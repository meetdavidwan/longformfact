\u201cthe eight dead rhinos were among those that had been moved to the sanctuary in an initiative to start a new population in line with the national rhino conservation and management strategy,\u201d

tomb, they were allegedly pointed to a roman temple built some 200 years earlier. the roman temple was razed and excavations beneath it revealed a tomb hewn from a limestone cave. the top of the cave was sheared off to expose the interior of the tomb, and the edicule was built around it. newline_char newline_char a feature of the tomb is a long shelf, or \"burial bed,\" which according to
