{"id": NaN, "documents": [" summarize the meeting professor c: uh , is it the twenty - fourth ? phd f: now we 're on . professor c: yeah . phd a: uh chuck , is the mike type wireless {disfmarker} phd f: yes . phd a: wireless headset ? ok . phd f: yes . professor c: yeah . phd f: for you it is . professor c: yeah . we uh {disfmarker} we abandoned the lapel because they sort of were not too {disfmarker} not too hot , not too cold , they were {disfmarker} you know , they were {vocalsound} uh , far enough away that you got more background noise , uh , and uh {disfmarker} and so forth phd a: uh - huh . professor c: but they weren't so close that they got quite the {disfmarker} you know , the really good {disfmarker} no , th phd a: ok . professor c: they {disfmarker} i mean they didn't {disfmarker} wait a minute . i 'm saying that wrong . they were not so far away that they were really good representative distant mikes , phd a: uh - huh . professor c: but on the other hand they were not so close that they got rid of all the interference . so it was no {disfmarker} didn't seem to be a good point to them . on the other hand if you only had to have one mike in some ways you could argue the lapel was a good choice , precisely because it 's in the middle . phd a: yeah , yeah . professor c: there 's uh , some kinds of junk that you get with these things that you don't get with the lapel uh , little mouth clicks and breaths and so forth are worse with these than with the lapel , but given the choice we {disfmarker} there seemed to be very strong opinions for uh , getting rid of lapels . phd a: the mike number is {disfmarker} professor c: so , phd f: uh , your mike number 's written on the back of that unit there . phd a: oh yeah . one . phd f: and then the channel number 's usually one less than that . phd a: oh , ok . ok . phd f: it - it 's one less than what 's written on the back of your {disfmarker} phd a: ok . ok . phd f: yeah . so you should be zero , actually . phd a: hello ? yeah . phd f: for your uh , channel number . phd a: yep , yep . professor c: and you should do a lot of talking so we get a lot more of your pronunciations . no , they don't {disfmarker} don't have a {disfmarker} have any indian pronunciations . phd f: so what we usually do is um , we typically will have our meetings professor c: yeah . phd f: and then at the end of the meetings we 'll read the digits . everybody goes around and reads the digits on the {disfmarker} the bottom of their forms . professor c: session r phd d: r - nineteen ? phd a: ok . professor c: r - nineteen . phd f: yeah . we 're {disfmarker} this is session r - nineteen . professor c: if you say so . o k . do we have anything like an agenda ? what 's going on ? um . i guess um . so . one thing {disfmarker} phd f: sunil 's here for the summer ? professor c: sunil 's here for the summer , right . um , so , one thing is to talk about a kick off meeting maybe uh , and then just uh , i guess uh , progress reports individually , and then uh , plans for where we go between now and then , pretty much . um . phd f: i could say a few words about um , some of the uh , compute stuff that 's happening around here , so that people in the group know . professor c: mm - hmm . ok . why don't you start with that ? that 's sort of {disfmarker} phd f: ok . professor c: yeah ? phd f: we um {disfmarker} so we just put in an order for about twelve new machines , uh , to use as sort of a compute farm . and um , uh , we ordered uh , sun - blade - one - hundreds , and um , i 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in , but , uh , in addition , we 're running {disfmarker} so the plan for using these is , uh , we 're running p - make and customs here and andreas has sort of gotten that all uh , fixed up and up to speed . and he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um , {vocalsound} run things using p - make and customs . you don't actually have to write p - make scripts and things like that . the simplest thing {disfmarker} and i can send an email around or , maybe i should do an faq on the web site about it or something . um , professor c: how about an email that points to the faq , phd f: there 's a c professor c: you know what i 'm saying ? phd f: yeah , yeah . professor c: so that you can {disfmarker} yeah . phd f: uh , there 's a command , uh , that you can use called \" run command \" . \" run dash command \" , \" run hyphen command \" . and , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , uh , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine , and uh {disfmarker} and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment . so you can try this as a simple test with uh , the l s command . so you can say \" run dash command l s \" , and , um , it 'll actually export that {vocalsound} ls command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an ls on your current directory . so , substitute ls for whatever command you want to run , and um {disfmarker} and that 's a simple way to get started using {disfmarker} using this . and , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up , {vocalsound} um , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use . now th one of the nice things is that uh , each machine that 's part of the p - make and customs network has attributes associated with it . uh , attributes like how much memory the machine has , what its speed is , what its operating system , and when you use something like \" run command \" , you can specify those attributes for your program . for example if you only want your thing to run under linux , you can give it the linux attribute , and then it will find the fastest available linux machine and run it on that . so . you can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent , all the way down to an individual machine . each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself . so you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that . if there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up , and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there . so , there 's a lot of nice features to it and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines and uh , right now andreas and i have been the main ones using it and we 're {disfmarker} uh . the sri recognizer has all this p - make customs stuff built into it . professor c: so as i understand , you know , he 's using all the machines and you 're using all the machines , phd f: so . professor c: is the rough division of {disfmarker} phd f: yeah . exactly . yeah , you know , i {disfmarker} i sort of got started {comment} using the recognizer just recently and uh , uh i fired off a training job , and then i fired off a recognition job and i get this email about midnight from andreas saying , \" uh , are you running two {vocalsound} trainings simultaneously s my m my jobs are not getting run . \" so i had to back off a little bit . but , soon as we get some more machines then uh {disfmarker} then we 'll have more compute available . so , um , that 's just a quick update about what we 've got . so . grad g: um , i have {disfmarker} i have a question about the uh , parallelization ? phd f: mm - hmm . grad g: so , um , let 's say i have like , a thousand little {disfmarker} little jobs to do ? phd f: mm - hmm . grad g: um , how do i do it with \" run command \" ? i mean do {disfmarker} phd f: you could write a script uh , which called run command on each sub - job grad g: uh - huh . a thousand times ? phd f: right ? but you probably wanna be careful with that grad g: ok . phd f: because um , you don't wanna saturate the network . uh , so , um , you know , you should {disfmarker} you should probably not run more than , say ten jobs yourself at any one time , uh , just because then it would keep other people {disfmarker} grad g: oh , too much file transfer and stuff . phd f: well it 's not that so much as that , you know , e with {disfmarker} if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed , so it 's sort of a sharing thing . um , grad g: ok . phd f: so you should try to limit it to somet sometim some number around ten jobs at a time . um . so if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run , um , you 'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were gonna use \" run command \" , uh , to only have ten of those going at a time . and uh , then , when one of those finished you 'd fire off another one . um , professor c: i remember i {disfmarker} i forget whether it was when the rutgers or {disfmarker} or hopkins workshop , i remember one of the workshops i was at there were {disfmarker} everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines and there was some kind of p - make like thing that sit sent things out . phd f: mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor c: so all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines phd f: mm - hmm . yeah . professor c: and {vocalsound} and things were a lot less efficient than if you 'd just use your own machine . phd f: yeah . yep . yeah , exactly . yeah , you have to be a little bit careful . professor c: as i recall , but . yeah . phd d: hmm . phd f: um , but uh , you can also {disfmarker} if you have that level of parallelization um , and you don't wanna have to worry about writing the logic in {disfmarker} in a perl script to take care of that , you can use um , p - make grad g: just do p - make . phd f: and {disfmarker} and you basically write a make file that uh , you know your final job depends on these one thousand things , grad g: s mm - hmm . phd f: and when you run p - make , uh , on your make file , you can give it the dash capital j and {disfmarker} and then a number , grad g: mm - hmm . phd f: and that number represents how many uh , machines to use at once . and then it 'll make sure that it never goes above that . grad g: right . phd f: so , grad g: right . ok . phd f: i can get some documentation . phd d: so it {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's not systematically queued . i mean all the jobs are running . if you launch twenty jobs , they are all running . alright . phd f: it depends . if you {disfmarker} \" run command \" , that i mentioned before , is {disfmarker} doesn't know about other things that you might be running . phd d: uh - huh . phd f: so , it would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once , phd d: right . phd f: and they wouldn't know about each other . but if you use p - make , then , it knows about all the jobs that it has to run phd d: mm - hmm . phd f: and it can control , uh , how many it runs simultaneously . professor c: so \" run command \" doesn't use p - make , or {disfmarker} ? phd f: it uses \" export \" underlyingly . but , if you {disfmarker} i it 's meant to be run one job at a time ? so you could fire off a thousand of those , and it doesn't know {disfmarker} any one of those doesn't know about the other ones that are running . professor c: so why would one use that rather than p - make ? phd f: well , if you have , um {disfmarker} like , for example , uh if you didn't wanna write a p - make script and you just had a , uh {disfmarker} an htk training job that you know is gonna take uh , six hours to run , and somebody 's using , uh , the machine you typically use , you can say \" run command \" and your htk thing and it 'll find another machine , the fastest currently available machine and {disfmarker} and run your job there . professor c: now , does it have the same sort of behavior as p - make , which is that , you know , if you run something on somebody 's machine and they come in and hit a key then it {disfmarker} phd f: yes . yeah , there are um {disfmarker} right . so some of the machines at the institute , um , have this attribute called \" no evict \" . and if you specify that , in {disfmarker} in one of your attribute lines , then it 'll go to a machine which your job won't be evicted from . professor c: mm - hmm . phd f: but , the machines that don't have that attribute , if a job gets fired up on that , which could be somebody 's desktop machine , and {disfmarker} and they were at lunch , professor c: mm - hmm . phd f: they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console , then your machine will get evicted {disfmarker} your job {comment} will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine . automatically . so {disfmarker} which can cause you to lose time , right ? if you had a two hour job , and it got halfway through and then somebody came back to their machine and it got evicted . so . if you don't want your job to run on a machine where it could be evicted , then you give it the minus {disfmarker} the attribute , you know , \" no evict \" , and it 'll pick a machine that it can't be evicted from . so . professor c: um , what {disfmarker} what about {disfmarker} i remember always used to be an issue , maybe it 's not anymore , that if you {disfmarker} if something required {disfmarker} if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work , but if you were logged into it from home ? phd f: mm - hmm . professor c: and you weren't hitting any keys ? cuz you were , home ? phd f: yeah , i {disfmarker} i 'm not sure how that works . professor c: yeah . phd f: uh , it seems like andreas did something for that . professor c: hmm . phd f: um . professor c: ok . we can ask him sometime . phd f: but {disfmarker} yeah . i don't know whether it monitors the keyboard or actually looks at the console tty , so maybe if you echoed something to the you know , dev {disfmarker} dev console or something . professor c: you probably wouldn't ordinarily , though . yeah . right ? you probably wouldn't ordinarily . phd f: hmm ? professor c: i mean you sort of {disfmarker} you 're at home and you 're trying to log in , and it takes forever to even log you in , and you probably go , \" screw this \" , phd f: yeah , yeah . professor c: and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know . phd f: yeah . yeah , so , um , professor c: yeah . phd f: yeah . i {disfmarker} i can {disfmarker} i 'm not sure about that one . professor c: yeah . phd f: but uh . professor c: ok . phd a: uh , i need a little orientation about this environment and uh scr s how to run some jobs here because i never d did anything so far with this x emissions phd f: ok . phd a: so , i think maybe i 'll ask you after the meeting . phd f: um . yeah . yeah , and {disfmarker} and also uh , stephane 's a {disfmarker} a really good resource for that if you can't find me . phd a: yeah , yeah , yeah . yep . ok , sure phd d: mmm . phd f: especially with regard to the aurora stuff . phd a: ok . phd f: he {disfmarker} he knows that stuff better than i do . professor c: ok . well , why don't we uh , uh , sunil since you 're {vocalsound} haven't {disfmarker} haven't been at one of these yet , why don't yo you tell us what 's {disfmarker} what 's up with you ? wh - what you 've been up to , hopefully . phd a: um . yeah . so , uh , shall i start from {disfmarker} well i don't know how may i {disfmarker} how {disfmarker} ok . uh , i think i 'll start from the post uh aurora submission maybe . professor c: yeah . phd a: uh , yeah , after the submission the {disfmarker} what i 've been working on mainly was to take {disfmarker} take other s submissions and then over their system , what they submitted , because we didn't have any speech enhancement system in {disfmarker} in ours . so {disfmarker} so i tried uh , and u first i tried just lda . and then i found that uh , i mean , if {disfmarker} if i combine it with lda , it gives @ @ improvement over theirs . uh {disfmarker} phd f: are y are you saying lda ? phd a: yeah . yeah . phd f: lda . ok . phd a: so , just {disfmarker} just the lda filters . i just plug in {disfmarker} i just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in lda on top of that . but the lda filter that i used was different from what we submitted in the proposal . phd f: mm - hmm . phd a: what i did was {vocalsound} i took the lda filter 's design using clean speech , uh , mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement so , instead of using this , uh , narrow {disfmarker} narrow band lda filter that we submitted uh , i got new filters . so that seems to be giving {disfmarker} uh , improving over their uh , system . slightly . but , not very significantly . and uh , that was uh , showing any improvement over {disfmarker} final {disfmarker} by plugging in an lda . and uh , so then after {disfmarker} after that i {disfmarker} i added uh , on - line normalization also on top of that . and that {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there also i n i found that i have to make some changes to their time constant that i used because th it has a {disfmarker} a mean and variance update time constant and {disfmarker} which is not suitable for the enhanced speech , and whatever we try it on with proposal - one . but um , i didn't {disfmarker} i didn't play with that time constant a lot , i just t g i just found that i have to reduce the value {disfmarker} i mean , i have to increase the time constant , or reduce the value of the update value . that 's all i found so i have to . uh , yeah . and uh , uh , the other {disfmarker} other thing what i tried was , i just um , uh , took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint inf uh th information , just the aurora baseline , to see that how much the baseline itself improves by just supplying the information of the {disfmarker} i mean the w speech and nonspeech . and uh , i found that the baseline itself improves by twenty - two percent by just giving the wuh . professor c: uh , can you back up a second , i {disfmarker} i {disfmarker} i missed something , uh , i guess my mind wandered . ad - ad when you added the on - line normalization and so forth , uh , uh things got better again ? phd a: yeah . no . professor c: or is it ? phd a: no . no , things didn't get better with the same time constant that we used . professor c: did it not ? no , no . with a different time constant . phd a: with the different time constant i found that {disfmarker}"], "document": " summarize the meeting professor c: uh , is it the twenty - fourth ? phd f: now we 're on . professor c: yeah . phd a: uh chuck , is the mike type wireless {disfmarker} phd f: yes . phd a: wireless headset ? ok . phd f: yes . professor c: yeah . phd f: for you it is . professor c: yeah . we uh {disfmarker} we abandoned the lapel because they sort of were not too {disfmarker} not too hot , not too cold , they were {disfmarker} you know , they were {vocalsound} uh , far enough away that you got more background noise , uh , and uh {disfmarker} and so forth phd a: uh - huh . professor c: but they weren't so close that they got quite the {disfmarker} you know , the really good {disfmarker} no , th phd a: ok . professor c: they {disfmarker} i mean they didn't {disfmarker} wait a minute . i 'm saying that wrong . they were not so far away that they were really good representative distant mikes , phd a: uh - huh . professor c: but on the other hand they were not so close that they got rid of all the interference . so it was no {disfmarker} didn't seem to be a good point to them . on the other hand if you only had to have one mike in some ways you could argue the lapel was a good choice , precisely because it 's in the middle . phd a: yeah , yeah . professor c: there 's uh , some kinds of junk that you get with these things that you don't get with the lapel uh , little mouth clicks and breaths and so forth are worse with these than with the lapel , but given the choice we {disfmarker} there seemed to be very strong opinions for uh , getting rid of lapels . phd a: the mike number is {disfmarker} professor c: so , phd f: uh , your mike number 's written on the back of that unit there . phd a: oh yeah . one . phd f: and then the channel number 's usually one less than that . phd a: oh , ok . ok . phd f: it - it 's one less than what 's written on the back of your {disfmarker} phd a: ok . ok . phd f: yeah . so you should be zero , actually . phd a: hello ?

phd f: well , if you have , um {disfmarker} like , for example , uh if you didn't wanna write a p - make script and you just had a , uh {disfmarker} an htk training job that you know is gonna take uh , six hours to run , and somebody 's using , uh , the machine you typically use , you can say \" run command \" and your htk thing and it 'll find another machine , the fastest currently available machine and {disfmarker} and run your job there . professor c: now , does it have the same sort of behavior as p - make , which is that , you know , if you run something on somebody 's machine and they come in and hit a key then it {disfmarker} phd f: yes . yeah , there are um {disfmarker} right . so some of the machines at the institute , um , have this attribute called \" no evict \" . and if you specify that , in {disfmarker} in one of your attribute lines , then it 'll go to a machine which your job won't be evicted from . professor c: mm - hmm . phd f: but , the machines that don't have that attribute , if a job gets fired up on that , which could be somebody 's desktop machine , and {disfmarker} and they were at lunch , professor c: mm - hmm . phd f: they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console , then your machine will get evicted {disfmarker} your job {comment} will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine . automatically . so {disfmarker} which can cause you to lose time , right ? if you had a two hour job , and it got halfway through and then somebody came back to their machine and it got evicted . so . if you don't want your job to run on a machine where it could be evicted , then you give it the minus {disfmarker} the attribute , you know , \" no evict \" , and it 'll pick a machine that it can't be evicted from . so . professor c: um , what {disfmarker} what about {disfmarker} i remember always used to be an issue , maybe it 's not anymore , that if you {disfmarker} if something required {disfmarker} if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work , but if you were logged into it from home ? phd f: mm - hmm . professor c: and you weren't hitting any keys ? cuz you were , home ? phd f: yeah , i {disfmarker} i 'm not sure how that works . professor c: yeah . phd f: uh , it seems like andreas did something for that . professor c: hmm . phd f: um . professor c: ok . we can ask him sometime . phd f: but {disfmarker} yeah . i don't know whether it monitors the keyboard or actually looks at the console tty , so maybe if you echoed something to the you know , dev {disfmarker} dev console or something . professor c: you probably wouldn't ordinarily , though . yeah . right ? you probably wouldn't ordinarily . phd f: hmm ? professor c: i mean you sort of {disfmarker} you 're at home and you 're trying to log in , and it takes forever to even log you in , and you probably go , \" screw this \" , phd f: yeah , yeah . professor c: and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know . phd f: yeah . yeah , so , um , professor c: yeah . phd f: yeah . i {disfmarker} i can {disfmarker} i 'm not sure about that one . professor c: yeah . phd f: but uh . professor c: ok . phd a: uh , i need a little orientation about this environment and uh scr s how to run some jobs here because i never d did anything so far with this x emissions phd f: ok . phd a: so , i think maybe i 'll ask you after the meeting . phd f: um . yeah . yeah , and {disfmarker} and also uh , stephane 's a {disfmarker} a really good resource for that if you can't find me . phd a: yeah , yeah , yeah . yep . ok , sure phd d: mmm . phd f: especially with regard to the aurora stuff . phd a: ok . phd f: he {disfmarker} he knows that stuff better than i do . professor c: ok . well , why don't we uh , uh , sunil since you 're {vocalsound} haven't {disfmarker} haven't been at one of these yet , why don't yo you tell us what 's {disfmarker} what 's up with you ? wh - what you 've been up to , hopefully . phd a: um . yeah . so , uh , shall i start from {disfmarker} well i don't know how may i {disfmarker} how {disfmarker} ok . uh , i think i 'll start from the post uh aurora submission maybe . professor c: yeah . phd a: uh , yeah , after the submission the {disfmarker} what i 've been working on mainly was to take {disfmarker} take other s submissions and then over their system , what they submitted , because we didn't have any speech enhancement system in {disfmarker} in ours . so {disfmarker} so i tried uh , and u first i tried just lda . and then i found that uh , i mean , if {disfmarker} if i combine it with lda , it gives @ @ improvement over theirs . uh {disfmarker} phd f: are y are you saying lda ? phd a: yeah . yeah . phd f: lda . ok . phd a: so , just {disfmarker} just the lda filters . i just plug in {disfmarker} i just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in lda on top of that . but the lda filter that i used was different from what we submitted in the proposal . phd f: mm - hmm . phd a: what i did was {vocalsound} i took the lda filter 's design using clean speech , uh , mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement so , instead of using this , uh , narrow {disfmarker} narrow band lda filter that we submitted uh , i got new filters . so that seems to be giving {disfmarker} uh , improving over their uh , system . slightly . but , not very significantly . and uh , that was uh , showing any improvement over {disfmarker} final {disfmarker} by plugging in an lda . and uh , so then after {disfmarker} after that i {disfmarker} i added uh , on - line normalization also on top of that . and that {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there also i n i found that i have to make some changes to their time constant that i used because th it has a {disfmarker} a mean and variance update time constant and {disfmarker} which is not suitable for the enhanced speech , and whatever we try it on with proposal - one . but um , i didn't {disfmarker} i didn't play with that time constant a lot , i just t g i just found that i have to reduce the value {disfmarker} i mean , i have to increase the time constant , or reduce the value of the update value . that 's all i found so i have to . uh , yeah . and uh , uh , the other {disfmarker} other thing what i tried was , i just um , uh , took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint inf uh th information , just the aurora baseline , to see that how much the baseline itself improves by just supplying the information of the {disfmarker} i mean the w speech and nonspeech . and uh , i found that the baseline itself improves by twenty - two percent by just giving the wuh . professor c: uh , can you back up a second , i {disfmarker} i {disfmarker} i missed something , uh , i guess my mind wandered . ad - ad when you added the on - line normalization and so forth , uh , uh things got better again ? phd a: yeah . no . professor c: or is it ? phd a: no . no , things didn't get better with the same time constant that we used . professor c: did it not ? no , no . with a different time constant . phd a: with the different time constant i found that {disfmarker}", "summary": "This was a meeting to discuss the progress of the project and to plan for the future.

phd a: ok . professor c: r - nineteen . phd f: yeah . we 're {disfmarker} this is session r - nineteen . professor c: if you say so . o k . do we have anything like an agenda ? what 's going on ? um . i guess um . so . one thing {disfmarker} phd f: sunil 's here for the summer ? professor c: sunil 's here for the summer , right . um , so , one thing is to talk about a kick off meeting maybe uh , and then just uh , i guess uh , progress reports individually , and then uh , plans for where we go between now and then , pretty much . um . phd f: i could say a few words about um , some of the uh , compute stuff that 's happening around here , so that people in the group know . professor c: mm - hmm . ok . why don't you start with that ? that 's sort of {disfmarker} phd f: ok . professor c: yeah ? phd f: we um {disfmarker} so we just put in an order for about twelve new machines , uh , to use as sort of a compute farm . and um , uh , we ordered uh , sun - blade - one - hundreds , and um , i 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in , but , uh , in addition , we 're running {disfmarker} so the plan for using these is , uh , we 're running p - make and customs here and andreas has sort of gotten that all uh , fixed up and up to speed . and he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um , {vocalsound} run things using p - make and customs . you don't actually have to write p - make scripts and things like that . the simplest thing {disfmarker} and i can send an email around or , maybe i should do an faq on the web site about it or something . um , professor c: how about an email that points to the faq , phd f: there 's a c professor c: you know what i 'm saying ? phd f: yeah , yeah . professor c: so that you can {disfmarker} yeah . phd f: uh , there 's a command , uh , that you can use called \" run command \" . \" run dash command \" , \" run hyphen command \" . and , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , uh , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine , and uh {disfmarker} and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment . so you can try this as a simple test with uh , the l s command . so you can say \" run dash command l s \" , and , um , it 'll actually export that {vocalsound} ls command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an ls on your current directory . so , substitute ls for whatever command you want to run , and um {disfmarker} and that 's a simple way to get started using {disfmarker} using this . and , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up , {vocalsound} um , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use . now th one of the nice things is that uh , each machine that 's part of the p - make and customs network has attributes associated with it . uh , attributes like how much memory the machine has , what its speed is , what its operating system , and when you use something like \" run command \" , you can specify those attributes for your program . for example if you only want your thing to run under linux , you can give it the linux attribute , and then it will find the fastest available linux machine and run it on that . so . you can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent , all the way down to an individual machine . each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself . so you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that . if there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up , and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there . so , there 's a lot of nice features to it and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines and uh , right now andreas and i have been the main ones using it and we 're {disfmarker} uh . the sri recognizer has all this p - make customs stuff built into it . professor c: so as i understand , you know , he 's using all the machines and you 're using all the machines , phd f: so . professor c: is the rough division of {disfmarker} phd f: yeah . exactly . yeah , you know , i {disfmarker} i sort of got started {comment} using the recognizer just recently and uh , uh i fired off a training job , and then i fired off a recognition job and i get this email about midnight from andreas saying , \" uh , are you running two {vocalsound} trainings simultaneously s my m my jobs are not getting run . \" so i had to back off a little bit . but , soon as we get some more machines then uh {disfmarker} then we 'll have more compute available . so , um , that 's just a quick update about what we 've got . so . grad g: um , i have {disfmarker} i have a question about the uh , parallelization ? phd f: mm - hmm . grad g: so , um , let 's say i have like , a thousand little {disfmarker} little jobs to do ? phd f: mm - hmm . grad g: um , how do i do it with \" run command \" ? i mean do {disfmarker} phd f: you could write a script uh , which called run command on each sub - job grad g: uh - huh . a thousand times ? phd f: right ? but you probably wanna be careful with that grad g: ok . phd f: because um , you don't wanna saturate the network . uh , so , um , you know , you should {disfmarker} you should probably not run more than , say ten jobs yourself at any one time , uh , just because then it would keep other people {disfmarker} grad g: oh , too much file transfer and stuff . phd f: well it 's not that so much as that , you know , e with {disfmarker} if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed , so it 's sort of a sharing thing . um , grad g: ok . phd f: so you should try to limit it to somet sometim some number around ten jobs at a time . um . so if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run , um , you 'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were gonna use \" run command \" , uh , to only have ten of those going at a time . and uh , then , when one of those finished you 'd fire off another one . um , professor c: i remember i {disfmarker} i forget whether it was when the rutgers or {disfmarker} or hopkins workshop , i remember one of the workshops i was at there were {disfmarker} everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines and there was some kind of p - make like thing that sit sent things out . phd f: mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor c: so all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines phd f: mm - hmm . yeah . professor c: and {vocalsound} and things were a lot less efficient than if you 'd just use your own machine . phd f: yeah . yep . yeah , exactly . yeah , you have to be a little bit careful . professor c: as i recall , but . yeah . phd d: hmm . phd f: um , but uh , you can also {disfmarker} if you have that level of parallelization um , and you don't wanna have to worry about writing the logic in {disfmarker} in a perl script to take care of that , you can use um , p - make grad g: just do p - make . phd f: and {disfmarker} and you basically write a make file that uh , you know your final job depends on these one thousand things , grad g: s mm - hmm . phd f: and when you run p - make , uh , on your make file , you can give it the dash capital j and {disfmarker} and then a number , grad g: mm - hmm . phd f: and that number represents how many uh , machines to use at once . and then it 'll make sure that it never goes above that . grad g: right . phd f: so , grad g: right . ok . phd f: i can get some documentation . phd d: so it {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's not systematically queued . i mean all the jobs are running . if you launch twenty jobs , they are all running . alright . phd f: it depends . if you {disfmarker} \" run command \" , that i mentioned before , is {disfmarker} doesn't know about other things that you might be running . phd d: uh - huh . phd f: so , it would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once , phd d: right . phd f: and they wouldn't know about each other . but if you use p - make , then , it knows about all the jobs that it has to run phd d: mm - hmm . phd f: and it can control , uh , how many it runs simultaneously . professor c: so \" run command \" doesn't use p - make , or {disfmarker} ?

phd f: now we 're on . professor c: yeah . phd a: uh chuck , is the mike type wireless {disfmarker} phd f: yes . phd a: wireless headset ? ok . phd f: yes . professor c: yeah . phd f: for you it is . professor c: yeah . we uh {disfmarker} we abandoned the lapel because they sort of were not too {disfmarker} not too hot , not too cold , they were {disfmarker} you know , they were {vocalsound} uh , far enough away that you got more background noise , uh , and uh {disfmarker} and so forth phd a: uh - huh . professor c: but they weren't so close that they got quite the {disfmarker} you know , the really good {disfmarker} no , th phd a: ok . professor c: they {disfmarker} i mean they didn't {disfmarker} wait a minute . i 'm saying that wrong . they were not so far away that they were really good representative distant mikes , phd a: uh - huh . professor c: but on the other hand they were not so close that they got rid of all the interference . so it was no {disfmarker} didn't seem to be a good point to them . on the other hand if you only had to have one mike in some ways you could argue the lapel was a good choice , precisely because it 's in the middle . phd a: yeah , yeah . professor c: there 's uh , some kinds of junk that you get with these things that you don't get with the lapel uh , little mouth clicks and breaths and so forth are worse with these than with the lapel , but given the choice we {disfmarker} there seemed to be very strong opinions for uh , getting rid of lapels . phd a: the mike number is {disfmarker} professor c: so , phd f: uh , your mike number 's written on the back of that unit there . phd a: oh yeah . one . phd f: and then the channel number 's usually one less than that . phd a: oh , ok . ok . phd f: it - it 's one less than what 's written on the back of your {disfmarker} phd a: ok . ok . phd f: yeah . so you should be zero , actually . phd a: hello ? yeah . phd f: for your uh , channel number . phd a: yep , yep . professor c: and you should do a lot of talking so we get a lot more of your pronunciations . no , they don't {disfmarker} don't have a {disfmarker} have any indian pronunciations . phd f: so what we usually do is um , we typically will have our meetings professor c: yeah . phd f: and then at the end of the meetings we 'll read the digits . everybody goes around and reads the digits on the {disfmarker} the bottom of their forms . professor c: session r phd d: r - nineteen ? phd a: ok . professor c: r - nineteen . phd f: yeah . we 're {disfmarker} this is session r - nineteen . professor c: if you say so . o k . do we have anything like an agenda ? what 's going on ? um . i guess um . so . one thing {disfmarker} phd f: sunil 's here for the summer ? professor c: sunil 's here for the summer , right . um , so , one thing is to talk about a kick off meeting maybe uh , and then just uh , i guess uh , progress reports individually , and then uh , plans for where we go between now and then , pretty much . um . phd f: i could say a few words about um , some of the uh , compute stuff that 's happening around here , so that people in the group know . professor c: mm - hmm . ok . why don't you start with that ? that 's sort of {disfmarker} phd f: ok . professor c: yeah ? phd f: we um {disfmarker} so we just put in an order for about twelve new machines , uh , to use as sort of a compute farm . and um , uh , we ordered uh , sun - blade - one - hundreds , and um , i 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in , but , uh , in addition , we 're running {disfmarker} so the plan for using these is , uh , we 're running p - make and customs here and andreas has sort of gotten that all uh , fixed up and up to speed . and he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um , {vocalsound} run things using p - make and customs . you don't actually have to write p - make scripts and things like that . the simplest thing {disfmarker} and i can send an email around or , maybe i should do an faq on the web site about it or something . um , professor c: how about an email that points to the faq , phd f: there 's a c professor c: you know what i 'm saying ? phd f: yeah , yeah . professor c: so that you can {disfmarker} yeah . phd f: uh , there 's a command , uh , that you can use called \" run command \" . \" run dash command \" , \" run hyphen command \" . and , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , uh , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine , and uh {disfmarker} and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment . so you can try this as a simple test with uh , the l s command . so you can say \" run dash command l s \" , and , um , it 'll actually export that {vocalsound} ls command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an ls on your current directory . so , substitute ls for whatever command you want to run , and um {disfmarker} and that 's a simple way to get started using {disfmarker} using this . and , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up , {vocalsound} um , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use . now th one of the nice things is that uh , each machine that 's part of the p - make and customs network has attributes associated with it . uh , attributes like how much memory the machine has , what its speed is , what its operating system , and when you use something like \" run command \" , you can specify those attributes for your program . for example if you only want your thing to run under linux , you can give it the linux attribute , and then it will find the fastest available linux machine and run it on that . so . you can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent , all the way down to an individual machine . each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself . so you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that . if there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up , and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there . so , there 's a lot of nice features to it and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines and uh , right now andreas and i have been the main ones using it and we 're {disfmarker} uh . the sri recognizer has all this p - make customs stuff built into it . professor c: so as i understand , you know , he 's using all the machines and you 're using all the machines , phd f: so . professor c: is the rough division of {disfmarker} phd f: yeah . exactly . yeah , you know , i {disfmarker} i sort of got started {comment} using the recognizer just recently and uh , uh i fired off a training job , and then i fired off a recognition job and i get this email about midnight from andreas saying , \" uh , are you running two {vocalsound} trainings simultaneously s my m my jobs are not getting run . \" so i had to back off a little bit . but , soon as we get some more machines then uh {disfmarker} then we 'll have more compute available . so , um , that 's just a quick update about what we 've got . so . grad g: um , i have {disfmarker} i have a question about the uh , parallelization ? phd f: mm - hmm . grad g: so , um , let 's say i have like , a thousand little {disfmarker} little jobs to do ? phd f: mm - hmm . grad g: um , how do i do it with \" run command \" ? i mean do {disfmarker} phd f: you could write a script uh , which called run command on each sub - job grad g: uh - huh . a thousand times ? phd f: right ? but you probably wanna be careful with that grad g: ok . phd f: because um , you don't wanna saturate the network . uh , so , um , you know , you should {disfmarker} you should probably not run more than , say ten jobs yourself at any one time , uh , just because then it would keep other people {disfmarker} grad g: oh , too much file transfer and stuff . phd f: well it 's not that so much as that , you know , e with {disfmarker} if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed , so it 's sort of a sharing thing . um , grad g: ok . phd f: so you should try to limit it to somet sometim some number around ten jobs at a time . um . so if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run , um , you 'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were gonna use \" run command \" , uh , to only have ten of those going at a time . and uh , then , when one of those finished you 'd fire off another one . um , professor c: i remember i {disfmarker} i forget whether it was when the rutgers or {disfmarker} or hopkins workshop , i remember one of the workshops i was at there were {disfmarker} everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines and there was some kind of p - make like thing that sit sent things out . phd f: mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor c: so all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines phd f: mm - hmm . yeah . professor c: and {vocalsound} and things were a lot less efficient than if you 'd just use your own machine . phd f: yeah . yep . yeah , exactly . yeah , you have to be a little bit careful . professor c: as i recall , but . yeah . phd d: hmm . phd f: um , but uh , you can also {disfmarker} if you have that level of parallelization um , and you don't wanna have to worry about writing the logic in {disfmarker} in a perl script to take care of that , you can use um , p - make grad g: just do p - make . phd f: and {disfmarker} and you basically write a make file that uh , you know your final job depends on these one thousand things , grad g: s mm - hmm . phd f: and when you run p - make , uh , on your make file , you can give it the dash capital j and {disfmarker} and then a number , grad g: mm - hmm . phd f: and that number represents how many uh , machines to use at once . and then it 'll make sure that it never goes above that . grad g: right . phd f: so , grad g: right . ok . phd f: i can get some documentation . phd d: so it {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's not systematically queued . i mean all the jobs are running . if you launch twenty jobs , they are all running . alright . phd f: it depends . if you {disfmarker} \" run command \" , that i mentioned before , is {disfmarker} doesn't know about other things that you might be running . phd d: uh - huh . phd f: so , it would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once , phd d: right . phd f: and they wouldn't know about each other . but if you use p - make , then , it knows about all the jobs that it has to run phd d: mm - hmm . phd f: and it can control , uh , how many it runs simultaneously . professor c: so \" run command \" doesn't use p - make , or {disfmarker} ? phd f: it uses \" export \" underlyingly . but , if you {disfmarker} i it 's meant to be run one job at a time ? so you could fire off a thousand of those , and it doesn't know {disfmarker} any one of those doesn't know about the other ones that are running . professor c: so why would one use that rather than p - make ? phd f: well , if you have , um {disfmarker} like , for example , uh if you didn't wanna write a p - make script and you just had a , uh {disfmarker} an htk training job that you know is gonna take uh , six hours to run , and somebody 's using , uh , the machine you typically use , you can say \" run command \" and your htk thing and it 'll find another machine , the fastest currently available machine and {disfmarker} and run your job there . professor c: now , does it have the same sort of behavior as p - make , which is that , you know , if you run something on somebody 's machine and they come in and hit a key then it {disfmarker} phd f: yes . yeah , there are um {disfmarker} right . so some of the machines at the institute , um , have this attribute called \" no evict \" . and if you specify that , in {disfmarker} in one of your attribute lines , then it 'll go to a machine which your job won't be evicted from . professor c: mm - hmm . phd f: but , the machines that don't have that attribute , if a job gets fired up on that , which could be somebody 's desktop machine , and {disfmarker} and they were at lunch , professor c: mm - hmm . phd f: they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console , then your machine will get evicted {disfmarker} your job {comment} will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine . automatically . so {disfmarker} which can cause you to lose time , right ? if you had a two hour job , and it got halfway through and then somebody came back to their machine and it got evicted . so . if you don't want your job to run on a machine where it could be evicted , then you give it the minus {disfmarker} the attribute , you know , \" no evict \" , and it 'll pick a machine that it can't be evicted from . so . professor c: um , what {disfmarker} what about {disfmarker} i remember always used to be an issue , maybe it 's not anymore , that if you {disfmarker} if something required {disfmarker} if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work , but if you were logged into it from home ? phd f: mm - hmm . professor c: and you weren't hitting any keys ? cuz you were , home ? phd f: yeah , i {disfmarker} i 'm not sure how that works . professor c: yeah . phd f: uh , it seems like andreas did something for that . professor c: hmm . phd f: um . professor c: ok . we can ask him sometime . phd f: but {disfmarker} yeah . i don't know whether it monitors the keyboard or actually looks at the console tty , so maybe if you echoed something to the you know , dev {disfmarker} dev console or something . professor c: you probably wouldn't ordinarily , though . yeah . right ? you probably wouldn't ordinarily . phd f: hmm ? professor c: i mean you sort of {disfmarker} you 're at home and you 're trying to log in , and it takes forever to even log you in , and you probably go , \" screw this \" , phd f: yeah , yeah . professor c: and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know . phd f: yeah . yeah , so , um , professor c: yeah . phd f: yeah . i {disfmarker} i can {disfmarker} i 'm not sure about that one . professor c: yeah . phd f: but uh . professor c: ok . phd a: uh , i need a little orientation about this environment and uh scr s how to run some jobs here because i never d did anything so far with this x emissions phd f: ok . phd a: so , i think maybe i 'll ask you after the meeting . phd f: um . yeah . yeah , and {disfmarker} and also uh , stephane 's a {disfmarker} a really good resource for that if you can't find me . phd a: yeah , yeah , yeah . yep . ok , sure phd d: mmm . phd f: especially with regard to the aurora stuff . phd a: ok . phd f: he {disfmarker} he knows that stuff better than i do . professor c: ok . well , why don't we uh , uh , sunil since you 're {vocalsound} haven't {disfmarker} haven't been at one of these yet , why don't yo you tell us what 's {disfmarker} what 's up with you ? wh - what you 've been up to , hopefully . phd a: um . yeah . so , uh , shall i start from {disfmarker} well i don't know how may i {disfmarker} how {disfmarker} ok . uh , i think i 'll start from the post uh aurora submission maybe . professor c: yeah . phd a: uh , yeah , after the submission the {disfmarker} what i 've been working on mainly was to take {disfmarker} take other s submissions and then over their system , what they submitted , because we didn't have any speech enhancement system in {disfmarker} in ours . so {disfmarker} so i tried uh , and u first i tried just lda . and then i found that uh , i mean , if {disfmarker} if i combine it with lda , it gives @ @ improvement over theirs . uh {disfmarker} phd f: are y are you saying lda ? phd a: yeah . yeah . phd f: lda . ok . phd a: so , just {disfmarker} just the lda filters . i just plug in {disfmarker} i just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in lda on top of that . but the lda filter that i used was different from what we submitted in the proposal . phd f: mm - hmm . phd a: what i did was {vocalsound} i took the lda filter 's design using clean speech , uh , mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement so , instead of using this , uh , narrow {disfmarker} narrow band lda filter that we submitted uh , i got new filters . so that seems to be giving {disfmarker} uh , improving over their uh , system . slightly . but , not very significantly . and uh , that was uh , showing any improvement over {disfmarker} final {disfmarker} by plugging in an lda . and uh , so then after {disfmarker} after that i {disfmarker} i added uh , on - line normalization also on top of that . and that {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there also i n i found that i have to make some changes to their time constant that i used because th it has a {disfmarker} a mean and variance update time constant and {disfmarker} which is not suitable for the enhanced speech , and whatever we try it on with proposal - one . but um , i didn't {disfmarker} i didn't play with that time constant a lot , i just t g i just found that i have to reduce the value {disfmarker} i mean , i have to increase the time constant , or reduce the value of the update value . that 's all i found so i have to . uh , yeah . and uh , uh , the other {disfmarker} other thing what i tried was , i just um , uh , took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint inf uh th information , just the aurora baseline , to see that how much the baseline itself improves by just supplying the information of the {disfmarker} i mean the w speech and nonspeech . and uh , i found that the baseline itself improves by twenty - two percent by just giving the wuh . professor c: uh , can you back up a second , i {disfmarker} i {disfmarker} i missed something , uh , i guess my mind wandered . ad - ad when you added the on - line normalization and so forth , uh , uh things got better again ? phd a: yeah . no . professor c: or is it ? phd a: no . no , things didn't get better with the same time constant that we used . professor c: did it not ? no , no . with a different time constant . phd a: with the different time constant i found that {disfmarker}", "summary": "the professor c informed the team that the lapel microphone had been abandoned because it was too hot and the remote control was not as effective as expected. the team debated whether the lapel microphone was a good choice for the meetings. on the other hand, if only one mike was used for the meetings, it would eliminate some of the unwanted noises.

phd f: right ? but you probably wanna be careful with that grad g: ok . phd f: because um , you don't wanna saturate the network . uh , so , um , you know , you should {disfmarker} you should probably not run more than , say ten jobs yourself at any one time , uh , just because then it would keep other people {disfmarker} grad g: oh , too much file transfer and stuff . phd f: well it 's not that so much as that , you know , e with {disfmarker} if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed , so it 's sort of a sharing thing . um , grad g: ok . phd f: so you should try to limit it to somet sometim some number around ten jobs at a time . um . so if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run , um , you 'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were gonna use \" run command \" , uh , to only have ten of those going at a time . and uh , then , when one of those finished you 'd fire off another one . um , professor c: i remember i {disfmarker} i forget whether it was when the rutgers or {disfmarker} or hopkins workshop , i remember one of the workshops i was at there were {disfmarker} everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines and there was some kind of p - make like thing that sit sent things out . phd f: mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor c: so all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines phd f: mm - hmm . yeah . professor c: and {vocalsound} and things were a lot less efficient than if you 'd just use your own machine . phd f: yeah . yep . yeah , exactly . yeah , you have to be a little bit careful . professor c: as i recall , but . yeah . phd d: hmm . phd f: um , but uh , you can also {disfmarker} if you have that level of parallelization um , and you don't wanna have to worry about writing the logic in {disfmarker} in a perl script to take care of that , you can use um , p - make grad g: just do p - make . phd f: and {disfmarker} and you basically write a make file that uh , you know your final job depends on these one thousand things , grad g: s mm - hmm . phd f: and when you run p - make , uh , on your make file , you can give it the dash capital j and {disfmarker} and then a number , grad g: mm - hmm . phd f: and that number represents how many uh , machines to use at once . and then it 'll make sure that it never goes above that . grad g: right . phd f: so , grad g: right . ok . phd f: i can get some documentation . phd d: so it {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's not systematically queued . i mean all the jobs are running . if you launch twenty jobs , they are all running . alright . phd f: it depends . if you {disfmarker} \" run command \" , that i mentioned before , is {disfmarker} doesn't know about other things that you might be running . phd d: uh - huh . phd f: so , it would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once , phd d: right . phd f: and they wouldn't know about each other . but if you use p - make , then , it knows about all the jobs that it has to run phd d: mm - hmm . phd f: and it can control , uh , how many it runs simultaneously . professor c: so \" run command \" doesn't use p - make , or {disfmarker} ? phd f: it uses \" export \" underlyingly . but , if you {disfmarker} i it 's meant to be run one job at a time ? so you could fire off a thousand of those , and it doesn't know {disfmarker} any one of those doesn't know about the other ones that are running . professor c: so why would one use that rather than p - make ? phd f: well , if you have , um {disfmarker} like , for example , uh if you didn't wanna write a p - make script and you just had a , uh {disfmarker} an htk training job that you know is gonna take uh , six hours to run , and somebody 's using , uh , the machine you typically use , you can say \" run command \" and your htk thing and it 'll find another machine , the fastest currently available machine and {disfmarker} and run your job there . professor c: now , does it have the same sort of behavior as p - make , which is that , you know , if you run something on somebody 's machine and they come in and hit a key then it {disfmarker} phd f: yes . yeah , there are um {disfmarker} right . so some of the machines at the institute , um , have this attribute called \" no evict \" . and if you specify that , in {disfmarker} in one of your attribute lines , then it 'll go to a machine which your job won't be evicted from . professor c: mm - hmm . phd f: but , the machines that don't have that attribute , if a job gets fired up on that , which could be somebody 's desktop machine , and {disfmarker} and they were at lunch , professor c: mm - hmm . phd f: they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console , then your machine will get evicted {disfmarker} your job {comment} will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine . automatically . so {disfmarker} which can cause you to lose time , right ? if you had a two hour job , and it got halfway through and then somebody came back to their machine and it got evicted . so . if you don't want your job to run on a machine where it could be evicted , then you give it the minus {disfmarker} the attribute , you know , \" no evict \" , and it 'll pick a machine that it can't be evicted from . so . professor c: um , what {disfmarker} what about {disfmarker} i remember always used to be an issue , maybe it 's not anymore , that if you {disfmarker} if something required {disfmarker} if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work , but if you were logged into it from home ? phd f: mm - hmm . professor c: and you weren't hitting any keys ? cuz you were , home ? phd f: yeah , i {disfmarker} i 'm not sure how that works . professor c: yeah . phd f: uh , it seems like andreas did something for that . professor c: hmm . phd f: um . professor c: ok . we can ask him sometime . phd f: but {disfmarker} yeah . i don't know whether it monitors the keyboard or actually looks at the console tty , so maybe if you echoed something to the you know , dev {disfmarker} dev console or something . professor c: you probably wouldn't ordinarily , though . yeah . right ? you probably wouldn't ordinarily . phd f: hmm ? professor c: i mean you sort of {disfmarker} you 're at home and you 're trying to log in , and it takes forever to even log you in , and you probably go , \" screw this \" , phd f: yeah , yeah . professor c: and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know . phd f: yeah . yeah , so , um , professor c: yeah . phd f: yeah . i {disfmarker} i can {disfmarker} i 'm not sure about that one . professor c: yeah . phd f: but uh . professor c: ok . phd a: uh , i need a little orientation about this environment and uh scr s how to run some jobs here because i never d did anything so far with this x emissions phd f: ok . phd a: so , i think maybe i 'll ask you after the meeting . phd f: um . yeah . yeah , and {disfmarker} and also uh , stephane 's a {disfmarker} a really good resource for that if you can't find me . phd a: yeah , yeah , yeah . yep . ok , sure phd d: mmm . phd f: especially with regard to the aurora stuff . phd a: ok . phd f: he {disfmarker} he knows that stuff better than i do . professor c: ok . well , why don't we uh , uh , sunil since you 're {vocalsound} haven't {disfmarker} haven't been at one of these yet , why don't yo you tell us what 's {disfmarker} what 's up with you ? wh - what you 've been up to , hopefully . phd a: um . yeah . so , uh , shall i start from {disfmarker} well i don't know how may i {disfmarker} how {disfmarker} ok . uh , i think i 'll start from the post uh aurora submission maybe . professor c: yeah . phd a: uh , yeah , after the submission the {disfmarker} what i 've been working on mainly was to take {disfmarker} take other s submissions and then over their system , what they submitted , because we didn't have any speech enhancement system in {disfmarker} in ours . so {disfmarker} so i tried uh , and u first i tried just lda . and then i found that uh , i mean , if {disfmarker} if i combine it with lda , it gives @ @ improvement over theirs . uh {disfmarker} phd f: are y are you saying lda ? phd a: yeah . yeah . phd f: lda . ok . phd a: so , just {disfmarker} just the lda filters . i just plug in {disfmarker} i just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in lda on top of that . but the lda filter that i used was different from what we submitted in the proposal . phd f: mm - hmm . phd a: what i did was {vocalsound} i took the lda filter 's design using clean speech , uh , mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement so , instead of using this , uh , narrow {disfmarker} narrow band lda filter that we submitted uh , i got new filters . so that seems to be giving {disfmarker} uh , improving over their uh , system . slightly . but , not very significantly . and uh , that was uh , showing any improvement over {disfmarker} final {disfmarker} by plugging in an lda . and uh , so then after {disfmarker} after that i {disfmarker} i added uh , on - line normalization also on top of that . and that {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there also i n i found that i have to make some changes to their time constant that i used because th it has a {disfmarker} a mean and variance update time constant and {disfmarker} which is not suitable for the enhanced speech , and whatever we try it on with proposal - one . but um , i didn't {disfmarker} i didn't play with that time constant a lot , i just t g i just found that i have to reduce the value {disfmarker} i mean , i have to increase the time constant , or reduce the value of the update value . that 's all i found so i have to . uh , yeah . and uh , uh , the other {disfmarker} other thing what i tried was , i just um , uh , took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint inf uh th information , just the aurora baseline , to see that how much the baseline itself improves by just supplying the information of the {disfmarker} i mean the w speech and nonspeech . and uh , i found that the baseline itself improves by twenty - two percent by just giving the wuh . professor c: uh , can you back up a second , i {disfmarker} i {disfmarker} i missed something , uh , i guess my mind wandered . ad - ad when you added the on - line normalization and so forth , uh , uh things got better again ? phd a: yeah . no . professor c: or is it ? phd a: no . no , things didn't get better with the same time constant that we used . professor c: did it not ? no , no . with a different time constant . phd a: with the different time constant i found that {disfmarker}"], "document": " summarize the meeting professor c: uh , is it the twenty - fourth ? phd f: now we 're on . professor c: yeah . phd a: uh chuck , is the mike type wireless {disfmarker} phd f: yes . phd a: wireless headset ? ok . phd f: yes . professor c: yeah . phd f: for you it is . professor c: yeah . we uh {disfmarker} we abandoned the lapel because they sort of were not too {disfmarker} not too hot , not too cold , they were {disfmarker} you know , they were {vocalsound} uh , far enough away that you got more background noise , uh , and uh {disfmarker} and so forth phd a: uh - huh . professor c: but they weren't so close that they got quite the {disfmarker} you know , the really good {disfmarker} no , th phd a: ok . professor c: they {disfmarker} i mean they didn't {disfmarker} wait a minute . i 'm saying that wrong . they were not so far away that they were really good representative distant mikes , phd a: uh - huh . professor c: but on the other hand they were not so close that they got rid of all the interference . so it was no {disfmarker} didn't seem to be a good point to them . on the other hand if you only had to have one mike in some ways you could argue the lapel was a good choice , precisely because it 's in the middle . phd a: yeah , yeah . professor c: there 's uh , some kinds of junk that you get with these things that you don't get with the lapel uh , little mouth clicks and breaths and so forth are worse with these than with the lapel , but given the choice we {disfmarker} there seemed to be very strong opinions for uh , getting rid of lapels . phd a: the mike number is {disfmarker} professor c: so , phd f: uh , your mike number 's written on the back of that unit there . phd a: oh yeah . one . phd f: and then the channel number 's usually one less than that . phd a: oh , ok . ok . phd f: it - it 's one less than what 's written on the back of your {disfmarker} phd a: ok . ok . phd f: yeah . so you should be zero , actually . phd a: hello ? yeah . phd f: for your uh , channel number . phd a: yep , yep . professor c: and you should do a lot of talking so we get a lot more of your pronunciations . no , they don't {disfmarker} don't have a {disfmarker} have any indian pronunciations . phd f: so what we usually do is um , we typically will have our meetings professor c: yeah . phd f: and then at the end of the meetings we 'll read the digits . everybody goes around and reads the digits on the {disfmarker} the bottom of their forms . professor c: session r phd d: r - nineteen ? phd a: ok . professor c: r - nineteen . phd f: yeah . we 're {disfmarker} this is session r - nineteen . professor c: if you say so . o k . do we have anything like an agenda ? what 's going on ? um . i guess um . so . one thing {disfmarker} phd f: sunil 's here for the summer ? professor c: sunil 's here for the summer , right . um , so , one thing is to talk about a kick off meeting maybe uh , and then just uh , i guess uh , progress reports individually , and then uh , plans for where we go between now and then , pretty much . um . phd f: i could say a few words about um , some of the uh , compute stuff that 's happening around here , so that people in the group know . professor c: mm - hmm . ok . why don't you start with that ? that 's sort of {disfmarker} phd f: ok . professor c: yeah ? phd f: we um {disfmarker} so we just put in an order for about twelve new machines , uh , to use as sort of a compute farm . and um , uh , we ordered uh , sun - blade - one - hundreds , and um , i 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in , but , uh , in addition , we 're running {disfmarker} so the plan for using these is , uh , we 're running p - make and customs here and andreas has sort of gotten that all uh , fixed up and up to speed . and he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um , {vocalsound} run things using p - make and customs . you don't actually have to write p - make scripts and things like that . the simplest thing {disfmarker} and i can send an email around or , maybe i should do an faq on the web site about it or something . um , professor c: how about an email that points to the faq , phd f: there 's a c professor c: you know what i 'm saying ? phd f: yeah , yeah . professor c: so that you can {disfmarker} yeah . phd f: uh , there 's a command , uh , that you can use called \" run command \" . \" run dash command \" , \" run hyphen command \" . and , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , uh , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine , and uh {disfmarker} and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment . so you can try this as a simple test with uh , the l s command . so you can say \" run dash command l s \" , and , um , it 'll actually export that {vocalsound} ls command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an ls on your current directory . so , substitute ls for whatever command you want to run , and um {disfmarker} and that 's a simple way to get started using {disfmarker} using this . and , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up , {vocalsound} um , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use . now th one of the nice things is that uh , each machine that 's part of the p - make and customs network has attributes associated with it . uh , attributes like how much memory the machine has , what its speed is , what its operating system , and when you use something like \" run command \" , you can specify those attributes for your program . for example if you only want your thing to run under linux , you can give it the linux attribute , and then it will find the fastest available linux machine and run it on that . so . you can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent , all the way down to an individual machine . each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself . so you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that . if there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up , and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there . so , there 's a lot of nice features to it and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines and uh , right now andreas and i have been the main ones using it and we 're {disfmarker} uh . the sri recognizer has all this p - make customs stuff built into it . professor c: so as i understand , you know , he 's using all the machines and you 're using all the machines , phd f: so . professor c: is the rough division of {disfmarker} phd f: yeah . exactly . yeah , you know , i {disfmarker} i sort of got started {comment} using the recognizer just recently and uh , uh i fired off a training job , and then i fired off a recognition job and i get this email about midnight from andreas saying , \" uh , are you running two {vocalsound} trainings simultaneously s my m my jobs are not getting run . \" so i had to back off a little bit . but , soon as we get some more machines then uh {disfmarker} then we 'll have more compute available . so , um , that 's just a quick update about what we 've got . so . grad g: um , i have {disfmarker} i have a question about the uh , parallelization ? phd f: mm - hmm . grad g: so , um , let 's say i have like , a thousand little {disfmarker} little jobs to do ? phd f: mm - hmm . grad g: um , how do i do it with \" run command \" ? i mean do {disfmarker} phd f: you could write a script uh , which called run command on each sub - job grad g: uh - huh . a thousand times ?

phd a: yeah . yeah . phd f: lda . ok . phd a: so , just {disfmarker} just the lda filters . i just plug in {disfmarker} i just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in lda on top of that . but the lda filter that i used was different from what we submitted in the proposal . phd f: mm - hmm . phd a: what i did was {vocalsound} i took the lda filter 's design using clean speech , uh , mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement so , instead of using this , uh , narrow {disfmarker} narrow band lda filter that we submitted uh , i got new filters . so that seems to be giving {disfmarker} uh , improving over their uh , system . slightly . but , not very significantly . and uh , that was uh , showing any improvement over {disfmarker} final {disfmarker} by plugging in an lda . and uh , so then after {disfmarker} after that i {disfmarker} i added uh , on - line normalization also on top of that . and that {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there also i n i found that i have to make some changes to their time constant that i used because th it has a {disfmarker} a mean and variance update time constant and {disfmarker} which is not suitable for the enhanced speech , and whatever we try it on with proposal - one . but um , i didn't {disfmarker} i didn't play with that time constant a lot , i just t g i just found that i have to reduce the value {disfmarker} i mean , i have to increase the time constant , or reduce the value of the update value . that 's all i found so i have to . uh , yeah . and uh , uh , the other {disfmarker} other thing what i tried was , i just um , uh , took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint inf uh th information , just the aurora baseline , to see that how much the baseline itself improves by just supplying the information of the {disfmarker} i mean the w speech and nonspeech . and uh , i found that the baseline itself improves by twenty - two percent by just giving the wuh . professor c: uh , can you back up a second , i {disfmarker} i {disfmarker} i missed something , uh , i guess my mind wandered . ad - ad when you added the on - line normalization and so forth , uh , uh things got better again ? phd a: yeah . no . professor c: or is it ? phd a: no . no , things didn't get better with the same time constant that we used . professor c: did it not ? no , no . with a different time constant . phd a: with the different time constant i found that {disfmarker}", "summary": " the group met to discuss the current status of the p - make and customs network and to decide how to use the machines. they decided that the lapel could be used instead. at the end of the meeting, grad g raised a question about parallelization. the group just wanted to know what the future plans were. the answer was that there would be more machines available.

no . project manager: hm ? marketing: we haven't decided on an order . project manager: no , any any order's fine . yeah . marketing: first . okay . um , how do i put this {disfmarker} industrial designer: just uh {disfmarker} marketing: i'll just put the cable in . project manager: oh yeah , sorry . marketing: {gap} is that it ? can you see ? {vocalsound} oh , here . okay . so what happens it doesn't work ? project manager: it sh it takes a few seconds i think . industrial designer: you may need to {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} who's that ? {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: no . industrial designer: but sometimes you have to do it {disfmarker} marketing: is it in the right thing ? industrial designer: it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press f_ eight . marketing: oh wait , um . uh . you need to help me . {vocalsound} project manager: uh-huh , and then press function . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: and f_ eight . marketing: yeah . user interface: could you just plug it back into hers because she had {disfmarker} marketing: oh , wait . user interface: oh . marketing: that's {disfmarker} is that it ? industrial designer: adjusting . project manager: here we are . {vocalsound} industrial designer: the cable might be a little loose or something . oh , you got it . marketing: right here we are . project manager: oh . is it on ? marketing: we're here . project manager: okay . marketing: okay , um . in order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . custome customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and i think we should design according to these buttons . easy to lose , and r_s_i_ . i don't know what r_s_i_ means . um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , i don't have a clue . project manager: hm . marketing: um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , i have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . so the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . they're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . and um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . the other ones are the settings , and they're used less than {disfmarker} you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that i think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . and if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , i don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . um i don't i don't know um what the decision to be made is , but i think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together . {vocalsound} and that's all i have to say about the matter , {vocalsound} um . project manager: 'kay . marketing: shall i {disfmarker} what do i do ? do i give this to someone else ? project manager: yeah . just move right on . user interface: right . so get this . okay so now i need to press f_ eight , what is it ? project manager: {vocalsound} uh function f_ eight . marketing: function f_ eight . user interface: 'kay . what's function ? project manager: it's the little blue {disfmarker} w it's the one {disfmarker} th user interface: oh function , i see it . project manager: yeah . yeah should be {disfmarker} user interface: there we go . {vocalsound} project manager: it should be {gap} yeah . user interface: okay . um . this my presentation about the uh technical functions design and i basically just tried to focus on um {vocalsound} just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . so uh and i just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet {vocalsound} . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: and okay so basically um {vocalsound} i think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . um {vocalsound} so i think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that {disfmarker} like close together that um {vocalsound} are used in the same way , uh {vocalsound} or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh {disfmarker} can you c y small enough large enough i'm not sure we c i guess we would need to do some research about , i would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the tv . does it have like capacity to change the channels ? um {vocalsound} does it do {disfmarker} or do we need to have like functions for cable or v_c_r_ ? and then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? and um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um i dunno if this will work but {disfmarker} and i think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . {vocalsound} just i mean i like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but i mean i think we sh can sort of think about things like um {vocalsound} like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . {vocalsound} that concludes my presentation . project manager: {gap} user interface: okay . you need the little thingy . ooh . industrial designer: how do i um {disfmarker} marketing: s that's on view . industrial designer: right . marketing: oh . industrial designer: okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method i used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . um so i think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the tv . and also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the tv and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . so the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the tv , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . and also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their tv or stick it on their wall . and this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the tv . and then for the location function , you would have a sender on the tv which would output some sort of signal , um we could use i_r_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . that signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , i_r_ transmitter to communicate to the tv , that's just sort of standard , um so most tvs have an i_r_ receiver . probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and i'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . so that concludes my presentation . project manager: 'kay . user interface: do you know about like {disfmarker} industrial designer: mm ? user interface: i dunno , you seem like you know about {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: yeah , uh i d i was an engineer before i came here . user interface: okay . cool . {vocalsound} project manager: okay . well thank you everybody . um {vocalsound} we have {disfmarker} we'll discuss that and then i just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . um , teletext is apparently outdated , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . um , industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable i guess . um if we have something {disfmarker} i mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . okay . um . so we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . um , yeah . {vocalsound} do {disfmarker} let's {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: i guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming , see what we can {disfmarker} user interface: like in terms of marketing: how it looks or {disfmarker} user interface: how it looks , or like what it does ? project manager: wha what {disfmarker} um {vocalsound} well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and i dunno the the s user interface: okay . project manager: the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . so . user interface: yeah . okay . so {disfmarker} is our target group then people {disfmarker} so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? project manager: {vocalsound} i think that seems to {disfmarker} yeah . mm . user interface: so {disfmarker} industrial designer: it's easy to implement . user interface: okay . so the {disfmarker} marketing: {gap} the the buzzer you mean , user interface: yeah , yeah , yeah . industrial designer: locator . marketing: yeah , for sure , yeah . user interface: so then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , project manager: yeah , teenagers and young professionals . user interface: what was it ? marketing: well that's for speech recognition . project manager: oh , uh . industrial designer: well {disfmarker} user interface: oh . marketing: and screen . that's only for speech recognition and screen . industrial designer: i was thinking about that but uh i mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , project manager: yeah . industrial designer: and also , if the tv is on it's making sound and the people on the tv are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the tv's gonna switch itself to channel one , marketing: yeah yeah yeah . project manager: mm . industrial designer: or {disfmarker} it seems like a silly , user interface: yeah . marketing: i mean {disfmarker} industrial designer: i'm not sure how you would implement it . user interface: yeah . marketing: i just put the values {vocalsound} in . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: and if if you consider our budget , it probably {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: but um the screen is the same as what , {gap} industrial designer: it's a cool idea but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . user interface: yeah . marketing: yeah , i'm happy with that . project manager: yeah {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: right so um {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: hu yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} completely . user interface: okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a {disfmarker} like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the tv itself . industrial designer: well you would have to have a button on a tv or on your wall or some place {gap} since the tv already has power . marketing: yeah . project manager: yeah . user interface: yeah . industrial designer: yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and i was thinking , i_r_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the tv it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . user interface: okay . okay . marketing: yeah . project manager: okay . industrial designer: sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably . user interface: alright . marketing: okay . user interface: {vocalsound} okay . project manager: so you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can {disfmarker} industrial designer: it would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote {vocalsound} . project manager: right . yeah , yeah . marketing: so do you plug it in the t_ {disfmarker} you plug it in tv , this thing ? industrial designer: yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your tv so if you need to find the remote , click the button . marketing: okay . okay . user interface: so it's now like a two-part thing . industrial designer: yeah , so it would be a two part package . user interface: okay . alright . marketing: okay . user interface: so we get to design that too . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} make it fashionable . um , okay . project manager: so do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . industrial designer: yeah i think so . marketing: yeah . just there . project manager: huh . okay . marketing: mm . are we um should that thing be on the {vocalsound} thing to put the {disfmarker} you s you talking about a home for it . project manager: yeah . marketing: do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ? project manager: we probably leave that . i mean i guess one takes care of the other , like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's {disfmarker} marketing: okay . user interface: yeah . then it can live anywhere . project manager: yeah {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: yeah . marketing: okay . for the {disfmarker} so you have that button , that {disfmarker} so there's {disfmarker} is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ? industrial designer: um on the tv or on the phone ? marketing: are we just having a radio ? on the phone . industrial designer: um it seemed like a {disfmarker} a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , user interface: t marketing: you don't need a light . yeah yeah yeah . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: i think that's what the phone has , marketing: yeah yeah . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: i mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it {vocalsound} and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever . project manager: and like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so marketing: you can hear it's under the couch yeah . project manager: {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: so i yeah . marketing: um , {vocalsound} {gap} so need the other buttons . so we have this {disfmarker} mm . project manager: so i mean the two remotes that you had shown r i don't remember who showed them {vocalsound} , yeah you you did um , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: that was that was me . marketing: mm-hmm . {vocalsound} project manager: they're {disfmarker} i mean one looked like it was for v_c_r_ type thing , and the other looked like just television . user interface: i think w i think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes . project manager: oh really . 'cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have v_c_r_ capabilities . user interface: and uh industrial designer: does anyone know if v_c_r_s are the same across {disfmarker} international ? user interface: yeah . project manager: they're not {disfmarker} no . marketing: they're not , no . industrial designer: okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's v_c_r_s . user interface: s project manager: yeah , that's right , yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} it not v_h_s_ here ? project manager: but d_v_d_ probably is . industrial designer: yeah , other than that region and coding thing . user interface: um {disfmarker} project manager: and and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , i mean it's gonna be d_v_d_ type , that's the the technology these days . marketing: but v_c_r_s {disfmarker} yeah . yeah , for sure . industrial designer: mm-hmm . user interface: yeah . so . okay , let's see if i can {disfmarker} i think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take {disfmarker} like just reduce the number of buttons you know , project manager: yeah . user interface: like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the tv . project manager: yeah . marketing: well for sure we need the um {disfmarker} i think we can just design the channels ? i mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much , project manager: s user interface: yeah . project manager: huh . industrial designer: mm-hmm . user interface: yeah . marketing: s and it's usually that red user interface: yeah . marketing: and i think it's quite nice to keep it like red . user interface: yeah . project manager: you know , i've seen some remotes that {disfmarker} where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . so you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just {disfmarker} marketing: oh okay , yeah . user interface: it seems like that would be hard though . project manager: but {disfmarker} user interface: i mean , like because unless you know {disfmarker} project manager: it might be confusing . yeah . user interface: yeah . just 'cause i wouldn't {disfmarker} i would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . {vocalsound} project manager: yeah . besides you like to be able to go power . industrial designer: yeah , i never think to hold something down . {vocalsound} marketing: yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} i have the power {vocalsound} user interface: yeah . b {vocalsound} yeah . project manager: i guess . so we definitely want a power button and numbers . right . user interface: yeah . marketing: well even um ipod thing {vocalsound} {voc"], "document": " summarize the whole meeting. marketing: okay . project manager: 'kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . welcome everybody . um hope your sessions went well . um so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . um i've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , and i'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . um i i'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet . right . um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this {disfmarker} marketing: and i can start if you want . mm . project manager: sure . marketing: is there an order ? no . project manager: hm ? marketing: we haven't decided on an order . project manager: no , any any order's fine . yeah . marketing: first . okay . um , how do i put this {disfmarker} industrial designer: just uh {disfmarker} marketing: i'll just put the cable in . project manager: oh yeah , sorry . marketing: {gap} is that it ? can you see ? {vocalsound} oh , here . okay . so what happens it doesn't work ? project manager: it sh it takes a few seconds i think . industrial designer: you may need to {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} who's that ? {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: no . industrial designer: but sometimes you have to do it {disfmarker} marketing: is it in the right thing ? industrial designer: it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press f_ eight . marketing: oh wait , um . uh . you need to help me . {vocalsound} project manager: uh-huh , and then press function . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: and f_ eight . marketing: yeah . user interface: could you just plug it back into hers because she had {disfmarker} marketing: oh , wait . user interface: oh . marketing: that's {disfmarker} is that it ? industrial designer: adjusting . project manager: here we are . {vocalsound} industrial designer: the cable might be a little loose or something . oh , you got it . marketing: right here we are . project manager: oh . is it on ?

um {vocalsound} does it do {disfmarker} or do we need to have like functions for cable or v_c_r_ ? and then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? and um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um i dunno if this will work but {disfmarker} and i think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . {vocalsound} just i mean i like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but i mean i think we sh can sort of think about things like um {vocalsound} like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . {vocalsound} that concludes my presentation . project manager: {gap} user interface: okay . you need the little thingy . ooh . industrial designer: how do i um {disfmarker} marketing: s that's on view . industrial designer: right . marketing: oh . industrial designer: okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method i used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . um so i think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the tv . and also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the tv and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . so the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the tv , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . and also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their tv or stick it on their wall . and this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the tv . and then for the location function , you would have a sender on the tv which would output some sort of signal , um we could use i_r_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . that signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , i_r_ transmitter to communicate to the tv , that's just sort of standard , um so most tvs have an i_r_ receiver . probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and i'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . so that concludes my presentation . project manager: 'kay . user interface: do you know about like {disfmarker} industrial designer: mm ? user interface: i dunno , you seem like you know about {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: yeah , uh i d i was an engineer before i came here . user interface: okay . cool . {vocalsound} project manager: okay . well thank you everybody . um {vocalsound} we have {disfmarker} we'll discuss that and then i just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . um , teletext is apparently outdated , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . um , industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable i guess . um if we have something {disfmarker} i mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . okay . um . so we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . um , yeah . {vocalsound} do {disfmarker} let's {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: i guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming , see what we can {disfmarker} user interface: like in terms of marketing: how it looks or {disfmarker} user interface: how it looks , or like what it does ? project manager: wha what {disfmarker} um {vocalsound} well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and i dunno the the s user interface: okay . project manager: the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . so . user interface: yeah . okay . so {disfmarker} is our target group then people {disfmarker} so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? project manager: {vocalsound} i think that seems to {disfmarker} yeah . mm . user interface: so {disfmarker} industrial designer: it's easy to implement . user interface: okay . so the {disfmarker} marketing: {gap} the the buzzer you mean , user interface: yeah , yeah , yeah . industrial designer: locator . marketing: yeah , for sure , yeah . user interface: so then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , project manager: yeah , teenagers and young professionals . user interface: what was it ? marketing: well that's for speech recognition . project manager: oh , uh . industrial designer: well {disfmarker} user interface: oh . marketing: and screen . that's only for speech recognition and screen . industrial designer: i was thinking about that but uh i mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , project manager: yeah . industrial designer: and also , if the tv is on it's making sound and the people on the tv are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the tv's gonna switch itself to channel one , marketing: yeah yeah yeah . project manager: mm . industrial designer: or {disfmarker} it seems like a silly , user interface: yeah . marketing: i mean {disfmarker} industrial designer: i'm not sure how you would implement it . user interface: yeah . marketing: i just put the values {vocalsound} in . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: and if if you consider our budget , it probably {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: but um the screen is the same as what , {gap} industrial designer: it's a cool idea but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . user interface: yeah . marketing: yeah , i'm happy with that . project manager: yeah {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: right so um {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: hu yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} completely . user interface: okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a {disfmarker} like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the tv itself . industrial designer: well you would have to have a button on a tv or on your wall or some place {gap} since the tv already has power . marketing: yeah . project manager: yeah . user interface: yeah . industrial designer: yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and i was thinking , i_r_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the tv it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . user interface: okay . okay . marketing: yeah . project manager: okay . industrial designer: sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably . user interface: alright . marketing: okay . user interface: {vocalsound} okay . project manager: so you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can {disfmarker} industrial designer: it would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote {vocalsound} . project manager: right . yeah , yeah . marketing: so do you plug it in the t_ {disfmarker} you plug it in tv , this thing ? industrial designer: yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your tv so if you need to find the remote , click the button . marketing: okay . okay . user interface: so it's now like a two-part thing . industrial designer: yeah , so it would be a two part package . user interface: okay . alright . marketing: okay . user interface: so we get to design that too . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} make it fashionable . um , okay . project manager: so do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . industrial designer: yeah i think so . marketing: yeah . just there . project manager: huh . okay . marketing: mm . are we um should that thing be on the {vocalsound} thing to put the {disfmarker} you s you talking about a home for it . project manager: yeah . marketing: do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ? project manager: we probably leave that . i mean i guess one takes care of the other , like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's {disfmarker} marketing: okay . user interface: yeah . then it can live anywhere . project manager: yeah {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: yeah . marketing: okay . for the {disfmarker} so you have that button , that {disfmarker} so there's {disfmarker} is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ? industrial designer: um on the tv or on the phone ? marketing: are we just having a radio ? on the phone . industrial designer: um it seemed like a {disfmarker} a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , user interface: t marketing: you don't need a light . yeah yeah yeah . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: i think that's what the phone has , marketing: yeah yeah . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: i mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it {vocalsound} and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever . project manager: and like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so marketing: you can hear it's under the couch yeah . project manager: {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: so i yeah . marketing: um , {vocalsound} {gap} so need the other buttons . so we have this {disfmarker} mm . project manager: so i mean the two remotes that you had shown r i don't remember who showed them {vocalsound} , yeah you you did um , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: that was that was me . marketing: mm-hmm . {vocalsound} project manager: they're {disfmarker} i mean one looked like it was for v_c_r_ type thing , and the other looked like just television . user interface: i think w i think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes . project manager: oh really . 'cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have v_c_r_ capabilities . user interface: and uh industrial designer: does anyone know if v_c_r_s are the same across {disfmarker} international ? user interface: yeah . project manager: they're not {disfmarker} no . marketing: they're not , no . industrial designer: okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's v_c_r_s . user interface: s project manager: yeah , that's right , yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} it not v_h_s_ here ? project manager: but d_v_d_ probably is . industrial designer: yeah , other than that region and coding thing . user interface: um {disfmarker} project manager: and and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , i mean it's gonna be d_v_d_ type , that's the the technology these days . marketing: but v_c_r_s {disfmarker} yeah . yeah , for sure . industrial designer: mm-hmm . user interface: yeah . so . okay , let's see if i can {disfmarker} i think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take {disfmarker} like just reduce the number of buttons you know , project manager: yeah . user interface: like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the tv . project manager: yeah . marketing: well for sure we need the um {disfmarker} i think we can just design the channels ? i mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much , project manager: s user interface: yeah . project manager: huh . industrial designer: mm-hmm . user interface: yeah . marketing: s and it's usually that red user interface: yeah . marketing: and i think it's quite nice to keep it like red . user interface: yeah . project manager: you know , i've seen some remotes that {disfmarker} where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . so you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just {disfmarker} marketing: oh okay , yeah . user interface: it seems like that would be hard though . project manager: but {disfmarker} user interface: i mean , like because unless you know {disfmarker} project manager: it might be confusing . yeah . user interface: yeah . just 'cause i wouldn't {disfmarker} i would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . {vocalsound} project manager: yeah . besides you like to be able to go power . industrial designer: yeah , i never think to hold something down . {vocalsound} marketing: yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} i have the power {vocalsound} user interface: yeah . b {vocalsound} yeah . project manager: i guess . so we definitely want a power button and numbers . right . user interface: yeah . marketing: well even um ipod thing {vocalsound} {voc", "summary": "In the functional design meeting, they discussed user needs, technical effects, and the working design of the remote control. The minutes from the previous meetings were shared in the shared documents folder. The updates from everyone revealed that a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory and it was found that customers and users don't like the way remote controls look, feel, or work. It was also determined that people only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote, so they focused on the buttons that are used most frequently. They also discussed that people are willing to pay more for a remote control that is user friendly and fashionable. In the end, they concluded that the remote needs to be able to turn on and off the TV, change the channels, and have a location function. ", "model": "gpt3", "faithfulness": 0}
{"id": NaN, "documents": [" summarize the whole meeting. marketing: okay . project manager: 'kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . welcome everybody . um hope your sessions went well . um so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . um i've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , and i'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . um i i'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet . right . um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this {disfmarker} marketing: and i can start if you want . mm . project manager: sure . marketing: is there an order ? no . project manager: hm ? marketing: we haven't decided on an order . project manager: no , any any order's fine . yeah . marketing: first . okay . um , how do i put this {disfmarker} industrial designer: just uh {disfmarker} marketing: i'll just put the cable in . project manager: oh yeah , sorry . marketing: {gap} is that it ? can you see ? {vocalsound} oh , here . okay . so what happens it doesn't work ? project manager: it sh it takes a few seconds i think . industrial designer: you may need to {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} who's that ? {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: no . industrial designer: but sometimes you have to do it {disfmarker} marketing: is it in the right thing ? industrial designer: it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press f_ eight . marketing: oh wait , um . uh . you need to help me . {vocalsound} project manager: uh-huh , and then press function . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: and f_ eight . marketing: yeah . user interface: could you just plug it back into hers because she had {disfmarker} marketing: oh , wait . user interface: oh . marketing: that's {disfmarker} is that it ? industrial designer: adjusting . project manager: here we are . {vocalsound} industrial designer: the cable might be a little loose or something . oh , you got it . marketing: right here we are . project manager: oh . is it on ? marketing: we're here . project manager: okay . marketing: okay , um . in order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . custome customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and i think we should design according to these buttons . easy to lose , and r_s_i_ . i don't know what r_s_i_ means . um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , i don't have a clue . project manager: hm . marketing: um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , i have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . so the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . they're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . and um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . the other ones are the settings , and they're used less than {disfmarker} you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that i think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . and if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , i don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . um i don't i don't know um what the decision to be made is , but i think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together . {vocalsound} and that's all i have to say about the matter , {vocalsound} um . project manager: 'kay . marketing: shall i {disfmarker} what do i do ? do i give this to someone else ? project manager: yeah . just move right on . user interface: right . so get this . okay so now i need to press f_ eight , what is it ? project manager: {vocalsound} uh function f_ eight . marketing: function f_ eight . user interface: 'kay . what's function ?

industrial designer: um on the tv or on the phone ? marketing: are we just having a radio ? on the phone . industrial designer: um it seemed like a {disfmarker} a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , user interface: t marketing: you don't need a light . yeah yeah yeah . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: i think that's what the phone has , marketing: yeah yeah . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: i mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it {vocalsound} and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever . project manager: and like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so marketing: you can hear it's under the couch yeah . project manager: {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: so i yeah . marketing: um , {vocalsound} {gap} so need the other buttons . so we have this {disfmarker} mm . project manager: so i mean the two remotes that you had shown r i don't remember who showed them {vocalsound} , yeah you you did um , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: that was that was me . marketing: mm-hmm . {vocalsound} project manager: they're {disfmarker} i mean one looked like it was for v_c_r_ type thing , and the other looked like just television . user interface: i think w i think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes . project manager: oh really . 'cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have v_c_r_ capabilities . user interface: and uh industrial designer: does anyone know if v_c_r_s are the same across {disfmarker} international ? user interface: yeah . project manager: they're not {disfmarker} no . marketing: they're not , no . industrial designer: okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's v_c_r_s . user interface: s project manager: yeah , that's right , yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} it not v_h_s_ here ? project manager: but d_v_d_ probably is . industrial designer: yeah , other than that region and coding thing . user interface: um {disfmarker} project manager: and and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , i mean it's gonna be d_v_d_ type , that's the the technology these days . marketing: but v_c_r_s {disfmarker} yeah . yeah , for sure . industrial designer: mm-hmm . user interface: yeah . so . okay , let's see if i can {disfmarker} i think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take {disfmarker} like just reduce the number of buttons you know , project manager: yeah . user interface: like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the tv . project manager: yeah . marketing: well for sure we need the um {disfmarker} i think we can just design the channels ? i mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much , project manager: s user interface: yeah . project manager: huh . industrial designer: mm-hmm . user interface: yeah . marketing: s and it's usually that red user interface: yeah . marketing: and i think it's quite nice to keep it like red . user interface: yeah . project manager: you know , i've seen some remotes that {disfmarker} where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . so you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just {disfmarker} marketing: oh okay , yeah . user interface: it seems like that would be hard though . project manager: but {disfmarker} user interface: i mean , like because unless you know {disfmarker} project manager: it might be confusing . yeah . user interface: yeah . just 'cause i wouldn't {disfmarker} i would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . {vocalsound} project manager: yeah . besides you like to be able to go power . industrial designer: yeah , i never think to hold something down . {vocalsound} marketing: yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} i have the power {vocalsound} user interface: yeah . b {vocalsound} yeah . project manager: i guess . so we definitely want a power button and numbers . right . user interface: yeah . marketing: well even um ipod thing {vocalsound} {voc"], "document": " summarize the whole meeting. marketing: okay . project manager: 'kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . welcome everybody . um hope your sessions went well . um so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . um i've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , and i'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . um i i'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet . right . um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this {disfmarker} marketing: and i can start if you want . mm . project manager: sure . marketing: is there an order ? no . project manager: hm ? marketing: we haven't decided on an order . project manager: no , any any order's fine . yeah . marketing: first . okay . um , how do i put this {disfmarker} industrial designer: just uh {disfmarker} marketing: i'll just put the cable in . project manager: oh yeah , sorry . marketing: {gap} is that it ? can you see ? {vocalsound} oh , here . okay . so what happens it doesn't work ? project manager: it sh it takes a few seconds i think . industrial designer: you may need to {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} who's that ? {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: no . industrial designer: but sometimes you have to do it {disfmarker} marketing: is it in the right thing ? industrial designer: it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press f_ eight . marketing: oh wait , um . uh . you need to help me . {vocalsound} project manager: uh-huh , and then press function . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: and f_ eight . marketing: yeah . user interface: could you just plug it back into hers because she had {disfmarker} marketing: oh , wait . user interface: oh . marketing: that's {disfmarker} is that it ? industrial designer: adjusting . project manager: here we are . {vocalsound} industrial designer: the cable might be a little loose or something . oh , you got it . marketing: right here we are . project manager: oh . is it on ? marketing: we're here . project manager: okay . marketing: okay , um . in order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . custome customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and i think we should design according to these buttons . easy to lose , and r_s_i_ . i don't know what r_s_i_ means . um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , i don't have a clue . project manager: hm . marketing: um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , i have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . so the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . they're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . and um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . the other ones are the settings , and they're used less than {disfmarker} you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that i think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . and if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , i don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . um i don't i don't know um what the decision to be made is , but i think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together . {vocalsound} and that's all i have to say about the matter , {vocalsound} um . project manager: 'kay . marketing: shall i {disfmarker} what do i do ? do i give this to someone else ? project manager: yeah . just move right on . user interface: right . so get this . okay so now i need to press f_ eight , what is it ? project manager: {vocalsound} uh function f_ eight . marketing: function f_ eight . user interface: 'kay . what's function ? project manager: it's the little blue {disfmarker} w it's the one {disfmarker} th user interface: oh function , i see it . project manager: yeah . yeah should be {disfmarker} user interface: there we go . {vocalsound} project manager: it should be {gap} yeah . user interface: okay . um . this my presentation about the uh technical functions design and i basically just tried to focus on um {vocalsound} just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . so uh and i just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet {vocalsound} . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: and okay so basically um {vocalsound} i think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . um {vocalsound} so i think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that {disfmarker} like close together that um {vocalsound} are used in the same way , uh {vocalsound} or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh {disfmarker} can you c y small enough large enough i'm not sure we c i guess we would need to do some research about , i would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the tv . does it have like capacity to change the channels ? um {vocalsound} does it do {disfmarker} or do we need to have like functions for cable or v_c_r_ ? and then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? and um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um i dunno if this will work but {disfmarker} and i think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . {vocalsound} just i mean i like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but i mean i think we sh can sort of think about things like um {vocalsound} like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . {vocalsound} that concludes my presentation . project manager: {gap} user interface: okay . you need the little thingy . ooh . industrial designer: how do i um {disfmarker} marketing: s that's on view . industrial designer: right . marketing: oh . industrial designer: okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method i used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . um so i think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the tv . and also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the tv and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . so the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the tv , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . and also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their tv or stick it on their wall . and this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the tv . and then for the location function , you would have a sender on the tv which would output some sort of signal , um we could use i_r_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . that signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , i_r_ transmitter to communicate to the tv , that's just sort of standard , um so most tvs have an i_r_ receiver . probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and i'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . so that concludes my presentation . project manager: 'kay . user interface: do you know about like {disfmarker} industrial designer: mm ? user interface: i dunno , you seem like you know about {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: yeah , uh i d i was an engineer before i came here . user interface: okay . cool . {vocalsound} project manager: okay . well thank you everybody . um {vocalsound} we have {disfmarker} we'll discuss that and then i just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . um , teletext is apparently outdated , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . um , industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable i guess . um if we have something {disfmarker} i mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . okay . um . so we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . um , yeah . {vocalsound} do {disfmarker} let's {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: i guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming , see what we can {disfmarker} user interface: like in terms of marketing: how it looks or {disfmarker} user interface: how it looks , or like what it does ? project manager: wha what {disfmarker} um {vocalsound} well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and i dunno the the s user interface: okay . project manager: the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . so . user interface: yeah . okay . so {disfmarker} is our target group then people {disfmarker} so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? project manager: {vocalsound} i think that seems to {disfmarker} yeah . mm . user interface: so {disfmarker} industrial designer: it's easy to implement . user interface: okay . so the {disfmarker} marketing: {gap} the the buzzer you mean , user interface: yeah , yeah , yeah . industrial designer: locator . marketing: yeah , for sure , yeah . user interface: so then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , project manager: yeah , teenagers and young professionals . user interface: what was it ? marketing: well that's for speech recognition . project manager: oh , uh . industrial designer: well {disfmarker} user interface: oh . marketing: and screen . that's only for speech recognition and screen . industrial designer: i was thinking about that but uh i mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , project manager: yeah . industrial designer: and also , if the tv is on it's making sound and the people on the tv are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the tv's gonna switch itself to channel one , marketing: yeah yeah yeah . project manager: mm . industrial designer: or {disfmarker} it seems like a silly , user interface: yeah . marketing: i mean {disfmarker} industrial designer: i'm not sure how you would implement it . user interface: yeah . marketing: i just put the values {vocalsound} in . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: and if if you consider our budget , it probably {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: but um the screen is the same as what , {gap} industrial designer: it's a cool idea but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . user interface: yeah . marketing: yeah , i'm happy with that . project manager: yeah {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: right so um {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: hu yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} completely . user interface: okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a {disfmarker} like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the tv itself . industrial designer: well you would have to have a button on a tv or on your wall or some place {gap} since the tv already has power . marketing: yeah . project manager: yeah . user interface: yeah . industrial designer: yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and i was thinking , i_r_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the tv it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . user interface: okay . okay . marketing: yeah . project manager: okay . industrial designer: sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably . user interface: alright . marketing: okay . user interface: {vocalsound} okay . project manager: so you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can {disfmarker} industrial designer: it would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote {vocalsound} . project manager: right . yeah , yeah . marketing: so do you plug it in the t_ {disfmarker} you plug it in tv , this thing ? industrial designer: yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your tv so if you need to find the remote , click the button . marketing: okay . okay . user interface: so it's now like a two-part thing . industrial designer: yeah , so it would be a two part package . user interface: okay . alright . marketing: okay . user interface: so we get to design that too . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} make it fashionable . um , okay . project manager: so do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . industrial designer: yeah i think so . marketing: yeah . just there . project manager: huh . okay . marketing: mm . are we um should that thing be on the {vocalsound} thing to put the {disfmarker} you s you talking about a home for it . project manager: yeah . marketing: do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ? project manager: we probably leave that . i mean i guess one takes care of the other , like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's {disfmarker} marketing: okay . user interface: yeah . then it can live anywhere . project manager: yeah {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: yeah . marketing: okay . for the {disfmarker} so you have that button , that {disfmarker} so there's {disfmarker} is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ? industrial designer: um on the tv or on the phone ? marketing: are we just having a radio ? on the phone . industrial designer: um it seemed like a {disfmarker} a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , user interface: t marketing: you don't need a light . yeah yeah yeah . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: i think that's what the phone has , marketing: yeah yeah . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: i mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it {vocalsound} and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever . project manager: and like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so marketing: you can hear it's under the couch yeah . project manager: {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: so i yeah . marketing: um , {vocalsound} {gap} so need the other buttons . so we have this {disfmarker} mm . project manager: so i mean the two remotes that you had shown r i don't remember who showed them {vocalsound} , yeah you you did um , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: that was that was me . marketing: mm-hmm . {vocalsound} project manager: they're {disfmarker} i mean one looked like it was for v_c_r_ type thing , and the other looked like just television . user interface: i think w i think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes . project manager: oh really . 'cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have v_c_r_ capabilities . user interface: and uh industrial designer: does anyone know if v_c_r_s are the same across {disfmarker} international ? user interface: yeah . project manager: they're not {disfmarker} no . marketing: they're not , no . industrial designer: okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's v_c_r_s . user interface: s project manager: yeah , that's right , yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} it not v_h_s_ here ? project manager: but d_v_d_ probably is . industrial designer: yeah , other than that region and coding thing . user interface: um {disfmarker} project manager: and and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , i mean it's gonna be d_v_d_ type , that's the the technology these days . marketing: but v_c_r_s {disfmarker} yeah . yeah , for sure . industrial designer: mm-hmm . user interface: yeah . so . okay , let's see if i can {disfmarker} i think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take {disfmarker} like just reduce the number of buttons you know , project manager: yeah . user interface: like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the tv . project manager: yeah . marketing: well for sure we need the um {disfmarker} i think we can just design the channels ? i mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much , project manager: s user interface: yeah . project manager: huh . industrial designer: mm-hmm . user interface: yeah . marketing: s and it's usually that red user interface: yeah . marketing: and i think it's quite nice to keep it like red . user interface: yeah . project manager: you know , i've seen some remotes that {disfmarker} where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . so you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just {disfmarker} marketing: oh okay , yeah . user interface: it seems like that would be hard though . project manager: but {disfmarker} user interface: i mean , like because unless you know {disfmarker} project manager: it might be confusing . yeah . user interface: yeah . just 'cause i wouldn't {disfmarker} i would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . {vocalsound} project manager: yeah . besides you like to be able to go power . industrial designer: yeah , i never think to hold something down . {vocalsound} marketing: yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} i have the power {vocalsound} user interface: yeah . b {vocalsound} yeah . project manager: i guess . so we definitely want a power button and numbers . right . user interface: yeah . marketing: well even um ipod thing {vocalsound} {voc", "summary": "the meeting kicked off with marketing leading the discussion on user requirements, technical effects, and working design of the remote control. then, industrial designer shared the working design and main components of the remote control. also, they discussed functions that they would add to the remote control such as a child lock and the appearance of the remote control, such as having a comfortable shape and different colours. finally, project manager stated their target group, which was people aged ten to forty, and they discussed how to cater to their needs, such as having large buttons for the elderly.

project manager: it's the little blue {disfmarker} w it's the one {disfmarker} th user interface: oh function , i see it . project manager: yeah . yeah should be {disfmarker} user interface: there we go . {vocalsound} project manager: it should be {gap} yeah . user interface: okay . um . this my presentation about the uh technical functions design and i basically just tried to focus on um {vocalsound} just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . so uh and i just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet {vocalsound} . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: and okay so basically um {vocalsound} i think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . um {vocalsound} so i think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that {disfmarker} like close together that um {vocalsound} are used in the same way , uh {vocalsound} or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh {disfmarker} can you c y small enough large enough i'm not sure we c i guess we would need to do some research about , i would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the tv . does it have like capacity to change the channels ? um {vocalsound} does it do {disfmarker} or do we need to have like functions for cable or v_c_r_ ? and then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? and um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um i dunno if this will work but {disfmarker} and i think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . {vocalsound} just i mean i like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but i mean i think we sh can sort of think about things like um {vocalsound} like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . {vocalsound} that concludes my presentation . project manager: {gap} user interface: okay . you need the little thingy . ooh . industrial designer: how do i um {disfmarker} marketing: s that's on view . industrial designer: right . marketing: oh . industrial designer: okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method i used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . um so i think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the tv . and also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the tv and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . so the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the tv , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . and also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their tv or stick it on their wall . and this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the tv . and then for the location function , you would have a sender on the tv which would output some sort of signal , um we could use i_r_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . that signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , i_r_ transmitter to communicate to the tv , that's just sort of standard , um so most tvs have an i_r_ receiver . probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and i'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . so that concludes my presentation . project manager: 'kay . user interface: do you know about like {disfmarker} industrial designer: mm ? user interface: i dunno , you seem like you know about {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: yeah , uh i d i was an engineer before i came here . user interface: okay . cool . {vocalsound} project manager: okay . well thank you everybody . um {vocalsound} we have {disfmarker} we'll discuss that and then i just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . um , teletext is apparently outdated , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . um , industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable i guess . um if we have something {disfmarker} i mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . okay . um . so we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . um , yeah . {vocalsound} do {disfmarker} let's {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: i guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming , see what we can {disfmarker} user interface: like in terms of marketing: how it looks or {disfmarker} user interface: how it looks , or like what it does ? project manager: wha what {disfmarker} um {vocalsound} well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and i dunno the the s user interface: okay . project manager: the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . so . user interface: yeah . okay . so {disfmarker} is our target group then people {disfmarker} so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? project manager: {vocalsound} i think that seems to {disfmarker} yeah . mm . user interface: so {disfmarker} industrial designer: it's easy to implement . user interface: okay . so the {disfmarker} marketing: {gap} the the buzzer you mean , user interface: yeah , yeah , yeah . industrial designer: locator . marketing: yeah , for sure , yeah . user interface: so then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , project manager: yeah , teenagers and young professionals . user interface: what was it ? marketing: well that's for speech recognition . project manager: oh , uh . industrial designer: well {disfmarker} user interface: oh . marketing: and screen . that's only for speech recognition and screen . industrial designer: i was thinking about that but uh i mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , project manager: yeah . industrial designer: and also , if the tv is on it's making sound and the people on the tv are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the tv's gonna switch itself to channel one , marketing: yeah yeah yeah . project manager: mm . industrial designer: or {disfmarker} it seems like a silly , user interface: yeah . marketing: i mean {disfmarker} industrial designer: i'm not sure how you would implement it . user interface: yeah . marketing: i just put the values {vocalsound} in . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: and if if you consider our budget , it probably {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: but um the screen is the same as what , {gap} industrial designer: it's a cool idea but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . user interface: yeah . marketing: yeah , i'm happy with that . project manager: yeah {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: right so um {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: hu yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} completely . user interface: okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a {disfmarker} like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the tv itself . industrial designer: well you would have to have a button on a tv or on your wall or some place {gap} since the tv already has power . marketing: yeah . project manager: yeah . user interface: yeah . industrial designer: yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and i was thinking , i_r_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the tv it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . user interface: okay . okay . marketing: yeah . project manager: okay . industrial designer: sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably . user interface: alright . marketing: okay . user interface: {vocalsound} okay . project manager: so you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can {disfmarker} industrial designer: it would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote {vocalsound} . project manager: right . yeah , yeah . marketing: so do you plug it in the t_ {disfmarker} you plug it in tv , this thing ? industrial designer: yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your tv so if you need to find the remote , click the button . marketing: okay . okay . user interface: so it's now like a two-part thing . industrial designer: yeah , so it would be a two part package . user interface: okay . alright . marketing: okay . user interface: so we get to design that too . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} make it fashionable . um , okay . project manager: so do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . industrial designer: yeah i think so . marketing: yeah . just there . project manager: huh . okay . marketing: mm . are we um should that thing be on the {vocalsound} thing to put the {disfmarker} you s you talking about a home for it . project manager: yeah . marketing: do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ? project manager: we probably leave that . i mean i guess one takes care of the other , like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's {disfmarker} marketing: okay . user interface: yeah . then it can live anywhere . project manager: yeah {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: yeah . marketing: okay . for the {disfmarker} so you have that button , that {disfmarker} so there's {disfmarker} is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ? industrial designer: um on the tv or on the phone ? marketing: are we just having a radio ? on the phone . industrial designer: um it seemed like a {disfmarker} a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , user interface: t marketing: you don't need a light . yeah yeah yeah . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: i think that's what the phone has , marketing: yeah yeah . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: i mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it {vocalsound} and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever . project manager: and like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so marketing: you can hear it's under the couch yeah . project manager: {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: so i yeah . marketing: um , {vocalsound} {gap} so need the other buttons . so we have this {disfmarker} mm . project manager: so i mean the two remotes that you had shown r i don't remember who showed them {vocalsound} , yeah you you did um , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: that was that was me . marketing: mm-hmm . {vocalsound} project manager: they're {disfmarker} i mean one looked like it was for v_c_r_ type thing , and the other looked like just television . user interface: i think w i think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes . project manager: oh really . 'cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have v_c_r_ capabilities . user interface: and uh industrial designer: does anyone know if v_c_r_s are the same across {disfmarker} international ? user interface: yeah . project manager: they're not {disfmarker} no . marketing: they're not , no . industrial designer: okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's v_c_r_s . user interface: s project manager: yeah , that's right , yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} it not v_h_s_ here ? project manager: but d_v_d_ probably is . industrial designer: yeah , other than that region and coding thing . user interface: um {disfmarker} project manager: and and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , i mean it's gonna be d_v_d_ type , that's the the technology these days . marketing: but v_c_r_s {disfmarker} yeah . yeah , for sure . industrial designer: mm-hmm . user interface: yeah . so . okay , let's see if i can {disfmarker} i think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take {disfmarker} like just reduce the number of buttons you know , project manager: yeah . user interface: like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the tv . project manager: yeah . marketing: well for sure we need the um {disfmarker} i think we can just design the channels ? i mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much , project manager: s user interface: yeah . project manager: huh . industrial designer: mm-hmm . user interface: yeah . marketing: s and it's usually that red user interface: yeah . marketing: and i think it's quite nice to keep it like red . user interface: yeah . project manager: you know , i've seen some remotes that {disfmarker} where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . so you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just {disfmarker} marketing: oh okay , yeah . user interface: it seems like that would be hard though . project manager: but {disfmarker} user interface: i mean , like because unless you know {disfmarker} project manager: it might be confusing . yeah . user interface: yeah . just 'cause i wouldn't {disfmarker} i would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . {vocalsound} project manager: yeah . besides you like to be able to go power . industrial designer: yeah , i never think to hold something down . {vocalsound} marketing: yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} i have the power {vocalsound} user interface: yeah . b {vocalsound} yeah . project manager: i guess . so we definitely want a power button and numbers . right . user interface: yeah . marketing: well even um ipod thing {vocalsound} {voc"], "document": " summarize the whole meeting. marketing: okay . project manager: 'kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . welcome everybody . um hope your sessions went well . um so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . um i've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , and i'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . um i i'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet . right . um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this {disfmarker} marketing: and i can start if you want . mm . project manager: sure . marketing: is there an order ? no . project manager: hm ? marketing: we haven't decided on an order . project manager: no , any any order's fine . yeah . marketing: first . okay . um , how do i put this {disfmarker} industrial designer: just uh {disfmarker} marketing: i'll just put the cable in . project manager: oh yeah , sorry . marketing: {gap} is that it ? can you see ? {vocalsound} oh , here . okay . so what happens it doesn't work ? project manager: it sh it takes a few seconds i think . industrial designer: you may need to {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} who's that ? {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: no . industrial designer: but sometimes you have to do it {disfmarker} marketing: is it in the right thing ? industrial designer: it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press f_ eight . marketing: oh wait , um . uh . you need to help me . {vocalsound} project manager: uh-huh , and then press function . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: and f_ eight . marketing: yeah . user interface: could you just plug it back into hers because she had {disfmarker} marketing: oh , wait . user interface: oh . marketing: that's {disfmarker} is that it ? industrial designer: adjusting . project manager: here we are . {vocalsound} industrial designer: the cable might be a little loose or something . oh , you got it . marketing: right here we are . project manager: oh . is it on ? marketing: we're here . project manager: okay . marketing: okay , um . in order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . custome customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and i think we should design according to these buttons . easy to lose , and r_s_i_ . i don't know what r_s_i_ means . um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , i don't have a clue . project manager: hm . marketing: um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , i have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . so the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . they're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . and um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . the other ones are the settings , and they're used less than {disfmarker} you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that i think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . and if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , i don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . um i don't i don't know um what the decision to be made is , but i think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together . {vocalsound} and that's all i have to say about the matter , {vocalsound} um . project manager: 'kay . marketing: shall i {disfmarker} what do i do ? do i give this to someone else ? project manager: yeah . just move right on . user interface: right . so get this . okay so now i need to press f_ eight , what is it ? project manager: {vocalsound} uh function f_ eight . marketing: function f_ eight . user interface: 'kay . what's function ? project manager: it's the little blue {disfmarker} w it's the one {disfmarker} th user interface: oh function , i see it . project manager: yeah . yeah should be {disfmarker} user interface: there we go . {vocalsound} project manager: it should be {gap} yeah . user interface: okay . um . this my presentation about the uh technical functions design and i basically just tried to focus on um {vocalsound} just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . so uh and i just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet {vocalsound} . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: and okay so basically um {vocalsound} i think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . um {vocalsound} so i think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that {disfmarker} like close together that um {vocalsound} are used in the same way , uh {vocalsound} or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh {disfmarker} can you c y small enough large enough i'm not sure we c i guess we would need to do some research about , i would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the tv . does it have like capacity to change the channels ?

project manager: wha what {disfmarker} um {vocalsound} well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and i dunno the the s user interface: okay . project manager: the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . so . user interface: yeah . okay . so {disfmarker} is our target group then people {disfmarker} so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? project manager: {vocalsound} i think that seems to {disfmarker} yeah . mm . user interface: so {disfmarker} industrial designer: it's easy to implement . user interface: okay . so the {disfmarker} marketing: {gap} the the buzzer you mean , user interface: yeah , yeah , yeah . industrial designer: locator . marketing: yeah , for sure , yeah . user interface: so then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , project manager: yeah , teenagers and young professionals . user interface: what was it ? marketing: well that's for speech recognition . project manager: oh , uh . industrial designer: well {disfmarker} user interface: oh . marketing: and screen . that's only for speech recognition and screen . industrial designer: i was thinking about that but uh i mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , project manager: yeah . industrial designer: and also , if the tv is on it's making sound and the people on the tv are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the tv's gonna switch itself to channel one , marketing: yeah yeah yeah . project manager: mm . industrial designer: or {disfmarker} it seems like a silly , user interface: yeah . marketing: i mean {disfmarker} industrial designer: i'm not sure how you would implement it . user interface: yeah . marketing: i just put the values {vocalsound} in . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: and if if you consider our budget , it probably {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: but um the screen is the same as what , {gap} industrial designer: it's a cool idea but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . user interface: yeah . marketing: yeah , i'm happy with that . project manager: yeah {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: right so um {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: hu yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} completely . user interface: okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a {disfmarker} like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the tv itself . industrial designer: well you would have to have a button on a tv or on your wall or some place {gap} since the tv already has power . marketing: yeah . project manager: yeah . user interface: yeah . industrial designer: yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and i was thinking , i_r_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the tv it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . user interface: okay . okay . marketing: yeah . project manager: okay . industrial designer: sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably . user interface: alright . marketing: okay . user interface: {vocalsound} okay . project manager: so you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can {disfmarker} industrial designer: it would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote {vocalsound} . project manager: right . yeah , yeah . marketing: so do you plug it in the t_ {disfmarker} you plug it in tv , this thing ? industrial designer: yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your tv so if you need to find the remote , click the button . marketing: okay . okay . user interface: so it's now like a two-part thing . industrial designer: yeah , so it would be a two part package . user interface: okay . alright . marketing: okay . user interface: so we get to design that too . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} make it fashionable . um , okay . project manager: so do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . industrial designer: yeah i think so . marketing: yeah . just there . project manager: huh . okay . marketing: mm . are we um should that thing be on the {vocalsound} thing to put the {disfmarker} you s you talking about a home for it . project manager: yeah . marketing: do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ? project manager: we probably leave that . i mean i guess one takes care of the other , like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's {disfmarker} marketing: okay . user interface: yeah . then it can live anywhere . project manager: yeah {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: yeah . marketing: okay . for the {disfmarker} so you have that button , that {disfmarker} so there's {disfmarker} is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ? industrial designer: um on the tv or on the phone ? marketing: are we just having a radio ? on the phone . industrial designer: um it seemed like a {disfmarker} a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , user interface: t marketing: you don't need a light . yeah yeah yeah . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: i think that's what the phone has , marketing: yeah yeah . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: i mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it {vocalsound} and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever . project manager: and like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so marketing: you can hear it's under the couch yeah . project manager: {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: so i yeah . marketing: um , {vocalsound} {gap} so need the other buttons . so we have this {disfmarker} mm . project manager: so i mean the two remotes that you had shown r i don't remember who showed them {vocalsound} , yeah you you did um , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: that was that was me . marketing: mm-hmm . {vocalsound} project manager: they're {disfmarker} i mean one looked like it was for v_c_r_ type thing , and the other looked like just television . user interface: i think w i think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes . project manager: oh really . 'cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have v_c_r_ capabilities . user interface: and uh industrial designer: does anyone know if v_c_r_s are the same across {disfmarker} international ? user interface: yeah . project manager: they're not {disfmarker} no . marketing: they're not , no . industrial designer: okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's v_c_r_s . user interface: s project manager: yeah , that's right , yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} it not v_h_s_ here ? project manager: but d_v_d_ probably is . industrial designer: yeah , other than that region and coding thing . user interface: um {disfmarker} project manager: and and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , i mean it's gonna be d_v_d_ type , that's the the technology these days . marketing: but v_c_r_s {disfmarker} yeah . yeah , for sure . industrial designer: mm-hmm . user interface: yeah . so . okay , let's see if i can {disfmarker} i think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take {disfmarker} like just reduce the number of buttons you know , project manager: yeah . user interface: like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the tv . project manager: yeah . marketing: well for sure we need the um {disfmarker} i think we can just design the channels ? i mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much , project manager: s user interface: yeah . project manager: huh . industrial designer: mm-hmm . user interface: yeah . marketing: s and it's usually that red user interface: yeah . marketing: and i think it's quite nice to keep it like red . user interface: yeah . project manager: you know , i've seen some remotes that {disfmarker} where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . so you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just {disfmarker} marketing: oh okay , yeah . user interface: it seems like that would be hard though . project manager: but {disfmarker} user interface: i mean , like because unless you know {disfmarker} project manager: it might be confusing . yeah . user interface: yeah . just 'cause i wouldn't {disfmarker} i would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . {vocalsound} project manager: yeah . besides you like to be able to go power . industrial designer: yeah , i never think to hold something down . {vocalsound} marketing: yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} i have the power {vocalsound} user interface: yeah . b {vocalsound} yeah . project manager: i guess . so we definitely want a power button and numbers . right . user interface: yeah . marketing: well even um ipod thing {vocalsound} {voc", "summary": " marketing gave a presentation in the first place based on research and came up with ideas like what their remote control should look like, buttons design, whether the new product should have colour, size, shape, etc. user interface then gave a presentation on the technical functions design including basic functions and location function. after that, the team discussed the working design of the remote control.

grad c: um , well , i 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . so we currently have one base station with six wireless mike , possibility of six wireless receivers , and apparently you can chain those together . and so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes . professor e: so , um . grad c: and {disfmarker} so , you know it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six . professor e: so let 's see we {disfmarker} grad c: right ? so we could have up to nine . professor e: and right now we can have up to six . grad c: right . and we have five , we 're getting one more . professor e: yeah . grad c: and it 's um , about nine hundred dollars for the base station , and then eight hundred per channel . professor e: oh . so yeah so the only {disfmarker} beyond the mike {disfmarker} the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars . grad c: right . professor e: oh , we should do it . grad c: ok . ok , so i 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and {disfmarker} and then just go ahead and order them . professor e: yeah . yeah . phd b: i don't quite understand how that {disfmarker} how that works , . if {disfmarker} so we 're not increasing the number of channels . ok . grad c: no , we 're just replacing the wired {disfmarker} the two wired that are still working , phd b: ok . i see . grad c: along with a couple of the wired that aren't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless . professor e: yeah . phd b: three wireds work , professor e: basically we found {disfmarker} phd b: right ? grad c: i {disfmarker} i guess three wireds work , yeah . phd b: yeah . yeah . professor e: yeah . but we 've had more problems with that . grad c: yep . professor e: and that sort of bypasses the whole {disfmarker} the whole jimbox thing and all that . grad c: right . professor e: and so um , we {disfmarker} we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra sony radio mikes , as long as we 're conscious about the batteries . grad c: right . professor e: that seems to be the key issue . grad c: everyone 's battery ok ? phd b: i checked them this morning , they should be . grad c: ok . professor e: yeah . um , {vocalsound} that 's the only thing with them . but the quality seems really good and {disfmarker} um i heard from uw that they 're {disfmarker} they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased . they 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf . grad c: well we should talk to them about it because i know that sri is also in the process of looking at stuff , and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone {disfmarker} on the same page with that . professor e: yeah . phd b: sri , really ? grad c: yeah . phd b: oh . grad c: they got sa apparent well , maybe {pause} this needs to be bleeped out ? i have no clue . professor e: uh , i don't know . grad c: i don't know how much of it 's public . professor e: probably we shouldn't {disfmarker} probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff . grad c: right . professor e: yeah . but anyway there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker} and nist and uw . so . um . but {disfmarker} but yeah i thin i think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is {disfmarker} is quite positive with the sony , grad c: right . professor e: uh , radio - mikes . now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something , right ? grad c: uh , no , we 're having the {disfmarker} them do it . professor e: no ? grad c: so it 's so hand - soldering it , but i 'm not doing it . professor e: oh . grad c: so , they {disfmarker} they charge professor e: ok . nothing against you and your hand - soldering grad c: right . professor e: but {disfmarker} grad c: you 've never seen my hand - soldering . but uh , a as i said they 're coming in . professor e: uh , ok , so that 's being done professionally and {disfmarker} grad c: i {disfmarker} i mean {disfmarker} professor e: yeah . grad c: yeah . i mean . professor e: yeah . grad c: as professionally as i guess you can get it done . professor e: well , it could {disfmarker} if they do a lot of it , it 's {disfmarker} grad c: i mean i it 's just their repair shop . right ? their maintenance people . professor e: well , we 'll see what it {disfmarker} it 's like . grad c: yep . professor e: that {disfmarker} tha that can be quite good . th - this {disfmarker} yeah , ok . good . yeah . so let 's go with that . grad c: and , i mean we 'll see , tomorrow , you know , what it looks like . professor e: uh , yeah . so , um , uh , dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits . uh , so he 'll be interested in what 's going on with that . i guess {disfmarker} was {disfmarker} the decision last time was that the {disfmarker} the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ? has that started , or is that {disfmarker} ? postdoc f: mm - hmm . yeah . uh , it would be to use his interface and i was going to meet with him today about that . grad c: right , so , the decision was that jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork . so i did the {disfmarker} all that last week . so all the {disfmarker} all the forms are now {pause} on the computer . and uh , then i have a bunch of scripts that we 'll read those and let the uh {pause} transcribers use different tools . and i just want to talk to jane about how we transition to using those . postdoc f: mm - hmm . so he has a nice set up that they {disfmarker} it w it will be efficient for them to do that . professor e: ok . grad c: i {disfmarker} i don't think it 'll take too long . professor e: so anyway {disfmarker} grad c: so , you know , just uh , a matter of a few days i suspect . professor e: so anyway i think we {disfmarker} we have at least one uh , user for the digits once they get done , which will be dave . grad c: right . i 've already done five or six {pause} sets . postdoc f: ok . grad c: so if he wanted to , you know , just have a few to start with , he could . you know , and i also have a bunch of scripts that will , like , generate p - files and run recognition on them also . professor e: yeah , he might {disfmarker} he might be asking {disfmarker} right . ok . uh , is dave {disfmarker} i don't know if dave is on the list , if he 's invited to these meetings , uh if he knows . postdoc f: i don't tend to get an invitation myself for them even . phd a: no , no . grad c: uh , we don't have a active one but i 'll make sure he 's on the list . postdoc f: yeah . should we call him ? i mean is he {disfmarker} d is he definitely not available today ? professor e: i don't know . postdoc f: should i call his office and see ? phd a: he was in . grad c: i mean , he 's still taking classes , so uh , he may well have conflicts . professor e: uh , well i it 's uh {disfmarker} phd a: yeah . professor e: yeah . phd a: yeah , he was in {pause} s postdoc f: he wasn't there at cof professor e: yeah , so this might be a conflict for him . phd a: yeah . professor e: yeah . postdoc f: ok . professor e: ok . uh , so . grad c: yeah didn't he say his signal - processing class was like {pause} tuesdays and thursdays ? phd a: i think he has a class . yeah . phd b: yeah . he might have . grad c: oh well , whatever . grad d: you talking about david gelbart ? professor e: oh , ok . phd a: yeah . phd b: yeah . grad c: yeah . professor e: yeah . postdoc f: yes . grad d: yeah , i think he 's taking two twenty - five a which is now . phd b: yeah . grad d: so . professor e: yeah . postdoc f: ok . professor e: ok . so , that 's why we 're not seeing him . ok . uh , transcriptions , uh , beyond the digits , where we are , and so on . postdoc f: ok . professor e: and the {disfmarker} and the recordings also , postdoc f: um {disfmarker} professor e: just where we are . yeah . postdoc f: well , so um , should we {disfmarker} we don't wan wanna do the recording status first , or {disfmarker} ? grad c: well , we have about thirty - two hours uh as of , i guess a week and a half ago , so we probably now have about thirty - five hours . professor e: and {disfmarker} and that 's {disfmarker} that 's uh {disfmarker} how much of that is digits ? it 's uh {disfmarker} that 's including digits , grad c: that 's including digits . professor e: right ? grad c: i haven't separated it out so i have no clue how much of that is digits . professor e: so {disfmarker} yeah . so anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours , or something of {disfmarker} there 's got to be more than thirty hour {disfmarker} phd a: mmm . grad c: of {disfmarker} of non - digits ? professor e: i it couldn't {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of non - digits . grad c: yeah , absolutely . i mean , the digits don't take up that much time . professor e: yeah , yeah . ok . postdoc f: ok , and the transcribers h i , uh , don't have the exact numbers , but i {pause} think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh , transcribing from them right now . the next step is to {disfmarker} that i 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized . what i mean by clean is that they 're spell - checked , that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout , and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh , liz requested in terms of um , um {pause} in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which i hadn't been specific about . um , for example , i they 'll say uh \" ninety - two \" . and you know , so how {disfmarker} you could {disfmarker} grad c: nine two , postdoc f: e exactly . grad c: right . postdoc f: so if you just say \" nine two \" , the {disfmarker} there are many s ways that could have been expressed . an - and i just had them {disfmarker} i {disfmarker} i mean , a certain number of them did put the words down , but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , um , a gloss th and things . phd b: you know , jane ? grad c: mm - hmm . phd b:"], "document": " what were the topics talked about in the meeting? professor e: alright . grad c: so are you {disfmarker} professor e: so . grad c: are we going ? professor e: it is uh , must be february fifteenth . postdoc f: yeah . grad c: yu i think the date 's written in there , yep . and actually if everyone could cross out the r - nine next to \" session \" , and write mr eleven . professor e: yeah . yeah . we didn't have a front - end meeting today . grad c: and let 's remember also to make sure that one 's {comment} gets marked as unread , unused . professor e: ok . phd a: mr eleven . grad c: mr eleven . postdoc f: that sounds like a spy code . professor e: mmm . ok . so . grad c: there 's lots of clicking i 'm sure as i 'm trying to get this to work {pause} correctly . professor e: agenda . any agenda items today ? grad c: i wanna talk a little bit about getting {disfmarker} how we 're gonna to get people to edit bleeps , parts of the meeting that they don't want to include . what i 've done so far , and i wanna get some opinions on , how to {disfmarker} how to finish it up . professor e: ok . postdoc f: i wanna ask about um , some aud audio monitoring on some of the {pause} um {pause} well some of the equipment . in particular , the {disfmarker} well uh , that 's just what i wanna ask . professor e: ok audio monitoring , jane . postdoc f: ba - based on some of the tran uh {disfmarker} i in listening to {pause} some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things , and in pact {disfmarker} in fact this one i 'm talking on is one of {disfmarker} of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings , grad c: oh really . postdoc f: so i {disfmarker} phd b: \" spikes \" , you mean like uh , instantaneous click type spikes , or {disfmarker} ? postdoc f: mm - hmm . yeah . phd a: spikes ? grad c: clicks . postdoc f: yeah . professor e: hmm . postdoc f: yeah . phd b: huh . postdoc f: and i don't know what the e electronics is but . grad c: yeah . postdoc f: yeah . grad c: well , i think it 's phd a: touching . grad c: uh , it {disfmarker} it could be a number of things . phd a: yeah . grad c: it could be touching and fiddling , and the other thing is that it could {disfmarker} the fact that it 's on a wired mike is suspicious . it might be a connector . postdoc f: oh , ok . well maybe {disfmarker} then we don't really have to talk about that as an {disfmarker} phd b: you could try an experiment and say \" ok , i 'm about to test for spikes \" , postdoc f: i {disfmarker} i take that off the agenda . phd b: and then wiggle the thing there , and then go and when they go to transcribe it , it could , ask them to come and get you . grad c: yeah . right . phd b: \" come get me when you transcribe this and see if there 's spikes . \" postdoc f: oh that {disfmarker} professor e: um . postdoc f: well , ok . phd b: no i 'm just {disfmarker} professor e: i mean , were this a professional audio recording , {vocalsound} what we would do {disfmarker} {comment} what you would do is {disfmarker} in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that things are not giving that kind of performance . and if they are , then they can't be used . grad c: right . professor e: so . um . let 's see . i guess {pause} i would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh , recording , transcription you know , basically you know where we are on the corpus . postdoc f: good . professor e: and then um , the other thing which i would like to talk about which is a real meta - quest , i think , deal is , uh , agendas . so maybe i 'll {disfmarker} i 'll start with that actually . uh , um . {vocalsound} andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know , if possible , what we were gonna be talking about because he 's sort of peripherally involved to this point , and if there 's gonna be a topic about {disfmarker} discussion about something that he uh strongly cares about then he would come and {disfmarker} and i think part of {disfmarker} part of his motivation with this is that he 's trying to help us out , in the {disfmarker} because of uh the fact that the meetings are {disfmarker} are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up and so , he figures he could help that out by not showing {disfmarker} grad c: mmm . professor e: and {disfmarker} and i 'm sure help out his own time . by not showing up if it 's a meeting that he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} so , uh in order {disfmarker} i 'd {disfmarker} i think that this is a wish on his part . uh . it 's actually gonna be hard because it seems like a lot of times uh things come up that are unanticipated and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} grad c: right . professor e: but um , we could try anyway , uh , do another try at coming up with the agenda uh , at some point before the meeting , uh , say the day before . grad c: well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to {pause} like on wednesday , or tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items . phd a: yeah . professor e: ok . you {disfmarker} you wanna volunteer to do that ? grad c: sure . professor e: ok . alright so we 'll send out agenda request . grad c: let me professor e: uh . phd b: that 'll be {disfmarker} i think that 'll help {disfmarker} grad c: i 'll put that on my spare brain or it will not {pause} get done . phd b: that 'll help a lot , actually . professor e: yeah , i have to tell you for the uh {disfmarker} for the admin meeting that we have , lila does that um every time before an admin meeting . and uh , she ends up getting the agenda requests uh , uh ten minutes before the meeting . but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} {comment} but . uh . {comment} but we can try . maybe it 'll work . phd b: mmm . grad c: yeah . maybe . weirder things have happened . professor e: yeah . postdoc f: i 'm wondering if he were to just , uh , specify particular topics , i mean . maybe we 'd be able to meet that request of his a little more . phd b: i would {disfmarker} i would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him . grad c: well then {disfmarker} professor e: yeah . actually it {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} this maybe brings up another topic which is um {disfmarker} so we 're done with that topic . the other topic i was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that . grad c: yeah , actually i {disfmarker} i was going to say we need to {pause} talk about that too . professor e: yeah . why {disfmarker} why don't we do that . grad c: ok . um , the new microphones , the two new ones are in . um . {pause} and they are being assembled as we speak , i hope . and i didn't bring my car today so i 'm gonna pick them up tomorrow . um , and then the other question i was thinking about is {disfmarker} well , a couple things . first of all , if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable , we should probably just go ahead and get them . so we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in , phd a: grad c: and get people 's opinions on {disfmarker} on what they think of them . um , then the other question i had is maybe we should get another wireless . another wireless setup . i mean it 's expensive , but it does seem to be {pause} better than the wired . professor e: so how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ? grad c: um , well , i 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . so we currently have one base station with six wireless mike , possibility of six wireless receivers , and apparently you can chain those together . and so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes . professor e: so , um . grad c: and {disfmarker} so , you know it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six . professor e: so let 's see we {disfmarker} grad c: right ? so we could have up to nine . professor e: and right now we can have up to six . grad c: right . and we have five , we 're getting one more . professor e: yeah . grad c: and it 's um , about nine hundred dollars for the base station , and then eight hundred per channel . professor e: oh . so yeah so the only {disfmarker} beyond the mike {disfmarker} the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars . grad c: right . professor e: oh , we should do it . grad c: ok . ok , so i 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and {disfmarker} and then just go ahead and order them . professor e: yeah . yeah . phd b: i don't quite understand how that {disfmarker} how that works , . if {disfmarker} so we 're not increasing the number of channels . ok . grad c: no , we 're just replacing the wired {disfmarker} the two wired that are still working , phd b: ok . i see . grad c: along with a couple of the wired that aren't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless . professor e: yeah . phd b: three wireds work , professor e: basically we found {disfmarker} phd b: right ? grad c: i {disfmarker} i guess three wireds work , yeah . phd b: yeah . yeah . professor e: yeah . but we 've had more problems with that . grad c: yep . professor e: and that sort of bypasses the whole {disfmarker} the whole jimbox thing and all that . grad c: right . professor e: and so um , we {disfmarker} we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra sony radio mikes , as long as we 're conscious about the batteries . grad c: right . professor e: that seems to be the key issue . grad c: everyone 's battery ok ? phd b: i checked them this morning , they should be . grad c: ok . professor e: yeah . um , {vocalsound} that 's the only thing with them . but the quality seems really good and {disfmarker} um i heard from uw that they 're {disfmarker} they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased . they 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf . grad c: well we should talk to them about it because i know that sri is also in the process of looking at stuff , and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone {disfmarker} on the same page with that . professor e: yeah . phd b: sri , really ? grad c: yeah . phd b: oh . grad c: they got sa apparent well , maybe {pause} this needs to be bleeped out ? i have no clue . professor e: uh , i don't know . grad c: i don't know how much of it 's public . professor e: probably we shouldn't {disfmarker} probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff . grad c: right . professor e: yeah . but anyway there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker} and nist and uw . so . um . but {disfmarker} but yeah i thin i think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is {disfmarker} is quite positive with the sony , grad c: right . professor e: uh , radio - mikes . now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something , right ?

their maintenance people . professor e: well , we 'll see what it {disfmarker} it 's like . grad c: yep . professor e: that {disfmarker} tha that can be quite good . th - this {disfmarker} yeah , ok . good . yeah . so let 's go with that . grad c: and , i mean we 'll see , tomorrow , you know , what it looks like . professor e: uh , yeah . so , um , uh , dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits . uh , so he 'll be interested in what 's going on with that . i guess {disfmarker} was {disfmarker} the decision last time was that the {disfmarker} the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ?

postdoc f: mm - hmm . yeah . phd a: spikes ? grad c: clicks . postdoc f: yeah . professor e: hmm . postdoc f: yeah . phd b: huh . postdoc f: and i don't know what the e electronics is but . grad c: yeah . postdoc f: yeah . grad c: well , i think it 's phd a: touching . grad c: uh , it {disfmarker} it could be a number of things . phd a: yeah . grad c: it could be touching and fiddling , and the other thing is that it could {disfmarker} the fact that it 's on a wired mike is suspicious . it might be a connector . postdoc f: oh , ok . well maybe {disfmarker} then we don't really have to talk about that as an {disfmarker} phd b: you could try an experiment and say \" ok , i 'm about to test for spikes \" , postdoc f: i {disfmarker} i take that off the agenda . phd b: and then wiggle the thing there , and then go and when they go to transcribe it , it could , ask them to come and get you . grad c: yeah . right . phd b: \" come get me when you transcribe this and see if there 's spikes . \" postdoc f: oh that {disfmarker} professor e: um . postdoc f: well , ok . phd b: no i 'm just {disfmarker} professor e: i mean , were this a professional audio recording , {vocalsound} what we would do {disfmarker} {comment} what you would do is {disfmarker} in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that things are not giving that kind of performance . and if they are , then they can't be used . grad c: right . professor e: so . um . let 's see . i guess {pause} i would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh , recording , transcription you know , basically you know where we are on the corpus . postdoc f: good . professor e: and then um , the other thing which i would like to talk about which is a real meta - quest , i think , deal is , uh , agendas . so maybe i 'll {disfmarker} i 'll start with that actually . uh , um . {vocalsound} andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know , if possible , what we were gonna be talking about because he 's sort of peripherally involved to this point , and if there 's gonna be a topic about {disfmarker} discussion about something that he uh strongly cares about then he would come and {disfmarker} and i think part of {disfmarker} part of his motivation with this is that he 's trying to help us out , in the {disfmarker} because of uh the fact that the meetings are {disfmarker} are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up and so , he figures he could help that out by not showing {disfmarker} grad c: mmm . professor e: and {disfmarker} and i 'm sure help out his own time . by not showing up if it 's a meeting that he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} so , uh in order {disfmarker} i 'd {disfmarker} i think that this is a wish on his part . uh . it 's actually gonna be hard because it seems like a lot of times uh things come up that are unanticipated and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} grad c: right . professor e: but um , we could try anyway , uh , do another try at coming up with the agenda uh , at some point before the meeting , uh , say the day before . grad c: well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to {pause} like on wednesday , or tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items . phd a: yeah . professor e: ok . you {disfmarker} you wanna volunteer to do that ? grad c: sure . professor e: ok . alright so we 'll send out agenda request . grad c: let me professor e: uh . phd b: that 'll be {disfmarker} i think that 'll help {disfmarker} grad c: i 'll put that on my spare brain or it will not {pause} get done . phd b: that 'll help a lot , actually . professor e: yeah , i have to tell you for the uh {disfmarker} for the admin meeting that we have , lila does that um every time before an admin meeting . and uh , she ends up getting the agenda requests uh , uh ten minutes before the meeting . but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} {comment} but . uh . {comment} but we can try . maybe it 'll work . phd b: mmm . grad c: yeah . maybe . weirder things have happened . professor e: yeah . postdoc f: i 'm wondering if he were to just , uh , specify particular topics , i mean . maybe we 'd be able to meet that request of his a little more . phd b: i would {disfmarker} i would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him . grad c: well then {disfmarker} professor e: yeah . actually it {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} this maybe brings up another topic which is um {disfmarker} so we 're done with that topic . the other topic i was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that . grad c: yeah , actually i {disfmarker} i was going to say we need to {pause} talk about that too . professor e: yeah . why {disfmarker} why don't we do that . grad c: ok . um , the new microphones , the two new ones are in . um . {pause} and they are being assembled as we speak , i hope . and i didn't bring my car today so i 'm gonna pick them up tomorrow . um , and then the other question i was thinking about is {disfmarker} well , a couple things . first of all , if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable , we should probably just go ahead and get them . so we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in , phd a: grad c: and get people 's opinions on {disfmarker} on what they think of them . um , then the other question i had is maybe we should get another wireless . another wireless setup . i mean it 's expensive , but it does seem to be {pause} better than the wired . professor e: so how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ? grad c: um , well , i 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . so we currently have one base station with six wireless mike , possibility of six wireless receivers , and apparently you can chain those together . and so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes . professor e: so , um . grad c: and {disfmarker} so , you know it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six . professor e: so let 's see we {disfmarker} grad c: right ? so we could have up to nine . professor e: and right now we can have up to six . grad c: right . and we have five , we 're getting one more . professor e: yeah . grad c: and it 's um , about nine hundred dollars for the base station , and then eight hundred per channel . professor e: oh . so yeah so the only {disfmarker} beyond the mike {disfmarker} the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars . grad c: right . professor e: oh , we should do it . grad c: ok . ok , so i 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and {disfmarker} and then just go ahead and order them . professor e: yeah . yeah . phd b: i don't quite understand how that {disfmarker} how that works , . if {disfmarker} so we 're not increasing the number of channels . ok . grad c: no , we 're just replacing the wired {disfmarker} the two wired that are still working , phd b: ok . i see . grad c: along with a couple of the wired that aren't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless . professor e: yeah . phd b: three wireds work , professor e: basically we found {disfmarker} phd b: right ? grad c: i {disfmarker} i guess three wireds work , yeah . phd b: yeah . yeah . professor e: yeah . but we 've had more problems with that . grad c: yep . professor e: and that sort of bypasses the whole {disfmarker} the whole jimbox thing and all that . grad c: right . professor e: and so um , we {disfmarker} we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra sony radio mikes , as long as we 're conscious about the batteries . grad c: right . professor e: that seems to be the key issue . grad c: everyone 's battery ok ? phd b: i checked them this morning , they should be . grad c: ok . professor e: yeah . um , {vocalsound} that 's the only thing with them . but the quality seems really good and {disfmarker} um i heard from uw that they 're {disfmarker} they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased . they 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf . grad c: well we should talk to them about it because i know that sri is also in the process of looking at stuff , and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone {disfmarker} on the same page with that . professor e: yeah . phd b: sri , really ? grad c: yeah . phd b: oh . grad c: they got sa apparent well , maybe {pause} this needs to be bleeped out ? i have no clue . professor e: uh , i don't know . grad c: i don't know how much of it 's public . professor e: probably we shouldn't {disfmarker} probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff . grad c: right . professor e: yeah . but anyway there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker} and nist and uw . so . um . but {disfmarker} but yeah i thin i think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is {disfmarker} is quite positive with the sony , grad c: right . professor e: uh , radio - mikes . now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something , right ? grad c: uh , no , we 're having the {disfmarker} them do it . professor e: no ? grad c: so it 's so hand - soldering it , but i 'm not doing it . professor e: oh . grad c: so , they {disfmarker} they charge professor e: ok . nothing against you and your hand - soldering grad c: right . professor e: but {disfmarker} grad c: you 've never seen my hand - soldering . but uh , a as i said they 're coming in . professor e: uh , ok , so that 's being done professionally and {disfmarker} grad c: i {disfmarker} i mean {disfmarker} professor e: yeah . grad c: yeah . i mean . professor e: yeah . grad c: as professionally as i guess you can get it done . professor e: well , it could {disfmarker} if they do a lot of it , it 's {disfmarker} grad c: i mean i it 's just their repair shop . right ? their maintenance people . professor e: well , we 'll see what it {disfmarker} it 's like . grad c: yep . professor e: that {disfmarker} tha that can be quite good . th - this {disfmarker} yeah , ok . good . yeah . so let 's go with that . grad c: and , i mean we 'll see , tomorrow , you know , what it looks like . professor e: uh , yeah . so , um , uh , dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits . uh , so he 'll be interested in what 's going on with that . i guess {disfmarker} was {disfmarker} the decision last time was that the {disfmarker} the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ? has that started , or is that {disfmarker} ? postdoc f: mm - hmm . yeah . uh , it would be to use his interface and i was going to meet with him today about that . grad c: right , so , the decision was that jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork . so i did the {disfmarker} all that last week . so all the {disfmarker} all the forms are now {pause} on the computer . and uh , then i have a bunch of scripts that we 'll read those and let the uh {pause} transcribers use different tools . and i just want to talk to jane about how we transition to using those . postdoc f: mm - hmm . so he has a nice set up that they {disfmarker} it w it will be efficient for them to do that . professor e: ok . grad c: i {disfmarker} i don't think it 'll take too long . professor e: so anyway {disfmarker} grad c: so , you know , just uh , a matter of a few days i suspect . professor e: so anyway i think we {disfmarker} we have at least one uh , user for the digits once they get done , which will be dave . grad c: right . i 've already done five or six {pause} sets . postdoc f: ok . grad c: so if he wanted to , you know , just have a few to start with , he could . you know , and i also have a bunch of scripts that will , like , generate p - files and run recognition on them also . professor e: yeah , he might {disfmarker} he might be asking {disfmarker} right . ok . uh , is dave {disfmarker} i don't know if dave is on the list , if he 's invited to these meetings , uh if he knows . postdoc f: i don't tend to get an invitation myself for them even . phd a: no , no . grad c: uh , we don't have a active one but i 'll make sure he 's on the list . postdoc f: yeah . should we call him ? i mean is he {disfmarker} d is he definitely not available today ? professor e: i don't know . postdoc f: should i call his office and see ? phd a: he was in . grad c: i mean , he 's still taking classes , so uh , he may well have conflicts . professor e: uh , well i it 's uh {disfmarker} phd a: yeah . professor e: yeah . phd a: yeah , he was in {pause} s postdoc f: he wasn't there at cof professor e: yeah , so this might be a conflict for him . phd a: yeah . professor e: yeah . postdoc f: ok . professor e: ok . uh , so . grad c: yeah didn't he say his signal - processing class was like {pause} tuesdays and thursdays ? phd a: i think he has a class . yeah . phd b: yeah . he might have . grad c: oh well , whatever . grad d: you talking about david gelbart ? professor e: oh , ok . phd a: yeah . phd b: yeah . grad c: yeah . professor e: yeah . postdoc f: yes . grad d: yeah , i think he 's taking two twenty - five a which is now . phd b: yeah . grad d: so . professor e: yeah . postdoc f: ok . professor e: ok . so , that 's why we 're not seeing him . ok . uh , transcriptions , uh , beyond the digits , where we are , and so on . postdoc f: ok . professor e: and the {disfmarker} and the recordings also , postdoc f: um {disfmarker} professor e: just where we are . yeah . postdoc f: well , so um , should we {disfmarker} we don't wan wanna do the recording status first , or {disfmarker} ? grad c: well , we have about thirty - two hours uh as of , i guess a week and a half ago , so we probably now have about thirty - five hours . professor e: and {disfmarker} and that 's {disfmarker} that 's uh {disfmarker} how much of that is digits ? it 's uh {disfmarker} that 's including digits , grad c: that 's including digits . professor e: right ? grad c: i haven't separated it out so i have no clue how much of that is digits . professor e: so {disfmarker} yeah . so anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours , or something of {disfmarker} there 's got to be more than thirty hour {disfmarker} phd a: mmm . grad c: of {disfmarker} of non - digits ? professor e: i it couldn't {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of non - digits . grad c: yeah , absolutely . i mean , the digits don't take up that much time . professor e: yeah , yeah . ok . postdoc f: ok , and the transcribers h i , uh , don't have the exact numbers , but i {pause} think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh , transcribing from them right now . the next step is to {disfmarker} that i 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized . what i mean by clean is that they 're spell - checked , that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout , and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh , liz requested in terms of um , um {pause} in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which i hadn't been specific about . um , for example , i they 'll say uh \" ninety - two \" . and you know , so how {disfmarker} you could {disfmarker} grad c: nine two , postdoc f: e exactly . grad c: right . postdoc f: so if you just say \" nine two \" , the {disfmarker} there are many s ways that could have been expressed . an - and i just had them {disfmarker} i {disfmarker} i mean , a certain number of them did put the words down , but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , um , a gloss th and things . phd b: you know , jane ? grad c: mm - hmm . phd b:"], "document": " what were the topics talked about in the meeting? professor e: alright . grad c: so are you {disfmarker} professor e: so . grad c: are we going ? professor e: it is uh , must be february fifteenth . postdoc f: yeah . grad c: yu i think the date 's written in there , yep . and actually if everyone could cross out the r - nine next to \" session \" , and write mr eleven . professor e: yeah . yeah . we didn't have a front - end meeting today . grad c: and let 's remember also to make sure that one 's {comment} gets marked as unread , unused . professor e: ok . phd a: mr eleven . grad c: mr eleven . postdoc f: that sounds like a spy code . professor e: mmm . ok . so . grad c: there 's lots of clicking i 'm sure as i 'm trying to get this to work {pause} correctly . professor e: agenda . any agenda items today ? grad c: i wanna talk a little bit about getting {disfmarker} how we 're gonna to get people to edit bleeps , parts of the meeting that they don't want to include . what i 've done so far , and i wanna get some opinions on , how to {disfmarker} how to finish it up . professor e: ok . postdoc f: i wanna ask about um , some aud audio monitoring on some of the {pause} um {pause} well some of the equipment . in particular , the {disfmarker} well uh , that 's just what i wanna ask . professor e: ok audio monitoring , jane . postdoc f: ba - based on some of the tran uh {disfmarker} i in listening to {pause} some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things , and in pact {disfmarker} in fact this one i 'm talking on is one of {disfmarker} of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings , grad c: oh really . postdoc f: so i {disfmarker} phd b: \" spikes \" , you mean like uh , instantaneous click type spikes , or {disfmarker} ? postdoc f: mm - hmm . yeah . phd a: spikes ? grad c: clicks . postdoc f: yeah . professor e: hmm . postdoc f: yeah . phd b: huh . postdoc f: and i don't know what the e electronics is but . grad c: yeah . postdoc f: yeah . grad c: well , i think it 's phd a: touching . grad c: uh , it {disfmarker} it could be a number of things . phd a: yeah . grad c: it could be touching and fiddling , and the other thing is that it could {disfmarker} the fact that it 's on a wired mike is suspicious . it might be a connector . postdoc f: oh , ok . well maybe {disfmarker} then we don't really have to talk about that as an {disfmarker} phd b: you could try an experiment and say \" ok , i 'm about to test for spikes \" , postdoc f: i {disfmarker} i take that off the agenda . phd b: and then wiggle the thing there , and then go and when they go to transcribe it , it could , ask them to come and get you . grad c: yeah . right . phd b: \" come get me when you transcribe this and see if there 's spikes . \" postdoc f: oh that {disfmarker} professor e: um . postdoc f: well , ok . phd b: no i 'm just {disfmarker} professor e: i mean , were this a professional audio recording , {vocalsound} what we would do {disfmarker} {comment} what you would do is {disfmarker} in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that things are not giving that kind of performance . and if they are , then they can't be used . grad c: right . professor e: so . um . let 's see . i guess {pause} i would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh , recording , transcription you know , basically you know where we are on the corpus . postdoc f: good . professor e: and then um , the other thing which i would like to talk about which is a real meta - quest , i think , deal is , uh , agendas . so maybe i 'll {disfmarker} i 'll start with that actually . uh , um . {vocalsound} andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know , if possible , what we were gonna be talking about because he 's sort of peripherally involved to this point , and if there 's gonna be a topic about {disfmarker} discussion about something that he uh strongly cares about then he would come and {disfmarker} and i think part of {disfmarker} part of his motivation with this is that he 's trying to help us out , in the {disfmarker} because of uh the fact that the meetings are {disfmarker} are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up and so , he figures he could help that out by not showing {disfmarker} grad c: mmm . professor e: and {disfmarker} and i 'm sure help out his own time . by not showing up if it 's a meeting that he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} so , uh in order {disfmarker} i 'd {disfmarker} i think that this is a wish on his part . uh . it 's actually gonna be hard because it seems like a lot of times uh things come up that are unanticipated and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} grad c: right . professor e: but um , we could try anyway , uh , do another try at coming up with the agenda uh , at some point before the meeting , uh , say the day before . grad c: well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to {pause} like on wednesday , or tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items . phd a: yeah . professor e: ok . you {disfmarker} you wanna volunteer to do that ? grad c: sure . professor e: ok . alright so we 'll send out agenda request . grad c: let me professor e: uh . phd b: that 'll be {disfmarker} i think that 'll help {disfmarker} grad c: i 'll put that on my spare brain or it will not {pause} get done . phd b: that 'll help a lot , actually . professor e: yeah , i have to tell you for the uh {disfmarker} for the admin meeting that we have , lila does that um every time before an admin meeting . and uh , she ends up getting the agenda requests uh , uh ten minutes before the meeting . but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} {comment} but . uh . {comment} but we can try . maybe it 'll work . phd b: mmm . grad c: yeah . maybe . weirder things have happened . professor e: yeah . postdoc f: i 'm wondering if he were to just , uh , specify particular topics , i mean . maybe we 'd be able to meet that request of his a little more . phd b: i would {disfmarker} i would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him . grad c: well then {disfmarker} professor e: yeah . actually it {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} this maybe brings up another topic which is um {disfmarker} so we 're done with that topic . the other topic i was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that . grad c: yeah , actually i {disfmarker} i was going to say we need to {pause} talk about that too . professor e: yeah . why {disfmarker} why don't we do that . grad c: ok . um , the new microphones , the two new ones are in . um . {pause} and they are being assembled as we speak , i hope . and i didn't bring my car today so i 'm gonna pick them up tomorrow . um , and then the other question i was thinking about is {disfmarker} well , a couple things . first of all , if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable , we should probably just go ahead and get them . so we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in , phd a: grad c: and get people 's opinions on {disfmarker} on what they think of them . um , then the other question i had is maybe we should get another wireless . another wireless setup . i mean it 's expensive , but it does seem to be {pause} better than the wired . professor e: so how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ?

grad c: yeah . phd b: oh . grad c: they got sa apparent well , maybe {pause} this needs to be bleeped out ? i have no clue . professor e: uh , i don't know . grad c: i don't know how much of it 's public . professor e: probably we shouldn't {disfmarker} probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff . grad c: right . professor e: yeah . but anyway there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker} and nist and uw . so . um . but {disfmarker} but yeah i thin i think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is {disfmarker} is quite positive with the sony , grad c: right . professor e: uh , radio - mikes . now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something , right ?

their maintenance people . professor e: well , we 'll see what it {disfmarker} it 's like . grad c: yep . professor e: that {disfmarker} tha that can be quite good . th - this {disfmarker} yeah , ok . good . yeah . so let 's go with that . grad c: and , i mean we 'll see , tomorrow , you know , what it looks like . professor e: uh , yeah . so , um , uh , dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits . uh , so he 'll be interested in what 's going on with that . i guess {disfmarker} was {disfmarker} the decision last time was that the {disfmarker} the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ? has that started , or is that {disfmarker} ? postdoc f: mm - hmm . yeah . uh , it would be to use his interface and i was going to meet with him today about that . grad c: right , so , the decision was that jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork . so i did the {disfmarker} all that last week . so all the {disfmarker} all the forms are now {pause} on the computer . and uh , then i have a bunch of scripts that we 'll read those and let the uh {pause} transcribers use different tools . and i just want to talk to jane about how we transition to using those . postdoc f: mm - hmm . so he has a nice set up that they {disfmarker} it w it will be efficient for them to do that . professor e: ok . grad c: i {disfmarker} i don't think it 'll take too long . professor e: so anyway {disfmarker} grad c: so , you know , just uh , a matter of a few days i suspect . professor e: so anyway i think we {disfmarker} we have at least one uh , user for the digits once they get done , which will be dave . grad c: right . i 've already done five or six {pause} sets . postdoc f: ok . grad c: so if he wanted to , you know , just have a few to start with , he could . you know , and i also have a bunch of scripts that will , like , generate p - files and run recognition on them also . professor e: yeah , he might {disfmarker} he might be asking {disfmarker} right . ok . uh , is dave {disfmarker} i don't know if dave is on the list , if he 's invited to these meetings , uh if he knows . postdoc f: i don't tend to get an invitation myself for them even . phd a: no , no . grad c: uh , we don't have a active one but i 'll make sure he 's on the list . postdoc f: yeah . should we call him ? i mean is he {disfmarker} d is he definitely not available today ? professor e: i don't know . postdoc f: should i call his office and see ? phd a: he was in . grad c: i mean , he 's still taking classes , so uh , he may well have conflicts . professor e: uh , well i it 's uh {disfmarker} phd a: yeah . professor e: yeah . phd a: yeah , he was in {pause} s postdoc f: he wasn't there at cof professor e: yeah , so this might be a conflict for him . phd a: yeah . professor e: yeah . postdoc f: ok . professor e: ok . uh , so . grad c: yeah didn't he say his signal - processing class was like {pause} tuesdays and thursdays ? phd a: i think he has a class . yeah . phd b: yeah . he might have . grad c: oh well , whatever . grad d: you talking about david gelbart ? professor e: oh , ok . phd a: yeah . phd b: yeah . grad c: yeah . professor e: yeah . postdoc f: yes . grad d: yeah , i think he 's taking two twenty - five a which is now . phd b: yeah . grad d: so . professor e: yeah . postdoc f: ok . professor e: ok . so , that 's why we 're not seeing him . ok . uh , transcriptions , uh , beyond the digits , where we are , and so on . postdoc f: ok . professor e: and the {disfmarker} and the recordings also , postdoc f: um {disfmarker} professor e: just where we are . yeah . postdoc f: well , so um , should we {disfmarker} we don't wan wanna do the recording status first , or {disfmarker} ? grad c: well , we have about thirty - two hours uh as of , i guess a week and a half ago , so we probably now have about thirty - five hours . professor e: and {disfmarker} and that 's {disfmarker} that 's uh {disfmarker} how much of that is digits ? it 's uh {disfmarker} that 's including digits , grad c: that 's including digits . professor e: right ? grad c: i haven't separated it out so i have no clue how much of that is digits . professor e: so {disfmarker} yeah . so anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours , or something of {disfmarker} there 's got to be more than thirty hour {disfmarker} phd a: mmm . grad c: of {disfmarker} of non - digits ? professor e: i it couldn't {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of non - digits . grad c: yeah , absolutely . i mean , the digits don't take up that much time . professor e: yeah , yeah . ok . postdoc f: ok , and the transcribers h i , uh , don't have the exact numbers , but i {pause} think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh , transcribing from them right now . the next step is to {disfmarker} that i 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized . what i mean by clean is that they 're spell - checked , that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout , and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh , liz requested in terms of um , um {pause} in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which i hadn't been specific about . um , for example , i they 'll say uh \" ninety - two \" . and you know , so how {disfmarker} you could {disfmarker} grad c: nine two , postdoc f: e exactly . grad c: right . postdoc f: so if you just say \" nine two \" , the {disfmarker} there are many s ways that could have been expressed . an - and i just had them {disfmarker} i {disfmarker} i mean , a certain number of them did put the words down , but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , um , a gloss th and things . phd b: you know , jane ?

postdoc f: mm - hmm . yeah . phd a: spikes ? grad c: clicks . postdoc f: yeah . professor e: hmm . postdoc f: yeah . phd b: huh . postdoc f: and i don't know what the e electronics is but . grad c: yeah . postdoc f: yeah . grad c: well , i think it 's phd a: touching . grad c: uh , it {disfmarker} it could be a number of things . phd a: yeah . grad c: it could be touching and fiddling , and the other thing is that it could {disfmarker} the fact that it 's on a wired mike is suspicious . it might be a connector . postdoc f: oh , ok . well maybe {disfmarker} then we don't really have to talk about that as an {disfmarker} phd b: you could try an experiment and say \" ok , i 'm about to test for spikes \" , postdoc f: i {disfmarker} i take that off the agenda . phd b: and then wiggle the thing there , and then go and when they go to transcribe it , it could , ask them to come and get you . grad c: yeah . right . phd b: \" come get me when you transcribe this and see if there 's spikes . \" postdoc f: oh that {disfmarker} professor e: um . postdoc f: well , ok . phd b: no i 'm just {disfmarker} professor e: i mean , were this a professional audio recording , {vocalsound} what we would do {disfmarker} {comment} what you would do is {disfmarker} in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that things are not giving that kind of performance . and if they are , then they can't be used . grad c: right . professor e: so . um . let 's see . i guess {pause} i would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh , recording , transcription you know , basically you know where we are on the corpus . postdoc f: good . professor e: and then um , the other thing which i would like to talk about which is a real meta - quest , i think , deal is , uh , agendas . so maybe i 'll {disfmarker} i 'll start with that actually . uh , um . {vocalsound} andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know , if possible , what we were gonna be talking about because he 's sort of peripherally involved to this point , and if there 's gonna be a topic about {disfmarker} discussion about something that he uh strongly cares about then he would come and {disfmarker} and i think part of {disfmarker} part of his motivation with this is that he 's trying to help us out , in the {disfmarker} because of uh the fact that the meetings are {disfmarker} are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up and so , he figures he could help that out by not showing {disfmarker} grad c: mmm . professor e: and {disfmarker} and i 'm sure help out his own time . by not showing up if it 's a meeting that he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} so , uh in order {disfmarker} i 'd {disfmarker} i think that this is a wish on his part . uh . it 's actually gonna be hard because it seems like a lot of times uh things come up that are unanticipated and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} grad c: right . professor e: but um , we could try anyway , uh , do another try at coming up with the agenda uh , at some point before the meeting , uh , say the day before . grad c: well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to {pause} like on wednesday , or tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items . phd a: yeah . professor e: ok . you {disfmarker} you wanna volunteer to do that ? grad c: sure . professor e: ok . alright so we 'll send out agenda request . grad c: let me professor e: uh . phd b: that 'll be {disfmarker} i think that 'll help {disfmarker} grad c: i 'll put that on my spare brain or it will not {pause} get done . phd b: that 'll help a lot , actually . professor e: yeah , i have to tell you for the uh {disfmarker} for the admin meeting that we have , lila does that um every time before an admin meeting . and uh , she ends up getting the agenda requests uh , uh ten minutes before the meeting . but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} {comment} but . uh . {comment} but we can try . maybe it 'll work . phd b: mmm . grad c: yeah . maybe . weirder things have happened . professor e: yeah . postdoc f: i 'm wondering if he were to just , uh , specify particular topics , i mean . maybe we 'd be able to meet that request of his a little more . phd b: i would {disfmarker} i would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him . grad c: well then {disfmarker} professor e: yeah . actually it {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} this maybe brings up another topic which is um {disfmarker} so we 're done with that topic . the other topic i was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that . grad c: yeah , actually i {disfmarker} i was going to say we need to {pause} talk about that too . professor e: yeah . why {disfmarker} why don't we do that . grad c: ok . um , the new microphones , the two new ones are in . um . {pause} and they are being assembled as we speak , i hope . and i didn't bring my car today so i 'm gonna pick them up tomorrow . um , and then the other question i was thinking about is {disfmarker} well , a couple things . first of all , if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable , we should probably just go ahead and get them . so we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in , phd a: grad c: and get people 's opinions on {disfmarker} on what they think of them . um , then the other question i had is maybe we should get another wireless . another wireless setup . i mean it 's expensive , but it does seem to be {pause} better than the wired . professor e: so how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ? grad c: um , well , i 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . so we currently have one base station with six wireless mike , possibility of six wireless receivers , and apparently you can chain those together . and so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes . professor e: so , um . grad c: and {disfmarker} so , you know it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six . professor e: so let 's see we {disfmarker} grad c: right ? so we could have up to nine . professor e: and right now we can have up to six . grad c: right . and we have five , we 're getting one more . professor e: yeah . grad c: and it 's um , about nine hundred dollars for the base station , and then eight hundred per channel . professor e: oh . so yeah so the only {disfmarker} beyond the mike {disfmarker} the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars . grad c: right . professor e: oh , we should do it . grad c: ok . ok , so i 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and {disfmarker} and then just go ahead and order them . professor e: yeah . yeah . phd b: i don't quite understand how that {disfmarker} how that works , . if {disfmarker} so we 're not increasing the number of channels . ok . grad c: no , we 're just replacing the wired {disfmarker} the two wired that are still working , phd b: ok . i see . grad c: along with a couple of the wired that aren't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless . professor e: yeah . phd b: three wireds work , professor e: basically we found {disfmarker} phd b: right ? grad c: i {disfmarker} i guess three wireds work , yeah . phd b: yeah . yeah . professor e: yeah . but we 've had more problems with that . grad c: yep . professor e: and that sort of bypasses the whole {disfmarker} the whole jimbox thing and all that . grad c: right . professor e: and so um , we {disfmarker} we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra sony radio mikes , as long as we 're conscious about the batteries . grad c: right . professor e: that seems to be the key issue . grad c: everyone 's battery ok ? phd b: i checked them this morning , they should be . grad c: ok . professor e: yeah . um , {vocalsound} that 's the only thing with them . but the quality seems really good and {disfmarker} um i heard from uw that they 're {disfmarker} they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased . they 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf . grad c: well we should talk to them about it because i know that sri is also in the process of looking at stuff , and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone {disfmarker} on the same page with that . professor e: yeah . phd b: sri , really ? grad c: yeah . phd b: oh . grad c: they got sa apparent well , maybe {pause} this needs to be bleeped out ? i have no clue . professor e: uh , i don't know . grad c: i don't know how much of it 's public . professor e: probably we shouldn't {disfmarker} probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff . grad c: right . professor e: yeah . but anyway there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker} and nist and uw . so . um . but {disfmarker} but yeah i thin i think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is {disfmarker} is quite positive with the sony , grad c: right . professor e: uh , radio - mikes . now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something , right ? grad c: uh , no , we 're having the {disfmarker} them do it . professor e: no ? grad c: so it 's so hand - soldering it , but i 'm not doing it . professor e: oh . grad c: so , they {disfmarker} they charge professor e: ok . nothing against you and your hand - soldering grad c: right . professor e: but {disfmarker} grad c: you 've never seen my hand - soldering . but uh , a as i said they 're coming in . professor e: uh , ok , so that 's being done professionally and {disfmarker} grad c: i {disfmarker} i mean {disfmarker} professor e: yeah . grad c: yeah . i mean . professor e: yeah . grad c: as professionally as i guess you can get it done . professor e: well , it could {disfmarker} if they do a lot of it , it 's {disfmarker} grad c: i mean i it 's just their repair shop . right ? their maintenance people . professor e: well , we 'll see what it {disfmarker} it 's like . grad c: yep . professor e: that {disfmarker} tha that can be quite good . th - this {disfmarker} yeah , ok . good . yeah . so let 's go with that . grad c: and , i mean we 'll see , tomorrow , you know , what it looks like . professor e: uh , yeah . so , um , uh , dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits . uh , so he 'll be interested in what 's going on with that . i guess {disfmarker} was {disfmarker} the decision last time was that the {disfmarker} the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ? has that started , or is that {disfmarker} ? postdoc f: mm - hmm . yeah . uh , it would be to use his interface and i was going to meet with him today about that . grad c: right , so , the decision was that jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork . so i did the {disfmarker} all that last week . so all the {disfmarker} all the forms are now {pause} on the computer . and uh , then i have a bunch of scripts that we 'll read those and let the uh {pause} transcribers use different tools . and i just want to talk to jane about how we transition to using those . postdoc f: mm - hmm . so he has a nice set up that they {disfmarker} it w it will be efficient for them to do that . professor e: ok . grad c: i {disfmarker} i don't think it 'll take too long . professor e: so anyway {disfmarker} grad c: so , you know , just uh , a matter of a few days i suspect . professor e: so anyway i think we {disfmarker} we have at least one uh , user for the digits once they get done , which will be dave . grad c: right . i 've already done five or six {pause} sets . postdoc f: ok . grad c: so if he wanted to , you know , just have a few to start with , he could . you know , and i also have a bunch of scripts that will , like , generate p - files and run recognition on them also . professor e: yeah , he might {disfmarker} he might be asking {disfmarker} right . ok . uh , is dave {disfmarker} i don't know if dave is on the list , if he 's invited to these meetings , uh if he knows . postdoc f: i don't tend to get an invitation myself for them even . phd a: no , no . grad c: uh , we don't have a active one but i 'll make sure he 's on the list . postdoc f: yeah . should we call him ?

postdoc f: mm - hmm . yeah . phd a: spikes ? grad c: clicks . postdoc f: yeah . professor e: hmm . postdoc f: yeah . phd b: huh . postdoc f: and i don't know what the e electronics is but . grad c: yeah . postdoc f: yeah . grad c: well , i think it 's phd a: touching . grad c: uh , it {disfmarker} it could be a number of things . phd a: yeah . grad c: it could be touching and fiddling , and the other thing is that it could {disfmarker} the fact that it 's on a wired mike is suspicious . it might be a connector . postdoc f: oh , ok . well maybe {disfmarker} then we don't really have to talk about that as an {disfmarker} phd b: you could try an experiment and say \" ok , i 'm about to test for spikes \" , postdoc f: i {disfmarker} i take that off the agenda . phd b: and then wiggle the thing there , and then go and when they go to transcribe it , it could , ask them to come and get you . grad c: yeah . right . phd b: \" come get me when you transcribe this and see if there 's spikes . \" postdoc f: oh that {disfmarker} professor e: um . postdoc f: well , ok . phd b: no i 'm just {disfmarker} professor e: i mean , were this a professional audio recording , {vocalsound} what we would do {disfmarker} {comment} what you would do is {disfmarker} in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that things are not giving that kind of performance . and if they are , then they can't be used . grad c: right . professor e: so . um . let 's see . i guess {pause} i would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh , recording , transcription you know , basically you know where we are on the corpus . postdoc f: good . professor e: and then um , the other thing which i would like to talk about which is a real meta - quest , i think , deal is , uh , agendas . so maybe i 'll {disfmarker} i 'll start with that actually . uh , um . {vocalsound} andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know , if possible , what we were gonna be talking about because he 's sort of peripherally involved to this point , and if there 's gonna be a topic about {disfmarker} discussion about something that he uh strongly cares about then he would come and {disfmarker} and i think part of {disfmarker} part of his motivation with this is that he 's trying to help us out , in the {disfmarker} because of uh the fact that the meetings are {disfmarker} are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up and so , he figures he could help that out by not showing {disfmarker} grad c: mmm . professor e: and {disfmarker} and i 'm sure help out his own time . by not showing up if it 's a meeting that he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} so , uh in order {disfmarker} i 'd {disfmarker} i think that this is a wish on his part . uh . it 's actually gonna be hard because it seems like a lot of times uh things come up that are unanticipated and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} grad c: right . professor e: but um , we could try anyway , uh , do another try at coming up with the agenda uh , at some point before the meeting , uh , say the day before . grad c: well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to {pause} like on wednesday , or tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items . phd a: yeah . professor e: ok . you {disfmarker} you wanna volunteer to do that ? grad c: sure . professor e: ok . alright so we 'll send out agenda request . grad c: let me professor e: uh . phd b: that 'll be {disfmarker} i think that 'll help {disfmarker} grad c: i 'll put that on my spare brain or it will not {pause} get done . phd b: that 'll help a lot , actually . professor e: yeah , i have to tell you for the uh {disfmarker} for the admin meeting that we have , lila does that um every time before an admin meeting . and uh , she ends up getting the agenda requests uh , uh ten minutes before the meeting . but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} {comment} but . uh . {comment} but we can try . maybe it 'll work . phd b: mmm . grad c: yeah . maybe . weirder things have happened . professor e: yeah . postdoc f: i 'm wondering if he were to just , uh , specify particular topics , i mean . maybe we 'd be able to meet that request of his a little more . phd b: i would {disfmarker} i would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him . grad c: well then {disfmarker} professor e: yeah . actually it {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} this maybe brings up another topic which is um {disfmarker} so we 're done with that topic . the other topic i was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that . grad c: yeah , actually i {disfmarker} i was going to say we need to {pause} talk about that too . professor e: yeah . why {disfmarker} why don't we do that . grad c: ok . um , the new microphones , the two new ones are in . um . {pause} and they are being assembled as we speak , i hope . and i didn't bring my car today so i 'm gonna pick them up tomorrow . um , and then the other question i was thinking about is {disfmarker} well , a couple things . first of all , if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable , we should probably just go ahead and get them . so we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in , phd a: grad c: and get people 's opinions on {disfmarker} on what they think of them . um , then the other question i had is maybe we should get another wireless . another wireless setup . i mean it 's expensive , but it does seem to be {pause} better than the wired . professor e: so how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ? grad c: um , well , i 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . so we currently have one base station with six wireless mike , possibility of six wireless receivers , and apparently you can chain those together . and so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes . professor e: so , um . grad c: and {disfmarker} so , you know it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six . professor e: so let 's see we {disfmarker} grad c: right ? so we could have up to nine . professor e: and right now we can have up to six . grad c: right . and we have five , we 're getting one more . professor e: yeah . grad c: and it 's um , about nine hundred dollars for the base station , and then eight hundred per channel . professor e: oh . so yeah so the only {disfmarker} beyond the mike {disfmarker} the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars . grad c: right . professor e: oh , we should do it . grad c: ok . ok , so i 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and {disfmarker} and then just go ahead and order them . professor e: yeah . yeah . phd b: i don't quite understand how that {disfmarker} how that works , . if {disfmarker} so we 're not increasing the number of channels . ok . grad c: no , we 're just replacing the wired {disfmarker} the two wired that are still working , phd b: ok . i see . grad c: along with a couple of the wired that aren't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless . professor e: yeah . phd b: three wireds work , professor e: basically we found {disfmarker} phd b: right ? grad c: i {disfmarker} i guess three wireds work , yeah . phd b: yeah . yeah . professor e: yeah . but we 've had more problems with that . grad c: yep . professor e: and that sort of bypasses the whole {disfmarker} the whole jimbox thing and all that . grad c: right . professor e: and so um , we {disfmarker} we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra sony radio mikes , as long as we 're conscious about the batteries . grad c: right . professor e: that seems to be the key issue . grad c: everyone 's battery ok ? phd b: i checked them this morning , they should be . grad c: ok . professor e: yeah . um , {vocalsound} that 's the only thing with them . but the quality seems really good and {disfmarker} um i heard from uw that they 're {disfmarker} they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased . they 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf . grad c: well we should talk to them about it because i know that sri is also in the process of looking at stuff , and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone {disfmarker} on the same page with that . professor e: yeah . phd b: sri , really ? grad c: yeah . phd b: oh . grad c: they got sa apparent well , maybe {pause} this needs to be bleeped out ? i have no clue . professor e: uh , i don't know . grad c: i don't know how much of it 's public . professor e: probably we shouldn't {disfmarker} probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff . grad c: right . professor e: yeah . but anyway there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker} and nist and uw . so . um . but {disfmarker} but yeah i thin i think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is {disfmarker} is quite positive with the sony , grad c: right . professor e: uh , radio - mikes . now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something , right ? grad c: uh , no , we 're having the {disfmarker} them do it . professor e: no ? grad c: so it 's so hand - soldering it , but i 'm not doing it . professor e: oh . grad c: so , they {disfmarker} they charge professor e: ok . nothing against you and your hand - soldering grad c: right . professor e: but {disfmarker} grad c: you 've never seen my hand - soldering . but uh , a as i said they 're coming in . professor e: uh , ok , so that 's being done professionally and {disfmarker} grad c: i {disfmarker} i mean {disfmarker} professor e: yeah . grad c: yeah . i mean . professor e: yeah . grad c: as professionally as i guess you can get it done . professor e: well , it could {disfmarker} if they do a lot of it , it 's {disfmarker} grad c: i mean i it 's just their repair shop . right ? their maintenance people . professor e: well , we 'll see what it {disfmarker} it 's like . grad c: yep . professor e: that {disfmarker} tha that can be quite good . th - this {disfmarker} yeah , ok . good . yeah . so let 's go with that . grad c: and , i mean we 'll see , tomorrow , you know , what it looks like . professor e: uh , yeah . so , um , uh , dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits . uh , so he 'll be interested in what 's going on with that . i guess {disfmarker} was {disfmarker} the decision last time was that the {disfmarker} the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ? has that started , or is that {disfmarker} ? postdoc f: mm - hmm . yeah . uh , it would be to use his interface and i was going to meet with him today about that . grad c: right , so , the decision was that jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork . so i did the {disfmarker} all that last week . so all the {disfmarker} all the forms are now {pause} on the computer . and uh , then i have a bunch of scripts that we 'll read those and let the uh {pause} transcribers use different tools . and i just want to talk to jane about how we transition to using those . postdoc f: mm - hmm . so he has a nice set up that they {disfmarker} it w it will be efficient for them to do that . professor e: ok . grad c: i {disfmarker} i don't think it 'll take too long . professor e: so anyway {disfmarker} grad c: so , you know , just uh , a matter of a few days i suspect . professor e: so anyway i think we {disfmarker} we have at least one uh , user for the digits once they get done , which will be dave . grad c: right . i 've already done five or six {pause} sets . postdoc f: ok . grad c: so if he wanted to , you know , just have a few to start with , he could . you know , and i also have a bunch of scripts that will , like , generate p - files and run recognition on them also . professor e: yeah , he might {disfmarker} he might be asking {disfmarker} right . ok . uh , is dave {disfmarker} i don't know if dave is on the list , if he 's invited to these meetings , uh if he knows . postdoc f: i don't tend to get an invitation myself for them even . phd a: no , no . grad c: uh , we don't have a active one but i 'll make sure he 's on the list . postdoc f: yeah . should we call him ? i mean is he {disfmarker} d is he definitely not available today ? professor e: i don't know . postdoc f: should i call his office and see ? phd a: he was in . grad c: i mean , he 's still taking classes , so uh , he may well have conflicts . professor e: uh , well i it 's uh {disfmarker} phd a: yeah . professor e: yeah . phd a: yeah , he was in {pause} s postdoc f: he wasn't there at cof professor e: yeah , so this might be a conflict for him . phd a: yeah . professor e: yeah . postdoc f: ok . professor e: ok . uh , so . grad c: yeah didn't he say his signal - processing class was like {pause} tuesdays and thursdays ? phd a: i think he has a class . yeah . phd b: yeah . he might have . grad c: oh well , whatever . grad d: you talking about david gelbart ? professor e: oh , ok . phd a: yeah . phd b: yeah . grad c: yeah . professor e: yeah . postdoc f: yes . grad d: yeah , i think he 's taking two twenty - five a which is now . phd b: yeah . grad d: so . professor e: yeah . postdoc f: ok . professor e: ok . so , that 's why we 're not seeing him . ok . uh , transcriptions , uh , beyond the digits , where we are , and so on . postdoc f: ok . professor e: and the {disfmarker} and the recordings also , postdoc f: um {disfmarker} professor e: just where we are . yeah . postdoc f: well , so um , should we {disfmarker} we don't wan wanna do the recording status first , or {disfmarker} ? grad c: well , we have about thirty - two hours uh as of , i guess a week and a half ago , so we probably now have about thirty - five hours . professor e: and {disfmarker} and that 's {disfmarker} that 's uh {disfmarker} how much of that is digits ? it 's uh {disfmarker} that 's including digits , grad c: that 's including digits . professor e: right ? grad c: i haven't separated it out so i have no clue how much of that is digits . professor e: so {disfmarker} yeah . so anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours , or something of {disfmarker} there 's got to be more than thirty hour {disfmarker} phd a: mmm . grad c: of {disfmarker} of non - digits ? professor e: i it couldn't {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of non - digits . grad c: yeah , absolutely . i mean , the digits don't take up that much time . professor e: yeah , yeah . ok . postdoc f: ok , and the transcribers h i , uh , don't have the exact numbers , but i {pause} think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh , transcribing from them right now . the next step is to {disfmarker} that i 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized . what i mean by clean is that they 're spell - checked , that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout , and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh , liz requested in terms of um , um {pause} in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which i hadn't been specific about . um , for example , i they 'll say uh \" ninety - two \" . and you know , so how {disfmarker} you could {disfmarker} grad c: nine two , postdoc f: e exactly . grad c: right . postdoc f: so if you just say \" nine two \" , the {disfmarker} there are many s ways that could have been expressed . an - and i just had them {disfmarker} i {disfmarker} i mean , a certain number of them did put the words down , but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , um , a gloss th and things . phd b: you know , jane ?

{"id": NaN, "documents": [" summarize the discussion about unintended consequences. lynne neagle am: okay, thank you. we've got some questions now on the unintended consequences from si\u00e2n gwenllian. sian gwenllian am: yes, we've discussed some of these already, but, for example, under the new law, or the proposed law, would one unintended consequence be that, if someone living in wales who can't use the reasonable punishment defence\u2014would their life prospects be different compared to those people in england, who will be able to use that defence? i think you've mentioned that in your written evidence. barry hughes: yes. okay. a simple answer: if somebody in wales is convicted\u2014so, if it goes towards the end of the spectrum that is serious, which results in a prosecution\u2014. it may be\u2014the sort of circumstance i can see happening here is somebody who takes a principled stand and declines any form of out-of-court disposal and says, 'prosecute me'. we probably would end up prosecuting, because it's a relatively serious offence. so, let's say it comes to court and let's say they end up being convicted of assaulting their child\u2014in circumstances that would not have happened in england\u2014then they would have a criminal conviction they wouldn't have in england, and that, inevitably, has an impact upon their life prospects. but i think, along the road there, there would have been an element of choice. sian gwenllian am: okay. and do you think that that would be an isolated incident? barry hughes: yes, truly, i believe, an isolated incident. i've said before that i would be very surprised if we even had referrals that reached double figures on these cases. they're likely to be very limited. when the cps was asked to conduct a survey across all of england and wales\u2014this was the review in 2007\u2014it spanned just over a two-year period, and there were 12 cases that were brought up at that stage. now, i have to say, i don't think that's entirely reliable, but it is indicative. we had a freedom of information act request at one stage, which threw up something like three cases in a year. so, if you think about that as being all of england and wales\u2014and we make up about 5 per cent of the volume of criminal prosecutions nationally\u2014you can see why i might say the numbers are likely to be small, for the reasons we've explored about getting past the evidential stage into the public interest. sian gwenllian am: thank you for that. in terms of thinking about another kind of unintended consequence, in terms of managing performance and all of the targets that the police need to reach, are we perhaps going to see some people going through the criminal justice system in an inappropriate way and contrary to the interests of the child, because we need to reach some target in terms of performance measures? barry hughes: i have to say i think that extremely unlikely. in the cps, we don't have targets for securing convictions or not. clearly, we prosecute if we think that there's a reasonable prospect, a realistic prospect, of conviction and it's in the public interest, but we have no targets. and i would also say, because the numbers here are likely to be so small, any assertion of looking to meet targets\u2014it's a tiny, tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean. sian gwenllian am: what about\u2014? there is a target for unsolved crimes, or unsolved offences. what if they fall into that category? is that an unintended consequence? barry hughes: i'm talking about something i don't have great knowledge of here. there was, at one stage, a series of targets for the police that bore down upon cases that secure what was called a sanction detection, which counted for home office figures. that disappeared some years ago. some individual constabularies may still have targets, but, as far as i'm aware, we don't have a suite of national measures. the police are required to report against this, but we don't have targets. and, in my experience, the police are much more sensible these days than they may have been 20 years ago, in terms of trying to get cases charged in order to meet some notional target. it's much less of an issue than it ever was\u2014much. sian gwenllian am: okay. we've mentioned this, namely the risk of malicious reporting against parents involved in private family law cases. this happens now, of course. is that going to increase if we change the law? barry hughes: there is greater potential for it to increase. i think the numbers, again, will be tiny, and dwarfed by the number of cases where we have to deal with the fallout between a relationship breakdown between partners\u2014whether they be living within the same house or living in different houses. regrettably, there are times when children are used as part of this ongoing dispute. getting into the subtleties of the father, say, smacking the child in a way that was reasonable chastisement or was not reasonable chastisement is probably part of a much bigger piece here. i can see it potentially arising. it's not something that would cause me concern, simply because we already have a well-developed approach to dealing with the way in which we evaluate the evidence from parties who may well have a particular position that they want to reinforce, sometimes through exaggeration of basic facts and sometimes through fabrication. sian gwenllian am: are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law? barry hughes: no, i think we've had a pretty helpful canter through most of the circumstances here that might happen. and i can't think of anything else off the top of my head. sian gwenllian am: finally from me, therefore\u2014another issue, in a way\u2014the european convention on human rights. would not introducing the new law mean, at some point, that wales could get itself into difficulty because there is a breach of the human rights convention? and therefore england as well, at some point. barry hughes: right. how to approach that one? in the 2007 review to which we've referred already, the government, the then government, set out its position that it believes that section 58, in the way that it was drafted, is compliant with the european convention. there are various parties who would disagree with that, but that was the then government's position. if wales implements this legislation and it becomes part of the law, then, arguably, wales would be more in compliance with echr than not, and england would be less so. but nonetheless, at present, i haven't seen any demurral from the position that was expressed in 2007, which is that they consider that the position that's been adopted with section 58 is compliant with the legislation. it may well be tested by case law; that's the way it's likely to happen. some of the changes in this arena were driven by case law\u2014so, that case i referred to, regina v h, which was heard back in 2001 in the court of appeal, was significant in helping shape the direction of travel towards section 58. sian gwenllian am: and that case law not necessarily would have to happen within the uk\u2014that case law could come from other countries within the european union. barry hughes: it could, but i would be a foolish man if i were to say what impact european jurisprudence might have upon us. [laughter.] suzy davies am: [inaudible.]\u2014like common law jurisdictions would be. barry hughes: yes. at this point in time, that'd be a bit of a punt. lynne neagle am: yes. okay. thank you. janet. janet finch-saunders am: yes. suzy's touched on this mildly, but, in written evidence, you say that you do not consider that the costs of prosecuting cases made possible by the bill will be of great significance to the crown prosecution service, and you're basing that, from your evidence here today, on the low numbers of prosecutions. so, we've been asked by individuals, and we've had consultation responses from individuals, who've argued that there is no point creating legislation if people are not prosecuted for breaching it. what's your answer to that? barry hughes: there is a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences, and i think probably about\u2014. there are over\u2014. from memory\u2014please never hold me to this\u2014but, from memory, there are something like 10,000 criminal offences; we probably prosecute 5 per cent of those in any given year. there are some offences on the statute\u2014. i've been prosecuting for 32 years now; there are some offences that i've never come near and probably never will. but, nonetheless, the fact those offences exist sets out in terms what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. so, we have various defences to do with acts. i remember seeing some about antarctic stations and offences that might be committed there. well, they're not something that we do, but it sets out what's tolerant\u2014what's tolerable, sorry, and what isn't. so, the fact that we might not have many prosecutions is, for me, not a reason not to say that we shouldn't signify that certain behaviour is or is not acceptable. clearly, we don't wish to criminalise everything\u2014that would be a nonsense\u2014or to attempt to set the boundaries by almost micromanaging what individuals do and don't do. the criminal law provides a general framework within which to operate, which most people tend to understand. so, awareness is important and it comes back to that point. janet finch-saunders am: thank you. and then the explanatory memorandum says there is a shortage of registered intermediaries who assist child witnesses during police interview and when giving evidence in court. is this a potential barrier to implementing this proposed law, and are there any other potential barriers you want to raise? barry hughes: no. it's a potential barrier, but i don't think it is a barrier. there was a shortage of registered intermediaries in wales, and i know that the ministry of justice have taken action to deal with that, and we have had a number of people who are now in a position to act as intermediaries. now, of course, if they were to decide not to do that anymore, we may have a problem, but, in turn, we would be looking to recruit more people into those positions. so, yes, it has the potential to serve as a barrier, but in practice, i don't think it would be a barrier. i think, particularly given the very low numbers we're talking about, we would be able to manage it. i've got no significant concerns, i have to say. lynne neagle am: thank you. well, we've come to the end of our time. can i thank you for attending, the three of you, and for your answers, which have been fascinating and very clear and most helpful to the committee? you will be sent a transcript following the meeting to check for accuracy. thank you again for your time in coming here today. diolch yn fawr. barry hughes: thank you. it's been a pleasure. lynne neagle am: item 3, then, is papers to note. paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the business committee requesting an extension on the deadline for the bill, which has now been agreed. paper to note 2 is a letter from myself to the deputy minister for health and social services requesting some further information from cafcass cymru on the bill. paper to note 3 is a letter from myself to the minister for education regarding diamond reform implementation ahead of our scrutiny session on 4 july. are members happy to note those? item 4, then. can i propose in accordance with standing order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? are members content? thank you.

there is a target for unsolved crimes, or unsolved offences. what if they fall into that category? is that an unintended consequence? barry hughes: i'm talking about something i don't have great knowledge of here. there was, at one stage, a series of targets for the police that bore down upon cases that secure what was called a sanction detection, which counted for home office figures. that disappeared some years ago. some individual constabularies may still have targets, but, as far as i'm aware, we don't have a suite of national measures. the police are required to report against this, but we don't have targets. and, in my experience, the police are much more sensible these days than they may have been 20 years ago, in terms of trying to get cases charged in order to meet some notional target. it's much less of an issue than it ever was\u2014much. sian gwenllian am: okay. we've mentioned this, namely the risk of malicious reporting against parents involved in private family law cases. this happens now, of course. is that going to increase if we change the law? barry hughes: there is greater potential for it to increase. i think the numbers, again, will be tiny, and dwarfed by the number of cases where we have to deal with the fallout between a relationship breakdown between partners\u2014whether they be living within the same house or living in different houses. regrettably, there are times when children are used as part of this ongoing dispute. getting into the subtleties of the father, say, smacking the child in a way that was reasonable chastisement or was not reasonable chastisement is probably part of a much bigger piece here. i can see it potentially arising. it's not something that would cause me concern, simply because we already have a well-developed approach to dealing with the way in which we evaluate the evidence from parties who may well have a particular position that they want to reinforce, sometimes through exaggeration of basic facts and sometimes through fabrication. sian gwenllian am: are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law? barry hughes: no, i think we've had a pretty helpful canter through most of the circumstances here that might happen. and i can't think of anything else off the top of my head. sian gwenllian am: finally from me, therefore\u2014another issue, in a way\u2014the european convention on human rights. would not introducing the new law mean, at some point, that wales could get itself into difficulty because there is a breach of the human rights convention? and therefore england as well, at some point. barry hughes: right. how to approach that one? in the 2007 review to which we've referred already, the government, the then government, set out its position that it believes that section 58, in the way that it was drafted, is compliant with the european convention. there are various parties who would disagree with that, but that was the then government's position. if wales implements this legislation and it becomes part of the law, then, arguably, wales would be more in compliance with echr than not, and england would be less so. but nonetheless, at present, i haven't seen any demurral from the position that was expressed in 2007, which is that they consider that the position that's been adopted with section 58 is compliant with the legislation. it may well be tested by case law; that's the way it's likely to happen. some of the changes in this arena were driven by case law\u2014so, that case i referred to, regina v h, which was heard back in 2001 in the court of appeal, was significant in helping shape the direction of travel towards section 58. sian gwenllian am: and that case law not necessarily would have to happen within the uk\u2014that case law could come from other countries within the european union. barry hughes: it could, but i would be a foolish man if i were to say what impact european jurisprudence might have upon us. [laughter.] suzy davies am: [inaudible.]\u2014like common law jurisdictions would be. barry hughes: yes. at this point in time, that'd be a bit of a punt. lynne neagle am: yes. okay. thank you. janet. janet finch-saunders am: yes. suzy's touched on this mildly, but, in written evidence, you say that you do not consider that the costs of prosecuting cases made possible by the bill will be of great significance to the crown prosecution service, and you're basing that, from your evidence here today, on the low numbers of prosecutions. so, we've been asked by individuals, and we've had consultation responses from individuals, who've argued that there is no point creating legislation if people are not prosecuted for breaching it. what's your answer to that? barry hughes: there is a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences, and i think probably about\u2014. there are over\u2014. from memory\u2014please never hold me to this\u2014but, from memory, there are something like 10,000 criminal offences; we probably prosecute 5 per cent of those in any given year. there are some offences on the statute\u2014. i've been prosecuting for 32 years now; there are some offences that i've never come near and probably never will. but, nonetheless, the fact those offences exist sets out in terms what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. so, we have various defences to do with acts. i remember seeing some about antarctic stations and offences that might be committed there. well, they're not something that we do, but it sets out what's tolerant\u2014what's tolerable, sorry, and what isn't. so, the fact that we might not have many prosecutions is, for me, not a reason not to say that we shouldn't signify that certain behaviour is or is not acceptable. clearly, we don't wish to criminalise everything\u2014that would be a nonsense\u2014or to attempt to set the boundaries by almost micromanaging what individuals do and don't do. the criminal law provides a general framework within which to operate, which most people tend to understand. so, awareness is important and it comes back to that point. janet finch-saunders am: thank you. and then the explanatory memorandum says there is a shortage of registered intermediaries who assist child witnesses during police interview and when giving evidence in court. is this a potential barrier to implementing this proposed law, and are there any other potential barriers you want to raise? barry hughes: no. it's a potential barrier, but i don't think it is a barrier. there was a shortage of registered intermediaries in wales, and i know that the ministry of justice have taken action to deal with that, and we have had a number of people who are now in a position to act as intermediaries. now, of course, if they were to decide not to do that anymore, we may have a problem, but, in turn, we would be looking to recruit more people into those positions. so, yes, it has the potential to serve as a barrier, but in practice, i don't think it would be a barrier. i think, particularly given the very low numbers we're talking about, we would be able to manage it. i've got no significant concerns, i have to say. lynne neagle am: thank you. well, we've come to the end of our time. can i thank you for attending, the three of you, and for your answers, which have been fascinating and very clear and most helpful to the committee? you will be sent a transcript following the meeting to check for accuracy. thank you again for your time in coming here today. diolch yn fawr. barry hughes: thank you. it's been a pleasure. lynne neagle am: item 3, then, is papers to note. paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the business committee requesting an extension on the deadline for the bill, which has now been agreed. paper to note 2 is a letter from myself to the deputy minister for health and social services requesting some further information from cafcass cymru on the bill. paper to note 3 is a letter from myself to the minister for education regarding diamond reform implementation ahead of our scrutiny session on 4 july. are members happy to note those? item 4, then. can i propose in accordance with standing order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? are members content? thank you.

i think you've mentioned that in your written evidence. barry hughes: yes. okay. a simple answer: if somebody in wales is convicted\u2014so, if it goes towards the end of the spectrum that is serious, which results in a prosecution\u2014. it may be\u2014the sort of circumstance i can see happening here is somebody who takes a principled stand and declines any form of out-of-court disposal and says, 'prosecute me'. we probably would end up prosecuting, because it's a relatively serious offence. so, let's say it comes to court and let's say they end up being convicted of assaulting their child\u2014in circumstances that would not have happened in england\u2014then they would have a criminal conviction they wouldn't have in england, and that, inevitably, has an impact upon their life prospects. but i think, along the road there, there would have been an element of choice. sian gwenllian am: okay. and do you think that that would be an isolated incident?

i think you've mentioned that in your written evidence. barry hughes: yes. okay. a simple answer: if somebody in wales is convicted\u2014so, if it goes towards the end of the spectrum that is serious, which results in a prosecution\u2014. it may be\u2014the sort of circumstance i can see happening here is somebody who takes a principled stand and declines any form of out-of-court disposal and says, 'prosecute me'. we probably would end up prosecuting, because it's a relatively serious offence. so, let's say it comes to court and let's say they end up being convicted of assaulting their child\u2014in circumstances that would not have happened in england\u2014then they would have a criminal conviction they wouldn't have in england, and that, inevitably, has an impact upon their life prospects. but i think, along the road there, there would have been an element of choice. sian gwenllian am: okay. and do you think that that would be an isolated incident? barry hughes: yes, truly, i believe, an isolated incident. i've said before that i would be very surprised if we even had referrals that reached double figures on these cases. they're likely to be very limited. when the cps was asked to conduct a survey across all of england and wales\u2014this was the review in 2007\u2014it spanned just over a two-year period, and there were 12 cases that were brought up at that stage. now, i have to say, i don't think that's entirely reliable, but it is indicative. we had a freedom of information act request at one stage, which threw up something like three cases in a year. so, if you think about that as being all of england and wales\u2014and we make up about 5 per cent of the volume of criminal prosecutions nationally\u2014you can see why i might say the numbers are likely to be small, for the reasons we've explored about getting past the evidential stage into the public interest. sian gwenllian am: thank you for that. in terms of thinking about another kind of unintended consequence, in terms of managing performance and all of the targets that the police need to reach, are we perhaps going to see some people going through the criminal justice system in an inappropriate way and contrary to the interests of the child, because we need to reach some target in terms of performance measures? barry hughes: i have to say i think that extremely unlikely. in the cps, we don't have targets for securing convictions or not. clearly, we prosecute if we think that there's a reasonable prospect, a realistic prospect, of conviction and it's in the public interest, but we have no targets. and i would also say, because the numbers here are likely to be so small, any assertion of looking to meet targets\u2014it's a tiny, tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean. sian gwenllian am: what about\u2014? there is a target for unsolved crimes, or unsolved offences. what if they fall into that category? is that an unintended consequence? barry hughes: i'm talking about something i don't have great knowledge of here. there was, at one stage, a series of targets for the police that bore down upon cases that secure what was called a sanction detection, which counted for home office figures. that disappeared some years ago. some individual constabularies may still have targets, but, as far as i'm aware, we don't have a suite of national measures. the police are required to report against this, but we don't have targets. and, in my experience, the police are much more sensible these days than they may have been 20 years ago, in terms of trying to get cases charged in order to meet some notional target. it's much less of an issue than it ever was\u2014much. sian gwenllian am: okay. we've mentioned this, namely the risk of malicious reporting against parents involved in private family law cases. this happens now, of course. is that going to increase if we change the law? barry hughes: there is greater potential for it to increase. i think the numbers, again, will be tiny, and dwarfed by the number of cases where we have to deal with the fallout between a relationship breakdown between partners\u2014whether they be living within the same house or living in different houses. regrettably, there are times when children are used as part of this ongoing dispute. getting into the subtleties of the father, say, smacking the child in a way that was reasonable chastisement or was not reasonable chastisement is probably part of a much bigger piece here. i can see it potentially arising. it's not something that would cause me concern, simply because we already have a well-developed approach to dealing with the way in which we evaluate the evidence from parties who may well have a particular position that they want to reinforce, sometimes through exaggeration of basic facts and sometimes through fabrication. sian gwenllian am: are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law? barry hughes: no, i think we've had a pretty helpful canter through most of the circumstances here that might happen. and i can't think of anything else off the top of my head. sian gwenllian am: finally from me, therefore\u2014another issue, in a way\u2014the european convention on human rights. would not introducing the new law mean, at some point, that wales could get itself into difficulty because there is a breach of the human rights convention? and therefore england as well, at some point. barry hughes: right. how to approach that one? in the 2007 review to which we've referred already, the government, the then government, set out its position that it believes that section 58, in the way that it was drafted, is compliant with the european convention. there are various parties who would disagree with that, but that was the then government's position. if wales implements this legislation and it becomes part of the law, then, arguably, wales would be more in compliance with echr than not, and england would be less so. but nonetheless, at present, i haven't seen any demurral from the position that was expressed in 2007, which is that they consider that the position that's been adopted with section 58 is compliant with the legislation. it may well be tested by case law; that's the way it's likely to happen. some of the changes in this arena were driven by case law\u2014so, that case i referred to, regina v h, which was heard back in 2001 in the court of appeal, was significant in helping shape the direction of travel towards section 58. sian gwenllian am: and that case law not necessarily would have to happen within the uk\u2014that case law could come from other countries within the european union. barry hughes: it could, but i would be a foolish man if i were to say what impact european jurisprudence might have upon us.

{disfmarker} industrial designer: well , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our um {gap} . {vocalsound} there are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device . project

the buttons ? user interface: {vocalsound} plastic or rubber . industrial designer: {vocalsound} there are plastic or rubber . user interface: well , project manager: okay , user interface: yeah .

{vocalsound} but {disfmarker} marketing: well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button , industrial designer: yes , but it {disfmarker} marketing: 'cause you have to assign two channel {disfmarker} new channels . industrial designer: but these are tasks that are only executed once , i think . project manager: m uh yeah . industrial designer: or not ? project manager: m m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition . marketing: you {disfmarker} industrial designer: well okay . okay , yeah , that's right . or something li like that . user interface: and a button for disabling the voice recognition . project manager: yeah al although by pressing the button for i n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it {disfmarker} you'd disable it with a little beep and and {disfmarker} industrial designer: yes . user interface: yeah . project manager: but o okay , that that's not really really important . user interface: {vocalsound} that's the basic idea , yeah . of our prototype . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: the basic {disfmarker} okay . okay . um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ? marketing: yes . project manager: okay . marketing: uh my name is not name project manager: {vocalsound} you are nameless . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: but {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: uh well , i used the {gap} {disfmarker} the uh {gap} documents . and these uh were the most important criteria . industrial designer: {vocalsound} is it spongy ? {vocalsound} marketing: it should be . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . fancy look and feel . so {disfmarker} user interface: so just walk through it step by step . i mean , is it fancy , everything {disfmarker} i believe uh i believe it's fancy . {vocalsound} marketing: uh well appar industrial designer: i believe it's fancy too . marketing: yeah , but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet . project manager: no . user interface: oh , sorry . marketing: so {disfmarker} project manager: okay , so industrial designer: okay . project manager: this {disfmarker} these are the cr uh the criteria . marketing: yeah , i think these are the most important criteria . project manager: okay , well {disfmarker} marketing: so uh project manager: the then we'll switch to my presentation . um {disfmarker} marketing: that's about it . project manager: the production costs . the costs are not under {disfmarker} can i {disfmarker} {vocalsound} um this is the {disfmarker} user interface: twenty two . project manager: yeah , it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve euro fifty . user interface: yikes . project manager: and what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . so i guess we should skip that , industrial designer: well it's very expensive . project manager: because it's not that important . industrial designer: okay . user interface: why does the price and and the s oh , one uh exa project manager: yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum . user interface: yeah . the number of uh {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} okay . project manager: um well , this is what i would call our luxury model . um if you would {disfmarker} user interface: and and does it {disfmarker} project manager: if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um {vocalsound} to make it {vocalsound} just between the twelve euro fifty , um then i did the following changes . twelve euro forty cents i came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature , industrial designer: mm-hmm . project manager: because it's uh it's a four euro uh addition to the price . industrial designer: mm-hmm . project manager: um {disfmarker} yeah , i believe {disfmarker} uh , push-button , well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it makes it the thirteen {disfmarker} yeah . push-buttons are {disfmarker} buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost . industrial designer: hmm . project manager: so um {disfmarker} yeah , th this design is not um within our price model . industrial designer: okay . project manager: um {disfmarker} industrial designer: but i'm afraid it's not complete . because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . and you have not added one item there . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: so it's c way too expensive . project manager: it's still too expensive , yeah . um {disfmarker} user interface: but that's that's only for the buttons . project manager: i i guess if we leave the {disfmarker} if we leave this one out , um {disfmarker} user interface: so the button we can use plastic . project manager: oh . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: and uh maybe not use the special form . user interface: and the pla uh {disfmarker} and a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber . industrial designer: but it {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} it becomes a very dull remote control , i know . industrial designer: yes . project manager: but it's the board decision . um {disfmarker} and um {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: well , b basically it {vocalsound} {disfmarker} when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because i think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions . project manager: yeah . yeah , i know . maybe we should look at an {disfmarker} uh focus on another uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: so {disfmarker} type of m maybe another market segment . project manager: yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic industrial designer: yeah . project manager: and uh m maximise the profits industrial designer: yes . project manager: and um {disfmarker} industrial designer: that's {disfmarker} maybe that's better . {vocalsound} project manager: yeah . industrial designer: maybe we could uh {disfmarker} we should go for straight and simple , project manager: yeah . industrial designer: but that's not what uh has been asked . project manager: i know , i know . industrial designer: so we should kick the board's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} yeah . although i think we {disfmarker} yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already . industrial designer: hmm . project manager: um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people . industrial designer: yes . project manager: um but uh i agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . definitely not , no . {vocalsound} it's not that innovative . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: or however you s pronounce that . user interface: yeah , too bad . {vocalsound} project manager: um so , okay . {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} oh , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: this is the wrong one . so uh that means redesign . {vocalsound} we do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product . user interface: mm-hmm . project manager: um {vocalsound} but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . um i'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . i guess {disfmarker} marketing: um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: yeah , that's true . industrial designer: well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good . project manager: we l we can learn . yeah . yeah . i agree . industrial designer: so {disfmarker} project manager: well {disfmarker} industrial designer: is it fancy ? {vocalsound} project manager: i d it is it is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: yay . is it ? is it fancy ? project manager: yeah , i think so . user interface: um the yellow rubber , i think so . industrial designer: i think so . project manager: {vocalsound} you like the rubber , uh roo . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} i'm into it . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: so uh one ? project manager: yeah . industrial designer: but it's not that fancy . project manager: no , i'll i'll i'll give it a two . industrial designer: i mean i think uh {disfmarker} i think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing {disfmarker} the casing . it would be even more {disfmarker} project manager: you like tita {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: oh , you really like titanium . i'm i'm into it . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: that's a flavour as well . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: it has flavour . yes , that's right . {vocalsound} you should taste it . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} right . um {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: yeah , i know , marketing: is it uh {disfmarker} project manager: but but it {disfmarker} but that's fancy in the way um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i mean fancy has has a lot of {disfmarker} industrial designer: it has to do with fashion , i guess . project manager: yeah . user interface: it's trendy trendy , fun {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: so do {disfmarker} marketing: and w user interface: yeah . marketing: yeah , w what they want {disfmarker} wanted was uh colours and soft materials . project manager: yeah . marketing: so in that way {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it's fancy . project manager: it applies . it {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: well , just {vocalsound} give it a two . industrial designer: okay . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: yes . user interface: it's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: i think i th i think it would have been {disfmarker} i would have think {disfmarker} uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . it would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar . user interface: yeah , but that's sti that's uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: so {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't {disfmarker} we don't have the double-curved case . we w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . that's two out of three . so i believe uh we are close uh to two . industrial designer: yes . project manager: yeah , i i agree . industrial designer: yes , i agree too . it's okay . we did {gap} {disfmarker} yes , we did good . marketing: okay , and uh was it innovative ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: well , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: with the voice recognition feature and uh {disfmarker} user interface: but that's not in it . ov or can we {disfmarker} marketing: yep . project manager: no , we are evaluating this this uh design now . this prototype . industrial designer: well , let's let's {disfmarker} this product . user interface: okay . industrial designer: so i i i think it is . i think it's innovative . project manager: yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} and the scroll uh wheel . the solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , i think . industrial designer: no . it could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker} marketing: yeah , and uh {disfmarker} project manager: that would have been a thrill . industrial designer: yes , but {disfmarker} marketing: so uh also a uh two ? industrial designer: i think uh it's a two . project manager: yep . marketing: is it easy to use ? project manager: i'm not sure . {vocalsound} i'm not sure . user interface: yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , i think . well , hard {disfmarker} it's not for the for the e for the elderly . they won't use it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} well , but there are two parts in this remote control . what you see here is is the basic part . everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: that's for a novice user . when you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . so in that in that way it is advanced , project manager: yeah . industrial designer: and i think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users . user interface: i think {disfmarker} i think a three . industrial designer: so uh {disfmarker} it's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} wouldn't give it more . project manager: uh i'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well . um {disfmarker} marketing: well the p the most important function is easy to use . the the zapping , channel switching , volume . but the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . project manager: okay . uh two or three ? three ? wha wh what would be your guess ? i mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . industrial designer: okay . project manager: it's the uh it's it's overall . is the device easy to use ? industrial designer: yeah , that's right . you're right in that , but i {gap} {disfmarker} i guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , project manager: yeah . industrial designer: because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: so {disfmarker} project manager: um {disfmarker} okay . industrial designer: after all , i think {disfmarker} personally i would give a two . but {disfmarker} project manager: uh roo , a three ? user interface: yep . project manager: ruud ? marketing: good question . uh i'll go uh for the two . project manager: okay . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: so , it's two , two and three . two threes . so that's ten . project manager: so i could make it e easy ? user interface: if you make it a four it will be three in general . industrial designer: so that's w no , two and a half . user interface: if he makes it a four . not a three . industrial designer: six and four . six and four is ten . divided by four is two and a half . so {disfmarker} user interface: darn . nee . industrial designer: yes . {vocalsound} marketing: hmm ? huh ? project manager: roo . {vocalsound} user interface: a seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} no . marketing: yeah . i yeah {gap} . user interface: a four and a three together . industrial designer: {vocalsound} four ? user interface: yeah , you have a two , he has a two . three ? marketing: yeah , industrial designer: two ? marketing: two , two , three {disfmarker} project manager: no , user interface: and a three ? project manager: i haven't said anything yet . user interface: nee . i know . marketing: no . {vocalsound} project manager: okay , but if i would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . divided by four is two point five . industrial designer: divided by four . user interface: yes . so if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three . then you would make a four . if you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: but i'm filling in a three . industrial designer: that's not even {disfmarker} project manager: does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: but that's not possible to fill in , project manager: yes , it is . industrial designer: so we have to round it . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} is it easy to find ? {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} i have a veto . {vocalsound} exactly . it's not about the content , it's about {disfmarker} okay , um is it easy to f yeah , definitely . user interface: yeah , industrial designer: yes . user interface: we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . industrial designer: it it most definitely is {disfmarker} it's very easy . project manager: yeah , or beeps or {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: yes . maybe {disfmarker} uh i i think i think {disfmarker} project manager: i'm here , i'm here . {vocalsound} industrial designer: something like that . maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing i'm here . so something like that . project manager: yeah . yeah . user interface: but even without it {disfmarker} project manager: yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: well , i uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: so , i th project manager: we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but i personally give it a one . user"], "document": " summarize the whole meeting. user interface: that's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button . industrial designer: like this one . user interface: but uh we don't uh we don't uh {disfmarker} we do think it's um well {disfmarker} what if with ease of use , w which prefers the {disfmarker} which the the customer of the user prefers . industrial designer: it's important . uh i think th this is device which which has a learning curve . um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control . and after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often . but other users who are new to this device need something like that . project manager: okay . industrial designer: they n they need to understand what {disfmarker} uh how to change channels and uh change the volume , so it's easier for them project manager: could could i see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ? a a and the voice recognition as well , industrial designer: yeah , maybe so . yes , it's {disfmarker} project manager: th maybe you could uh could uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: well , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our um {gap} . {vocalsound} there are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device . project manager: {vocalsound} yeah . industrial designer: it's it's quite easy . project manager: okay . okay , good . and and the case is is rubber ? industrial designer: yes , rubber ? project manager: and the buttons ? user interface: {vocalsound} plastic or rubber . industrial designer: {vocalsound} there are plastic or rubber . user interface: well , project manager: okay , user interface: yeah . project manager: and uh the colouring ? industrial designer: uh yellow with uh project manager: {gap} with with grey or black . industrial designer: grey or black or something like that . whatever cost uh cost uh the least . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} okay , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: we'll we'll come to that later . um industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: okay . anything else to add or {disfmarker} industrial designer: no . {vocalsound} uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} but {disfmarker} marketing: well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button , industrial designer: yes , but it {disfmarker} marketing: 'cause you have to assign two channel {disfmarker} new channels . industrial designer: but these are tasks that are only executed once , i think . project manager: m uh yeah . industrial designer: or not ? project manager: m m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition . marketing: you {disfmarker} industrial designer: well okay . okay , yeah , that's right . or something li like that . user interface: and a button for disabling the voice recognition . project manager: yeah al although by pressing the button for i n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it {disfmarker} you'd disable it with a little beep and and {disfmarker} industrial designer: yes . user interface: yeah . project manager: but o okay , that that's not really really important . user interface: {vocalsound} that's the basic idea , yeah . of our prototype . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: the basic {disfmarker} okay . okay . um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ? marketing: yes . project manager: okay . marketing: uh my name is not name project manager: {vocalsound} you are nameless . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: but {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: uh well , i used the {gap} {disfmarker} the uh {gap} documents . and these uh were the most important criteria . industrial designer: {vocalsound} is it spongy ? {vocalsound} marketing: it should be . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . fancy look and feel . so {disfmarker} user interface: so just walk through it step by step . i mean , is it fancy , everything {disfmarker} i believe uh i believe it's fancy . {vocalsound} marketing: uh well appar industrial designer: i believe it's fancy too . marketing: yeah , but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet . project manager: no . user interface: oh , sorry . marketing: so {disfmarker} project manager: okay , so industrial designer: okay . project manager: this {disfmarker} these are the cr uh the criteria . marketing: yeah , i think these are the most important criteria . project manager: okay , well {disfmarker} marketing: so uh project manager: the then we'll switch to my presentation . um {disfmarker} marketing: that's about it . project manager: the production costs . the costs are not under {disfmarker} can i {disfmarker} {vocalsound} um this is the {disfmarker} user interface: twenty two . project manager: yeah , it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve euro fifty . user interface: yikes . project manager: and what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . so i guess we should skip that , industrial designer: well it's very expensive . project manager: because it's not that important . industrial designer: okay . user interface: why does the price and and the s oh , one uh exa project manager: yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum . user interface: yeah . the number of uh {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} okay . project manager: um well , this is what i would call our luxury model . um if you would {disfmarker} user interface: and and does it {disfmarker} project manager: if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um {vocalsound} to make it {vocalsound} just between the twelve euro fifty , um then i did the following changes . twelve euro forty cents i came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature , industrial designer: mm-hmm . project manager: because it's uh it's a four euro uh addition to the price . industrial designer: mm-hmm . project manager: um {disfmarker} yeah , i believe {disfmarker} uh , push-button , well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it makes it the thirteen {disfmarker} yeah . push-buttons are {disfmarker} buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost . industrial designer: hmm . project manager: so um {disfmarker} yeah , th this design is not um within our price model . industrial designer: okay . project manager: um {disfmarker} industrial designer: but i'm afraid it's not complete . because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . and you have not added one item there . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: so it's c way too expensive . project manager: it's still too expensive , yeah . um {disfmarker} user interface: but that's that's only for the buttons . project manager: i i guess if we leave the {disfmarker} if we leave this one out , um {disfmarker} user interface: so the button we can use plastic . project manager: oh . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: and uh maybe not use the special form . user interface: and the pla uh {disfmarker} and a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber . industrial designer: but it {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} it becomes a very dull remote control , i know . industrial designer: yes . project manager: but it's the board decision . um {disfmarker} and um {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: well , b basically it {vocalsound} {disfmarker} when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because i think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions . project manager: yeah . yeah , i know . maybe we should look at an {disfmarker} uh focus on another uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: so {disfmarker} type of m maybe another market segment . project manager: yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic industrial designer: yeah . project manager: and uh m maximise the profits industrial designer: yes . project manager: and um {disfmarker} industrial designer: that's {disfmarker} maybe that's better . {vocalsound} project manager: yeah . industrial designer: maybe we could uh {disfmarker} we should go for straight and simple , project manager: yeah . industrial designer: but that's not what uh has been asked . project manager: i know , i know . industrial designer: so we should kick the board's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} yeah . although i think we {disfmarker} yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already . industrial designer: hmm . project manager: um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people . industrial designer: yes . project manager: um but uh i agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . definitely not , no . {vocalsound} it's not that innovative . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: or however you s pronounce that . user interface: yeah , too bad . {vocalsound} project manager: um so , okay . {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} oh , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: this is the wrong one . so uh that means redesign . {vocalsound} we do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product . user interface: mm-hmm . project manager: um {vocalsound} but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . um i'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . i guess {disfmarker} marketing: um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: yeah , that's true . industrial designer: well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good . project manager: we l we can learn . yeah . yeah . i agree . industrial designer: so {disfmarker} project manager: well {disfmarker} industrial designer: is it fancy ? {vocalsound} project manager: i d it is it is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: yay . is it ? is it fancy ? project manager: yeah , i think so . user interface: um the yellow rubber , i think so . industrial designer: i think so . project manager: {vocalsound} you like the rubber , uh roo . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} i'm into it . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: so uh one ? project manager: yeah . industrial designer: but it's not that fancy . project manager: no , i'll i'll i'll give it a two . industrial designer: i mean i think uh {disfmarker} i think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing {disfmarker} the casing . it would be even more {disfmarker} project manager: you like tita {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: oh , you really like titanium . i'm i'm into it . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: that's a flavour as well . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: it has flavour . yes , that's right . {vocalsound} you should taste it . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} right . um {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: yeah , i know , marketing: is it uh {disfmarker} project manager: but but it {disfmarker} but that's fancy in the way um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i mean fancy has has a lot of {disfmarker} industrial designer: it has to do with fashion , i guess . project manager: yeah . user interface: it's trendy trendy , fun {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: so do {disfmarker} marketing: and w user interface: yeah . marketing: yeah , w what they want {disfmarker} wanted was uh colours and soft materials . project manager: yeah . marketing: so in that way {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it's fancy . project manager: it applies . it {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: well , just {vocalsound} give it a

to two . industrial designer: yes . project manager: yeah , i i agree . industrial designer: yes , i agree too . it's okay . we did {gap} {disfmarker} yes , we did good . marketing: okay , and uh was it innovative ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: well , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: with the voice recognition feature and uh {disfmarker} user interface: but that's not in

three ? user interface: yep . project manager: ruud ? marketing: good question . uh i'll go uh for the two . project manager: okay . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: so , it's two , two and three . two threes . so that's ten . project manager: so i could make it e easy ? user interface: if you make it a four it will be three in general .

manager: {vocalsound} yeah . industrial designer: it's it's quite easy . project manager: okay . okay , good . and and the case is is rubber ? industrial designer: yes , rubber ? project manager: and the buttons ? user interface: {vocalsound} plastic or rubber . industrial designer: {vocalsound} there are plastic or rubber . user interface: well , project manager: okay , user interface: yeah . project manager: and uh the colouring ? industrial designer: uh yellow with uh project manager: {gap} with with grey or black . industrial designer: grey or black or something like that . whatever cost uh cost uh the least . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} okay , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: we'll we'll come to that later . um industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: okay . anything else to add or {disfmarker} industrial designer: no . {vocalsound} uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} but {disfmarker} marketing: well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button , industrial designer: yes , but it {disfmarker} marketing: 'cause you have to assign two channel {disfmarker} new channels . industrial designer: but these are tasks that are only executed once , i think . project manager: m uh yeah . industrial designer: or not ? project manager: m m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition . marketing: you {disfmarker} industrial designer: well okay . okay , yeah , that's right . or something li like that . user interface: and a button for disabling the voice recognition . project manager: yeah al although by pressing the button for i n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it {disfmarker} you'd disable it with a little beep and and {disfmarker} industrial designer: yes . user interface: yeah . project manager: but o okay , that that's not really really important . user interface: {vocalsound} that's the basic idea , yeah . of our prototype . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: the basic {disfmarker} okay . okay . um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ? marketing: yes . project manager: okay . marketing: uh my name is not name project manager: {vocalsound} you are nameless . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: but {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: uh well , i used the {gap} {disfmarker} the uh {gap} documents . and these uh were the most important criteria . industrial designer: {vocalsound} is it spongy ? {vocalsound} marketing: it should be . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . fancy look and feel . so {disfmarker} user interface: so just walk through it step by step . i mean , is it fancy , everything {disfmarker} i believe uh i believe it's fancy . {vocalsound} marketing: uh well appar industrial designer: i believe it's fancy too . marketing: yeah , but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet . project manager: no . user interface: oh , sorry . marketing: so {disfmarker} project manager: okay , so industrial designer: okay . project manager: this {disfmarker} these are the cr uh the criteria . marketing: yeah , i think these are the most important criteria . project manager: okay , well {disfmarker} marketing: so uh project manager: the then we'll switch to my presentation . um {disfmarker} marketing: that's about it . project manager: the production costs . the costs are not under {disfmarker} can i {disfmarker} {vocalsound} um this is the {disfmarker} user interface: twenty two . project manager: yeah , it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve euro fifty . user interface: yikes . project manager: and what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . so i guess we should skip that , industrial designer: well it's very expensive . project manager: because it's not that important . industrial designer: okay . user interface: why does the price and and the s oh , one uh exa project manager: yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum . user interface: yeah . the number of uh {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} okay . project manager: um well , this is what i would call our luxury model . um if you would {disfmarker} user interface: and and does it {disfmarker} project manager: if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um {vocalsound} to make it {vocalsound} just between the twelve euro fifty , um then i did the following changes . twelve euro forty cents i came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature , industrial designer: mm-hmm . project manager: because it's uh it's a four euro uh addition to the price . industrial designer: mm-hmm . project manager: um {disfmarker} yeah , i believe {disfmarker} uh , push-button , well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it makes it the thirteen {disfmarker} yeah . push-buttons are {disfmarker} buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost . industrial designer: hmm . project manager: so um {disfmarker} yeah , th this design is not um within our price model . industrial designer: okay . project manager: um {disfmarker} industrial designer: but i'm afraid it's not complete . because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . and you have not added one item there . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: so it's c way too expensive . project manager: it's still too expensive , yeah . um {disfmarker} user interface: but that's that's only for the buttons . project manager: i i guess if we leave the {disfmarker} if we leave this one out , um {disfmarker} user interface: so the button we can use plastic . project manager: oh . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: and uh maybe not use the special form . user interface: and the pla uh {disfmarker} and a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber . industrial designer: but it {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} it becomes a very dull remote control , i know . industrial designer: yes . project manager: but it's the board decision . um {disfmarker} and um {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: well , b basically it {vocalsound} {disfmarker} when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because i think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions . project manager: yeah . yeah , i know . maybe we should look at an {disfmarker} uh focus on another uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: so {disfmarker} type of m maybe another market segment . project manager: yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic industrial designer: yeah . project manager: and uh m maximise the profits industrial designer: yes . project manager: and um {disfmarker} industrial designer: that's {disfmarker} maybe that's better . {vocalsound} project manager: yeah . industrial designer: maybe we could uh {disfmarker} we should go for straight and simple , project manager: yeah . industrial designer: but that's not what uh has been asked . project manager: i know , i know . industrial designer: so we should kick the board's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} yeah . although i think we {disfmarker} yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already . industrial designer: hmm . project manager: um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people . industrial designer: yes . project manager: um but uh i agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . definitely not , no . {vocalsound} it's not that innovative . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: or however you s pronounce that . user interface: yeah , too bad . {vocalsound} project manager: um so , okay . {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} oh , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: this is the wrong one . so uh that means redesign . {vocalsound} we do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product . user interface: mm-hmm . project manager: um {vocalsound} but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . um i'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . i guess {disfmarker} marketing: um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: yeah , that's true . industrial designer: well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good . project manager: we l we can learn . yeah . yeah . i agree . industrial designer: so {disfmarker} project manager: well {disfmarker} industrial designer: is it fancy ? {vocalsound} project manager: i d it is it is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: yay . is it ? is it fancy ? project manager: yeah , i think so . user interface: um the yellow rubber , i think so . industrial designer: i think so . project manager: {vocalsound} you like the rubber , uh roo . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} i'm into it . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: so uh one ? project manager: yeah . industrial designer: but it's not that fancy . project manager: no , i'll i'll i'll give it a two . industrial designer: i mean i think uh {disfmarker} i think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing {disfmarker} the casing . it would be even more {disfmarker} project manager: you like tita {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: oh , you really like titanium . i'm i'm into it . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: that's a flavour as well . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: it has flavour . yes , that's right . {vocalsound} you should taste it . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} right . um {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: yeah , i know , marketing: is it uh {disfmarker} project manager: but but it {disfmarker} but that's fancy in the way um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i mean fancy has has a lot of {disfmarker} industrial designer: it has to do with fashion , i guess . project manager: yeah . user interface: it's trendy trendy , fun {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: so do {disfmarker} marketing: and w user interface: yeah . marketing: yeah , w what they want {disfmarker} wanted was uh colours and soft materials . project manager: yeah . marketing: so in that way {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it's fancy . project manager: it applies . it {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: well , just {vocalsound} give it a two . industrial designer: okay . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: yes . user interface: it's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: i think i th i think it would have been {disfmarker} i would have think {disfmarker} uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . it would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar . user interface: yeah , but that's sti that's uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: so {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't {disfmarker} we don't have the double-curved case . we w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . that's two out of three . so i believe uh we are close uh to two . industrial designer: yes . project manager: yeah , i i agree . industrial designer: yes , i agree too . it's okay . we did {gap} {disfmarker} yes , we did good . marketing: okay , and uh was it innovative ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: well , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: with the voice recognition feature and uh {disfmarker} user interface: but that's not in it . ov or can we {disfmarker} marketing: yep . project manager: no , we are evaluating this this uh design now . this prototype . industrial designer: well , let's let's {disfmarker} this product . user interface: okay . industrial designer: so i i i think it is . i think it's innovative . project manager: yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} and the scroll uh wheel . the solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , i think . industrial designer: no . it could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker} marketing: yeah , and uh {disfmarker} project manager: that would have been a thrill . industrial designer: yes , but {disfmarker} marketing: so uh also a uh two ? industrial designer: i think uh it's a two . project manager: yep . marketing: is it easy to use ? project manager: i'm not sure . {vocalsound} i'm not sure . user interface: yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , i think . well , hard {disfmarker} it's not for the for the e for the elderly . they won't use it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} well , but there are two parts in this remote control . what you see here is is the basic part . everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: that's for a novice user . when you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . so in that in that way it is advanced , project manager: yeah . industrial designer: and i think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users . user interface: i think {disfmarker} i think a three . industrial designer: so uh {disfmarker} it's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} wouldn't give it more . project manager: uh i'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well . um {disfmarker} marketing: well the p the most important function is easy to use . the the zapping , channel switching , volume . but the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . project manager: okay . uh two or three ? three ? wha wh what would be your guess ? i mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . industrial designer: okay . project manager: it's the uh it's it's overall . is the device easy to use ? industrial designer: yeah , that's right . you're right in that , but i {gap} {disfmarker} i guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , project manager: yeah . industrial designer: because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: so {disfmarker} project manager: um {disfmarker} okay . industrial designer: after all , i think {disfmarker} personally i would give a two . but {disfmarker} project manager: uh roo , a three ? user interface: yep . project manager: ruud ? marketing: good question . uh i'll go uh for the two . project manager: okay . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: so , it's two , two and three . two threes . so that's ten . project manager: so i could make it e easy ? user interface: if you make it a four it will be three in general . industrial designer: so that's w no , two and a half . user interface: if he makes it a four . not a three . industrial designer: six and four . six and four is ten . divided by four is two and a half . so {disfmarker} user interface: darn . nee . industrial designer: yes . {vocalsound} marketing: hmm ? huh ? project manager: roo . {vocalsound} user interface: a seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} no . marketing: yeah . i yeah {gap} . user interface: a four and a three together . industrial designer: {vocalsound} four ? user interface: yeah , you have a two , he has a two . three ? marketing: yeah , industrial designer: two ? marketing: two , two , three {disfmarker} project manager: no , user interface: and a three ? project manager: i haven't said anything yet . user interface: nee . i know . marketing: no . {vocalsound} project manager: okay , but if i would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . divided by four is two point five . industrial designer: divided by four . user interface: yes . so if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three . then you would make a four . if you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: but i'm filling in a three . industrial designer: that's not even {disfmarker} project manager: does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: but that's not possible to fill in , project manager: yes , it is . industrial designer: so we have to round it . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} is it easy to find ? {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} i have a veto . {vocalsound} exactly . it's not about the content , it's about {disfmarker} okay , um is it easy to f yeah , definitely . user interface: yeah , industrial designer: yes . user interface: we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . industrial designer: it it most definitely is {disfmarker} it's very easy . project manager: yeah , or beeps or {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: yes . maybe {disfmarker} uh i i think i think {disfmarker} project manager: i'm here , i'm here . {vocalsound} industrial designer: something like that . maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing i'm here . so something like that . project manager: yeah . yeah . user interface: but even without it {disfmarker} project manager: yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: well , i uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: so , i th project manager: we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but i personally give it a one . user"], "document": " summarize the whole meeting. user interface: that's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button . industrial designer: like this one . user interface: but uh we don't uh we don't uh {disfmarker} we do think it's um well {disfmarker} what if with ease of use , w which prefers the {disfmarker} which the the customer of the user prefers . industrial designer: it's important . uh i think th this is device which which has a learning curve . um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control . and after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often . but other users who are new to this device need something like that . project manager: okay . industrial designer: they n they need to understand what {disfmarker} uh how to change channels and uh change the volume , so it's easier for them project manager: could could i see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ? a a and the voice recognition as well , industrial designer: yeah , maybe so . yes , it's {disfmarker} project manager: th maybe you could uh could uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: well , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our um {gap} . {vocalsound} there are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device . project manager: {vocalsound} yeah . industrial designer: it's it's quite easy . project manager: okay . okay , good . and and the case is is rubber ? industrial designer: yes , rubber ? project manager: and the buttons ? user interface: {vocalsound} plastic or rubber . industrial designer: {vocalsound} there are plastic or rubber . user interface: well , project manager: okay , user interface: yeah . project manager: and uh the colouring ? industrial designer: uh yellow with uh project manager: {gap} with with grey or black . industrial designer: grey or black or something like that . whatever cost uh cost uh the least . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} okay , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: we'll we'll come to that later . um industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: okay . anything else to add or {disfmarker} industrial designer: no . {vocalsound} uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} but {disfmarker} marketing: well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button , industrial designer: yes , but it {disfmarker} marketing: 'cause you have to assign two channel {disfmarker} new channels . industrial designer: but these are tasks that are only executed once , i think . project manager: m uh yeah . industrial designer: or not ? project manager: m m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition . marketing: you {disfmarker} industrial designer: well okay . okay , yeah , that's right . or something li like that . user interface: and a button for disabling the voice recognition . project manager: yeah al although by pressing the button for i n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it {disfmarker} you'd disable it with a little beep and and {disfmarker} industrial designer: yes . user interface: yeah . project manager: but o okay , that that's not really really important . user interface: {vocalsound} that's the basic idea , yeah . of our prototype . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: the basic {disfmarker} okay . okay . um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ? marketing: yes . project manager: okay . marketing: uh my name is not name project manager: {vocalsound} you are nameless . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: but {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: uh well , i used the {gap} {disfmarker} the uh {gap} documents . and these uh were the most important criteria . industrial designer: {vocalsound} is it spongy ? {vocalsound} marketing: it should be . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . fancy look and feel . so {disfmarker} user interface: so just walk through it step by step . i mean , is it fancy , everything {disfmarker} i believe uh i believe it's fancy . {vocalsound} marketing: uh well appar industrial designer: i believe it's fancy too . marketing: yeah , but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet . project manager: no . user interface: oh , sorry . marketing: so {disfmarker} project manager: okay , so industrial designer: okay . project manager: this {disfmarker} these are the cr uh the criteria . marketing: yeah , i think these are the most important

yeah , i think so . user interface: um the yellow rubber , i think so . industrial designer: i think so . project manager: {vocalsound} you like the rubber , uh roo . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} i'm into it . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: so uh one ? project manager: yeah . industrial designer: but it's not that fancy . project

, fun {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: so do {disfmarker} marketing: and w user interface: yeah . marketing: yeah , w what they want {disfmarker} wanted was uh colours and soft materials . project manager: yeah . marketing: so in that way {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it's fancy . project manager: it applies . it {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: well , just {vocalsound} give it a two . industrial designer: okay . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: yes . user interface: it's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: i think i th i think it would have been {disfmarker} i would have think {disfmarker} uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . it would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar . user interface: yeah , but that's sti that's uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: so {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't {disfmarker} we don't have the double-curved case . we w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . that's two out of three . so i believe uh we are close uh to two . industrial designer: yes . project manager: yeah , i i agree . industrial designer: yes , i agree too . it's okay . we did {gap} {disfmarker} yes , we did good . marketing: okay , and uh was it innovative ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: well , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: with the voice recognition feature and uh {disfmarker} user interface: but that's not in it . ov or can we {disfmarker} marketing: yep . project manager: no , we are evaluating this this uh design now . this prototype . industrial designer: well , let's let's {disfmarker} this product . user interface: okay . industrial designer: so i i i think it is . i think it's innovative . project manager: yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} and the scroll uh wheel . the solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , i think . industrial designer: no . it could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker} marketing: yeah , and uh {disfmarker} project manager: that would have been a thrill . industrial designer: yes , but {disfmarker} marketing: so uh also a uh two ? industrial designer: i think uh it's a two . project manager: yep . marketing: is it easy to use ? project manager: i'm not sure . {vocalsound} i'm not sure . user interface: yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , i think . well , hard {disfmarker} it's not for the for the e for the elderly . they won't use it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} well , but there are two parts in this remote control . what you see here is is the basic part . everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: that's for a novice user . when you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . so in that in that way it is advanced , project manager: yeah . industrial designer: and i think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users . user interface: i think {disfmarker} i think a three . industrial designer: so uh {disfmarker} it's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} wouldn't give it more . project manager: uh i'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well . um {disfmarker} marketing: well the p the most important function is easy to use . the the zapping , channel switching , volume . but the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . project manager: okay . uh two or three ? three ? wha wh what would be your guess ? i mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . industrial designer: okay . project manager: it's the uh it's it's overall . is the device easy to use ? industrial designer: yeah , that's right . you're right in that , but i {gap} {disfmarker} i guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , project manager: yeah . industrial designer: because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: so {disfmarker} project manager: um {disfmarker} okay . industrial designer: after all , i think {disfmarker} personally i would give a two . but {disfmarker} project manager: uh roo , a three ? user interface: yep . project manager: ruud ? marketing: good question . uh i'll go uh for the two . project manager: okay . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: so , it's two , two and three . two threes . so that's ten . project manager: so i could make it e easy ? user interface: if you make it a four it will be three in general . industrial designer: so that's w no , two and a half . user interface: if he makes it a four . not a three . industrial designer: six and four . six and four is ten . divided by four is two and a half . so {disfmarker} user interface: darn . nee . industrial designer: yes . {vocalsound} marketing: hmm ? huh ? project manager: roo . {vocalsound} user interface: a seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} no . marketing: yeah . i yeah {gap} . user interface: a four and a three together . industrial designer: {vocalsound} four ? user interface: yeah , you have a two , he has a two . three ? marketing: yeah , industrial designer: two ? marketing: two , two , three {disfmarker} project manager: no , user interface: and a three ? project manager: i haven't said anything yet . user interface: nee . i know . marketing: no . {vocalsound} project manager: okay , but if i would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . divided by four is two point five . industrial designer: divided by four . user interface: yes . so if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three . then you would make a four . if you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: but i'm filling in a three . industrial designer: that's not even {disfmarker} project manager: does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: but that's not possible to fill in , project manager: yes , it is . industrial designer: so we have to round it . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} is it easy to find ? {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} i have a veto . {vocalsound} exactly . it's not about the content , it's about {disfmarker} okay , um is it easy to f yeah , definitely . user interface: yeah , industrial designer: yes . user interface: we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . industrial designer: it it most definitely is {disfmarker} it's very easy . project manager: yeah , or beeps or {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: yes . maybe {disfmarker} uh i i think i think {disfmarker} project manager: i'm here , i'm here . {vocalsound} industrial designer: something like that . maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing i'm here . so something like that . project manager: yeah . yeah . user interface: but even without it {disfmarker} project manager: yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: well , i uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: so , i th project manager: we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but i personally give it a one . user", "summary": "user interface first asked whether the device should have a round button and which one should be used for the navigation. project manager agreed but asked industrial designer to clarify which button should be used for the voice recognition. then, project manager announced that there could be two buttons on the left side, one for the channel control and the other for the volume control. after that, project manager offered a choice question between yellow and black colours for the buttons. finally, to avoid confusion, user interface suggested using a rubber case for the buttons.

but uh we don't uh we don't uh {disfmarker} we do think it's um well {disfmarker} what if with ease of use , w which prefers the {disfmarker} which the the customer of the user prefers . industrial

start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often . but other users who are new to this device need something like that . project manager: okay . industrial designer: they n they need to understand what {disfmarker} uh how to change channels and uh change the volume , so it's easier for them project manager: could could i see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ? a a and the voice recognition as well , industrial designer: yeah , maybe so . yes , it's {disfmarker} project manager: th maybe you could uh could uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: well , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our um {gap} . {vocalsound} there are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device . project manager: {vocalsound} yeah . industrial designer: it's it's quite easy . project manager: okay . okay , good . and and the case is is rubber ? industrial designer: yes , rubber ? project manager: and the buttons ? user interface: {vocalsound} plastic or rubber . industrial designer: {vocalsound} there are plastic or rubber . user interface: well , project manager: okay , user interface: yeah . project manager: and uh the colouring ? industrial designer: uh yellow with uh project manager: {gap} with with grey or black . industrial designer: grey or black or something like that . whatever cost uh cost uh the least . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} okay , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: we'll we'll come to that later . um industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: okay . anything else to add or {disfmarker} industrial designer: no . {vocalsound} uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} but {disfmarker} marketing: well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button , industrial designer: yes , but it {disfmarker} marketing: 'cause you have to assign two channel {disfmarker} new channels . industrial designer: but these are tasks that are only executed once , i think . project manager: m uh yeah . industrial designer: or not ? project manager: m m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition . marketing: you {disfmarker} industrial designer: well okay . okay , yeah , that's right . or something li like that . user interface: and a button for disabling the voice recognition . project manager: yeah al although by pressing the button for i n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it {disfmarker} you'd disable it with a little beep and and {disfmarker} industrial designer: yes . user interface: yeah . project manager: but o okay , that that's not really really important . user interface: {vocalsound} that's the basic idea , yeah . of our prototype . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: the basic {disfmarker} okay . okay . um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ? marketing: yes . project manager: okay . marketing: uh my name is not name project manager: {vocalsound} you are nameless . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: but {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: uh well , i used the {gap} {disfmarker} the uh {gap} documents . and these uh were the most important criteria . industrial designer: {vocalsound} is it spongy ? {vocalsound} marketing: it should be . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . fancy look and feel . so {disfmarker} user interface: so just walk through it step by step . i mean , is it fancy , everything {disfmarker} i believe uh i believe it's fancy . {vocalsound} marketing: uh well appar industrial designer: i believe it's fancy too . marketing: yeah , but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet . project manager: no . user interface: oh , sorry . marketing: so {disfmarker} project manager: okay , so industrial designer: okay . project manager: this {disfmarker} these are the cr uh the criteria . marketing: yeah , i think these are the most important criteria . project manager: okay , well {disfmarker} marketing: so uh project manager: the then we'll switch to my presentation . um {disfmarker} marketing: that's about it . project manager: the production costs . the costs are not under {disfmarker} can i {disfmarker} {vocalsound} um this is the {disfmarker} user interface: twenty two . project manager: yeah , it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve euro fifty . user interface: yikes . project manager: and what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . so i guess we should skip that , industrial designer: well it's very expensive . project manager: because it's not that important . industrial designer: okay . user interface: why does the price and and the s oh , one uh exa project manager: yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum . user interface: yeah . the number of uh {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} okay . project manager: um well , this is what i would call our luxury model . um if you would {disfmarker} user interface: and and does it {disfmarker} project manager: if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um {vocalsound} to make it {vocalsound} just between the twelve euro fifty , um then i did the following changes . twelve euro forty cents i came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature , industrial designer: mm-hmm . project manager: because it's uh it's a four euro uh addition to the price . industrial designer: mm-hmm . project manager: um {disfmarker} yeah , i believe {disfmarker} uh , push-button , well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it makes it the thirteen {disfmarker} yeah . push-buttons are {disfmarker} buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost . industrial designer: hmm . project manager: so um {disfmarker} yeah , th this design is not um within our price model . industrial designer: okay . project manager: um {disfmarker} industrial designer: but i'm afraid it's not complete . because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . and you have not added one item there . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: so it's c way too expensive . project manager: it's still too expensive , yeah . um {disfmarker} user interface: but that's that's only for the buttons . project manager: i i guess if we leave the {disfmarker} if we leave this one out , um {disfmarker} user interface: so the button we can use plastic . project manager: oh . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: and uh maybe not use the special form . user interface: and the pla uh {disfmarker} and a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber . industrial designer: but it {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} it becomes a very dull remote control , i know . industrial designer: yes . project manager: but it's the board decision . um {disfmarker} and um {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: well , b basically it {vocalsound} {disfmarker} when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because i think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions . project manager: yeah . yeah , i know . maybe we should look at an {disfmarker} uh focus on another uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: so {disfmarker} type of m maybe another market segment . project manager: yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic industrial designer: yeah . project manager: and uh m maximise the profits industrial designer: yes . project manager: and um {disfmarker} industrial designer: that's {disfmarker} maybe that's better . {vocalsound} project manager: yeah . industrial designer: maybe we could uh {disfmarker} we should go for straight and simple , project manager: yeah . industrial designer: but that's not what uh has been asked . project manager: i know , i know . industrial designer: so we should kick the board's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} yeah . although i think we {disfmarker} yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already . industrial designer: hmm . project manager: um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people . industrial designer: yes . project manager: um but uh i agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . definitely not , no . {vocalsound} it's not that innovative . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: or however you s pronounce that . user interface: yeah , too bad . {vocalsound} project manager: um so , okay . {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} oh , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: this is the wrong one . so uh that means redesign . {vocalsound} we do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product . user interface: mm-hmm . project manager: um {vocalsound} but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . um i'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . i guess {disfmarker} marketing: um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: yeah , that's true . industrial designer: well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good . project manager: we l we can learn . yeah . yeah . i agree . industrial designer: so {disfmarker} project manager: well {disfmarker} industrial designer: is it fancy ? {vocalsound} project manager: i d it is it is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: yay . is it ? is it fancy ? project manager: yeah , i think so . user interface: um the yellow rubber , i think so . industrial designer: i think so . project manager: {vocalsound} you like the rubber , uh roo . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} i'm into it . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: so uh one ? project manager: yeah . industrial designer: but it's not that fancy . project manager: no , i'll i'll i'll give it a two . industrial designer: i mean i think uh {disfmarker} i think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing {disfmarker} the casing . it would be even more {disfmarker} project manager: you like tita {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: oh , you really like titanium . i'm i'm into it . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: that's a flavour as well . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: it has flavour . yes , that's right . {vocalsound} you should taste it . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} right . um {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: yeah , i know , marketing: is it uh {disfmarker} project manager: but but it {disfmarker} but that's fancy in the way um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i mean fancy has has a lot of {disfmarker} industrial designer: it has to do with fashion , i guess . project manager: yeah . user interface: it's trendy trendy , fun {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: so do {disfmarker} marketing: and w user interface: yeah . marketing: yeah , w what they want {disfmarker} wanted was uh colours and soft materials . project manager: yeah . marketing: so in that way {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it's fancy . project manager: it applies . it {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: well , just {vocalsound} give it a two . industrial designer: okay . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: yes . user interface: it's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: i think i th i think it would have been {disfmarker} i would have think {disfmarker} uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . it would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar . user interface: yeah , but that's sti that's uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: so {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't {disfmarker} we don't have the double-curved case . we w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . that's two out of three . so i believe uh we are close uh to two . industrial designer: yes . project manager: yeah , i i agree . industrial designer: yes , i agree too . it's okay . we did {gap} {disfmarker} yes , we did good . marketing: okay , and uh was it innovative ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: well , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: with the voice recognition feature and uh {disfmarker} user interface: but that's not in it . ov or can we {disfmarker} marketing: yep . project manager: no , we are evaluating this this uh design now . this prototype . industrial designer: well , let's let's {disfmarker} this product . user interface: okay . industrial designer: so i i i think it is . i think it's innovative . project manager: yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} and the scroll uh wheel . the solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , i think . industrial designer: no . it could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker} marketing: yeah , and uh {disfmarker} project manager: that would have been a thrill . industrial designer: yes , but {disfmarker} marketing: so uh also a uh two ? industrial designer: i think uh it's a two . project manager: yep . marketing: is it easy to use ? project manager: i'm not sure . {vocalsound} i'm not sure . user

interface: {vocalsound} that's the basic idea , yeah . of our prototype . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: the basic {disfmarker} okay . okay . um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ? marketing: yes . project manager: okay . marketing: uh my name is not name project manager: {vocalsound} you are nameless . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: but {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: uh well , i used the {gap} {disfmarker} the uh {gap} documents . and these uh were the most important criteria . industrial designer: {vocalsound} is it spongy ? {vocalsound} marketing: it should be . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . fancy look and feel . so {disfmarker} user interface: so just walk through it step by step . i mean , is it fancy , everything {disfmarker} i believe uh i believe it's fancy . {vocalsound} marketing: uh well appar industrial designer: i believe it's fancy too . marketing: yeah , but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet . project manager: no . user interface: oh , sorry . marketing: so {disfmarker} project manager: okay , so industrial designer: okay . project manager: this {disfmarker} these are the cr uh the criteria . marketing: yeah , i think these are the most important criteria . project manager: okay , well {disfmarker} marketing: so uh project manager: the then we'll switch to my presentation . um {disfmarker} marketing: that's about it . project manager: the production costs . the costs are not under {disfmarker} can i {disfmarker} {vocalsound} um this is the {disfmarker} user interface: twenty two . project manager: yeah , it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve euro fifty . user interface: yikes . project manager: and what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . so i guess we should skip that , industrial designer: well it's very expensive . project manager: because it's not that important . industrial designer: okay . user interface: why does the price and and the s oh , one uh exa project manager: yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum . user interface: yeah . the number of uh {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} okay . project manager: um well , this is what i would call our luxury model . um if you would {disfmarker} user interface: and and does it {disfmarker} project manager: if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um {vocalsound} to make it {vocalsound} just between the twelve euro fifty , um then i did the following changes . twelve euro forty cents i came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature , industrial designer: mm-hmm . project manager: because it's uh it's a four euro uh addition to the price . industrial designer: mm-hmm . project manager: um {disfmarker} yeah , i believe {disfmarker} uh , push-button , well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it makes it the thirteen {disfmarker} yeah . push-buttons are {disfmarker} buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost . industrial designer: hmm . project manager: so um {disfmarker} yeah , th this design is not um within our price model . industrial designer: okay . project manager: um {disfmarker} industrial designer: but i'm afraid it's not complete . because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . and you have not added one item there . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: so it's c way too expensive . project manager: it's still too expensive , yeah . um {disfmarker} user interface: but that's that's only for the buttons . project manager: i i guess if we leave the {disfmarker} if we leave this one out , um {disfmarker} user interface: so the button we can use plastic . project manager: oh . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: and uh maybe not use the special form . user interface: and the pla uh {disfmarker} and a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber . industrial designer: but it {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} it becomes a very dull remote control , i know . industrial designer: yes . project manager: but it's the board decision . um {disfmarker} and um {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: well , b basically it {vocalsound} {disfmarker} when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because i think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions . project manager: yeah . yeah , i know . maybe we should look at an {disfmarker} uh focus on another uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: so {disfmarker} type of m maybe another market segment . project manager: yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic industrial designer: yeah . project manager: and uh m maximise the profits industrial designer: yes . project manager: and um {disfmarker} industrial designer: that's {disfmarker} maybe that's better . {vocalsound} project manager: yeah . industrial designer: maybe we could uh {disfmarker} we should go for straight and simple , project manager: yeah . industrial designer: but that's not what uh has been asked . project manager: i know , i know . industrial designer: so we should kick the board's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} yeah . although i think we {disfmarker} yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already . industrial designer: hmm . project manager: um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people . industrial designer: yes . project manager: um but uh i agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . definitely not , no . {vocalsound} it's not that innovative . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: or however you s pronounce that . user interface: yeah , too bad . {vocalsound} project manager: um so , okay . {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} oh , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: this is the wrong one . so uh that means redesign . {vocalsound} we do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product . user interface: mm-hmm . project manager: um {vocalsound} but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . um i'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . i guess {disfmarker} marketing: um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: yeah , that's true . industrial designer: well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good . project manager: we l we can learn . yeah . yeah . i agree . industrial designer: so {disfmarker} project manager: well {disfmarker} industrial designer: is it fancy ? {vocalsound} project manager: i d it is it is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: yay . is it ? is it fancy ? project manager: yeah , i think so . user interface: um the yellow rubber , i think so . industrial designer: i think so . project manager: {vocalsound} you like the rubber , uh roo . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} i'm into it . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: so uh one ? project manager: yeah . industrial designer: but it's not that fancy . project manager: no , i'll i'll i'll give it a two . industrial designer: i mean i think uh {disfmarker} i think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing {disfmarker} the casing . it would be even more {disfmarker} project manager: you like tita {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: oh , you really like titanium . i'm i'm into it . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: that's a flavour as well . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: it has flavour . yes , that's right . {vocalsound} you should taste it . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} right . um {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: yeah , i know , marketing: is it uh {disfmarker} project manager: but but it {disfmarker} but that's fancy in the way um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i mean fancy has has a lot of {disfmarker} industrial designer: it has to do with fashion , i guess . project manager: yeah . user interface: it's trendy trendy , fun {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: so do {disfmarker} marketing: and w user interface: yeah . marketing: yeah , w what they want {disfmarker} wanted was uh colours and soft materials . project manager: yeah . marketing: so in that way {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it's fancy . project manager: it applies . it {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: well , just {vocalsound} give it a two . industrial designer: okay . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: yes . user interface: it's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: i think i th i think it would have been {disfmarker} i would have think {disfmarker} uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . it would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar . user interface: yeah , but that's sti that's uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: so {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't {disfmarker} we don't have the double-curved case . we w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . that's two out of three . so i believe uh we are close uh to two . industrial designer: yes . project manager: yeah , i i agree . industrial designer: yes , i agree too . it's okay . we did {gap} {disfmarker} yes , we did good . marketing: okay , and uh was it innovative ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: well , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: with the voice recognition feature and uh {disfmarker} user interface: but that's not in it . ov or can we {disfmarker} marketing: yep . project manager: no , we are evaluating this this uh design now . this prototype . industrial designer: well , let's let's {disfmarker} this product . user interface: okay . industrial designer: so i i i think it is . i think it's innovative . project manager: yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} and the scroll uh wheel . the solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , i think . industrial designer: no . it could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker} marketing: yeah , and uh {disfmarker} project manager: that would have been a thrill . industrial designer: yes , but {disfmarker} marketing: so uh also a uh two ? industrial designer: i think uh it's a two . project manager: yep . marketing: is it easy to use ? project manager: i'm not sure . {vocalsound} i'm not sure . user interface: yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , i think . well , hard {disfmarker} it's not for the for the e for the elderly . they won't use it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} well , but there are two parts in this remote control . what you see here is is the basic part . everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: that's for a novice user . when you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . so in that in that way it is advanced , project manager: yeah . industrial designer: and i think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users . user interface: i think {disfmarker} i think a three . industrial designer: so uh {disfmarker} it's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} wouldn't give it more . project manager: uh i'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well . um {disfmarker} marketing: well the p the most important function is easy to use . the the zapping , channel switching , volume . but the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . project manager: okay . uh two or three ? three ? wha wh what would be your guess ? i mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . industrial designer: okay . project manager: it's the uh it's it's overall . is the device easy to use ? industrial designer: yeah , that's right . you're right in that , but i {gap} {disfmarker} i guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , project manager: yeah . industrial designer: because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: so {disfmarker} project manager: um {disfmarker} okay . industrial designer: after all , i think {disfmarker} personally i would give a two . but {disfmarker} project manager: uh roo , a three ? user interface: yep . project manager: ruud ? marketing: good question . uh i'll go uh for the two . project manager: okay . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: so , it's two , two and three . two threes . so that's ten . project manager: so i could make it e easy ? user interface: if you make it a four it will be three in general . industrial designer: so that's w no , two and a half . user interface: if he makes it a four . not a three . industrial designer: six and four . six and four is ten . divided by four is two and a half . so {disfmarker} user interface: darn . nee . industrial designer: yes . {vocalsound} marketing: hmm ? huh ? project manager: roo . {vocalsound} user interface: a seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} no . marketing: yeah . i yeah {gap} . user interface: a four and a three together . industrial designer: {vocalsound} four ? user interface: yeah , you have a two , he has a two . three ? marketing: yeah , industrial designer: two ? marketing: two , two , three {disfmarker} project manager: no , user interface: and a three ? project manager: i haven't said anything yet . user interface: nee . i know . marketing: no . {vocalsound} project manager: okay , but if i would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . divided by four is two point five . industrial designer: divided by four . user interface: yes . so if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three . then you would make a four . if you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: but i'm filling in a three . industrial designer: that's not even {disfmarker} project manager: does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: but that's not possible to fill in , project manager: yes , it is . industrial designer: so we have to round it . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} is it easy to find ? {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} i have a veto . {vocalsound} exactly . it's not about the content , it's about {disfmarker} okay , um is it easy to f yeah , definitely . user interface: yeah , industrial designer: yes . user interface: we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . industrial designer: it it most definitely is {disfmarker} it's very easy . project manager: yeah , or beeps or {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: yes . maybe {disfmarker} uh i i think i think {disfmarker} project manager: i'm here , i'm here . {vocalsound} industrial designer: something like that . maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing i'm here . so something like that . project manager: yeah . yeah . user interface: but even without it {disfmarker} project manager: yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: well , i uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: so , i th project manager: we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but i personally give it a one . user", "summary": " user interface first raised the issue of the ease of use with the remote

{"id": NaN, "documents": [" summarize the discussion about out-of-court disposals. vikki howells am: thank you. i've got one further series of questions around out-of-court disposals, which you've already mentioned briefly. in your written evidence, you say there's ongoing work exploring diversion rather than prosecution in respect of this bill. firstly, could you tell us a bit more about the work that is being done to explore this as an option? barry hughes: we've been working with the national police chiefs' council. their lead is deputy chief constable sara glen. she is responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals. there is quite a range, and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved. i must say, this is primarily a matter for the police, because there are a great many offences or reports of crime that do not reach the cps because they are dealt with by way of an out-of-court disposal. any case that the police refer to us for a charging decision is going to be something\u2014. there's a document called the director's guidance on charging, which is issued by the director of public prosecutions, which sets out offences the police may charge and offences the cps may charge. offences that the police refer to us for a charging decision will generally be offences where they feel that there should be a prosecution rather than an out-of-court disposal. there may be cases where it's genuinely very difficult to assess what's the best approach, in which case we will have a conversation with them, a meaningful conversation, about what's the best way to approach that particular case. there will also be cases, and we see these not that rarely, where the police will bring a case to us for a prosecution on the basis that satisfies the evidential stage and satisfies the public interest stage, and we take a different view on the public interest stage. so, we might say\u2014for example, it involves a 15-year-old youth\u2014we\u00a0 think that diversion from the criminal justice system is a better disposal and we decide not to prosecute. we aren't responsible for administering\u00a0the out-of-court disposal or indeed monitoring compliance with that disposal, if, for example, it has conditions attached, such as repayment of the damage caused to a window or a front gate. that's not our responsibility\u2014that will fall to the police\u2014but we can decide that an out-of-court disposal is a more appropriate disposal than a prosecution. does that help? vikki howells am: it does. one final question on that then: creating a body of out-of-court disposals that are specific to this bill\u2014how would that actually work in practice do you think, given the fact that the assembly's legislative competence to make provision on the face of the bill is limited?
