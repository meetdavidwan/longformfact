Lewis\nIllustrated by KELLY FREAS\nHerbert Hyrel\n  settled himself\nmore comfortably in his\neasy chair, extended his short legs\nfurther toward the fireplace, and let\nhis eyes travel cautiously in the general\ndirection of his wife.\nShe was in her chair as usual, her\nlong legs curled up beneath her,\nthe upper half of her face hidden\nin the bulk of her personalized,\nthree-dimensional telovis. The telovis,\nof a stereoscopic nature, seemingly\nbrought the performers with\nall their tinsel and color directly\ninto the room of the watcher.\nHyrel had no way of seeing into\nthe plastic affair she wore, but he\nguessed from the expression on the\nlower half of her face that she was\nwatching one of the newer black-market\nsex-operas. In any event,\nthere would be no sound, movement,\nor sign of life from her for\nthe next three hours. To break the\nthread of the play for even a moment\nwould ruin all the previous\nemotional build-up.\nThere had been a time when he\nhated her for those long and silent\nevenings, lonely hours during\nwhich he was completely ignored.\nIt was different now, however, for\nthose hours furnished him with\ntime for an escape of his own.\nHis lips curled into a tight smile\nand his right hand fondled the unobtrusive\nswitch beneath his trouser\nleg. He did not press the switch.\nHe would wait a few minutes\nlonger. But it was comforting to\nknow that it was there, exhilarating\nto know that he could escape\nfor a few hours by a mere flick of\nhis finger.\nHe let his eyes stray to the dim\nlight of the artificial flames in the\nfireplace. His hate for her was not\nbounded merely by those lonely\nhours she had forced upon him.\nNo, it was far more encompassing.\nHe hated her with a deep, burning\nsavagery that was deadly in its\npassion. He hated her for her\nmoney, the money she kept securely\nfrom him. He hated her for the\npaltry allowance she doled out to\nhim, as if he were an irresponsible\nchild. It was as if she were constantly\nreminding him in every\nglance and gesture, \"I made a bad\nbargain when I married you. You\nwanted me, my money, everything,\nand had nothing to give in return\nexcept your own doltish self. You\nset a trap for me, baited with lies\nand a false front. Now you are\ncaught in your own trap and will\nremain there like a mouse to eat\nfrom my hand whatever crumbs I\nstoop to give you.\"\nBut some day his hate would be\nappeased. Yes, some day soon he\nwould kill her!\nHe shot a sideways glance at her,\nwondering if by chance she suspected.... She\nhadn't moved. Her\nlips were pouted into a half smile;\nthe sex-opera had probably\nreached one of its more pleasurable\nmoments.\nHyrel let his eyes shift back to\nthe fireplace again. Yes, he would\nkill her. Then he would claim\na rightful share of her money, be\nrid of her debasing dominance.\nHe let the\n  thought run\naround through his head, savoring\nit with mental taste buds.\nHe would not kill her tonight. No,\nnor the next night. He would wait,\nwait until he had sucked the last\nmeasure of pleasure from the\nthought.\nIt was like having a bottle of\nrare old wine on a shelf where it\ncould be viewed daily. It was like\nbeing able to pause again and\nagain before the bottle, hold it up\nto the light, and say to it, \"Some\nday, when my desire for you has\nreached the ultimate, I shall unstopper\nyou quietly and sip you\nslowly to the last soul-satisfying\ndrop.\" As long as the bottle remained\nthere upon the shelf it was\nsymbolic of that pleasurable moment....\nHe snapped out of his reverie\nand realized he had been wasting\nprecious moments. There would be\ntime enough tomorrow for gloating.\nTonight, there were other\nthings to do. Pleasurable things.\nHe remembered the girl he had\nmet the night before, and smiled\nsmugly. Perhaps she would be\nawaiting him even now. If not,\nthere would be another one....\nHe settled himself deeper into\nthe chair, glanced once more at his\nwife, then let his head lean comfortably\nback against the chair's\nheadrest. His hand upon his thigh\nfelt the thin mesh that cloaked his\nbody beneath his clothing like a\nsheer stocking. His fingers went\nagain to the tiny switch. Again he\nhesitated.\nHerbert Hyrel knew no more\nabout the telporter suit he wore\nthan he did about the radio in the\ncorner, the TV set against the wall,\nor the personalized telovis his wife\nwas wearing. You pressed one of\nthe buttons on the radio; music\ncame out. You pressed a button\nand clicked a dial on the TV;\nmusic and pictures came out. You\npressed a button and made an adjustment\non the telovis; three-dimensional,\nemotion-colored pictures\nleaped into the room. You\npressed a tiny switch on the telporter\nsuit; you were whisked away to\na receiving set you had previously\nset up in secret.\nHe knew that the music and the\nimages of the performers on the\nTV and telovis were brought to his\nroom by some form of electrical impulse\nor wave while the actual musicians\nand performers remained in\nthe studio. He knew that when he\npressed the switch on his thigh\nsomething within him\u2014his ectoplasm,\nhigher self, the thing spirits\nuse for materialization, whatever\nits real name\u2014streamed out of him\nalong an invisible channel, leaving\nhis body behind in the chair in a\nconscious but dream-like state. His\nother self materialized in a small\ncabin in a hidden nook between a\nhighway and a river where he had\ninstalled the receiving set a month\nago.\nHe thought once more of the girl\nwho might be waiting for him,\nsmiled, and pressed the switch.\nThe dank air\n  of the cabin\nwas chill to Herbert Hyrel's\nnaked flesh. He fumbled through\nthe darkness for the clothing he\nkept there, found his shorts and\ntrousers, got hurriedly into them,\nthen flicked on a pocket lighter and\nignited a stub of candle upon the\ntable. By the wavering light, he finished\ndressing in the black satin\nclothing, the white shirt, the flowing\nnecktie and tam. He invoiced\nthe contents of his billfold. Not\nmuch. And his monthly pittance\nwas still two weeks away....\nHe had skimped for six months\nto salvage enough money from his\nallowance to make a down payment\non the telporter suit. Since\nthen, his expenses\u2014monthly payments\nfor the suit, cabin rent, costly\nliquor\u2014had forced him to place his\nnights of escape on strict ration. He\ncould not go on this way, he realized.\nNot now. Not since he had\nmet the girl. He had to have more\nmoney. Perhaps he could not afford\nthe luxury of leaving the wine\nbottle longer upon the shelf....\nRiverside Club, where Hyrel arrived\nby bus and a hundred yards\nof walking, was exclusive. It catered\nto a clientele that had but\nthree things in common: money, a\ndesire for utter self-abandonment,\nand a sales slip indicating ownership\nof a telporter suit. The club\nwas of necessity expensive, for self-telportation\nwas strictly illegal, and\npolice protection came high.\nHerbert Hyrel adjusted his white,\nsilken mask carefully at the door\nand shoved his sales slip through a\nsmall aperture where it was thoroughly\nscanned by unseen eyes. A\nbuzzer sounded an instant later, the\nlock on the door clicked, and Hyrel\npushed through into the exhilarating\nwarmth of music and laughter.\nThe main room was large. Hidden\nlights along the walls sent slow\nbeams of red, blue, vermillion,\ngreen, yellow and pink trailing\nacross the domed ceiling in a heterogeneous\npattern. The colored\nbeams mingled, diffused, spread,\nwere caught up by mirrors of various\ntints which diffused and mingled\nthe lights once more until the\nwhole effect was an ever-changing\npanorama of softly-melting shades.\nThe gay and bizarre costumes of\nthe masked revelers on the dance\nfloor and at the tables, unearthly in\nthemselves, were made even more\nso by the altering light. Music\nflooded the room from unseen\nsources. Laughter\u2014hysterical,\ndrunken, filled with utter abandonment\u2014came\nfrom the dance floor,\nthe tables, and the private booths\nand rooms hidden cleverly within\nthe walls.\nHyrel pushed himself to an unoccupied\ntable, sat down and ordered\na bottle of cheap whiskey. He\nwould have preferred champagne,\nbut his depleted finances forbade\nthe more discriminate taste.\nWhen his order arrived, he\npoured a glass tumbler half full\nand consumed it eagerly while his\neyes scanned the room in search of\nthe girl. He couldn't see her in the\ndim swirl of color. Had she arrived?\nPerhaps she was wearing a\ndifferent costume than she had the\nnight before. If so, recognition\nmight prove difficult.\nHe poured himself another drink,\npromising himself he would go in\nsearch of her when the liquor began\nto take effect.\nA woman clad in the revealing\ngarb of a Persian dancer threw an\narm about him from behind and\nkissed him on the cheek through\nthe veil which covered the lower\npart of her face.\n\"Hi, honey,\" she giggled into his\near. \"Havin' a time?\"\nHe reached for the white arm to\npull her to him, but she eluded his\ngrasp and reeled away into the\nwaiting arms of a tall toreador.\nHyrel gulped his whiskey and\nwatched her nestle into the arms of\nher partner and begin with him a\nsinuous, suggestive dance. The\nwhiskey had begun its warming effect,\nand he laughed.\nThis was the land of the lotus\neaters, the sanctuary of the escapists,\nthe haven of all who wished to\ncast off their shell of inhibition and\nbecome the thing they dreamed\nthemselves to be. Here one could\nbe among his own kind, an actor\nupon a gay stage, a gaudy butterfly\nmetamorphosed from the slug,\na knight of old.\nThe Persian dancing girl was\nprobably the wife of a boorish oaf\nwhose idea of romance was spending\nan evening telling his wife how\nhe came to be a successful bank\npresident. But she had found her\nmeans of escape. Perhaps she had\npleaded a sick headache and had\nretired to her room. And there upon\nthe bed now reposed her shell of\nreality while her inner self, the\nshadowy one, completely materialized,\nbecame an exotic thing from\nthe East in this never-never land.\nThe man, the toreador, had\nprobably closeted himself within his\nlibrary with a set of account books\nand had left strict orders not to be\ndisturbed until he had finished\nwith them.\nBoth would have terrific hangovers\nin the morning. But that, of\ncourse, would be fully compensated\nfor by the memories of the evening.\nHyrel chuckled. The situation\nstruck him as being funny: the\nshadowy self got drunk and had a\ngood time, and the outer husk suffered\nthe hangover in the morning.\nStrange. Strange how a device such\nas the telporter suit could cause the\nshadow of each bodily cell to leave\nthe body, materialize, and become\na reality in its own right. And\nyet ...\nHe looked\n  at the heel of his\nleft hand. There was a long,\nirregular scar there. It was the result\nof a cut he had received nearly\nthree weeks ago when he had\nfallen over this very table and had\nrammed his hand into a sliver of\nbroken champagne glass. Later that\nevening, upon re-telporting back\nhome, the pain of the cut had remained\nin his hand, but there was\nno sign of the cut itself on the hand\nof his outer self. The scar was peculiar\nto the shadowy body only.\nThere was something about the\nshadowy body that carried the\nhurts to the outer body, but not the\nscars....\nSudden laughter broke out near\nhim, and he turned quickly in that\ndirection. A group of gaily costumed\nrevelers was standing in a\nsemi-circle about a small mound of\nclothing upon the floor. It was the\ncostume of the toreador.\nHyrel laughed, too. It had happened\nmany times before\u2014a costume\nsuddenly left empty as its\nowner, due to a threat of discovery\nat home, had had to press the\nswitch in haste to bring his shadowy\nself\u2014and complete consciousness\u2014back\nto his outer self in a\nhurry.\nA waiter picked up the clothing.\nHe would put it safely away so that\nthe owner could claim it upon his\nnext visit to the club. Another\nwaiter placed a fresh bottle of\nwhiskey on the table before Hyrel,\nand Hyrel paid him for it.\nThe whiskey, reaching his head\nnow in surges of warm cheerfulness,\nwas filling him with abandonment,\ncourage, and a desire for\nmerriment. He pushed himself up\nfrom the table, joined the merry\nthrong, threw his arm about the\nPersian dancer, drew her close.\nThey began dancing slowly to\nthe throbbing rhythm, dancing and\nholding on to each other tightly.\nHyrel could feel her hot breath\nthrough her veil upon his neck, adding\nto the headiness of the liquor.\nHis feeling of depression and inferiority\nflowed suddenly from him.\nOnce again he was the all-conquering\nmale.\nHis arm trembled as it drew her\nstill closer to him and he began\ndancing directly and purposefully\ntoward the shadows of a clump of\nartificial palms near one corner of\nthe room. There was an exit to the\ngarden behind the palms.\nHalf way there they passed a secluded\nbooth from which protruded\na long leg clad in black\nmesh stocking. Hyrel paused as he\nrecognized that part of the costume.\nIt was she! The girl! The\none he had met so briefly the night\nbefore!\nHis arm slid away from the Persian\ndancer, took hold of the mesh-clad\nleg, and pulled. A female form\nfollowed the leg from the booth\nand fell into his arms. He held her\ntightly, kissed her white neck, let\nher perfume send his thoughts reeling.\n\"Been looking for me, honey?\"\nshe whispered, her voice deep and\nthroaty.\n\"You know it!\"\nHe began whisking her away toward\nthe palms. The Persian girl\nwas pulled into the booth.\nYes, she was wearing the same\ncostume she had worn the night\nbefore, that of a can-can dancer of\nthe 90's. The mesh hose that encased\nher shapely legs were held up\nby flowered supporters in such a\nmanner as to leave four inches of\nwhite leg exposed between hose top\nand lacy panties. Her skirt, frilled\nto suggest innumerable petticoats,\nfell away at each hip, leaving the\nfront open to expose the full length\nof legs. She wore a wig of platinum\nhair encrusted with jewels that\nsparkled in the lights. Her jewel-studded\nmask was as white as her\nhair and covered the upper half of\nher face, except for the large\nalmond slits for her eyes. A white\npurse, jewel crusted, dangled from\none arm.\nHe stopped once before reaching\nthe palms, drew her closer, kissed\nher long and ardently. Then he began\npulling her on again.\nShe drew back when they\nreached the shelter of the fronds.\n\"Champagne, first,\" she whispered\nhuskily into his ear.\nHis heart sank. He had very little\nmoney left. Well, it might buy\na cheap brand....\nShe sipped\n  her champagne\nslowly and provocatively across\nthe table from him. Her eyes sparkled\nbehind the almond slits of her\nmask, caught the color changes and\ncast them back. She was wearing\ncontact lenses of a garish green.\nHe wished she would hurry with\nher drink. He had horrible visions\nof his wife at home taking off her\ntelovis and coming to his chair. He\nwould then have to press the\nswitch that would jerk his shadowy\nself back along its invisible connecting\ncord, jerk him back and\nleave but a small mound of clothes\nupon the chair at the table.\nDeep depression laid hold of\nhim. He would not be able to see\nher after tonight until he received\nhis monthly dole two weeks hence.\nShe wouldn't wait that long. Someone\nelse would have her.\nUnless ...\nYes, he knew now that he was\ngoing to kill his wife as soon as the\nopportunity presented itself. It\nwould be a simple matter. With the\naid of the telporter suit, he could\nestablish an iron-clad alibi.\nHe took a long drink of whiskey\nand looked at the dancers about\nhim. Sight of their gay costumes\nheightened his depression. He was\nwearing a cheap suit of satin, all he\ncould afford. But some day soon he\nwould show them! Some time soon\nhe would be dressed as gaily....\n\"Something troubling you,\nhoney?\"\nHis gaze shot back to her and\nshe blurred slightly before his eyes.\n\"No. Nothing at all!\" He summoned\na sickly smile and clutched\nher hand in his. \"Come on. Let's\ndance.\"\nHe drew her from the chair and\ninto his arms. She melted toward\nhim as if desiring to become a part\nof him. A tremor of excitement\nsurged through him and threatened\nto turn his knees into quivering\njelly. He could not make his\nfeet conform to the flooding\nrhythm of the music. He half stumbled,\nhalf pushed her along past the\nbooths.\nIn the shelter of the palms he\ndrew her savagely to him. \"Let's\u2014let's\ngo outside.\" His voice was little\nmore than a croak.\n\"But, honey!\" She pushed herself\naway, her low voice maddening\nhim. \"Don't you have a private\nroom? A girl doesn't like to be\ntaken outside....\"\nHer words bit into his brain like\nthe blade of a hot knife.\nNo, he didn't have a private\nroom at the club like the others. A\nprivate room for his telporter receiver,\na private room where he\ncould take a willing guest. No! He\ncouldn't afford it! No!\nNo!\nNO!\nHis lot was a cheap suit of satin!\nCheap whiskey! Cheap champagne!\nA cheap shack by the\nriver....\nAn inarticulate cry escaped his\ntwisted lips. He clutched her roughly\nto him and dragged her through\nthe door and into the moonlight,\nwhiskey and anger lending him\nbrutal strength.\nHe pulled her through the deserted\ngarden.\nAll the others had\nprivate rooms!\nHe pulled her to\nthe far end, behind a clump of\nsquatty firs. His hands clawed at\nher. He tried to smother her mouth\nwith kisses.\nShe eluded him deftly. \"But,\nhoney\n!\" Her voice had gone deeper\ninto her throat. \"I just want to be\nsure about things. If you can't afford\none of the private rooms\u2014if\nyou can't afford to show me a good\ntime\u2014if you can't come here real\noften ...\"\nThe whiskey pounded and\nthrobbed at his brain like blows\nfrom an unseen club. His ego\ncurled and twisted within him like\na headless serpent.\n\"I'll have money!\" he shouted,\nstruggling to hold her. \"I'll have\nplenty of money! After tonight!\"\n\"Then we'll wait,\" she said.\n\"We'll wait until tomorrow night.\"\n\"No!\" he screamed. \"You don't\nbelieve me! You're like the others!\nYou think I'm no good! But I'll\nshow you! I'll show all of you!\"\nShe had gone\n  coldly rigid in\nhis arms, unyielding.\nMadness added to the pounding\nin his brain. Tears welled into his\neyes.\n\"I'll show you! I'll kill her! Then\nI'll have money!\" The hands\nclutching her shoulders shook her\ndrunkenly. \"You wait here! I'll go\nhome and kill her now! Then I'll\nbe back!\"\n\"Silly boy!\" Her low laughter\nrang hollowly in his ears. \"And just\nwho is it you are going to kill?\"\n\"My wife!\" he cried. \"My wife!\nI'll ...\"\nA sudden sobering thought\nstruck him. He was talking too\nmuch. And he wasn't making sense.\nHe shouldn't be telling her this.\nAnyway, he couldn't get the money\ntonight even if he did kill his wife.\n\"And so you are going to kill\nyour wife....\"\nHe blinked the tears from his\neyes. His chest was heaving, his\nheart pounding. He looked at her\nshimmering form. \"Y-yes,\" he whispered.\nHer eyes glinted strangely in the\nlight of the moon. Her handbag\nglinted as she opened it, and something\nshe took from it glittered\ncoldly in her hand.\n\"Fool!\"\nThe first shot tore squarely\nthrough his heart. And while he\nstood staring at her, mouth agape,\na second shot burned its way\nthrough his bewildered brain.\nMrs. Herbert Hyrel\n  removed\nthe telovis from her\nhead and laid it carefully aside.\nShe uncoiled her long legs from beneath\nher, walked to her husband's\nchair, and stood for a long moment\nlooking down at him, her lips\ndrawn back in contempt. Then she\nbent over him and reached down\nhis thigh until her fingers contacted\nthe small switch.\nSeconds later, a slight tremor\nshook Hyrel's body. His eyes\nsnapped open, air escaped his lungs,\nhis lower jaw sagged inanely, and\nhis head lolled to one side.\nShe stood a moment longer,\nwatching his eyes become glazed\nand sightless. Then she walked to\nthe telephone.\n\"Police?\" she said. \"This is Mrs.\nHerbert Hyrel. Something horrible\nhas happened to my husband.\nPlease come over immediately.\nBring a doctor.\"\nShe hung up, went to her bathroom,\nstripped off her clothing,\nand slid carefully out of her telporter\nsuit. This she folded neatly\nand tucked away into the false back\nof the medicine cabinet. She found\na fresh pair of blue, plastifur pajamas\nand got into them.\nShe was just arriving back into\nthe living room, tying the cord of\nher dressing gown about her slim\nwaist, when she heard the sound of\nthe police siren out front.\nTHE END\nTranscriber's Note:\nThis etext was produced from\nIf Worlds of Science Fiction\nJuly 1953.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\ncopyright on this publication was renewed.

Music\nflooded the room from unseen\nsources. Laughter\u2014hysterical,\ndrunken, filled with utter abandonment\u2014came\nfrom the dance floor,\nthe tables, and the private booths\nand rooms hidden cleverly within\nthe walls.\nHyrel pushed himself to an unoccupied\ntable, sat down and ordered\na bottle of cheap whiskey. He\nwould have preferred champagne,\nbut his depleted finances forbade\nthe more discriminate taste.\nWhen his order arrived, he\npoured a glass tumbler half full\nand consumed it eagerly while his\neyes scanned the room in search of\nthe girl. He couldn't see her in the\ndim swirl of color. Had she arrived?\nPerhaps she was wearing a\ndifferent costume than she had the\nnight before. If so, recognition\nmight prove difficult.\nHe poured himself another drink,\npromising himself he would go in\nsearch of her when the liquor began\nto take effect.\nA woman clad in the revealing\ngarb of a Persian dancer threw an\narm about him from behind and\nkissed him on the cheek through\nthe veil which covered the lower\npart of her face.\n\"Hi, honey,\" she giggled into his\near. \"Havin' a time?\"\nHe reached for the white arm to\npull her to him, but she eluded his\ngrasp and reeled away into the\nwaiting arms of a tall toreador.\nHyrel gulped his whiskey and\nwatched her nestle into the arms of\nher partner and begin with him a\nsinuous, suggestive dance. The\nwhiskey had begun its warming effect,\nand he laughed.\nThis was the land of the lotus\neaters, the sanctuary of the escapists,\nthe haven of all who wished to\ncast off their shell of inhibition and\nbecome the thing they dreamed\nthemselves to be. Here one could\nbe among his own kind, an actor\nupon a gay stage, a gaudy butterfly\nmetamorphosed from the slug,\na knight of old.\nThe Persian dancing girl was\nprobably the wife of a boorish oaf\nwhose idea of romance was spending\nan evening telling his wife how\nhe came to be a successful bank\npresident. But she had found her\nmeans of escape. Perhaps she had\npleaded a sick headache and had\nretired to her room. And there upon\nthe bed now reposed her shell of\nreality while her inner self, the\nshadowy one, completely materialized,\nbecame an exotic thing from\nthe East in this never-never land.\nThe man, the toreador, had\nprobably closeted himself within his\nlibrary with a set of account books\nand had left strict orders not to be\ndisturbed until he had finished\nwith them.\nBoth would have terrific hangovers\nin the morning. But that, of\ncourse, would be fully compensated\nfor by the memories of the evening.\nHyrel chuckled. The situation\nstruck him as being funny: the\nshadowy self got drunk and had a\ngood time, and the outer husk suffered\nthe hangover in the morning.\nStrange. Strange how a device such\nas the telporter suit could cause the\nshadow of each bodily cell to leave\nthe body, materialize, and become\na reality in its own right. And\nyet ...\nHe looked\n  at the heel of his\nleft hand. There was a long,\nirregular scar there. It was the result\nof a cut he had received nearly\nthree weeks ago when he had\nfallen over this very table and had\nrammed his hand into a sliver of\nbroken champagne glass. Later that\nevening, upon re-telporting back\nhome, the pain of the cut had remained\nin his hand, but there was\nno sign of the cut itself on the hand\nof his outer self. The scar was peculiar\nto the shadowy body only.\nThere was something about the\nshadowy body that carried the\nhurts to the outer body, but not the\nscars....\nSudden laughter broke out near\nhim, and he turned quickly in that\ndirection. A group of gaily costumed\nrevelers was standing in a\nsemi-circle about a small mound of\nclothing upon the floor. It was the\ncostume of the toreador.\nHyrel laughed, too. It had happened\nmany times before\u2014a costume\nsuddenly left empty as its\nowner, due to a threat of discovery\nat home, had had to press the\nswitch in haste to bring his shadowy\nself\u2014and complete consciousness\u2014back\nto his outer self in a\nhurry.\nA waiter picked up the clothing.\nHe would put it safely away so that\nthe owner could claim it upon his\nnext visit to the club. Another\nwaiter placed a fresh bottle of\nwhiskey on the table before Hyrel,\nand Hyrel paid him for it.\nThe whiskey, reaching his head\nnow in surges of warm cheerfulness,\nwas filling him with abandonment,\ncourage, and a desire for\nmerriment. He pushed himself up\nfrom the table, joined the merry\nthrong, threw his arm about the\nPersian dancer, drew her close.\nThey began dancing slowly to\nthe throbbing rhythm, dancing and\nholding on to each other tightly.\nHyrel could feel her hot breath\nthrough her veil upon his neck, adding\nto the headiness of the liquor.\nHis feeling of depression and inferiority\nflowed suddenly from him.\nOnce again he was the all-conquering\nmale.\nHis arm trembled as it drew her\nstill closer to him and he began\ndancing directly and purposefully\ntoward the shadows of a clump of\nartificial palms near one corner of\nthe room. There was an exit to the\ngarden behind the palms.\nHalf way there they passed a secluded\nbooth from which protruded\na long leg clad in black\nmesh stocking. Hyrel paused as he\nrecognized that part of the costume.\nIt was she! The girl! The\none he had met so briefly the night\nbefore!\nHis arm slid away from the Persian\ndancer, took hold of the mesh-clad\nleg, and pulled. A female form\nfollowed the leg from the booth\nand fell into his arms. He held her\ntightly, kissed her white neck, let\nher perfume send his thoughts reeling.\n\"Been looking for me, honey?\"\nshe whispered, her voice deep and\nthroaty.\n\"You know it!\"\nHe began whisking her away toward\nthe palms. The Persian girl\nwas pulled into the booth.\nYes, she was wearing the same\ncostume she had worn the night\nbefore, that of a can-can dancer of\nthe 90's. The mesh hose that encased\nher shapely legs were held up\nby flowered supporters in such a\nmanner as to leave four inches of\nwhite leg exposed between hose top\nand lacy panties. Her skirt, frilled\nto suggest innumerable petticoats,\nfell away at each hip, leaving the\nfront open to expose the full length\nof legs. She wore a wig of platinum\nhair encrusted with jewels that\nsparkled in the lights. Her jewel-studded\nmask was as white as her\nhair and covered the upper half of\nher face, except for the large\nalmond slits for her eyes. A white\npurse, jewel crusted, dangled from\none arm.\nHe stopped once before reaching\nthe palms, drew her closer, kissed\nher long and ardently. Then he began\npulling her on again.\nShe drew back when they\nreached the shelter of the fronds.\n\"Champagne, first,\" she whispered\nhuskily into his ear.\nHis heart sank. He had very little\nmoney left. Well, it might buy\na cheap brand....\nShe sipped\n  her champagne\nslowly and provocatively across\nthe table from him. Her eyes sparkled\nbehind the almond slits of her\nmask, caught the color changes and\ncast them back. She was wearing\ncontact lenses of a garish green.\nHe wished she would hurry with\nher drink. He had horrible visions\nof his wife at home taking off her\ntelovis and coming to his chair. He\nwould then have to press the\nswitch that would jerk his shadowy\nself back along its invisible connecting\ncord, jerk him back and\nleave but a small mound of clothes\nupon the chair at the table.\nDeep depression laid hold of\nhim. He would not be able to see\nher after tonight until he received\nhis monthly dole two weeks hence.\nShe wouldn't wait that long. Someone\nelse would have her.\nUnless ...\nYes, he knew now that he was\ngoing to kill his wife as soon as the\nopportunity presented itself. It\nwould be a simple matter. With the\naid of the telporter suit, he could\nestablish an iron-clad alibi.\nHe took a long drink of whiskey\nand looked at the dancers about\nhim. Sight of their gay costumes\nheightened his depression. He was\nwearing a cheap suit of satin, all he\ncould afford. But some day soon he\nwould show them! Some time soon\nhe would be dressed as gaily....\n\"Something troubling you,\nhoney?\"\nHis gaze shot back to her and\nshe blurred slightly before his eyes.\n\"No. Nothing at all!\" He summoned\na sickly smile and clutched\nher hand in his. \"Come on. Let's\ndance.\"\nHe drew her from the chair and\ninto his arms. She melted toward\nhim as if desiring to become a part\nof him. A tremor of excitement\nsurged through him and threatened\nto turn his knees into quivering\njelly. He could not make his\nfeet conform to the flooding\nrhythm of the music. He half stumbled,\nhalf pushed her along past the\nbooths.\nIn the shelter of the palms he\ndrew her savagely to him. \"Let's\u2014let's\ngo outside.\" His voice was little\nmore than a croak.\n\"But, honey!\" She pushed herself\naway, her low voice maddening\nhim. \"Don't you have a private\nroom? A girl doesn't like to be\ntaken outside....\"\nHer words bit into his brain like\nthe blade of a hot knife.\nNo, he didn't have a private\nroom at the club like the others. A\nprivate room for his telporter receiver,\na private room where he\ncould take a willing guest. No! He\ncouldn't afford it! No!\nNo!\nNO!\nHis lot was a cheap suit of satin!\nCheap whiskey! Cheap champagne!\nA cheap shack by the\nriver....\nAn inarticulate cry escaped his\ntwisted lips. He clutched her roughly\nto him and dragged her through\nthe door and into the moonlight,\nwhiskey and anger lending him\nbrutal strength.\nHe pulled her through the deserted\ngarden.\nAll the others had\nprivate rooms!\nHe pulled her to\nthe far end, behind a clump of\nsquatty firs. His hands clawed at\nher. He tried to smother her mouth\nwith kisses.\nShe eluded him deftly. \"But,\nhoney\n!\" Her voice had gone deeper\ninto her throat. \"I just want to be\nsure about things. If you can't afford\none of the private rooms\u2014if\nyou can't afford to show me a good\ntime\u2014if you can't come here real\noften ...\"\nThe whiskey pounded and\nthrobbed at his brain like blows\nfrom an unseen club. His ego\ncurled and twisted within him like\na headless serpent.\n\"I'll have money!\" he shouted,\nstruggling to hold her. \"I'll have\nplenty of money! After tonight!\"\n\"Then we'll wait,\" she said.\n\"We'll wait until tomorrow night.\"\n\"No!\" he screamed. \"You don't\nbelieve me! You're like the others!\nYou think I'm no good! But I'll\nshow you! I'll show all of you!\"\nShe had gone\n  coldly rigid in\nhis arms, unyielding.\nMadness added to the pounding\nin his brain. Tears welled into his\neyes.\n\"I'll show you! I'll kill her! Then\nI'll have money!\" The hands\nclutching her shoulders shook her\ndrunkenly. \"You wait here! I'll go\nhome and kill her now! Then I'll\nbe back!\"\n\"Silly boy!\" Her low laughter\nrang hollowly in his ears. \"And just\nwho is it you are going to kill?\"\n\"My wife!\" he cried. \"My wife!\nI'll ...\"\nA sudden sobering thought\nstruck him. He was talking too\nmuch. And he wasn't making sense.\nHe shouldn't be telling her this.\nAnyway, he couldn't get the money\ntonight even if he did kill his wife.\n\"And so you are going to kill\nyour wife....\"\nHe blinked the tears from his\neyes. His chest was heaving, his\nheart pounding. He looked at her\nshimmering form. \"Y-yes,\" he whispered.\nHer eyes glinted strangely in the\nlight of the moon. Her handbag\nglinted as she opened it, and something\nshe took from it glittered\ncoldly in her hand.\n\"Fool!\"\nThe first shot tore squarely\nthrough his heart. And while he\nstood staring at her, mouth agape,\na second shot burned its way\nthrough his bewildered brain.\nMrs. Herbert Hyrel\n  removed\nthe telovis from her\nhead and laid it carefully aside.\nShe uncoiled her long legs from beneath\nher, walked to her husband's\nchair, and stood for a long moment\nlooking down at him, her lips\ndrawn back in contempt. Then she\nbent over him and reached down\nhis thigh until her fingers contacted\nthe small switch.\nSeconds later, a slight tremor\nshook Hyrel's body. His eyes\nsnapped open, air escaped his lungs,\nhis lower jaw sagged inanely, and\nhis head lolled to one side.\nShe stood a moment longer,\nwatching his eyes become glazed\nand sightless. Then she walked to\nthe telephone.\n\"Police?\" she said. \"This is Mrs.\nHerbert Hyrel. Something horrible\nhas happened to my husband.\nPlease come over immediately.\nBring a doctor.\"\nShe hung up, went to her bathroom,\nstripped off her clothing,\nand slid carefully out of her telporter\nsuit. This she folded neatly\nand tucked away into the false back\nof the medicine cabinet. She found\na fresh pair of blue, plastifur pajamas\nand got into them.\nShe was just arriving back into\nthe living room, tying the cord of\nher dressing gown about her slim\nwaist, when she heard the sound of\nthe police siren out front.\nTHE END\nTranscriber's Note:\nThis etext was produced from\nIf Worlds of Science Fiction\nJuly 1953.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\ncopyright on this publication was renewed.

Lewis\nIllustrated by KELLY FREAS\nHerbert Hyrel\n  settled himself\nmore comfortably in his\neasy chair, extended his short legs\nfurther toward the fireplace, and let\nhis eyes travel cautiously in the general\ndirection of his wife.\nShe was in her chair as usual, her\nlong legs curled up beneath her,\nthe upper half of her face hidden\nin the bulk of her personalized,\nthree-dimensional telovis. The telovis,\nof a stereoscopic nature, seemingly\nbrought the performers with\nall their tinsel and color directly\ninto the room of the watcher.\nHyrel had no way of seeing into\nthe plastic affair she wore, but he\nguessed from the expression on the\nlower half of her face that she was\nwatching one of the newer black-market\nsex-operas. In any event,\nthere would be no sound, movement,\nor sign of life from her for\nthe next three hours. To break the\nthread of the play for even a moment\nwould ruin all the previous\nemotional build-up.\nThere had been a time when he\nhated her for those long and silent\nevenings, lonely hours during\nwhich he was completely ignored.\nIt was different now, however, for\nthose hours furnished him with\ntime for an escape of his own.\nHis lips curled into a tight smile\nand his right hand fondled the unobtrusive\nswitch beneath his trouser\nleg. He did not press the switch.\nHe would wait a few minutes\nlonger. But it was comforting to\nknow that it was there, exhilarating\nto know that he could escape\nfor a few hours by a mere flick of\nhis finger.\nHe let his eyes stray to the dim\nlight of the artificial flames in the\nfireplace. His hate for her was not\nbounded merely by those lonely\nhours she had forced upon him.\nNo, it was far more encompassing.\nHe hated her with a deep, burning\nsavagery that was deadly in its\npassion. He hated her for her\nmoney, the money she kept securely\nfrom him. He hated her for the\npaltry allowance she doled out to\nhim, as if he were an irresponsible\nchild. It was as if she were constantly\nreminding him in every\nglance and gesture, \"I made a bad\nbargain when I married you. You\nwanted me, my money, everything,\nand had nothing to give in return\nexcept your own doltish self. You\nset a trap for me, baited with lies\nand a false front. Now you are\ncaught in your own trap and will\nremain there like a mouse to eat\nfrom my hand whatever crumbs I\nstoop to give you.\"\nBut some day his hate would be\nappeased. Yes, some day soon he\nwould kill her!\nHe shot a sideways glance at her,\nwondering if by chance she suspected.... She\nhadn't moved. Her\nlips were pouted into a half smile;\nthe sex-opera had probably\nreached one of its more pleasurable\nmoments.\nHyrel let his eyes shift back to\nthe fireplace again. Yes, he would\nkill her. Then he would claim\na rightful share of her money, be\nrid of her debasing dominance.\nHe let the\n  thought run\naround through his head, savoring\nit with mental taste buds.\nHe would not kill her tonight. No,\nnor the next night. He would wait,\nwait until he had sucked the last\nmeasure of pleasure from the\nthought.\nIt was like having a bottle of\nrare old wine on a shelf where it\ncould be viewed daily. It was like\nbeing able to pause again and\nagain before the bottle, hold it up\nto the light, and say to it, \"Some\nday, when my desire for you has\nreached the ultimate, I shall unstopper\nyou quietly and sip you\nslowly to the last soul-satisfying\ndrop.\" As long as the bottle remained\nthere upon the shelf it was\nsymbolic of that pleasurable moment....\nHe snapped out of his reverie\nand realized he had been wasting\nprecious moments. There would be\ntime enough tomorrow for gloating.\nTonight, there were other\nthings to do. Pleasurable things.\nHe remembered the girl he had\nmet the night before, and smiled\nsmugly. Perhaps she would be\nawaiting him even now. If not,\nthere would be another one....\nHe settled himself deeper into\nthe chair, glanced once more at his\nwife, then let his head lean comfortably\nback against the chair's\nheadrest. His hand upon his thigh\nfelt the thin mesh that cloaked his\nbody beneath his clothing like a\nsheer stocking. His fingers went\nagain to the tiny switch. Again he\nhesitated.\nHerbert Hyrel knew no more\nabout the telporter suit he wore\nthan he did about the radio in the\ncorner, the TV set against the wall,\nor the personalized telovis his wife\nwas wearing. You pressed one of\nthe buttons on the radio; music\ncame out. You pressed a button\nand clicked a dial on the TV;\nmusic and pictures came out. You\npressed a button and made an adjustment\non the telovis; three-dimensional,\nemotion-colored pictures\nleaped into the room. You\npressed a tiny switch on the telporter\nsuit; you were whisked away to\na receiving set you had previously\nset up in secret.\nHe knew that the music and the\nimages of the performers on the\nTV and telovis were brought to his\nroom by some form of electrical impulse\nor wave while the actual musicians\nand performers remained in\nthe studio. He knew that when he\npressed the switch on his thigh\nsomething within him\u2014his ectoplasm,\nhigher self, the thing spirits\nuse for materialization, whatever\nits real name\u2014streamed out of him\nalong an invisible channel, leaving\nhis body behind in the chair in a\nconscious but dream-like state. His\nother self materialized in a small\ncabin in a hidden nook between a\nhighway and a river where he had\ninstalled the receiving set a month\nago.\nHe thought once more of the girl\nwho might be waiting for him,\nsmiled, and pressed the switch.\nThe dank air\n  of the cabin\nwas chill to Herbert Hyrel's\nnaked flesh. He fumbled through\nthe darkness for the clothing he\nkept there, found his shorts and\ntrousers, got hurriedly into them,\nthen flicked on a pocket lighter and\nignited a stub of candle upon the\ntable. By the wavering light, he finished\ndressing in the black satin\nclothing, the white shirt, the flowing\nnecktie and tam. He invoiced\nthe contents of his billfold. Not\nmuch. And his monthly pittance\nwas still two weeks away....\nHe had skimped for six months\nto salvage enough money from his\nallowance to make a down payment\non the telporter suit. Since\nthen, his expenses\u2014monthly payments\nfor the suit, cabin rent, costly\nliquor\u2014had forced him to place his\nnights of escape on strict ration. He\ncould not go on this way, he realized.\nNot now. Not since he had\nmet the girl. He had to have more\nmoney. Perhaps he could not afford\nthe luxury of leaving the wine\nbottle longer upon the shelf....\nRiverside Club, where Hyrel arrived\nby bus and a hundred yards\nof walking, was exclusive. It catered\nto a clientele that had but\nthree things in common: money, a\ndesire for utter self-abandonment,\nand a sales slip indicating ownership\nof a telporter suit. The club\nwas of necessity expensive, for self-telportation\nwas strictly illegal, and\npolice protection came high.\nHerbert Hyrel adjusted his white,\nsilken mask carefully at the door\nand shoved his sales slip through a\nsmall aperture where it was thoroughly\nscanned by unseen eyes. A\nbuzzer sounded an instant later, the\nlock on the door clicked, and Hyrel\npushed through into the exhilarating\nwarmth of music and laughter.\nThe main room was large. Hidden\nlights along the walls sent slow\nbeams of red, blue, vermillion,\ngreen, yellow and pink trailing\nacross the domed ceiling in a heterogeneous\npattern. The colored\nbeams mingled, diffused, spread,\nwere caught up by mirrors of various\ntints which diffused and mingled\nthe lights once more until the\nwhole effect was an ever-changing\npanorama of softly-melting shades.\nThe gay and bizarre costumes of\nthe masked revelers on the dance\nfloor and at the tables, unearthly in\nthemselves, were made even more\nso by the altering light. Music\nflooded the room from unseen\nsources. Laughter\u2014hysterical,\ndrunken, filled with utter abandonment\u2014came\nfrom the dance floor,\nthe tables, and the private booths\nand rooms hidden cleverly within\nthe walls.\nHyrel pushed himself to an unoccupied\ntable, sat down and ordered\na bottle of cheap whiskey. He\nwould have preferred champagne,\nbut his depleted finances forbade\nthe more discriminate taste.\nWhen his order arrived, he\npoured a glass tumbler half full\nand consumed it eagerly while his\neyes scanned the room in search of\nthe girl. He couldn't see her in the\ndim swirl of color. Had she arrived?\nPerhaps she was wearing a\ndifferent costume than she had the\nnight before. If so, recognition\nmight prove difficult.\nHe poured himself another drink,\npromising himself he would go in\nsearch of her when the liquor began\nto take effect.\nA woman clad in the revealing\ngarb of a Persian dancer threw an\narm about him from behind and\nkissed him on the cheek through\nthe veil which covered the lower\npart of her face.\n\"Hi, honey,\" she giggled into his\near. \"Havin' a time?\"\nHe reached for the white arm to\npull her to him, but she eluded his\ngrasp and reeled away into the\nwaiting arms of a tall toreador.\nHyrel gulped his whiskey and\nwatched her nestle into the arms of\nher partner and begin with him a\nsinuous, suggestive dance. The\nwhiskey had begun its warming effect,\nand he laughed.\nThis was the land of the lotus\neaters, the sanctuary of the escapists,\nthe haven of all who wished to\ncast off their shell of inhibition and\nbecome the thing they dreamed\nthemselves to be. Here one could\nbe among his own kind, an actor\nupon a gay stage, a gaudy butterfly\nmetamorphosed from the slug,\na knight of old.\nThe Persian dancing girl was\nprobably the wife of a boorish oaf\nwhose idea of romance was spending\nan evening telling his wife how\nhe came to be a successful bank\npresident. But she had found her\nmeans of escape. Perhaps she had\npleaded a sick headache and had\nretired to her room. And there upon\nthe bed now reposed her shell of\nreality while her inner self, the\nshadowy one, completely materialized,\nbecame an exotic thing from\nthe East in this never-never land.\nThe man, the toreador, had\nprobably closeted himself within his\nlibrary with a set of account books\nand had left strict orders not to be\ndisturbed until he had finished\nwith them.\nBoth would have terrific hangovers\nin the morning. But that, of\ncourse, would be fully compensated\nfor by the memories of the evening.\nHyrel chuckled.

He pushed himself up\nfrom the table, joined the merry\nthrong, threw his arm about the\nPersian dancer, drew her close.\nThey began dancing slowly to\nthe throbbing rhythm, dancing and\nholding on to each other tightly.\nHyrel could feel her hot breath\nthrough her veil upon his neck, adding\nto the headiness of the liquor.\nHis feeling of depression and inferiority\nflowed suddenly from him.\nOnce again he was the all-conquering\nmale.\nHis arm trembled as it drew her\nstill closer to him and he began\ndancing directly and purposefully\ntoward the shadows of a clump of\nartificial palms near one corner of\nthe room.

Her eyes sparkled\nbehind the almond slits of her\nmask, caught the color changes and\ncast them back. She was wearing\ncontact lenses of a garish green.\nHe wished she would hurry with\nher drink. He had horrible visions\nof his wife at home taking off her\ntelovis and coming to his chair. He\nwould then have to press the\nswitch that would jerk his shadowy\nself back along its invisible connecting\ncord, jerk him back and\nleave but a small mound of clothes\nupon the chair at the table.\nDeep depression laid hold of\nhim.

With the\naid of the telporter suit, he could\nestablish an iron-clad alibi.\nHe took a long drink of whiskey\nand looked at the dancers about\nhim.

Some time soon\nhe would be dressed as gaily....\n\"Something troubling you,\nhoney?\"\nHis gaze shot back to her and\nshe blurred slightly before his eyes.\n\"No. Nothing at all!\" He summoned\na sickly smile and clutched\nher hand in his. \"Come on.

A tremor of excitement\nsurged through him and threatened\nto turn his knees into quivering\njelly. He could not make his\nfeet conform to the flooding\nrhythm of the music. He half stumbled,\nhalf pushed her along past the\nbooths.\nIn the shelter of the palms he\ndrew her savagely to him. \"Let's\u2014let's\ngo outside.\" His voice was little\nmore than a croak.\n\"But, honey!\" She pushed herself\naway, her low voice maddening\nhim. \"Don't you have a private\nroom?

Lewis\nIllustrated by KELLY FREAS\nHerbert Hyrel\n  settled himself\nmore comfortably in his\neasy chair, extended his short legs\nfurther toward the fireplace, and let\nhis eyes travel cautiously in the general\ndirection of his wife.\nShe was in her chair as usual, her\nlong legs curled up beneath her,\nthe upper half of her face hidden\nin the bulk of her personalized,\nthree-dimensional telovis. The telovis,\nof a stereoscopic nature, seemingly\nbrought the performers with\nall their tinsel and color directly\ninto the room of the watcher.\nHyrel had no way of seeing into\nthe plastic affair she wore, but he\nguessed from the expression on the\nlower half of her face that she was\nwatching one of the newer black-market\nsex-operas. In any event,\nthere would be no sound, movement,\nor sign of life from her for\nthe next three hours. To break the\nthread of the play for even a moment\nwould ruin all the previous\nemotional build-up.\nThere had been a time when he\nhated her for those long and silent\nevenings, lonely hours during\nwhich he was completely ignored.\nIt was different now, however, for\nthose hours furnished him with\ntime for an escape of his own.\nHis lips curled into a tight smile\nand his right hand fondled the unobtrusive\nswitch beneath his trouser\nleg. He did not press the switch.\nHe would wait a few minutes\nlonger. But it was comforting to\nknow that it was there, exhilarating\nto know that he could escape\nfor a few hours by a mere flick of\nhis finger.\nHe let his eyes stray to the dim\nlight of the artificial flames in the\nfireplace. His hate for her was not\nbounded merely by those lonely\nhours she had forced upon him.\nNo, it was far more encompassing.\nHe hated her with a deep, burning\nsavagery that was deadly in its\npassion. He hated her for her\nmoney, the money she kept securely\nfrom him. He hated her for the\npaltry allowance she doled out to\nhim, as if he were an irresponsible\nchild. It was as if she were constantly\nreminding him in every\nglance and gesture, \"I made a bad\nbargain when I married you. You\nwanted me, my money, everything,\nand had nothing to give in return\nexcept your own doltish self. You\nset a trap for me, baited with lies\nand a false front. Now you are\ncaught in your own trap and will\nremain there like a mouse to eat\nfrom my hand whatever crumbs I\nstoop to give you.\"\nBut some day his hate would be\nappeased. Yes, some day soon he\nwould kill her!\nHe shot a sideways glance at her,\nwondering if by chance she suspected.... She\nhadn't moved. Her\nlips were pouted into a half smile;\nthe sex-opera had probably\nreached one of its more pleasurable\nmoments.\nHyrel let his eyes shift back to\nthe fireplace again. Yes, he would\nkill her. Then he would claim\na rightful share of her money, be\nrid of her debasing dominance.\nHe let the\n  thought run\naround through his head, savoring\nit with mental taste buds.\nHe would not kill her tonight. No,\nnor the next night. He would wait,\nwait until he had sucked the last\nmeasure of pleasure from the\nthought.\nIt was like having a bottle of\nrare old wine on a shelf where it\ncould be viewed daily. It was like\nbeing able to pause again and\nagain before the bottle, hold it up\nto the light, and say to it, \"Some\nday, when my desire for you has\nreached the ultimate, I shall unstopper\nyou quietly and sip you\nslowly to the last soul-satisfying\ndrop.\" As long as the bottle remained\nthere upon the shelf it was\nsymbolic of that pleasurable moment....\nHe snapped out of his reverie\nand realized he had been wasting\nprecious moments. There would be\ntime enough tomorrow for gloating.\nTonight, there were other\nthings to do. Pleasurable things.\nHe remembered the girl he had\nmet the night before, and smiled\nsmugly. Perhaps she would be\nawaiting him even now. If not,\nthere would be another one....\nHe settled himself deeper into\nthe chair, glanced once more at his\nwife, then let his head lean comfortably\nback against the chair's\nheadrest. His hand upon his thigh\nfelt the thin mesh that cloaked his\nbody beneath his clothing like a\nsheer stocking. His fingers went\nagain to the tiny switch. Again he\nhesitated.\nHerbert Hyrel knew no more\nabout the telporter suit he wore\nthan he did about the radio in the\ncorner, the TV set against the wall,\nor the personalized telovis his wife\nwas wearing. You pressed one of\nthe buttons on the radio; music\ncame out. You pressed a button\nand clicked a dial on the TV;\nmusic and pictures came out. You\npressed a button and made an adjustment\non the telovis; three-dimensional,\nemotion-colored pictures\nleaped into the room. You\npressed a tiny switch on the telporter\nsuit; you were whisked away to\na receiving set you had previously\nset up in secret.\nHe knew that the music and the\nimages of the performers on the\nTV and telovis were brought to his\nroom by some form of electrical impulse\nor wave while the actual musicians\nand performers remained in\nthe studio. He knew that when he\npressed the switch on his thigh\nsomething within him\u2014his ectoplasm,\nhigher self, the thing spirits\nuse for materialization, whatever\nits real name\u2014streamed out of him\nalong an invisible channel, leaving\nhis body behind in the chair in a\nconscious but dream-like state. His\nother self materialized in a small\ncabin in a hidden nook between a\nhighway and a river where he had\ninstalled the receiving set a month\nago.\nHe thought once more of the girl\nwho might be waiting for him,\nsmiled, and pressed the switch.\nThe dank air\n  of the cabin\nwas chill to Herbert Hyrel's\nnaked flesh. He fumbled through\nthe darkness for the clothing he\nkept there, found his shorts and\ntrousers, got hurriedly into them,\nthen flicked on a pocket lighter and\nignited a stub of candle upon the\ntable. By the wavering light, he finished\ndressing in the black satin\nclothing, the white shirt, the flowing\nnecktie and tam. He invoiced\nthe contents of his billfold. Not\nmuch. And his monthly pittance\nwas still two weeks away....\nHe had skimped for six months\nto salvage enough money from his\nallowance to make a down payment\non the telporter suit. Since\nthen, his expenses\u2014monthly payments\nfor the suit, cabin rent, costly\nliquor\u2014had forced him to place his\nnights of escape on strict ration. He\ncould not go on this way, he realized.\nNot now. Not since he had\nmet the girl. He had to have more\nmoney. Perhaps he could not afford\nthe luxury of leaving the wine\nbottle longer upon the shelf....\nRiverside Club, where Hyrel arrived\nby bus and a hundred yards\nof walking, was exclusive. It catered\nto a clientele that had but\nthree things in common: money, a\ndesire for utter self-abandonment,\nand a sales slip indicating ownership\nof a telporter suit. The club\nwas of necessity expensive, for self-telportation\nwas strictly illegal, and\npolice protection came high.\nHerbert Hyrel adjusted his white,\nsilken mask carefully at the door\nand shoved his sales slip through a\nsmall aperture where it was thoroughly\nscanned by unseen eyes. A\nbuzzer sounded an instant later, the\nlock on the door clicked, and Hyrel\npushed through into the exhilarating\nwarmth of music and laughter.\nThe main room was large. Hidden\nlights along the walls sent slow\nbeams of red, blue, vermillion,\ngreen, yellow and pink trailing\nacross the domed ceiling in a heterogeneous\npattern. The colored\nbeams mingled, diffused, spread,\nwere caught up by mirrors of various\ntints which diffused and mingled\nthe lights once more until the\nwhole effect was an ever-changing\npanorama of softly-melting shades.\nThe gay and bizarre costumes of\nthe masked revelers on the dance\nfloor and at the tables, unearthly in\nthemselves, were made even more\nso by the altering light. Music\nflooded the room from unseen\nsources. Laughter\u2014hysterical,\ndrunken, filled with utter abandonment\u2014came\nfrom the dance floor,\nthe tables, and the private booths\nand rooms hidden cleverly within\nthe walls.\nHyrel pushed himself to an unoccupied\ntable, sat down and ordered\na bottle of cheap whiskey. He\nwould have preferred champagne,\nbut his depleted finances forbade\nthe more discriminate taste.\nWhen his order arrived, he\npoured a glass tumbler half full\nand consumed it eagerly while his\neyes scanned the room in search of\nthe girl. He couldn't see her in the\ndim swirl of color. Had she arrived?\nPerhaps she was wearing a\ndifferent costume than she had the\nnight before. If so, recognition\nmight prove difficult.\nHe poured himself another drink,\npromising himself he would go in\nsearch of her when the liquor began\nto take effect.\nA woman clad in the revealing\ngarb of a Persian dancer threw an\narm about him from behind and\nkissed him on the cheek through\nthe veil which covered the lower\npart of her face.\n\"Hi, honey,\" she giggled into his\near. \"Havin' a time?\"\nHe reached for the white arm to\npull her to him, but she eluded his\ngrasp and reeled away into the\nwaiting arms of a tall toreador.\nHyrel gulped his whiskey and\nwatched her nestle into the arms of\nher partner and begin with him a\nsinuous, suggestive dance. The\nwhiskey had begun its warming effect,\nand he laughed.\nThis was the land of the lotus\neaters, the sanctuary of the escapists,\nthe haven of all who wished to\ncast off their shell of inhibition and\nbecome the thing they dreamed\nthemselves to be. Here one could\nbe among his own kind, an actor\nupon a gay stage, a gaudy butterfly\nmetamorphosed from the slug,\na knight of old.\nThe Persian dancing girl was\nprobably the wife of a boorish oaf\nwhose idea of romance was spending\nan evening telling his wife how\nhe came to be a successful bank\npresident. But she had found her\nmeans of escape. Perhaps she had\npleaded a sick headache and had\nretired to her room. And there upon\nthe bed now reposed her shell of\nreality while her inner self, the\nshadowy one, completely materialized,\nbecame an exotic thing from\nthe East in this never-never land.\nThe man, the toreador, had\nprobably closeted himself within his\nlibrary with a set of account books\nand had left strict orders not to be\ndisturbed until he had finished\nwith them.\nBoth would have terrific hangovers\nin the morning. But that, of\ncourse, would be fully compensated\nfor by the memories of the evening.\nHyrel chuckled. The situation\nstruck him as being funny: the\nshadowy self got drunk and had a\ngood time, and the outer husk suffered\nthe hangover in the morning.\nStrange. Strange how a device such\nas the telporter suit could cause the\nshadow of each bodily cell to leave\nthe body, materialize, and become\na reality in its own right. And\nyet ...\nHe looked\n  at the heel of his\nleft hand. There was a long,\nirregular scar there. It was the result\nof a cut he had received nearly\nthree weeks ago when he had\nfallen over this very table and had\nrammed his hand into a sliver of\nbroken champagne glass. Later that\nevening, upon re-telporting back\nhome, the pain of the cut had remained\nin his hand, but there was\nno sign of the cut itself on the hand\nof his outer self. The scar was peculiar\nto the shadowy body only.\nThere was something about the\nshadowy body that carried the\nhurts to the outer body, but not the\nscars....\nSudden laughter broke out near\nhim, and he turned quickly in that\ndirection. A group of gaily costumed\nrevelers was standing in a\nsemi-circle about a small mound of\nclothing upon the floor. It was the\ncostume of the toreador.\nHyrel laughed, too. It had happened\nmany times before\u2014a costume\nsuddenly left empty as its\nowner, due to a threat of discovery\nat home, had had to press the\nswitch in haste to bring his shadowy\nself\u2014and complete consciousness\u2014back\nto his outer self in a\nhurry.\nA waiter picked up the clothing.\nHe would put it safely away so that\nthe owner could claim it upon his\nnext visit to the club. Another\nwaiter placed a fresh bottle of\nwhiskey on the table before Hyrel,\nand Hyrel paid him for it.\nThe whiskey, reaching his head\nnow in surges of warm cheerfulness,\nwas filling him with abandonment,\ncourage, and a desire for\nmerriment. He pushed himself up\nfrom the table, joined the merry\nthrong, threw his arm about the\nPersian dancer, drew her close.\nThey began dancing slowly to\nthe throbbing rhythm, dancing and\nholding on to each other tightly.\nHyrel could feel her hot breath\nthrough her veil upon his neck, adding\nto the headiness of the liquor.\nHis feeling of depression and inferiority\nflowed suddenly from him.\nOnce again he was the all-conquering\nmale.\nHis arm trembled as it drew her\nstill closer to him and he began\ndancing directly and purposefully\ntoward the shadows of a clump of\nartificial palms near one corner of\nthe room. There was an exit to the\ngarden behind the palms.\nHalf way there they passed a secluded\nbooth from which protruded\na long leg clad in black\nmesh stocking. Hyrel paused as he\nrecognized that part of the costume.\nIt was she! The girl! The\none he had met so briefly the night\nbefore!\nHis arm slid away from the Persian\ndancer, took hold of the mesh-clad\nleg, and pulled. A female form\nfollowed the leg from the booth\nand fell into his arms. He held her\ntightly, kissed her white neck, let\nher perfume send his thoughts reeling.\n\"Been looking for me, honey?\"\nshe whispered, her voice deep and\nthroaty.\n\"You know it!\"\nHe began whisking her away toward\nthe palms. The Persian girl\nwas pulled into the booth.\nYes, she was wearing the same\ncostume she had worn the night\nbefore, that of a can-can dancer of\nthe 90's. The mesh hose that encased\nher shapely legs were held up\nby flowered supporters in such a\nmanner as to leave four inches of\nwhite leg exposed between hose top\nand lacy panties. Her skirt, frilled\nto suggest innumerable petticoats,\nfell away at each hip, leaving the\nfront open to expose the full length\nof legs. She wore a wig of platinum\nhair encrusted with jewels that\nsparkled in the lights. Her jewel-studded\nmask was as white as her\nhair and covered the upper half of\nher face, except for the large\nalmond slits for her eyes. A white\npurse, jewel crusted, dangled from\none arm.\nHe stopped once before reaching\nthe palms, drew her closer, kissed\nher long and ardently. Then he began\npulling her on again.\nShe drew back when they\nreached the shelter of the fronds.\n\"Champagne, first,\" she whispered\nhuskily into his ear.\nHis heart sank. He had very little\nmoney left. Well, it might buy\na cheap brand....\nShe sipped\n  her champagne\nslowly and provocatively across\nthe table from him. Her eyes sparkled\nbehind the almond slits of her\nmask, caught the color changes and\ncast them back. She was wearing\ncontact lenses of a garish green.\nHe wished she would hurry with\nher drink. He had horrible visions\nof his wife at home taking off her\ntelovis and coming to his chair. He\nwould then have to press the\nswitch that would jerk his shadowy\nself back along its invisible connecting\ncord, jerk him back and\nleave but a small mound of clothes\nupon the chair at the table.\nDeep depression laid hold of\nhim. He would not be able to see\nher after tonight until he received\nhis monthly dole two weeks hence.\nShe wouldn't wait that long. Someone\nelse would have her.\nUnless ...\nYes, he knew now that he was\ngoing to kill his wife as soon as the\nopportunity presented itself. It\nwould be a simple matter.

A woman comes up to him and asks if he wants to dance, but the man refuses. The woman leaves, and the man goes to his hotel room, where he watches a telovis show on the wall. The man is a businessman, and he has recently purchased a telporter suit, a device that can cause the shadow of each bodily cell to leave the body, materialize, and become a reality in its own right. He goes to a club, where the performers are dressed in strange costumes, and there he meets a beautiful woman in a revealing garb. She asks him to dance with her, but he refuses, saying that he is not a dancer, and that he has to go back to his business. He leaves the club, and when he wakes up in the morning, he is in his own bed, surrounded by his own body. His wife, Helen, comes to his bed, and she kisses him on the cheek through the veil that covers the lower part of her face. Helen tells him that she has found a way to escape reality, but it is a dangerous way to do so. She tells him to go to the attic, where there is a hidden location where he can leave his body. Helen takes him to a hidden nook between a highway and a river, where she hides his body in a small cabin, and then he goes to her hotel room. Helen follows him to her room, and they have a passionate kiss. Helen kisses him again, but this time the kiss is not passionate, but tender, and her lips are full of tears. Helen asks if she can go to jail, but Helen refuses. Helen then goes to the bar to order a drink, and while she is there, she notices a lot of strange looking people. She goes to ask the bartender, who tells her that there is an issue with the water in the bar, and Helen goes back to the hotel room to fix the problem. As she is leaving, she sees the man who gave her the wine, and turns around to see him. Helen is shocked to see that the man is the same man she married, but now he is wearing the same clothes as she did. Helen realizes that she is in love with him, but she can't have him with her because he is a spy. She also realizes that the stranger she is with is a telepathically disguised man, and this is why she is afraid to tell him who she is.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}

Ludwig\nIllustration by Kelly Freas\nIt all began on a Saturday\nnight at\nThe Space Room\n. If\nyou've seen any recent Martian\ntravel folders, you know the place:\n\"A picturesque oasis of old Martian\ncharm, situated on the beauteous\nGrand Canal in the heart of\nMarsport. Only half a mile from\nhistoric Chandler Field, landing\nsite of the first Martian expedition\nnearly fifty years ago in 1990. A\nvisitor to the hotel, lunch room or\ncocktail lounge will thrill at the\nsight of hardy space pioneers mingling\nside by side with colorful\nMartian tribesmen. An evening at\nThe Space Room\nis an amazing,\nunforgettable experience.\"\nOf course, the folders neglect to\nadd that the most amazing aspect is\nthe scent of the Canal's stagnant\nwater\u2014and that the most unforgettable\nexperience is seeing the \"root-of-all-evil\"\nevaporate from your\npocketbook like snow from the\nGreat Red Desert.\nWe were sitting on the bandstand\nof the candle-lit cocktail lounge.\nMe\u2014Jimmie Stanley\u2014and my\nfour-piece combo. Maybe you've\nseen our motto back on Earth:\n\"The Hottest Music This Side of\nMercury.\"\nBut there weren't four of us tonight.\nOnly three. Ziggy, our bass\nfiddle man, had nearly sliced off\ntwo fingers while opening a can of\nSaturnian ice-fish, thus decreasing\nthe number of our personnel by a\ntragic twenty-five per cent.\nWhich was why Ke-teeli, our\nboss, was descending upon us with\nall the grace of an enraged Venusian\nvinosaur.\n\"Where ees museek?\" he shrilled\nin his nasal tenor. He was almost\nskeleton thin, like most Martians,\nand so tall that if he fell down he'd\nbe half way home.\nI gulped. \"Our bass man can't\nbe here, but we've called the Marsport\nlocal for another. He'll be here\nany minute.\"\nKe-teeli, sometimes referred to\nas Goon-Face and The Eye, leered\ncoldly down at me from his eight-foot-three.\nHis eyes were like black\nneedle points set deep in a mask of\ndry, ancient, reddish leather.\n\"Ees no feedle man, ees no job,\"\nhe squeaked.\nI sighed. This was the week our\ncontract ended. Goon-Face had displayed\nlittle enough enthusiasm for\nour music as it was. His comments\nwere either, \"Ees too loud, too fast,\"\nor \"Ees too slow, too soft.\" The real\ncause of his concern being, I suspected,\nthe infrequency with which\nhis cash register tinkled.\n\"But,\" I added, \"even if the new\nman doesn't come,\nwe're\nstill here.\nWe'll play for you.\" I glanced at\nthe conglomeration of uniformed\nspacemen, white-suited tourists,\nand loin-clothed natives who sat at\nancient stone tables. \"You wouldn't\nwant to disappoint your customers,\nwould you?\"\nKe-teeli snorted. \"Maybe ees better\ndey be deesappointed. Ees better\nno museek den bad museek.\"\nFat Boy, our clarinetist who doubles\non Martian horn-harp, made a\nfeeble attempt at optimism. \"Don't\nworry, Mr. Ke-teeli. That new bass\nman will be here.\"\n\"Sure,\" said Hammer-Head, our\nred-haired vibro-drummer. \"I think\nI hear him coming now.\"\nSuspiciously, Ke-teeli eyed the\nentrance. There was only silence.\nHis naked, parchment-like chest\nswelled as if it were an expanding\nballoon.\n\"Five meenutes!\" he shrieked.\n\"Eef no feedle, den you go!\" And\nhe whirled away.\nWe waited.\nFat Boy's two hundred and\neighty-odd pounds were drooped\nover his chair like the blubber of an\nexhausted, beach-stranded whale.\n\"Well,\" he muttered, \"there's always\nthe uranium pits of Neptune.\nCourse, you don't live more than\nfive years there\u2014\"\n\"Maybe we could make it back\nto Lunar City,\" suggested Hammer-Head.\n\"Using what for fare?\" I asked.\n\"Your brains?\"\nHammer-Head groaned. \"No. I\nguess it'll have to be the black pits\nof Neptune. The home of washed-up\ninterplanetary musicians. It's too\nbad. We're so young, too.\"\nThe seconds swept by. Ke-teeli\nwas casting his razor-edged glare in\nour direction. I brushed the chewed\nfinger nails from the keyboard of\nmy electronic piano.\nThen it happened.\nFrom the entrance of\nThe\nSpace Room\ncame a thumping\nand a grating and a banging. Suddenly,\nsweeping across the dance\nfloor like a cold wind, was a bass\nfiddle, an enormous black monstrosity,\na refugee from a pawnbroker's\nattic. It was queerly shaped. It was\ntoo tall, too wide. It was more like\na monstrous, midnight-black hour-glass\nthan a bass.\nThe fiddle was not unaccompanied\nas I'd first imagined. Behind\nit, streaking over the floor in a\nwaltz of agony, was a little guy, an\nanimated matchstick with a flat,\nbroad face that seemed to have\nbeen compressed in a vice. His sandcolored\nmop of hair reminded me\nof a field of dry grass, the long\nstrands forming loops that flanked\nthe sides of his face.\nHis pale blue eyes were watery,\nlike twin pools of fog. His tightfitting\nsuit, as black as the bass,\nwas something off a park bench. It\nwas impossible to guess his age. He\ncould have been anywhere between\ntwenty and forty.\nThe bass thumped down upon\nthe bandstand.\n\"Hello,\" he puffed. \"I'm John\nSmith, from the Marsport union.\"\nHe spoke shrilly and rapidly, as if\nanxious to conclude the routine of\nintroductions. \"I'm sorry I'm late,\nbut I was working on my plan.\"\nA moment's silence.\n\"Your plan?\" I echoed at last.\n\"How to get back home,\" he\nsnapped as if I should have known\nit already.\nHummm, I thought.\nMy gaze turned to the dance\nfloor. Goon-Face had his eyes on\nus, and they were as cold as six Indians\ngoing South.\n\"We'll talk about your plan at\nintermission,\" I said, shivering.\n\"Now, we'd better start playing.\nJohn, do you know\nOn An Asteroid\nWith You\n?\"\n\"I know\neverything\n,\" said John\nSmith.\nI turned to my piano with a\nshudder. I didn't dare look at that\nhorrible fiddle again. I didn't dare\nthink what kind of soul-chilling\ntones might emerge from its ancient\ndepths.\nAnd I didn't dare look again at\nthe second monstrosity, the one\nnamed John Smith. I closed my\neyes and plunged into a four-bar\nintro.\nHammer-Head joined in on\nvibro-drums and Fat Boy on clarinet,\nand then\u2014\nMy eyes burst open. A shiver\ncoursed down my spine like gigantic\nmice feet.\nThe tones that surged from that\nmonstrous bass were ecstatic. They\nwere out of a jazzman's Heaven.\nThey were great rolling clouds that\nseemed to envelop the entire universe\nwith their vibrance. They\nheld a depth and a volume and a\nrichness that were astounding, that\nwere like no others I'd ever heard.\nFirst they went\nBoom-de-boom-de-boom-de-boom\n,\nand then,\nboom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom\n,\njust like the tones of all bass\nfiddles.\nBut there was something else, too.\nThere were overtones, so that John\nwasn't just playing a single note,\nbut a whole chord with each beat.\nAnd the fullness, the depth of those\nincredible chords actually set my\nblood tingling. I could\nfeel\nthe\ntingling just as one can feel the vibration\nof a plucked guitar string.\nI glanced at the cash customers.\nThey looked like weary warriors\ngetting their first glimpse of Valhalla.\nGap-jawed and wide-eyed,\nthey seemed in a kind of ecstatic\nhypnosis. Even the silent, bland-faced\nMartians stopped sipping\ntheir wine-syrup and nodded their\ndark heads in time with the rhythm.\nI looked at The Eye. The transformation\nof his gaunt features\nwas miraculous. Shadows of gloom\ndissolved and were replaced by\na black-toothed, crescent-shaped\nsmile of delight. His eyes shone like\nthose of a kid seeing Santa Claus.\nWe finished\nOn An Asteroid With\nYou\n, modulated into\nSweet Sally\nfrom Saturn\nand finished with\nTighten Your Lips on Titan\n.\nWe waited for the applause of\nthe Earth people and the shrilling\nof the Martians to die down. Then\nI turned to John and his fiddle.\n\"If I didn't hear it,\" I gasped,\n\"I wouldn't believe it!\"\n\"And the fiddle's so old, too!\"\nadded Hammer-Head who, although\nsober, seemed quite drunk.\n\"Old?\" said John Smith. \"Of\ncourse it's old. It's over five thousand\nyears old. I was lucky to find\nit in a pawnshop. Only it's not a\nfiddle but a\nZloomph\n. This is the\nonly one in existence.\" He patted\nthe thing tenderly. \"I tried the hole\nin it but it isn't the right one.\"\nI wondered what the hell he was\ntalking about. I studied the black,\nmirror-like wood. The aperture in\nthe vesonator was like that of any\nbass fiddle.\n\"Isn't right for what?\" I had to\nask.\nHe turned his sad eyes to me.\n\"For going home,\" he said.\nHummm, I thought.\nWe played. Tune after tune.\nJohn knew them all, from the\nlatest pop melodies to a swing version\nof the classic\nRhapsody of The\nStars\n. He was a quiet guy during\nthe next couple of hours, and getting\nmore than a few words from\nhim seemed as hard as extracting a\ntooth. He'd stand by his fiddle\u2014I\nmean, his\nZloomph\n\u2014with a dreamy\nexpression in those watery eyes,\nstaring at nothing.\nBut after one number he studied\nFat Boy's clarinet for a moment.\n\"Nice clarinet,\" he mused. \"Has an\nunusual hole in the front.\"\nFat Boy scratched the back of\nhis head. \"You\u2014you mean here?\nWhere the music comes out?\"\nJohn Smith nodded. \"Unusual.\"\nHummm, I thought again.\nAwhile later I caught him eyeing\nmy piano keyboard. \"What's\nthe matter, John?\"\nHe pointed.\n\"Oh, there,\" I said. \"A cigarette\nfell out of my ashtray, burnt a hole\nin the key. If The Eye sees it, he'll\nswear at me in seven languages.\"\n\"Even there,\" he said softly,\n\"even there....\"\nThere was no doubt about it.\nJohn Smith was peculiar, but he\nwas the best bass man this side of a\nmusician's Nirvana.\nIt didn't take a genius to figure\nout our situation. Item one: Goon-Face's\ncountenance had evidenced\nan excellent imitation of Mephistopheles\nbefore John began to play.\nItem two: Goon-Face had beamed\nlike a kitten with a quart of cream\nafter John began to play.\nConclusion: If we wanted to\nkeep eating, we'd have to persuade\nJohn Smith to join our combo.\nAt intermission I said, \"How\nabout a drink, John? Maybe a shot\nof wine-syrup?\"\nHe shook his head.\n\"Then maybe a Venusian fizz?\"\nHis grunt was negative.\n\"Then some old-fashioned beer?\"\nHe smiled. \"Yes, I\nlike\nbeer.\"\nI escorted him to the bar and assisted\nhim in his arduous climb onto\na stool.\n\"John,\" I ventured after he'd\ntaken an experimental sip, \"where\nhave you been hiding? A guy like\nyou should be playing every night.\"\nJohn yawned. \"Just got here. Figured\nI might need some money so\nI went to the union. Then I worked\non my plan.\"\n\"Then you need a job. How\nabout playing with us steady? We\nlike your style a lot.\"\nHe made a long, low humming\nsound which I interpreted as an\nexpression of intense concentration.\n\"I don't know,\" he finally drawled.\n\"It'd be a steady job, John.\" Inspiration\nstruck me. \"And listen, I\nhave an apartment. It's got everything,\nsolar shower, automatic chef,\n'copter landing\u2014if we ever get a\n'copter. Plenty of room there for\ntwo people. You can stay with me\nand it won't cost you a cent. And\nwe'll even pay you over union\nwages.\"\nHis watery gaze wandered lazily\nto the bar mirror, down to the glittering\narray of bottles and then out\nto the dance floor.\nHe yawned again and spoke\nslowly, as if each word were a leaden\nweight cast reluctantly from his\ntongue:\n\"No, I don't ... care much ...\nabout playing.\"\n\"What\ndo\nyou like to do, John?\"\nHis string-bean of a body stiffened.\n\"I like to study ancient history ...\nand I must work on my\nplan.\"\nOh Lord, that plan again!\nI took a deep breath. \"Tell me\nabout it, John. It\nmust\nbe interesting.\"\nHe made queer clicking noises\nwith his mouth that reminded me\nof a mechanical toy being wound\ninto motion. \"The whole foundation\nof this or any other culture is\nbased on the history of all the time\ndimensions, each interwoven with\nthe other, throughout the ages. And\nthe holes provide a means of studying\nall of it first hand.\"\nOh, oh\n, I thought.\nBut you still\nhave to eat. Remember, you still\nhave to eat.\n\"Trouble is,\" he went on, \"there\nare so many holes in this universe.\"\n\"Holes?\" I kept a straight face.\n\"Certainly. Look around you. All\nyou see is holes. These beer bottles\nare just holes surrounded by glass.\nThe doors and windows\u2014they're\nholes in walls. The mine tunnels\nmake a network of holes under the\ndesert. Caves are holes, animals live\nin holes, our faces have holes,\nclothes have holes\u2014millions and\nmillions of holes!\"\nI winced and thought, humor\nhim because you gotta eat, you\ngotta eat.\nHis voice trembled with emotion.\n\"Why, they're everywhere. They're\nin pots and pans, in pipes, in rocket\njets, in bumpy roads. There are buttonholes\nand well holes, and shoelace\nholes. There are doughnut\nholes and stocking holes and woodpecker\nholes and cheese holes.\nOceans lie in holes in the earth,\nand rivers and canals and valleys.\nThe craters of the Moon are holes.\nEverything is\u2014\"\n\"But, John,\" I said as patiently as\npossible, \"what have these holes\ngot to do with you?\"\nHe glowered at me as if I were\nunworthy of such a confidence.\n\"What have they to do with me?\"\nhe shrilled. \"I can't find the right\none\u2014that's what!\"\nI closed my eyes. \"Which particular\nhole are you looking for, John?\"\nHe was speaking rapidly again\nnow.\n\"I was hurrying back to the University\nwith the\nZloomph\nto prove\na point of ancient history to those\nfools. They don't believe that instruments\nwhich make music actually\nexisted before the tapes! It\nwas dark\u2014and some fool researcher\nhad forgotten to set a force-field\nover the hole\u2014I fell through.\"\nI closed my eyes. \"Now wait a\nminute. Did you drop something,\nlose it in the hole\u2014is that why you\nhave to find it?\"\n\"Oh I didn't lose anything important,\"\nhe snapped, \"\njust\nmy own\ntime dimension. And if I don't get\nback they will think I couldn't prove\nmy theory, that I'm ashamed to\ncome back, and I'll be discredited.\"\nHis chest sagged for an instant.\nThen he straightened. \"But there's\nstill time for my plan to work out\u2014with\nthe relative difference taken\ninto account. Only I get so tired\njust thinking about it.\"\n\"Yes, I can see where thinking\nabout it would tire any one.\"\nHe nodded. \"But it can't be too\nfar away.\"\n\"I'd like to hear more about it,\"\nI said. \"But if you're not going to\nplay with us\u2014\"\n\"Oh, I'll play with you,\" he\nbeamed. \"I can talk to\nyou\n.\nYou\nunderstand.\"\nThank heaven!\nHeaven lasted for just three\ndays. During those seventy-two\ngolden hours the melodious tinkling\nof The Eye's cash register was as\nconstant as that of Santa's sleigh\nbells.\nJohn became the hero of tourists,\nspacemen, and Martians, but nevertheless\nhe remained stubbornly\naloof. He was quiet, moody, playing\nhis\nZloomph\nautomatically. He'd\nreveal definite indications of belonging\nto Homo Sapiens only when\ndrinking beer and talking about his\nholes.\nGoon-Face was still cautious.\n\"Contract?\" he wheezed. \"Maybe.\nWe see. Eef feedleman stay, we\nhave contract. He stay, yes?\"\n\"Oh, sure,\" I said. \"He'll stay\u2014just\nas long as you want him.\"\n\"Den he sign contract, too. No\nbeeg feedle, no contract.\"\n\"Sure. We'll get him to sign it.\"\nI laughed hollowly. \"Don't worry,\nMr. Ke-teeli.\"\nJust a few minutes later tragedy\nstruck.\nA reporter from the\nMarsport\nTimes\nambled into interview the\nMan of The Hour. The interview,\nunfortunately, was conducted over\nthe bar and accompanied by a generous\nguzzling of beer. Fat Boy,\nHammer-Head and I watched\nfrom a table. Knowing John as we\ndid, a silent prayer was in our eyes.\n\"This is the first time he's talked\nto anybody,\" Fat Boy breathed.\n\"I\u2014I'm scared.\n\"Nothing can happen,\" I said,\noptimistically. \"This'll be good publicity.\"\nWe watched.\nJohn murmured something. The\nreporter, a paunchy, balding man,\nscribbled furiously in his notebook.\nJohn yawned, muttered something\nelse. The reporter continued\nto scribble.\nJohn sipped beer. His eyes\nbrightened, and he began to talk\nmore rapidly.\nThe reporter frowned, stopped\nwriting, and studied John curiously.\nJohn finished his first beer,\nstarted on his second. His eyes were\nwild, and he was talking more and\nmore rapidly.\n\"He's doing it,\" Hammer-Head\ngroaned. \"He's telling him!\"\nI rose swiftly. \"We better get\nover there. We should have known\nbetter\u2014\"\nWe were too late. The reporter\nhad already slapped on his hat and\nwas striding to the exit. John turned\nto us, dazed, his enthusiasm vanishing\nlike air from a punctured balloon.\n\"He wouldn't listen,\" he said,\nweakly. \"I tried to tell him, but he\nsaid he'd come back when I'm\nsober. I'm sober now. So I quit.\nI've got to find my hole.\"\nI patted him on the back. \"No,\nJohn, we'll help you. Don't quit.\nWe'll\u2014well, we'll help you.\"\n\"We're working on a plan, too,\"\nsaid Fat Boy in a burst of inspiration.\n\"We're going to make a more\nscientific approach.\"\n\"How?\" John asked.\nFat Boy gulped.\n\"Just wait another day,\" I said.\n\"We'll have it worked out. Just be\npatient another day. You can't\nleave now, not after all your work.\"\n\"No, I guess not,\" he sighed. \"I'll\nstay\u2014until tomorrow.\"\nAll night the thought crept\nthrough my brain like a teasing\nspider:\nWhat can we do to make\nhim stay? What can we tell him?\nWhat, what, what?\nUnable to sleep the next morning,\nI left John to his snoring and\nwent for an aspirin and black coffee.\nAll the possible schemes were\ndrumming through my mind: finding\nan Earth blonde to capture\nJohn's interest, having him electro-hypnotized,\nbreaking his leg, forging\na letter from this mythical university\ntelling him his theory was\nproved valid and for him to take\na nice long vacation now. He was\na screwball about holes and force\nfields and dimensional worlds but\nfor that music of his I'd baby him\nthe rest of his life.\nIt was early afternoon when I\ntrudged back to my apartment.\nJohn was squatting on the living\nroom floor, surrounded by a forest\nof empty beer bottles. His eyes were\nbulging, his hair was even wilder\nthan usual, and he was swaying.\n\"John!\" I cried. \"You're drunk!\"\nHis watery eyes squinted at me.\n\"No, not drunk. Just scared. I'm\nawful scared!\"\n\"But you mustn't be scared. That\nreporter was just stupid. We'll help\nyou with your theory.\"\nHis body trembled. \"No, it isn't\nthat. It isn't the reporter.\"\n\"Then what is it, John?\"\n\"It's my body. It's\u2014\"\n\"Yes, what about your body?\nAre you sick?\"\nHis face was white with terror.\n\"No, my\u2014\nmy body's full of holes\n.\nSuppose it's one of those holes!\nHow will I get back if it is?\"\nHe rose and staggered to his\nZloomph\n, clutching it as though it\nwere somehow a source of strength\nand consolation.\nI patted him gingerly on the arm.\n\"Now John. You've just had too\nmuch beer, that's all. Let's go out\nand get some air and some strong\nblack coffee. C'mon now.\"\nWe staggered out into the morning\ndarkness, the three of us. John,\nthe\nZloomph\n, and I.\nI was hanging on to him trying\nto see around and over and even\nunder the\nZloomph\n\u2014steering by a\nsort of radar-like sixth sense. The\nstreet lights on Marsport are pretty\ndim compared to Earthside. I\ndidn't see the open manhole that\nthe workmen had figured would be\nall right at that time of night. It\ngets pretty damned cold around 4: A.M.\nof a Martian morning, and I\nguess the men were warming up\nwith a little nip at the bar across\nthe street.\nThen\u2014he was gone.\nJohn just slipped out of my grasp\u2014\nZloomph\nand all\u2014and was gone\u2014completely\nand irrevocably gone.\nI even risked a broken neck and\njumped in the manhole after him.\nNothing\u2014nothing but the smell of\nozone and an echo bouncing crazily\noff the walls of the conduit.\n\"\u2014is it.\u2014is it.\u2014is it.\u2014is it.\"\nJohn Smith was gone, so utterly\nand completely and tragically gone\nit was as if he'd never existed....\nTonight is our last night at\nThe\nSpace Room\n. Goon-Face is scowling\nagain with the icy fury of a\nPlutonian monsoon. As Goon-Face\nhas said, \"No beeg feedle, no contract.\"\nWithout John, we're notes in a\nlost chord.\nWe've searched everything, in\nhospitals, morgues, jails, night clubs,\nhotels. We've hounded spaceports\nand 'copter terminals. Nowhere, nowhere\nis John Smith.\nZiggy, whose two fingers have\nhealed, has already bowed to what\nseems inevitable. He's signed up for\nthat trip to Neptune's uranium\npits. There's plenty of room for\nmore volunteers, he tells us. But I\nspend my time cussing the guy who\nforgot to set the force field at the\nother end of the hole and let John\nand his\nZloomph\nback into his own\ntime dimension. I cuss harder when\nI think how we were robbed of the\nbest bass player in the galaxy.\nAnd without a corpus delecti we\ncan't even sue the city.\n...

There was only silence.\nHis naked, parchment-like chest\nswelled as if it were an expanding\nballoon.\n\"Five meenutes!\" he shrieked.\n\"Eef no feedle, den you go!\" And\nhe whirled away.\nWe waited.\nFat Boy's two hundred and\neighty-odd pounds were drooped\nover his chair like the blubber of an\nexhausted, beach-stranded whale.\n\"Well,\" he muttered, \"there's always\nthe uranium pits of Neptune.\nCourse, you don't live more than\nfive years there\u2014\"\n\"Maybe we could make it back\nto Lunar City,\" suggested Hammer-Head.\n\"Using what for fare?\" I asked.\n\"Your brains?\"\nHammer-Head groaned. \"No. I\nguess it'll have to be the black pits\nof Neptune. The home of washed-up\ninterplanetary musicians. It's too\nbad. We're so young, too.\"\nThe seconds swept by. Ke-teeli\nwas casting his razor-edged glare in\nour direction. I brushed the chewed\nfinger nails from the keyboard of\nmy electronic piano.\nThen it happened.\nFrom the entrance of\nThe\nSpace Room\ncame a thumping\nand a grating and a banging. Suddenly,\nsweeping across the dance\nfloor like a cold wind, was a bass\nfiddle, an enormous black monstrosity,\na refugee from a pawnbroker's\nattic. It was queerly shaped. It was\ntoo tall, too wide. It was more like\na monstrous, midnight-black hour-glass\nthan a bass.\nThe fiddle was not unaccompanied\nas I'd first imagined. Behind\nit, streaking over the floor in a\nwaltz of agony, was a little guy, an\nanimated matchstick with a flat,\nbroad face that seemed to have\nbeen compressed in a vice. His sandcolored\nmop of hair reminded me\nof a field of dry grass, the long\nstrands forming loops that flanked\nthe sides of his face.\nHis pale blue eyes were watery,\nlike twin pools of fog. His tightfitting\nsuit, as black as the bass,\nwas something off a park bench. It\nwas impossible to guess his age. He\ncould have been anywhere between\ntwenty and forty.\nThe bass thumped down upon\nthe bandstand.\n\"Hello,\" he puffed. \"I'm John\nSmith, from the Marsport union.\"\nHe spoke shrilly and rapidly, as if\nanxious to conclude the routine of\nintroductions. \"I'm sorry I'm late,\nbut I was working on my plan.\"\nA moment's silence.\n\"Your plan?\" I echoed at last.\n\"How to get back home,\" he\nsnapped as if I should have known\nit already.\nHummm, I thought.\nMy gaze turned to the dance\nfloor. Goon-Face had his eyes on\nus, and they were as cold as six Indians\ngoing South.\n\"We'll talk about your plan at\nintermission,\" I said, shivering.\n\"Now, we'd better start playing.\nJohn, do you know\nOn An Asteroid\nWith You\n?\"\n\"I know\neverything\n,\" said John\nSmith.\nI turned to my piano with a\nshudder. I didn't dare look at that\nhorrible fiddle again. I didn't dare\nthink what kind of soul-chilling\ntones might emerge from its ancient\ndepths.\nAnd I didn't dare look again at\nthe second monstrosity, the one\nnamed John Smith. I closed my\neyes and plunged into a four-bar\nintro.\nHammer-Head joined in on\nvibro-drums and Fat Boy on clarinet,\nand then\u2014\nMy eyes burst open. A shiver\ncoursed down my spine like gigantic\nmice feet.\nThe tones that surged from that\nmonstrous bass were ecstatic. They\nwere out of a jazzman's Heaven.\nThey were great rolling clouds that\nseemed to envelop the entire universe\nwith their vibrance. They\nheld a depth and a volume and a\nrichness that were astounding, that\nwere like no others I'd ever heard.\nFirst they went\nBoom-de-boom-de-boom-de-boom\n,\nand then,\nboom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom\n,\njust like the tones of all bass\nfiddles.\nBut there was something else, too.\nThere were overtones, so that John\nwasn't just playing a single note,\nbut a whole chord with each beat.\nAnd the fullness, the depth of those\nincredible chords actually set my\nblood tingling. I could\nfeel\nthe\ntingling just as one can feel the vibration\nof a plucked guitar string.\nI glanced at the cash customers.\nThey looked like weary warriors\ngetting their first glimpse of Valhalla.\nGap-jawed and wide-eyed,\nthey seemed in a kind of ecstatic\nhypnosis. Even the silent, bland-faced\nMartians stopped sipping\ntheir wine-syrup and nodded their\ndark heads in time with the rhythm.\nI looked at The Eye. The transformation\nof his gaunt features\nwas miraculous. Shadows of gloom\ndissolved and were replaced by\na black-toothed, crescent-shaped\nsmile of delight. His eyes shone like\nthose of a kid seeing Santa Claus.\nWe finished\nOn An Asteroid With\nYou\n, modulated into\nSweet Sally\nfrom Saturn\nand finished with\nTighten Your Lips on Titan\n.\nWe waited for the applause of\nthe Earth people and the shrilling\nof the Martians to die down. Then\nI turned to John and his fiddle.\n\"If I didn't hear it,\" I gasped,\n\"I wouldn't believe it!\"\n\"And the fiddle's so old, too!\"\nadded Hammer-Head who, although\nsober, seemed quite drunk.\n\"Old?\" said John Smith. \"Of\ncourse it's old. It's over five thousand\nyears old. I was lucky to find\nit in a pawnshop. Only it's not a\nfiddle but a\nZloomph\n. This is the\nonly one in existence.\" He patted\nthe thing tenderly. \"I tried the hole\nin it but it isn't the right one.\"\nI wondered what the hell he was\ntalking about. I studied the black,\nmirror-like wood. The aperture in\nthe vesonator was like that of any\nbass fiddle.\n\"Isn't right for what?\" I had to\nask.\nHe turned his sad eyes to me.\n\"For going home,\" he said.\nHummm, I thought.\nWe played. Tune after tune.\nJohn knew them all, from the\nlatest pop melodies to a swing version\nof the classic\nRhapsody of The\nStars\n. He was a quiet guy during\nthe next couple of hours, and getting\nmore than a few words from\nhim seemed as hard as extracting a\ntooth. He'd stand by his fiddle\u2014I\nmean, his\nZloomph\n\u2014with a dreamy\nexpression in those watery eyes,\nstaring at nothing.\nBut after one number he studied\nFat Boy's clarinet for a moment.\n\"Nice clarinet,\" he mused. \"Has an\nunusual hole in the front.\"\nFat Boy scratched the back of\nhis head. \"You\u2014you mean here?\nWhere the music comes out?\"\nJohn Smith nodded. \"Unusual.\"\nHummm, I thought again.\nAwhile later I caught him eyeing\nmy piano keyboard. \"What's\nthe matter, John?\"\nHe pointed.\n\"Oh, there,\" I said. \"A cigarette\nfell out of my ashtray, burnt a hole\nin the key. If The Eye sees it, he'll\nswear at me in seven languages.\"\n\"Even there,\" he said softly,\n\"even there....\"\nThere was no doubt about it.\nJohn Smith was peculiar, but he\nwas the best bass man this side of a\nmusician's Nirvana.\nIt didn't take a genius to figure\nout our situation. Item one: Goon-Face's\ncountenance had evidenced\nan excellent imitation of Mephistopheles\nbefore John began to play.\nItem two: Goon-Face had beamed\nlike a kitten with a quart of cream\nafter John began to play.\nConclusion: If we wanted to\nkeep eating, we'd have to persuade\nJohn Smith to join our combo.\nAt intermission I said, \"How\nabout a drink, John? Maybe a shot\nof wine-syrup?\"\nHe shook his head.\n\"Then maybe a Venusian fizz?\"\nHis grunt was negative.\n\"Then some old-fashioned beer?\"\nHe smiled. \"Yes, I\nlike\nbeer.\"\nI escorted him to the bar and assisted\nhim in his arduous climb onto\na stool.\n\"John,\" I ventured after he'd\ntaken an experimental sip, \"where\nhave you been hiding? A guy like\nyou should be playing every night.\"\nJohn yawned. \"Just got here. Figured\nI might need some money so\nI went to the union. Then I worked\non my plan.\"\n\"Then you need a job. How\nabout playing with us steady? We\nlike your style a lot.\"\nHe made a long, low humming\nsound which I interpreted as an\nexpression of intense concentration.\n\"I don't know,\" he finally drawled.\n\"It'd be a steady job, John.\" Inspiration\nstruck me. \"And listen, I\nhave an apartment. It's got everything,\nsolar shower, automatic chef,\n'copter landing\u2014if we ever get a\n'copter. Plenty of room there for\ntwo people. You can stay with me\nand it won't cost you a cent. And\nwe'll even pay you over union\nwages.\"\nHis watery gaze wandered lazily\nto the bar mirror, down to the glittering\narray of bottles and then out\nto the dance floor.\nHe yawned again and spoke\nslowly, as if each word were a leaden\nweight cast reluctantly from his\ntongue:\n\"No, I don't ... care much ...\nabout playing.\"\n\"What\ndo\nyou like to do, John?\"\nHis string-bean of a body stiffened.\n\"I like to study ancient history ...\nand I must work on my\nplan.\"\nOh Lord, that plan again!\nI took a deep breath. \"Tell me\nabout it, John. It\nmust\nbe interesting.\"\nHe made queer clicking noises\nwith his mouth that reminded me\nof a mechanical toy being wound\ninto motion. \"The whole foundation\nof this or any other culture is\nbased on the history of all the time\ndimensions, each interwoven with\nthe other, throughout the ages. And\nthe holes provide a means of studying\nall of it first hand.\"\nOh, oh\n, I thought.\nBut you still\nhave to eat. Remember, you still\nhave to eat.\n\"Trouble is,\" he went on, \"there\nare so many holes in this universe.\"\n\"Holes?\" I kept a straight face.\n\"Certainly. Look around you. All\nyou see is holes. These beer bottles\nare just holes surrounded by glass.\nThe doors and windows\u2014they're\nholes in walls. The mine tunnels\nmake a network of holes under the\ndesert. Caves are holes, animals live\nin holes, our faces have holes,\nclothes have holes\u2014millions and\nmillions of holes!\"\nI winced and thought, humor\nhim because you gotta eat, you\ngotta eat.\nHis voice trembled with emotion.\n\"Why, they're everywhere. They're\nin pots and pans, in pipes, in rocket\njets, in bumpy roads. There are buttonholes\nand well holes, and shoelace\nholes. There are doughnut\nholes and stocking holes and woodpecker\nholes and cheese holes.\nOceans lie in holes in the earth,\nand rivers and canals and valleys.\nThe craters of the Moon are holes.\nEverything is\u2014\"\n\"But, John,\" I said as patiently as\npossible, \"what have these holes\ngot to do with you?\"\nHe glowered at me as if I were\nunworthy of such a confidence.\n\"What have they to do with me?\"\nhe shrilled. \"I can't find the right\none\u2014that's what!\"\nI closed my eyes. \"Which particular\nhole are you looking for, John?\"\nHe was speaking rapidly again\nnow.\n\"I was hurrying back to the University\nwith the\nZloomph\nto prove\na point of ancient history to those\nfools. They don't believe that instruments\nwhich make music actually\nexisted before the tapes! It\nwas dark\u2014and some fool researcher\nhad forgotten to set a force-field\nover the hole\u2014I fell through.\"\nI closed my eyes. \"Now wait a\nminute. Did you drop something,\nlose it in the hole\u2014is that why you\nhave to find it?\"\n\"Oh I didn't lose anything important,\"\nhe snapped, \"\njust\nmy own\ntime dimension. And if I don't get\nback they will think I couldn't prove\nmy theory, that I'm ashamed to\ncome back, and I'll be discredited.\"\nHis chest sagged for an instant.\nThen he straightened. \"But there's\nstill time for my plan to work out\u2014with\nthe relative difference taken\ninto account. Only I get so tired\njust thinking about it.\"\n\"Yes, I can see where thinking\nabout it would tire any one.\"\nHe nodded. \"But it can't be too\nfar away.\"\n\"I'd like to hear more about it,\"\nI said. \"But if you're not going to\nplay with us\u2014\"\n\"Oh, I'll play with you,\" he\nbeamed. \"I can talk to\nyou\n.\nYou\nunderstand.\"\nThank heaven!\nHeaven lasted for just three\ndays. During those seventy-two\ngolden hours the melodious tinkling\nof The Eye's cash register was as\nconstant as that of Santa's sleigh\nbells.\nJohn became the hero of tourists,\nspacemen, and Martians, but nevertheless\nhe remained stubbornly\naloof. He was quiet, moody, playing\nhis\nZloomph\nautomatically. He'd\nreveal definite indications of belonging\nto Homo Sapiens only when\ndrinking beer and talking about his\nholes.\nGoon-Face was still cautious.\n\"Contract?\" he wheezed. \"Maybe.\nWe see. Eef feedleman stay, we\nhave contract. He stay, yes?\"\n\"Oh, sure,\" I said. \"He'll stay\u2014just\nas long as you want him.\"\n\"Den he sign contract, too. No\nbeeg feedle, no contract.\"\n\"Sure. We'll get him to sign it.\"\nI laughed hollowly. \"Don't worry,\nMr. Ke-teeli.\"\nJust a few minutes later tragedy\nstruck.\nA reporter from the\nMarsport\nTimes\nambled into interview the\nMan of The Hour. The interview,\nunfortunately, was conducted over\nthe bar and accompanied by a generous\nguzzling of beer. Fat Boy,\nHammer-Head and I watched\nfrom a table. Knowing John as we\ndid, a silent prayer was in our eyes.\n\"This is the first time he's talked\nto anybody,\" Fat Boy breathed.\n\"I\u2014I'm scared.\n\"Nothing can happen,\" I said,\noptimistically. \"This'll be good publicity.\"\nWe watched.\nJohn murmured something. The\nreporter, a paunchy, balding man,\nscribbled furiously in his notebook.\nJohn yawned, muttered something\nelse. The reporter continued\nto scribble.\nJohn sipped beer. His eyes\nbrightened, and he began to talk\nmore rapidly.\nThe reporter frowned, stopped\nwriting, and studied John curiously.\nJohn finished his first beer,\nstarted on his second. His eyes were\nwild, and he was talking more and\nmore rapidly.\n\"He's doing it,\" Hammer-Head\ngroaned. \"He's telling him!\"\nI rose swiftly. \"We better get\nover there. We should have known\nbetter\u2014\"\nWe were too late. The reporter\nhad already slapped on his hat and\nwas striding to the exit. John turned\nto us, dazed, his enthusiasm vanishing\nlike air from a punctured balloon.\n\"He wouldn't listen,\" he said,\nweakly. \"I tried to tell him, but he\nsaid he'd come back when I'm\nsober. I'm sober now. So I quit.\nI've got to find my hole.\"\nI patted him on the back. \"No,\nJohn, we'll help you. Don't quit.\nWe'll\u2014well, we'll help you.\"\n\"We're working on a plan, too,\"\nsaid Fat Boy in a burst of inspiration.\n\"We're going to make a more\nscientific approach.\"\n\"How?\" John asked.\nFat Boy gulped.\n\"Just wait another day,\" I said.\n\"We'll have it worked out. Just be\npatient another day. You can't\nleave now, not after all your work.\"\n\"No, I guess not,\" he sighed. \"I'll\nstay\u2014until tomorrow.\"\nAll night the thought crept\nthrough my brain like a teasing\nspider:\nWhat can we do to make\nhim stay? What can we tell him?\nWhat, what, what?\nUnable to sleep the next morning,\nI left John to his snoring and\nwent for an aspirin and black coffee.\nAll the possible schemes were\ndrumming through my mind: finding\nan Earth blonde to capture\nJohn's interest, having him electro-hypnotized,\nbreaking his leg, forging\na letter from this mythical university\ntelling him his theory was\nproved valid and for him to take\na nice long vacation now. He was\na screwball about holes and force\nfields and dimensional worlds but\nfor that music of his I'd baby him\nthe rest of his life.\nIt was early afternoon when I\ntrudged back to my apartment.\nJohn was squatting on the living\nroom floor, surrounded by a forest\nof empty beer bottles. His eyes were\nbulging, his hair was even wilder\nthan usual, and he was swaying.\n\"John!\" I cried. \"You're drunk!\"\nHis watery eyes squinted at me.\n\"No, not drunk. Just scared. I'm\nawful scared!\"\n\"But you mustn't be scared. That\nreporter was just stupid. We'll help\nyou with your theory.\"\nHis body trembled. \"No, it isn't\nthat. It isn't the reporter.\"\n\"Then what is it, John?\"\n\"It's my body. It's\u2014\"\n\"Yes, what about your body?\nAre you sick?\"\nHis face was white with terror.\n\"No, my\u2014\nmy body's full of holes\n.\nSuppose it's one of those holes!\nHow will I get back if it is?\"\nHe rose and staggered to his\nZloomph\n, clutching it as though it\nwere somehow a source of strength\nand consolation.\nI patted him gingerly on the arm.\n\"Now John. You've just had too\nmuch beer, that's all. Let's go out\nand get some air and some strong\nblack coffee. C'mon now.\"\nWe staggered out into the morning\ndarkness, the three of us. John,\nthe\nZloomph\n, and I.\nI was hanging on to him trying\nto see around and over and even\nunder the\nZloomph\n\u2014steering by a\nsort of radar-like sixth sense. The\nstreet lights on Marsport are pretty\ndim compared to Earthside. I\ndidn't see the open manhole that\nthe workmen had figured would be\nall right at that time of night. It\ngets pretty damned cold around 4: A.M.\nof a Martian morning, and I\nguess the men were warming up\nwith a little nip at the bar across\nthe street.\nThen\u2014he was gone.\nJohn just slipped out of my grasp\u2014\nZloomph\nand all\u2014and was gone\u2014completely\nand irrevocably gone.\nI even risked a broken neck and\njumped in the manhole after him.\nNothing\u2014nothing but the smell of\nozone and an echo bouncing crazily\noff the walls of the conduit.\n\"\u2014is it.\u2014is it.\u2014is it.\u2014is it.\"\nJohn Smith was gone, so utterly\nand completely and tragically gone\nit was as if he'd never existed....\nTonight is our last night at\nThe\nSpace Room\n. Goon-Face is scowling\nagain with the icy fury of a\nPlutonian monsoon. As Goon-Face\nhas said, \"No beeg feedle, no contract.\"\nWithout John, we're notes in a\nlost chord.\nWe've searched everything, in\nhospitals, morgues, jails, night clubs,\nhotels. We've hounded spaceports\nand 'copter terminals. Nowhere, nowhere\nis John Smith.\nZiggy, whose two fingers have\nhealed, has already bowed to what\nseems inevitable. He's signed up for\nthat trip to Neptune's uranium\npits. There's plenty of room for\nmore volunteers, he tells us. But I\nspend my time cussing the guy who\nforgot to set the force field at the\nother end of the hole and let John\nand his\nZloomph\nback into his own\ntime dimension. I cuss harder when\nI think how we were robbed of the\nbest bass player in the galaxy.\nAnd without a corpus delecti we\ncan't even sue the city.\n... THE END\n", "summary": "The story begins on a Saturday night at The Space Room, a bar in Marsport. The bar is a picturesque oasis of old Martian charm, situated on the Grand Canal in the heart of Marsport, a place where spacemen, explorers, and natives mix. The Space room is where the performers of the Marsport local orchestra play, and the bar is where they meet the new member of their orchestra, a man named Ke-teeli. The story begins with Ke-tteeli, the Marsports boss, coming to see his bass man, who is out of town. He is upset because he has called the Mars port local for another man, and he is worried that the new man won't be able to come because the man is not yet hired. The man, named Keel, is a foreigner, and his job is to play the bass for the orchestra. The group of spacemen are playing for the new guy, and they are nervous about him. They are playing a piece called \"Holes and John Smith\" and it is a slow song, but the man, Keel is singing it anyway. The music is beautiful, and it seems that the man who is playing it is famous, but he is not. The other man, a Martian named Don, is playing the tuba, and Keel asks him to play it for them. The two men are nervous because they have never played together before, and are unfamiliar with each other. The new man, the man named Skaw, is tall, thin, and tall, and skinny. He looks down on the group of men playing the music. He tells them that he is a member of the expedition team, and that he has been hired to play bass for them, and is a great listener. The men are excited to hear his music, and Skaw is nervous about the unknown that he will play. The three men are playing the bass, and one of them, Ke-eeli, is the one who is supposed to play. He has been working at The Marsport for a while, and has a contract to play for the group. He arrives, and when he does, he is nervous because he is the only one who can play the instrument. He asks Ke-teleseli to play his piece, and then he asks him if he will be playing the other piece. The bass man says he will, and goes to pay the man. The next day, Keelei returns, and a Martian man named Karsh, who plays the tubal, introduces himself as the new bass man. He says that he was hired by Keel to play with the group, and will play for them for free. The Martian man is a tall, handsome man, but his face is covered in graying hair and he looks down upon the group as he plays. He introduces himself to Keel as \"Hank\", and he says that his name is Skaw.", "faithfulness": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}

He was a ragged little man out of a hole but he\nwas money in the bank to Stanley's four-piece combo. He was\n\u2014whoops!...\nThe Holes and John Smith\nBy Edward W. Ludwig\nIllustration by Kelly Freas\nIt all began on a Saturday\nnight at\nThe Space Room\n. If\nyou've seen any recent Martian\ntravel folders, you know the place:\n\"A picturesque oasis of old Martian\ncharm, situated on the beauteous\nGrand Canal in the heart of\nMarsport. Only half a mile from\nhistoric Chandler Field, landing\nsite of the first Martian expedition\nnearly fifty years ago in 1990. A\nvisitor to the hotel, lunch room or\ncocktail lounge will thrill at the\nsight of hardy space pioneers mingling\nside by side with colorful\nMartian tribesmen. An evening at\nThe Space Room\nis an amazing,\nunforgettable experience.\"\nOf course, the folders neglect to\nadd that the most amazing aspect is\nthe scent of the Canal's stagnant\nwater\u2014and that the most unforgettable\nexperience is seeing the \"root-of-all-evil\"\nevaporate from your\npocketbook like snow from the\nGreat Red Desert.\nWe were sitting on the bandstand\nof the candle-lit cocktail lounge.\nMe\u2014Jimmie Stanley\u2014and my\nfour-piece combo. Maybe you've\nseen our motto back on Earth:\n\"The Hottest Music This Side of\nMercury.\"\nBut there weren't four of us tonight.\nOnly three. Ziggy, our bass\nfiddle man, had nearly sliced off\ntwo fingers while opening a can of\nSaturnian ice-fish, thus decreasing\nthe number of our personnel by a\ntragic twenty-five per cent.\nWhich was why Ke-teeli, our\nboss, was descending upon us with\nall the grace of an enraged Venusian\nvinosaur.\n\"Where ees museek?\" he shrilled\nin his nasal tenor. He was almost\nskeleton thin, like most Martians,\nand so tall that if he fell down he'd\nbe half way home.\nI gulped. \"Our bass man can't\nbe here, but we've called the Marsport\nlocal for another. He'll be here\nany minute.\"\nKe-teeli, sometimes referred to\nas Goon-Face and The Eye, leered\ncoldly down at me from his eight-foot-three.\nHis eyes were like black\nneedle points set deep in a mask of\ndry, ancient, reddish leather.\n\"Ees no feedle man, ees no job,\"\nhe squeaked.\nI sighed. This was the week our\ncontract ended. Goon-Face had displayed\nlittle enough enthusiasm for\nour music as it was. His comments\nwere either, \"Ees too loud, too fast,\"\nor \"Ees too slow, too soft.\" The real\ncause of his concern being, I suspected,\nthe infrequency with which\nhis cash register tinkled.\n\"But,\" I added, \"even if the new\nman doesn't come,\nwe're\nstill here.\nWe'll play for you.\" I glanced at\nthe conglomeration of uniformed\nspacemen, white-suited tourists,\nand loin-clothed natives who sat at\nancient stone tables. \"You wouldn't\nwant to disappoint your customers,\nwould you?\"\nKe-teeli snorted. \"Maybe ees better\ndey be deesappointed. Ees better\nno museek den bad museek.\"\nFat Boy, our clarinetist who doubles\non Martian horn-harp, made a\nfeeble attempt at optimism. \"Don't\nworry, Mr. Ke-teeli. That new bass\nman will be here.\"\n\"Sure,\" said Hammer-Head, our\nred-haired vibro-drummer. \"I think\nI hear him coming now.\"\nSuspiciously, Ke-teeli eyed the\nentrance. There was only silence.\nHis naked, parchment-like chest\nswelled as if it were an expanding\nballoon.\n\"Five meenutes!\" he shrieked.\n\"Eef no feedle, den you go!\" And\nhe whirled away.\nWe waited.\nFat Boy's two hundred and\neighty-odd pounds were drooped\nover his chair like the blubber of an\nexhausted, beach-stranded whale.\n\"Well,\" he muttered, \"there's always\nthe uranium pits of Neptune.\nCourse, you don't live more than\nfive years there\u2014\"\n\"Maybe we could make it back\nto Lunar City,\" suggested Hammer-Head.\n\"Using what for fare?\" I asked.\n\"Your brains?\"\nHammer-Head groaned. \"No. I\nguess it'll have to be the black pits\nof Neptune. The home of washed-up\ninterplanetary musicians. It's too\nbad. We're so young, too.\"\nThe seconds swept by. Ke-teeli\nwas casting his razor-edged glare in\nour direction. I brushed the chewed\nfinger nails from the keyboard of\nmy electronic piano.\nThen it happened.\nFrom the entrance of\nThe\nSpace Room\ncame a thumping\nand a grating and a banging. Suddenly,\nsweeping across the dance\nfloor like a cold wind, was a bass\nfiddle, an enormous black monstrosity,\na refugee from a pawnbroker's\nattic. It was queerly shaped. It was\ntoo tall, too wide. It was more like\na monstrous, midnight-black hour-glass\nthan a bass.\nThe fiddle was not unaccompanied\nas I'd first imagined. Behind\nit, streaking over the floor in a\nwaltz of agony, was a little guy, an\nanimated matchstick with a flat,\nbroad face that seemed to have\nbeen compressed in a vice. His sandcolored\nmop of hair reminded me\nof a field of dry grass, the long\nstrands forming loops that flanked\nthe sides of his face.\nHis pale blue eyes were watery,\nlike twin pools of fog. His tightfitting\nsuit, as black as the bass,\nwas something off a park bench. It\nwas impossible to guess his age. He\ncould have been anywhere between\ntwenty and forty.\nThe bass thumped down upon\nthe bandstand.\n\"Hello,\" he puffed. \"I'm John\nSmith, from the Marsport union.\"\nHe spoke shrilly and rapidly, as if\nanxious to conclude the routine of\nintroductions. \"I'm sorry I'm late,\nbut I was working on my plan.\"\nA moment's silence.\n\"Your plan?\" I echoed at last.\n\"How to get back home,\" he\nsnapped as if I should have known\nit already.\nHummm, I thought.\nMy gaze turned to the dance\nfloor. Goon-Face had his eyes on\nus, and they were as cold as six Indians\ngoing South.\n\"We'll talk about your plan at\nintermission,\" I said, shivering.\n\"Now, we'd better start playing.\nJohn, do you know\nOn An Asteroid\nWith You\n?\"\n\"I know\neverything\n,\" said John\nSmith.\nI turned to my piano with a\nshudder. I didn't dare look at that\nhorrible fiddle again. I didn't dare\nthink what kind of soul-chilling\ntones might emerge from its ancient\ndepths.\nAnd I didn't dare look again at\nthe second monstrosity, the one\nnamed John Smith. I closed my\neyes and plunged into a four-bar\nintro.\nHammer-Head joined in on\nvibro-drums and Fat Boy on clarinet,\nand then\u2014\nMy eyes burst open. A shiver\ncoursed down my spine like gigantic\nmice feet.\nThe tones that surged from that\nmonstrous bass were ecstatic. They\nwere out of a jazzman's Heaven.\nThey were great rolling clouds that\nseemed to envelop the entire universe\nwith their vibrance. They\nheld a depth and a volume and a\nrichness that were astounding, that\nwere like no others I'd ever heard.\nFirst they went\nBoom-de-boom-de-boom-de-boom\n,\nand then,\nboom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom\n,\njust like the tones of all bass\nfiddles.\nBut there was something else, too.\nThere were overtones, so that John\nwasn't just playing a single note,\nbut a whole chord with each beat.\nAnd the fullness, the depth of those\nincredible chords actually set my\nblood tingling. I could\nfeel\nthe\ntingling just as one can feel the vibration\nof a plucked guitar string.\nI glanced at the cash customers.\nThey looked like weary warriors\ngetting their first glimpse of Valhalla.\nGap-jawed and wide-eyed,\nthey seemed in a kind of ecstatic\nhypnosis. Even the silent, bland-faced\nMartians stopped sipping\ntheir wine-syrup and nodded their\ndark heads in time with the rhythm.\nI looked at The Eye. The transformation\nof his gaunt features\nwas miraculous. Shadows of gloom\ndissolved and were replaced by\na black-toothed, crescent-shaped\nsmile of delight. His eyes shone like\nthose of a kid seeing Santa Claus.\nWe finished\nOn An Asteroid With\nYou\n, modulated into\nSweet Sally\nfrom Saturn\nand finished with\nTighten Your Lips on Titan\n.\nWe waited for the applause of\nthe Earth people and the shrilling\nof the Martians to die down. Then\nI turned to John and his fiddle.\n\"If I didn't hear it,\" I gasped,\n\"I wouldn't believe it!\"\n\"And the fiddle's so old, too!\"\nadded Hammer-Head who, although\nsober, seemed quite drunk.\n\"Old?\" said John Smith. \"Of\ncourse it's old. It's over five thousand\nyears old. I was lucky to find\nit in a pawnshop. Only it's not a\nfiddle but a\nZloomph\n. This is the\nonly one in existence.\" He patted\nthe thing tenderly. \"I tried the hole\nin it but it isn't the right one.\"\nI wondered what the hell he was\ntalking about. I studied the black,\nmirror-like wood. The aperture in\nthe vesonator was like that of any\nbass fiddle.\n\"Isn't right for what?\" I had to\nask.\nHe turned his sad eyes to me.\n\"For going home,\" he said.\nHummm, I thought.\nWe played. Tune after tune.\nJohn knew them all, from the\nlatest pop melodies to a swing version\nof the classic\nRhapsody of The\nStars\n. He was a quiet guy during\nthe next couple of hours, and getting\nmore than a few words from\nhim seemed as hard as extracting a\ntooth. He'd stand by his fiddle\u2014I\nmean, his\nZloomph\n\u2014with a dreamy\nexpression in those watery eyes,\nstaring at nothing.\nBut after one number he studied\nFat Boy's clarinet for a moment.\n\"Nice clarinet,\" he mused. \"Has an\nunusual hole in the front.\"\nFat Boy scratched the back of\nhis head. \"You\u2014you mean here?\nWhere the music comes out?\"\nJohn Smith nodded. \"Unusual.\"\nHummm, I thought again.\nAwhile later I caught him eyeing\nmy piano keyboard. \"What's\nthe matter, John?\"\nHe pointed.\n\"Oh, there,\" I said. \"A cigarette\nfell out of my ashtray, burnt a hole\nin the key. If The Eye sees it, he'll\nswear at me in seven languages.\"\n\"Even there,\" he said softly,\n\"even there....\"\nThere was no doubt about it.\nJohn Smith was peculiar, but he\nwas the best bass man this side of a\nmusician's Nirvana.\nIt didn't take a genius to figure\nout our situation. Item one: Goon-Face's\ncountenance had evidenced\nan excellent imitation of Mephistopheles\nbefore John began to play.\nItem two: Goon-Face had beamed\nlike a kitten with a quart of cream\nafter John began to play.\nConclusion: If we wanted to\nkeep eating, we'd have to persuade\nJohn Smith to join our combo.\nAt intermission I said, \"How\nabout a drink, John? Maybe a shot\nof wine-syrup?\"\nHe shook his head.\n\"Then maybe a Venusian fizz?\"\nHis grunt was negative.\n\"Then some old-fashioned beer?\"\nHe smiled. \"Yes, I\nlike\nbeer.\"\nI escorted him to the bar and assisted\nhim in his arduous climb onto\na stool.\n\"John,\" I ventured after he'd\ntaken an experimental sip, \"where\nhave you been hiding? A guy like\nyou should be playing every night.\"\nJohn yawned. \"Just got here. Figured\nI might need some money so\nI went to the union. Then I worked\non my plan.\"\n\"Then you need a job. How\nabout playing with us steady? We\nlike your style a lot.\"\nHe made a long, low humming\nsound which I interpreted as an\nexpression of intense concentration.\n\"I don't know,\" he finally drawled.\n\"It'd be a steady job, John.\" Inspiration\nstruck me. \"And listen, I\nhave an apartment. It's got everything,\nsolar shower, automatic chef,\n'copter landing\u2014if we ever get a\n'copter. Plenty of room there for\ntwo people. You can stay with me\nand it won't cost you a cent. And\nwe'll even pay you over union\nwages.\"\nHis watery gaze wandered lazily\nto the bar mirror, down to the glittering\narray of bottles and then out\nto the dance floor.\nHe yawned again and spoke\nslowly, as if each word were a leaden\nweight cast reluctantly from his\ntongue:\n\"No, I don't ... care much ...\nabout playing.\"\n\"What\ndo\nyou like to do, John?\"\nHis string-bean of a body stiffened.\n\"I like to study ancient history ...\nand I must work on my\nplan.\"\nOh Lord, that plan again!\nI took a deep breath. \"Tell me\nabout it, John. It\nmust\nbe interesting.\"\nHe made queer clicking noises\nwith his mouth that reminded me\nof a mechanical toy being wound\ninto motion. \"The whole foundation\nof this or any other culture is\nbased on the history of all the time\ndimensions, each interwoven with\nthe other, throughout the ages. And\nthe holes provide a means of studying\nall of it first hand.\"\nOh, oh\n, I thought.\nBut you still\nhave to eat. Remember, you still\nhave to eat.\n\"Trouble is,\" he went on, \"there\nare so many holes in this universe.\"\n\"Holes?\" I kept a straight face.\n\"Certainly. Look around you. All\nyou see is holes. These beer bottles\nare just holes surrounded by glass.\nThe doors and windows\u2014they're\nholes in walls. The mine tunnels\nmake a network of holes under the\ndesert. Caves are holes, animals live\nin holes, our faces have holes,\nclothes have holes\u2014millions and\nmillions of holes!\"\nI winced and thought, humor\nhim because you gotta eat, you\ngotta eat.\nHis voice trembled with emotion.\n\"Why, they're everywhere. They're\nin pots and pans, in pipes, in rocket\njets, in bumpy roads. There are buttonholes\nand well holes, and shoelace\nholes. There are doughnut\nholes and stocking holes and woodpecker\nholes and cheese holes.\nOceans lie in holes in the earth,\nand rivers and canals and valleys.\nThe craters of the Moon are holes.\nEverything is\u2014\"\n\"But, John,\" I said as patiently as\npossible, \"what have these holes\ngot to do with you?\"\nHe glowered at me as if I were\nunworthy of such a confidence.\n\"What have they to do with me?\"\nhe shrilled. \"I can't find the right\none\u2014that's what!\"\nI closed my eyes. \"Which particular\nhole are you looking for, John?\"\nHe was speaking rapidly again\nnow.\n\"I was hurrying back to the University\nwith the\nZloomph\nto prove\na point of ancient history to those\nfools. They don't believe that instruments\nwhich make music actually\nexisted before the tapes! It\nwas dark\u2014and some fool researcher\nhad forgotten to set a force-field\nover the hole\u2014I fell through.\"\nI closed my eyes. \"Now wait a\nminute. Did you drop something,\nlose it in the hole\u2014is that why you\nhave to find it?\"\n\"Oh I didn't lose anything important,\"\nhe snapped, \"\njust\nmy own\ntime dimension. And if I don't get\nback they will think I couldn't prove\nmy theory, that I'm ashamed to\ncome back, and I'll be discredited.\"\nHis chest sagged for an instant.\nThen he straightened. \"But there's\nstill time for my plan to work out\u2014with\nthe relative difference taken\ninto account. Only I get so tired\njust thinking about it.\"\n\"Yes, I can see where thinking\nabout it would tire any one.\"\nHe nodded. \"But it can't be too\nfar away.\"\n\"I'd like to hear more about it,\"\nI said. \"But if you're not going to\nplay with us\u2014\"\n\"Oh, I'll play with you,\" he\nbeamed. \"I can talk to\nyou\n.\nYou\nunderstand.\"\nThank heaven!\nHeaven lasted for just three\ndays. During those seventy-two\ngolden hours the melodious tinkling\nof The Eye's cash register was as\nconstant as that of Santa's sleigh\nbells.\nJohn became the hero of tourists,\nspacemen, and Martians, but nevertheless\nhe remained stubbornly\naloof. He was quiet, moody, playing\nhis\nZloomph\nautomatically. He'd\nreveal definite indications of belonging\nto Homo Sapiens only when\ndrinking beer and talking about his\nholes.\nGoon-Face was still cautious.\n\"Contract?\" he wheezed. \"Maybe.\nWe see. Eef feedleman stay, we\nhave contract. He stay, yes?\"\n\"Oh, sure,\" I said. \"He'll stay\u2014just\nas long as you want him.\"\n\"Den he sign contract, too. No\nbeeg feedle, no contract.\"\n\"Sure. We'll get him to sign it.\"\nI laughed hollowly. \"Don't worry,\nMr. Ke-teeli.\"\nJust a few minutes later tragedy\nstruck.\nA reporter from the\nMarsport\nTimes\nambled into interview the\nMan of The Hour. The interview,\nunfortunately, was conducted over\nthe bar and accompanied by a generous\nguzzling of beer. Fat Boy,\nHammer-Head and I watched\nfrom a table. Knowing John as we\ndid, a silent prayer was in our eyes.\n\"This is the first time he's talked\nto anybody,\" Fat Boy breathed.\n\"I\u2014I'm scared.\n\"Nothing can happen,\" I said,\noptimistically. \"This'll be good publicity.\"\nWe watched.\nJohn murmured something. The\nreporter, a paunchy, balding man,\nscribbled furiously in his notebook.\nJohn yawned, muttered something\nelse. The reporter continued\nto scribble.\nJohn sipped beer. His eyes\nbrightened, and he began to talk\nmore rapidly.\nThe reporter frowned, stopped\nwriting, and studied John curiously.\nJohn finished his first beer,\nstarted on his second. His eyes were\nwild, and he was talking more and\nmore rapidly.\n\"He's doing it,\" Hammer-Head\ngroaned. \"He's telling him!\"\nI rose swiftly. \"We better get\nover there. We should have known\nbetter\u2014\"\nWe were too late. The reporter\nhad already slapped on his hat and\nwas striding to the exit. John turned\nto us, dazed, his enthusiasm vanishing\nlike air from a punctured balloon.\n\"He wouldn't listen,\" he said,\nweakly. \"I tried to tell him, but he\nsaid he'd come back when I'm\nsober. I'm sober now. So I quit.\nI've got to find my hole.\"\nI patted him on the back. \"No,\nJohn, we'll help you. Don't quit.\nWe'll\u2014well, we'll help you.\"\n\"We're working on a plan, too,\"\nsaid Fat Boy in a burst of inspiration.\n\"We're going to make a more\nscientific approach.\"\n\"How?\" John asked.\nFat Boy gulped.\n\"Just wait another day,\" I said.\n\"We'll have it worked out. Just be\npatient another day. You can't\nleave now, not after all your work.\"\n\"No, I guess not,\" he sighed. \"I'll\nstay\u2014until tomorrow.\"\nAll night the thought crept\nthrough my brain like a teasing\nspider:\nWhat can we do to make\nhim stay? What can we tell him?\nWhat, what, what?\nUnable to sleep the next morning,\nI left John to his snoring and\nwent for an aspirin and black coffee.\nAll the possible schemes were\ndrumming through my mind: finding\nan Earth blonde to capture\nJohn's interest, having him electro-hypnotized,\nbreaking his leg, forging\na letter from this mythical university\ntelling him his theory was\nproved valid and for him to take\na nice long vacation now. He was\na screwball about holes and force\nfields and dimensional worlds but\nfor that music of his I'd baby him\nthe rest of his life.\nIt was early afternoon when I\ntrudged back to my apartment.\nJohn was squatting on the living\nroom floor, surrounded by a forest\nof empty beer bottles. His eyes were\nbulging, his hair was even wilder\nthan usual, and he was swaying.\n\"John!\" I cried. \"You're drunk!\"\nHis watery eyes squinted at me.\n\"No, not drunk. Just scared. I'm\nawful scared!\"\n\"But you mustn't be scared. That\nreporter was just stupid. We'll help\nyou with your theory.\"\nHis body trembled. \"No, it isn't\nthat. It isn't the reporter.\"\n\"Then what is it, John?\"\n\"It's my body. It's\u2014\"\n\"Yes, what about your body?\nAre you sick?\"\nHis face was white with terror.\n\"No, my\u2014\nmy body's full of holes\n.\nSuppose it's one of those holes!\nHow will I get back if it is?\"\nHe rose and staggered to his\nZloomph\n, clutching it as though it\nwere somehow a source of strength\nand consolation.\nI patted him gingerly on the arm.\n\"Now John. You've just had too\nmuch beer, that's all. Let's go out\nand get some air and some strong\nblack coffee. C'mon now.\"\nWe staggered out into the morning\ndarkness, the three of us. John,\nthe\nZloomph\n, and I.\nI was hanging on to him trying\nto see around and over and even\nunder the\nZloomph\n\u2014steering by a\nsort of radar-like sixth sense. The\nstreet lights on Marsport are pretty\ndim compared to Earthside. I\ndidn't see the open manhole that\nthe workmen had figured would be\nall right at that time of night. It\ngets pretty damned cold around 4: A.M.\nof a Martian morning, and I\nguess the men were warming up\nwith a little nip at the bar across\nthe street.\nThen\u2014he was gone.\nJohn just slipped out of my grasp\u2014\nZloomph\nand all\u2014and was gone\u2014completely\nand irrevocably gone.\nI even risked a broken neck and\njumped in the manhole after him.\nNothing\u2014nothing but the smell of\nozone and an echo bouncing crazily\noff the walls of the conduit.\n\"\u2014is it.\u2014is it.\u2014is it.\u2014is it.\"\nJohn Smith was gone, so utterly\nand completely and tragically gone\nit was as if he'd never existed....\nTonight is our last night at\nThe\nSpace Room\n. Goon-Face is scowling\nagain with the icy fury of a\nPlutonian monsoon. As Goon-Face\nhas said, \"No beeg feedle, no contract.\"\nWithout John, we're notes in a\nlost chord.\nWe've searched everything, in\nhospitals, morgues, jails, night clubs,\nhotels.

Ludwig\nIllustration by Kelly Freas\nIt all began on a Saturday\nnight at\nThe Space Room\n. If\nyou've seen any recent Martian\ntravel folders, you know the place:\n\"A picturesque oasis of old Martian\ncharm, situated on the beauteous\nGrand Canal in the heart of\nMarsport. Only half a mile from\nhistoric Chandler Field, landing\nsite of the first Martian expedition\nnearly fifty years ago in 1990. A\nvisitor to the hotel, lunch room or\ncocktail lounge will thrill at the\nsight of hardy space pioneers mingling\nside by side with colorful\nMartian tribesmen. An evening at\nThe Space Room\nis an amazing,\nunforgettable experience.\"\nOf course, the folders neglect to\nadd that the most amazing aspect is\nthe scent of the Canal's stagnant\nwater\u2014and that the most unforgettable\nexperience is seeing the \"root-of-all-evil\"\nevaporate from your\npocketbook like snow from the\nGreat Red Desert.\nWe were sitting on the bandstand\nof the candle-lit cocktail lounge.\nMe\u2014Jimmie Stanley\u2014and my\nfour-piece combo. Maybe you've\nseen our motto back on Earth:\n\"The Hottest Music This Side of\nMercury.\"\nBut there weren't four of us tonight.\nOnly three. Ziggy, our bass\nfiddle man, had nearly sliced off\ntwo fingers while opening a can of\nSaturnian ice-fish, thus decreasing\nthe number of our personnel by a\ntragic twenty-five per cent.\nWhich was why Ke-teeli, our\nboss, was descending upon us with\nall the grace of an enraged Venusian\nvinosaur.\n\"Where ees museek?\" he shrilled\nin his nasal tenor. He was almost\nskeleton thin, like most Martians,\nand so tall that if he fell down he'd\nbe half way home.\nI gulped. \"Our bass man can't\nbe here, but we've called the Marsport\nlocal for another. He'll be here\nany minute.\"\nKe-teeli, sometimes referred to\nas Goon-Face and The Eye, leered\ncoldly down at me from his eight-foot-three.\nHis eyes were like black\nneedle points set deep in a mask of\ndry, ancient, reddish leather.\n\"Ees no feedle man, ees no job,\"\nhe squeaked.\nI sighed. This was the week our\ncontract ended. Goon-Face had displayed\nlittle enough enthusiasm for\nour music as it was. His comments\nwere either, \"Ees too loud, too fast,\"\nor \"Ees too slow, too soft.\" The real\ncause of his concern being, I suspected,\nthe infrequency with which\nhis cash register tinkled.\n\"But,\" I added, \"even if the new\nman doesn't come,\nwe're\nstill here.\nWe'll play for you.\" I glanced at\nthe conglomeration of uniformed\nspacemen, white-suited tourists,\nand loin-clothed natives who sat at\nancient stone tables. \"You wouldn't\nwant to disappoint your customers,\nwould you?\"\nKe-teeli snorted. \"Maybe ees better\ndey be deesappointed. Ees better\nno museek den bad museek.\"\nFat Boy, our clarinetist who doubles\non Martian horn-harp, made a\nfeeble attempt at optimism. \"Don't\nworry, Mr. Ke-teeli. That new bass\nman will be here.\"\n\"Sure,\" said Hammer-Head, our\nred-haired vibro-drummer. \"I think\nI hear him coming now.\"\nSuspiciously, Ke-teeli eyed the\nentrance. There was only silence.\nHis naked, parchment-like chest\nswelled as if it were an expanding\nballoon.\n\"Five meenutes!\" he shrieked.\n\"Eef no feedle, den you go!\" And\nhe whirled away.\nWe waited.\nFat Boy's two hundred and\neighty-odd pounds were drooped\nover his chair like the blubber of an\nexhausted, beach-stranded whale.\n\"Well,\" he muttered, \"there's always\nthe uranium pits of Neptune.\nCourse, you don't live more than\nfive years there\u2014\"\n\"Maybe we could make it back\nto Lunar City,\" suggested Hammer-Head.\n\"Using what for fare?\" I asked.\n\"Your brains?\"\nHammer-Head groaned. \"No. I\nguess it'll have to be the black pits\nof Neptune. The home of washed-up\ninterplanetary musicians. It's too\nbad. We're so young, too.\"\nThe seconds swept by. Ke-teeli\nwas casting his razor-edged glare in\nour direction. I brushed the chewed\nfinger nails from the keyboard of\nmy electronic piano.\nThen it happened.\nFrom the entrance of\nThe\nSpace Room\ncame a thumping\nand a grating and a banging. Suddenly,\nsweeping across the dance\nfloor like a cold wind, was a bass\nfiddle, an enormous black monstrosity,\na refugee from a pawnbroker's\nattic. It was queerly shaped. It was\ntoo tall, too wide. It was more like\na monstrous, midnight-black hour-glass\nthan a bass.\nThe fiddle was not unaccompanied\nas I'd first imagined. Behind\nit, streaking over the floor in a\nwaltz of agony, was a little guy, an\nanimated matchstick with a flat,\nbroad face that seemed to have\nbeen compressed in a vice. His sandcolored\nmop of hair reminded me\nof a field of dry grass, the long\nstrands forming loops that flanked\nthe sides of his face.\nHis pale blue eyes were watery,\nlike twin pools of fog. His tightfitting\nsuit, as black as the bass,\nwas something off a park bench. It\nwas impossible to guess his age. He\ncould have been anywhere between\ntwenty and forty.\nThe bass thumped down upon\nthe bandstand.\n\"Hello,\" he puffed. \"I'm John\nSmith, from the Marsport union.\"\nHe spoke shrilly and rapidly, as if\nanxious to conclude the routine of\nintroductions. \"I'm sorry I'm late,\nbut I was working on my plan.\"\nA moment's silence.\n\"Your plan?\" I echoed at last.\n\"How to get back home,\" he\nsnapped as if I should have known\nit already.\nHummm, I thought.\nMy gaze turned to the dance\nfloor. Goon-Face had his eyes on\nus, and they were as cold as six Indians\ngoing South.\n\"We'll talk about your plan at\nintermission,\" I said, shivering.\n\"Now, we'd better start playing.\nJohn, do you know\nOn An Asteroid\nWith You\n?\"\n\"I know\neverything\n,\" said John\nSmith.\nI turned to my piano with a\nshudder. I didn't dare look at that\nhorrible fiddle again. I didn't dare\nthink what kind of soul-chilling\ntones might emerge from its ancient\ndepths.\nAnd I didn't dare look again at\nthe second monstrosity, the one\nnamed John Smith. I closed my\neyes and plunged into a four-bar\nintro.\nHammer-Head joined in on\nvibro-drums and Fat Boy on clarinet,\nand then\u2014\nMy eyes burst open. A shiver\ncoursed down my spine like gigantic\nmice feet.\nThe tones that surged from that\nmonstrous bass were ecstatic. They\nwere out of a jazzman's Heaven.\nThey were great rolling clouds that\nseemed to envelop the entire universe\nwith their vibrance. They\nheld a depth and a volume and a\nrichness that were astounding, that\nwere like no others I'd ever heard.\nFirst they went\nBoom-de-boom-de-boom-de-boom\n,\nand then,\nboom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom\n,\njust like the tones of all bass\nfiddles.\nBut there was something else, too.\nThere were overtones, so that John\nwasn't just playing a single note,\nbut a whole chord with each beat.\nAnd the fullness, the depth of those\nincredible chords actually set my\nblood tingling. I could\nfeel\nthe\ntingling just as one can feel the vibration\nof a plucked guitar string.\nI glanced at the cash customers.\nThey looked like weary warriors\ngetting their first glimpse of Valhalla.\nGap-jawed and wide-eyed,\nthey seemed in a kind of ecstatic\nhypnosis. Even the silent, bland-faced\nMartians stopped sipping\ntheir wine-syrup and nodded their\ndark heads in time with the rhythm.\nI looked at The Eye. The transformation\nof his gaunt features\nwas miraculous. Shadows of gloom\ndissolved and were replaced by\na black-toothed, crescent-shaped\nsmile of delight. His eyes shone like\nthose of a kid seeing Santa Claus.\nWe finished\nOn An Asteroid With\nYou\n, modulated into\nSweet Sally\nfrom Saturn\nand finished with\nTighten Your Lips on Titan\n.\nWe waited for the applause of\nthe Earth people and the shrilling\nof the Martians to die down. Then\nI turned to John and his fiddle.\n\"If I didn't hear it,\" I gasped,\n\"I wouldn't believe it!\"\n\"And the fiddle's so old, too!\"\nadded Hammer-Head who, although\nsober, seemed quite drunk.\n\"Old?\" said John Smith. \"Of\ncourse it's old. It's over five thousand\nyears old. I was lucky to find\nit in a pawnshop. Only it's not a\nfiddle but a\nZloomph\n. This is the\nonly one in existence.\" He patted\nthe thing tenderly. \"I tried the hole\nin it but it isn't the right one.\"\nI wondered what the hell he was\ntalking about. I studied the black,\nmirror-like wood. The aperture in\nthe vesonator was like that of any\nbass fiddle.\n\"Isn't right for what?\" I had to\nask.\nHe turned his sad eyes to me.\n\"For going home,\" he said.\nHummm, I thought.\nWe played. Tune after tune.\nJohn knew them all, from the\nlatest pop melodies to a swing version\nof the classic\nRhapsody of The\nStars\n. He was a quiet guy during\nthe next couple of hours, and getting\nmore than a few words from\nhim seemed as hard as extracting a\ntooth. He'd stand by his fiddle\u2014I\nmean, his\nZloomph\n\u2014with a dreamy\nexpression in those watery eyes,\nstaring at nothing.\nBut after one number he studied\nFat Boy's clarinet for a moment.\n\"Nice clarinet,\" he mused. \"Has an\nunusual hole in the front.\"\nFat Boy scratched the back of\nhis head. \"You\u2014you mean here?\nWhere the music comes out?\"\nJohn Smith nodded. \"Unusual.\"\nHummm, I thought again.\nAwhile later I caught him eyeing\nmy piano keyboard. \"What's\nthe matter, John?\"\nHe pointed.\n\"Oh, there,\" I said. \"A cigarette\nfell out of my ashtray, burnt a hole\nin the key. If The Eye sees it, he'll\nswear at me in seven languages.\"\n\"Even there,\" he said softly,\n\"even there....\"\nThere was no doubt about it.\nJohn Smith was peculiar, but he\nwas the best bass man this side of a\nmusician's Nirvana.\nIt didn't take a genius to figure\nout our situation. Item one: Goon-Face's\ncountenance had evidenced\nan excellent imitation of Mephistopheles\nbefore John began to play.\nItem two: Goon-Face had beamed\nlike a kitten with a quart of cream\nafter John began to play.\nConclusion: If we wanted to\nkeep eating, we'd have to persuade\nJohn Smith to join our combo.\nAt intermission I said, \"How\nabout a drink, John? Maybe a shot\nof wine-syrup?\"\nHe shook his head.\n\"Then maybe a Venusian fizz?\"\nHis grunt was negative.\n\"Then some old-fashioned beer?\"\nHe smiled. \"Yes, I\nlike\nbeer.\"\nI escorted him to the bar and assisted\nhim in his arduous climb onto\na stool.\n\"John,\" I ventured after he'd\ntaken an experimental sip, \"where\nhave you been hiding? A guy like\nyou should be playing every night.\"\nJohn yawned. \"Just got here. Figured\nI might need some money so\nI went to the union. Then I worked\non my plan.\"\n\"Then you need a job. How\nabout playing with us steady? We\nlike your style a lot.\"\nHe made a long, low humming\nsound which I interpreted as an\nexpression of intense concentration.\n\"I don't know,\" he finally drawled.\n\"It'd be a steady job, John.\" Inspiration\nstruck me. \"And listen, I\nhave an apartment. It's got everything,\nsolar shower, automatic chef,\n'copter landing\u2014if we ever get a\n'copter. Plenty of room there for\ntwo people. You can stay with me\nand it won't cost you a cent. And\nwe'll even pay you over union\nwages.\"\nHis watery gaze wandered lazily\nto the bar mirror, down to the glittering\narray of bottles and then out\nto the dance floor.\nHe yawned again and spoke\nslowly, as if each word were a leaden\nweight cast reluctantly from his\ntongue:\n\"No, I don't ... care much ...\nabout playing.\"\n\"What\ndo\nyou like to do, John?\"\nHis string-bean of a body stiffened.\n\"I like to study ancient history ...\nand I must work on my\nplan.\"\nOh Lord, that plan again!\nI took a deep breath. \"Tell me\nabout it, John. It\nmust\nbe interesting.\"\nHe made queer clicking noises\nwith his mouth that reminded me\nof a mechanical toy being wound\ninto motion. \"The whole foundation\nof this or any other culture is\nbased on the history of all the time\ndimensions, each interwoven with\nthe other, throughout the ages. And\nthe holes provide a means of studying\nall of it first hand.\"\nOh, oh\n, I thought.\nBut you still\nhave to eat. Remember, you still\nhave to eat.\n\"Trouble is,\" he went on, \"there\nare so many holes in this universe.\"\n\"Holes?\" I kept a straight face.\n\"Certainly. Look around you. All\nyou see is holes. These beer bottles\nare just holes surrounded by glass.\nThe doors and windows\u2014they're\nholes in walls. The mine tunnels\nmake a network of holes under the\ndesert. Caves are holes, animals live\nin holes, our faces have holes,\nclothes have holes\u2014millions and\nmillions of holes!\"\nI winced and thought, humor\nhim because you gotta eat, you\ngotta eat.\nHis voice trembled with emotion.\n\"Why, they're everywhere. They're\nin pots and pans, in pipes, in rocket\njets, in bumpy roads. There are buttonholes\nand well holes, and shoelace\nholes. There are doughnut\nholes and stocking holes and woodpecker\nholes and cheese holes.\nOceans lie in holes in the earth,\nand rivers and canals and valleys.\nThe craters of the Moon are holes.\nEverything is\u2014\"\n\"But, John,\" I said as patiently as\npossible, \"what have these holes\ngot to do with you?\"\nHe glowered at me as if I were\nunworthy of such a confidence.\n\"What have they to do with me?\"\nhe shrilled. \"I can't find the right\none\u2014that's what!\"\nI closed my eyes. \"Which particular\nhole are you looking for, John?\"\nHe was speaking rapidly again\nnow.\n\"I was hurrying back to the University\nwith the\nZloomph\nto prove\na point of ancient history to those\nfools. They don't believe that instruments\nwhich make music actually\nexisted before the tapes! It\nwas dark\u2014and some fool researcher\nhad forgotten to set a force-field\nover the hole\u2014I fell through.\"\nI closed my eyes. \"Now wait a\nminute. Did you drop something,\nlose it in the hole\u2014is that why you\nhave to find it?\"\n\"Oh I didn't lose anything important,\"\nhe snapped, \"\njust\nmy own\ntime dimension. And if I don't get\nback they will think I couldn't prove\nmy theory, that I'm ashamed to\ncome back, and I'll be discredited.\"\nHis chest sagged for an instant.\nThen he straightened. \"But there's\nstill time for my plan to work out\u2014with\nthe relative difference taken\ninto account. Only I get so tired\njust thinking about it.\"\n\"Yes, I can see where thinking\nabout it would tire any one.\"\nHe nodded. \"But it can't be too\nfar away.\"\n\"I'd like to hear more about it,\"\nI said. \"But if you're not going to\nplay with us\u2014\"\n\"Oh, I'll play with you,\" he\nbeamed. \"I can talk to\nyou\n.\nYou\nunderstand.\"\nThank heaven!\nHeaven lasted for just three\ndays. During those seventy-two\ngolden hours the melodious tinkling\nof The Eye's cash register was as\nconstant as that of Santa's sleigh\nbells.\nJohn became the hero of tourists,\nspacemen, and Martians, but nevertheless\nhe remained stubbornly\naloof. He was quiet, moody, playing\nhis\nZloomph\nautomatically. He'd\nreveal definite indications of belonging\nto Homo Sapiens only when\ndrinking beer and talking about his\nholes.\nGoon-Face was still cautious.\n\"Contract?\" he wheezed. \"Maybe.\nWe see. Eef feedleman stay, we\nhave contract. He stay, yes?\"\n\"Oh, sure,\" I said. \"He'll stay\u2014just\nas long as you want him.\"\n\"Den he sign contract, too. No\nbeeg feedle, no contract.\"\n\"Sure. We'll get him to sign it.\"\nI laughed hollowly. \"Don't worry,\nMr. Ke-teeli.\"\nJust a few minutes later tragedy\nstruck.\nA reporter from the\nMarsport\nTimes\nambled into interview the\nMan of The Hour. The interview,\nunfortunately, was conducted over\nthe bar and accompanied by a generous\nguzzling of beer. Fat Boy,\nHammer-Head and I watched\nfrom a table. Knowing John as we\ndid, a silent prayer was in our eyes.\n\"This is the first time he's talked\nto anybody,\" Fat Boy breathed.\n\"I\u2014I'm scared.\n\"Nothing can happen,\" I said,\noptimistically. \"This'll be good publicity.\"\nWe watched.\nJohn murmured something. The\nreporter, a paunchy, balding man,\nscribbled furiously in his notebook.\nJohn yawned, muttered something\nelse. The reporter continued\nto scribble.\nJohn sipped beer. His eyes\nbrightened, and he began to talk\nmore rapidly.\nThe reporter frowned, stopped\nwriting, and studied John curiously.\nJohn finished his first beer,\nstarted on his second. His eyes were\nwild, and he was talking more and\nmore rapidly.\n\"He's doing it,\" Hammer-Head\ngroaned. \"He's telling him!\"\nI rose swiftly. \"We better get\nover there. We should have known\nbetter\u2014\"\nWe were too late. The reporter\nhad already slapped on his hat and\nwas striding to the exit. John turned\nto us, dazed, his enthusiasm vanishing\nlike air from a punctured balloon.\n\"He wouldn't listen,\" he said,\nweakly. \"I tried to tell him, but he\nsaid he'd come back when I'm\nsober. I'm sober now. So I quit.\nI've got to find my hole.\"\nI patted him on the back. \"No,\nJohn, we'll help you. Don't quit.\nWe'll\u2014well, we'll help you.\"\n\"We're working on a plan, too,\"\nsaid Fat Boy in a burst of inspiration.\n\"We're going to make a more\nscientific approach.\"\n\"How?\" John asked.\nFat Boy gulped.\n\"Just wait another day,\" I said.\n\"We'll have it worked out. Just be\npatient another day. You can't\nleave now, not after all your work.\"\n\"No, I guess not,\" he sighed. \"I'll\nstay\u2014until tomorrow.\"\nAll night the thought crept\nthrough my brain like a teasing\nspider:\nWhat can we do to make\nhim stay? What can we tell him?\nWhat, what, what?\nUnable to sleep the next morning,\nI left John to his snoring and\nwent for an aspirin and black coffee.\nAll the possible schemes were\ndrumming through my mind: finding\nan Earth blonde to capture\nJohn's interest, having him electro-hypnotized,\nbreaking his leg, forging\na letter from this mythical university\ntelling him his theory was\nproved valid and for him to take\na nice long vacation now. He was\na screwball about holes and force\nfields and dimensional worlds but\nfor that music of his I'd baby him\nthe rest of his life.\nIt was early afternoon when I\ntrudged back to my apartment.\nJohn was squatting on the living\nroom floor, surrounded by a forest\nof empty beer bottles. His eyes were\nbulging, his hair was even wilder\nthan usual, and he was swaying.\n\"John!\" I cried. \"You're drunk!\"\nHis watery eyes squinted at me.\n\"No, not drunk. Just scared. I'm\nawful scared!\"\n\"But you mustn't be scared. That\nreporter was just stupid. We'll help\nyou with your theory.\"\nHis body trembled. \"No, it isn't\nthat. It isn't the reporter.\"\n\"Then what is it, John?\"\n\"It's my body. It's\u2014\"\n\"Yes, what about your body?\nAre you sick?\"\nHis face was white with terror.\n\"No, my\u2014\nmy body's full of holes\n.\nSuppose it's one of those holes!\nHow will I get back if it is?\"\nHe rose and staggered to his\nZloomph\n, clutching it as though it\nwere somehow a source of strength\nand consolation.\nI patted him gingerly on the arm.\n\"Now John. You've just had too\nmuch beer, that's all. Let's go out\nand get some air and some strong\nblack coffee. C'mon now.\"\nWe staggered out into the morning\ndarkness, the three of us. John,\nthe\nZloomph\n, and I.\nI was hanging on to him trying\nto see around and over and even\nunder the\nZloomph\n\u2014steering by a\nsort of radar-like sixth sense. The\nstreet lights on Marsport are pretty\ndim compared to Earthside. I\ndidn't see the open manhole that\nthe workmen had figured would be\nall right at that time of night. It\ngets pretty damned cold around 4: A.M.\nof a Martian morning, and I\nguess the men were warming up\nwith a little nip at the bar across\nthe street.\nThen\u2014he was gone.\nJohn just slipped out of my grasp\u2014\nZloomph\nand all\u2014and was gone\u2014completely\nand irrevocably gone.\nI even risked a broken neck and\njumped in the manhole after him.\nNothing\u2014nothing but the smell of\nozone and an echo bouncing crazily\noff the walls of the conduit.\n\"\u2014is it.\u2014is it.\u2014is it.\u2014is it.\"\nJohn Smith was gone, so utterly\nand completely and tragically gone\nit was as if he'd never existed....\nTonight is our last night at\nThe\nSpace Room\n. Goon-Face is scowling\nagain with the icy fury of a\nPlutonian monsoon. As Goon-Face\nhas said, \"No beeg feedle, no contract.\"\nWithout John, we're notes in a\nlost chord.\nWe've searched everything, in\nhospitals, morgues, jails, night clubs,\nhotels. We've hounded spaceports\nand 'copter terminals. Nowhere, nowhere\nis John Smith.\nZiggy, whose two fingers have\nhealed, has already bowed to what\nseems inevitable. He's signed up for\nthat trip to Neptune's uranium\npits. There's plenty of room for\nmore volunteers, he tells us. But I\nspend my time cussing the guy who\nforgot to set the force field at the\nother end of the hole and let John\nand his\nZloomph\nback into his own\ntime dimension. I cuss harder when\nI think how we were robbed of the\nbest bass player in the galaxy.\nAnd without a corpus delecti we\ncan't even sue the city.\n... THE END\n", "summary": "The story begins on a Saturday night at the Space Room, a bar in New York City, where a man named John is playing a game of zarquil. He is a spaceman who has traveled to many different planets throughout the universe in search of an alien that can help him solve the riddle of the Great Pyramid of Ganymede. When he arrives at the bar, he sits down at a table and orders a drink. After he finishes his drink, he goes to the bar to order another drink, but the bartender refuses to serve him because he is drunk. He leaves the bar and goes to bed. The next morning, he wakes up in a hospital bed, having been in a coma for three days. He goes to see his doctor, who tells him that he has been in the hospital for an unknown amount of time. He then goes to Venus, where he meets a Martian named Ziggy. The two go to Venus together, where they visit the Grand Canyon, and then back to the hotel. The story ends with the two of them back at the hotel, where the story begins again.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}

You might find it just on the other side\nof the fence\u2014where the grass is always greener.\nThe Ship dove into Earth's sea of atmosphere like a great, silver\nfish.\nInside the ship, a man and woman stood looking down at the expanse of\nland that curved away to a growing horizon. They saw the yellow ground\ncracked like a dried skin; and the polished stone of the mountains and\nthe seas that were shrunken away in the dust. And they saw how the\ncity circled the sea, as a circle of men surround a water hole in a\ndesert under a blazing sun.\nThe ship's radio cried out. \"You've made it! Thank God! You've made\nit!\"\nAnother voice, shaking, said, \"President\u2014Davis is\u2014overwhelmed. He\ncan't go on. On his behalf and on behalf of all the people\u2014with our\nhope that was almost dead, we greet you.\" A pause. \"Please come in!\"\nThe voice was silent. The air screamed against the hull of the ship.\n\"I can't tell them,\" said the man.\n\"Please come in!\" said the radio. \"Do you hear me?\"\nThe woman looked up at the man. \"You've got to Michael!\"\n\"Two thousand years. From one end of the galaxy to the other. Not one\ngrain of dust we can live on. Just Earth. And it's burned to a\ncinder.\"\nA note of hysteria stabbed into the radio voice. \"Are you all right?\nStand by! We're sending a rescue ship.\"\n\"They've got a right to know what we've found,\" said the woman. \"They\nsent us out. They've waited so long\u2014.\"\nHe stared into space. \"It's hopeless. If we'd found another planet\nthey could live on, they'd do the same as they've done here.\"\nHe touched the tiny golden locket that hung around his neck. \"Right\nnow, I could press this and scratch myself and the whole farce would\nbe over.\"\n\"No. A thousand of us died. You've got to think of them.\"\n\"We'll go back out into space,\" he said. \"It's clean out there. I'm\ntired. Two thousand years of reincarnation.\"\nShe spoke softly. \"We've been together for a long time. I've loved\nyou. I've asked very little. But I need to stay on Earth. Please,\nMichael.\"\nHe looked at her for a moment. Then he flipped a switch. \"Milky Way to\nEarth. Never mind the rescue ship. We're all right. We're coming in.\"\nThe great, white ship settled to Earth that was like a plain after\nflood waters have drained away.\nThe man and woman came out into the blazing sunlight.\nA shout, like the crashing of a thousand surfs, rose and broke over\nthem. The man and woman descended the gang-plank toward the officials\ngathered on the platform. They glanced around at the massed field of\nwhite faces beneath them; saw those same faces that had been turned\ntoward them two thousand years past; remembered the cheers and the\ncries that had crashed around them then, as they and the thousand had\nstood before the towering spires of the ships, before the takeoff.\nAnd, as then, there were no children among the milling, grasping\nthrong. Only the same clutching hands and voices and arms, asking for\nan answer, a salvation, a happy end.\nNow the officials gathered around the man and the woman, and spoke to\nthem in voices of reverence.\nA microphone was thrust into Michael's hand with the whispered\nadmonition to tell the people of the great new life waiting for them,\nopen and green and moist, on a virgin planet.\nThe cries of the people were slipping away and a stillness growing\nlike an ocean calm and, within it, the sound of the pumps, throbbing,\nsucking the water from the seas.\nAnd then Michael's voice, \"The thousand who left with us are dead. For\nsome time we've known the other planets in our solar system were\nuninhabitable. Now we've been from one end of the galaxy to the other.\nAnd this is what we've found.... We were given Earth. There's no place\nelse for us. The rest of the planets in the galaxy were given to\nothers. There's no place else for them. We've all had a chance to make\nthe best of Earth. Instead we've made the worst of it. So we're here\nto stay\u2014and die.\" He handed the microphone back.\nThe silence did not change.\nThe President grasped Michael's arm. \"What're you saying?\"\nA buzzing rose up from the people like that of a swarm of frightened\nbees. The sea of white faces swayed and their voices began to cry. The\ndin and motion held, long and drawn out, with a wail now and a\nfluttering beneath it.\nMichael and the woman stood above them in the center of the pale,\nhovering faces of the officials.\n\"Good God,\" said the President. \"You've got to tell them what you said\nisn't true!\"\n\"We've been searching two thousand years for a truth,\" said Michael.\n\"A thousand of us have died finding it. I've told it. That's the way\nit's got to be.\"\nThe President swayed, took the microphone in his hands.\n\"There's been some mistake!\" he cried. \"Go back to the pumps and the\ndistilleries! Go back to the water vats and the gardens and the\nflocks! Go back! Work and wait! We'll get the full truth to you.\nEverything's going to be\nall right\n!\"\nObediently the mass of faces separated, as though they were being spun\naway on a whirling disk. Michael and the woman were swallowed up, like\npebbles inside a closing hand, and carried away from the great, white\nship.\nThey ushered the man and woman into the beamed and paneled council\nchambers and sat them in thick chairs before the wall of polished wood\ndesks across which stared the line of faces, silent and waiting. And\non a far wall, facing them all, hung a silver screen, fifty feet\nsquare.\nThe President stood. \"Members of the council.\" He paused. \"As you\nheard, they report\u2014complete failure.\" He turned to Michael. \"And now,\nthe proof.\"\nMichael stood beside the motion picture projector, close to his chair.\nThe lights dimmed. There was only the sound of the pumps throbbing in\nthe darkness close and far away, above and beneath and all around.\nSuddenly on the screen appeared an endless depth of blackness filled\nwith a mass of glowing white, which extended into the room around the\nwatching people, seeming to touch them and then spreading, like an\nocean, farther away and out and out into an endless distance.\nNow streaks of yellow fire shot into the picture, like a swarm of\nlightning bugs, the thin sharp nosed shadows of space ships, hurtling,\nlike comets, toward the clustered star smear. And then silent thoughts\nflashed from the screen into the minds of the spectators; of time\npassing in months, years and centuries, passing and passing until they\nthemselves seemed to be rushing and rushing into the blackness toward\nblinding balls of white light, the size of moons.\nThe dark shapes of smaller spheres circling the blinding ones moved\nforward into the picture; red, blue, green, yellow, purple and many\nmixtures of all these, and then one planet filled the screen, seeming\nto be inflated, like a balloon, into a shining red ball. There was a\nrazor edge of horizon then and pink sky and an expanse of crimson.\nFlat, yellow creatures lay all around, expanding and contracting. A\nroaring rose and fell like the roaring of a million winds. Then fear\nflowed out of the picture into the minds of the watchers so that they\ngasped and cringed, and a silent voice told them that the atmosphere\nof this planet would disintegrate a human being.\nNow the red ball seemed to pull away from them into the blackness and\nthe blinding balls of light, and all around could be seen the streaks\nof rocket flame shooting away in all directions.\nSuddenly a flash cut the blackness, like the flare of a match, and\ndied, and the watchers caught from the screen the awareness of the\ndeath of a ship.\nThey were also aware of the rushing of time through centuries and they\nsaw the streaking rocket flames and planets rushing at them; saw\ncreatures in squares and circles, in threads wriggling, in lumps and\nblobs, rolling jumping and crawling; saw them in cloud forms whisking\nabout, changing their shapes, and in flowing wavelets of water. They\nsaw creatures hopping about on one leg and others crawling at\nincredible speeds on a thousand; saw some with all the numbers of legs\nand arms in between; and were aware of creatures that were there but\ninvisible.\nAnd those watching the screen on which time and distance were a\ncompressed and distilled kaleidoscope, saw planet after planet and\nthousands at a time; heard strange noises; rasping and roaring, clinks\nand whistles, screams and crying, sighing and moaning. And they were\naware through all this of atmosphere and ground inimical to man, some\nthat would evaporate at the touch of a human body, or would burst into\nflame, or swallow, or turn from liquid to solid or solid to liquid.\nThey saw and heard chemical analyses, were aware of this ocean of\nblackness and clouds of white through which man might move, and must\never move, because he could live only upon this floating dust speck\nthat was Earth.\nThe picture faded in, close to one of the long, needle nosed crafts,\nshowing inside, a man and a woman. Time was telescoped again while the\nman cut a tiny piece of scar tissue from his arm and that of the\nwoman, put them in bottles and set them into compartments where\nsolutions dripped rhythmically into the bottles, the temperature was\nheld at that of the human body, and synthetic sunlight focused upon\nthem from many pencil like tubes.\nThe watchers in the council chamber saw the bits of tissue swell into\nhuman embryos in a few seconds, and grow arms and legs and faces and\nextend themselves into babies. Saw them taken from the bottles and\ncared for, and become replicas of the man and woman controlling the\nship, who, all this time were aging, until life went out of their\nbodies. Then the ones who had been the scar tissue disintegrated them\nin the coffin-like tubes and let their dust be sucked out into\nspace\u2014all this through millions of miles and a hundred years,\ncompressed for the watchers into sixty seconds and a few feet of\nspace.\nInstantly there was black space on the screen again, with the fingers\nof flame pointing out behind the dark bodies of the ships.\nAnd then the spectators saw one ship shudder and swerve into a\nblazing, bluish white star, like a gnat flying into a white hot poker;\nsaw another drop away and away, out and out into the blackness past\nthe swirling white rim of the galaxy, and sink into a dark\nnothingness.\nGreat balls of rock showered like hail onto other ships, smashing them\ninto grotesque tin cans. The stream of fire at the tail of another\nship suddenly died and the ship floated into an orbit around a great,\nyellow planet, ten times the size of Jupiter, then was sucked into it.\nAnother burst like a bomb, flinging a man and woman out into the\ndarkness, where they hung suspended, frozen into statues, like bodies\ndrowned in the depths of an Arctic sea.\nAt this instant from the watching council, there were screams of\nhorror and voices crying out, \"Shut it off! Shut it off!\" There was a\nmoving about in the darkness. Murmurs and harsh cries of disapproval\ngrew in volume.\nAnother ship in the picture was split down the side by a meteor and\nthe bodies inside were impaled on jagged blades of steel, the\ncontorted, bloody faces lighted by bursts of flame. And the screams\nand cries of the spectators rose higher, \"Shut it off.... Oh Lord....\"\nLights flashed through the room and the picture died.\nMichael and Mary, both staring, saw, along the line of desks, the\nagonized faces, some staring like white stones, others hidden in\nclutching fingers, as though they had been confronted by a Medusa.\nThere was the sound of heavy breathing that mixed with the throbbing\nof the pumps. The President held tightly to the edges of his desk to\nquiet his trembling.\n\"There\u2014there've been changes,\" he said, \"since you've been out in\nspace. There isn't a person on Earth who's seen a violent death for\nhundreds of years.\"\nMichael faced him, frowning. \"I don't follow you.\"\n\"Dying violently happened so seldom on Earth that, after a long time,\nthe sight of it began to drive some people mad. And then one day a man\nwas struck by one of the ground cars and\neveryone\nwho saw it went\ninsane. Since then we've eliminated accidents, even the idea. Now, no\none is aware that death by violence is even a possibility.\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Michael, \"we've been so close to violent death for\nso long.... What you've seen is part of the proof you asked for.\"\n\"What you showed us was a picture,\" said the President. \"If it had\nbeen real, we'd all be insane by now. If it were shown to the people\nthere'd be mass hysteria.\"\n\"But even if we'd found another habitable planet, getting to it would\ninvolve just what we've shown you. Maybe only a tenth of the people\nwho left Earth, or a hundredth, would ever reach a destination out in\nspace.\"\n\"We couldn't tolerate such a possibility,\" said the President\ngravely. \"We'd have to find a way around it.\"\nThe pumps throbbed like giant hearts all through the stillness in the\ncouncil chambers. The faces along the line of desks were smoothing\nout; the terror in them was fading away.\n\"And yet the Earth is almost dead,\" said Michael quietly, \"and you\ncan't bring it back to life.\"\n\"The sins of our past, Mr. Nelson,\" said the President. \"The Atomic\nwars five thousand years ago. And the greed. It was too late a long\ntime ago. That, of course, is why the expedition was sent out. And now\nyou've come back to us with this terrible news.\" He looked around,\nslowly, then back to Michael. \"Can you give us any hope at all?\"\n\"None.\"\n\"Another expedition? To Andromeda perhaps? With you the leader?\"\nMichael shook his head. \"We're finished with expeditions, Mr.\nPresident.\"\nThere were mutterings in the council, and hastily whispered\nconsultations. Now they were watching the man and woman again.\n\"We feel,\" said the President, \"it would be dangerous to allow you to\ngo out among the people. They've been informed that your statement\nwasn't entirely true. This was necessary, to avoid a panic. The people\nsimply must not know the whole truth.\" He paused. \"Now we ask you to\nkeep in mind that whatever we decide about the two of you will be for\nthe good of the people.\"\nMichael and Mary were silent.\n\"You'll wait outside the council chambers,\" the President went on,\n\"until we have reached our decision.\"\nAs the man and woman were led away, the pumps beat in the stillness,\nand at the edge of the shrinking seas the salt thick waters were being\npulled into the distilleries, and from them into the tier upon tier of\nartificial gardens that sat like giant bee hives all around the\nshoreline; and the mounds of salt glistening in the sunlight behind\nthe gardens were growing into mountains.\nIn their rooms, Michael and Mary were talking through the hours, and\nwaiting. All around them were fragile, form-fitting chairs and\ntranslucent walls and a ceiling that, holding the light of the sun\nwhen they had first seen it, was now filled with moonlight.\nStanding at a circular window, ten feet in diameter, Michael saw, far\nbelow, the lights of the city extending into the darkness along the\nshoreline of the sea.\n\"We should have delivered our message by radio,\" he said, \"and gone\nback into space.\"\n\"You could probably still go,\" she said quietly.\nHe came and stood beside her. \"I couldn't stand being out in space, or\nanywhere, without you.\"\nShe looked up at him. \"We could go out into the wilderness, Michael,\noutside the force walls. We could go far away.\"\nHe turned from her. \"It's all dead. What would be the use?\"\n\"I came from the Earth,\" she said quietly. \"And I've got to go back to\nit. Space is so cold and frightening. Steel walls and blackness and\nthe rockets and the little pinpoints of light. It's a prison.\"\n\"But to die out there in the desert, in that dust.\" Then he paused and\nlooked away from her. \"We're crazy\u2014talking as though we had a\nchoice.\"\n\"Maybe they'll have to\ngive\nus a choice.\"\n\"What're you talking about?\"\n\"They went into hysterics at the sight of those bodies in the picture.\nThose young bodies that didn't die of old age.\"\nHe waited.\n\"They can't stand the sight of people dying violently.\"\nHer hand went to her throat and touched the tiny locket.\n\"These lockets were given to us so we'd have a choice between\nsuffering or quick painless death.... We still have a choice.\"\nHe touched the locket at his own throat and was very still for a long\nmoment. \"So we threaten to kill ourselves, before their eyes. What\nwould it do to them?\"\nHe was still for a long time. \"Sometimes, Mary, I think I don't know\nyou at all.\" A pause. \"And so now you and I are back where we started.\nWhich'll it be, space or Earth?\"\n\"Michael.\" Her voice trembled. \"I\u2014I don't know how to say this.\"\nHe waited, frowning, watching her intently.\n\"I'm\u2014going to have a child.\"\nHis face went blank.\nThen he stepped forward and took her by the shoulders. He saw the\nsoftness there in her face; saw her eyes bright as though the sun were\nshining in them; saw a flush in her cheeks, as though she had been\nrunning. And suddenly his throat was full.\n\"No,\" he said thickly. \"I can't believe it.\"\n\"It's true.\"\nHe held her for a long time, then he turned his eyes aside.\n\"Yes, I can see it is.\"\n\"I\u2014I can't put into words why I let it happen, Michael.\"\nHe shook his head. \"I don't know\u2014what to\u2014to say. It's so\nincredible.\"\n\"Maybe\u2014I got so\u2014tired\u2014just seeing the two of us over and over again\nand the culturing of the scar tissue, for twenty centuries. Maybe that\nwas it. It was just\u2014something I felt I\nhad\nto do. Some\u2014\nreal\nlife\nagain. Something new. I felt a need to produce something out of\nmyself. It all started way out in space, while we were getting close\nto the solar system. I began to wonder if we'd ever get out of the\nship alive or if we'd ever see a sunset again or a dawn or the night\nor morning like we'd seen on Earth\u2014so\u2014so long ago. And then I\nhad\nto let it happen. It was a vague and strange thing. There was\nsomething forcing me. But at the same time I wanted it, too. I seemed\nto be willing it, seemed to be feeling it was a necessary thing.\" She\npaused, frowning. \"I didn't stop to think\u2014it would be like this.\"\n\"Such a thing,\" he said, smiling grimly, \"hasn't happened on Earth for\nthree thousand years. I can remember in school, reading in the history\nbooks, how the whole Earth was overcrowded and how the food and water\nhad to be rationed and then how the laws were passed forbidding birth\nand after that how the people died and there weren't any more babies\nborn, until at last there was plenty of what the Earth had to give,\nfor everyone. And then the news was broken to everyone about the\nculturing of the scar tissue, and there were a few dissenters but they\nwere soon conditioned out of their dissension and the population was\nstabilized.\" He paused. \"After all this past history, I don't think\nthe council could endure what you've done.\"\n\"No,\" she said quietly. \"I don't think they could.\"\n\"And so this will be just for\nus\n.\" He took her in his arms. \"If I\nremember rightly, this is a traditional action.\" A pause. \"Now I'll go\nwith you out onto the Earth\u2014if we can swing it. When we get outside\nthe city, or if we do\u2014Well, we'll see.\"\nThey were very still together and then he turned and stood by the\nwindow and looked down upon the city and she came and stood beside\nhim.\nThey both saw it at the same time. And they watched, without speaking,\nboth knowing what was in the other's mind and heart. They watched the\ngiant four dimensional screens all through the city. A green, lush\nplanet showed bright and clear on them and there were ships standing\namong the trees and men walking through the grass, that moved gently\nlike the swells on a calm ocean, while into their minds came the\nthoughts projected from the screen:\n\"This will be your new home. It was found and then lost. But another\nexpedition will be sent out to find it again. Be of good hope.\nEverything will be all right.\"\nMichael turned from the window. \"So there's our evidence. Two thousand\nyears. All the others killed getting it. And with a simple twist, it\nbecomes a lie.\"\nMary sat down and buried her face in her hands.\n\"What a terrible failure there's been here,\" said Michael. \"The\nneglect and destruction of a whole planet. It's like a family letting\ntheir home decay all around them, and living in smaller and smaller\nrooms of it, until at last the rooms are all gone, and since they\ncan't find another home, they all die in the ruins of the last room.\"\n\"I can't face dying,\" Mary said quietly, \"squeezed in with all these\npeople, in this tomb they've made around the seas. I want to have the\nopen sky and the quiet away from those awful pounding pumps when I\ndie. I want the spread of the Earth all around and the clean air. I\nwant to be a real part of the Earth again.\"\nMichael barely nodded in agreement. He was standing very still now.\nAnd then there was the sound of the door opening.\nThey both rose, like mourners at a funeral, and went into the council\nchambers.\nAgain they sat in the thick chairs before the wall of desks with the\nfaces of the council looking across it like defenders.\nThe pumps were beating, beating all through the room and the quiet.\nThe President was standing. He faced Michael and Mary, and seemed to\nset himself as though to deliver a blow, or to receive one.\n\"Michael and Mary,\" he said, his voice struggling against a tightness,\n\"we've considered a long time concerning what is to be done with you\nand the report you brought back to us from the galaxy.\" He took\nanother swallow of water. \"To protect the sanity of the people, we've\nchanged your report. We've also decided that the people must be\nprotected from the possibility of your spreading the truth, as you did\nat the landing field. So, for the good of the people, you'll be\nisolated. All comforts will be given you. After all, in a sense, you\nare\nheroes and martyrs. Your scar tissue will be cultured as it has\nbeen in the past, and you will stay in solitary confinement until the\ntime when, perhaps, we can migrate to another planet. We feel that\nhope must not be destroyed. And so another expedition is being sent\nout. It may be that, in time, on another planet, you'll be able to\ntake your place in our society.\"\nHe paused. \"Is there anything you wish to say?\"\n\"Yes, there is.\"\n\"Proceed.\"\nMichael stared straight at the President. After a long moment, he\nraised his hand to the tiny locket at his throat.\n\"Perhaps you remember,\" he said, \"the lockets given to every member of\nthe expedition the night before we left. I still have mine.\" He raised\nit. \"So does my wife. They were designed to kill the wearer instantly\nand painlessly if he were ever faced with pain or a terror he couldn't\nendure.\"\nThe President was standing again. A stir ran along the barricade of\ndesks.\n\"We can't endure the city,\" went on Michael, \"or its life and the ways\nof the people.\" He glanced along the line of staring faces.\n\"If what I think you're about to say is true,\" said the President in a\nshaking voice, \"it would have been better if you'd never been born.\"\n\"Let's face facts, Mr. President. We were\nborn\nand haven't\ndied\u2014yet.\" A pause. \"And we can kill ourselves right here before your\neyes. It'd be painless to us. We'd be unconscious. But there would be\nhorrible convulsions and grimaces. Our bodies would be twisted and\ntorn. They'd thresh about. The deaths you saw in the picture happened\na long time ago, in outer space. You all went into hysterics at the\nsight of them. Our deaths now would be close and terrible to see.\"\nThe President staggered as though about to faint. There was a stirring\nand muttering and a jumping up along the desks. Voices cried out, in\nanger and fear. Arms waved and fists pounded. Hands clasped and\nunclasped and clawed at collars, and there was a pell mell rushing\naround the President. They yelled at each other and clasped each other\nby the shoulders, turned away and back again, and then suddenly became\nvery still.\nNow they began to step down from the raised line of desks, the\nPresident leading them, and came close to the man and woman, gathering\naround them in a wide half circle.\nMichael and Mary were holding the lockets close to their throats. The\nhalf circle of people, with the President at its center was moving\ncloser and closer. They were sweaty faces and red ones and dry white\nones and hands were raised to seize them.\nMichael put his arm around Mary's waist. He felt the trembling in her\nbody and the waiting for death.\n\"Stop!\" he said quietly.\nThey halted, in slight confusion, barely drawing back.\n\"If you want to see us die\u2014just come a step closer.... And remember\nwhat'll happen to you.\"\nThe faces began turning to each other and there was an undertone of\nmuttering and whispering. \"A ghastly thing.... Instant.... Nothing to\ndo.... Space's broken their minds.... They'll do it.... Eyes're\nmad.... What can we do?... What?...\" The sweaty faces, the cold white\nones, the flushed hot ones: all began to turn to the President, who\nwas staring at the two before him like a man watching himself die in a\nmirror.\n\"I command you,\" he suddenly said, in a choked voice, \"to\u2014to give me\nthose\u2014lockets! It's your\u2014duty!\"\n\"We've only one duty, Mr. President,\" said Michael sharply. \"To\nourselves.\"\n\"You're sick. Give yourselves over to us. We'll help you.\"\n\"We've made our choice. We want an answer. Quickly! Now!\"\nThe President's body sagged. \"What\u2014what is it you want?\"\nMichael threw the words. \"To go beyond the force fields of the city.\nTo go far out onto the Earth and live as long as we can, and then to\ndie a natural death.\"\nThe half circle of faces turned to each other and muttered and\nwhispered again. \"In the name of God.... Let them go.... Contaminate\nus.... Like animals.... Get them out of here....\nLet\nthem be\nfinished.... Best for us all.... And them....\"\nThere was a turning to the President again and hands thrusting him\nforward to within one step of Michael and Mary, who were standing\nthere close together, as though attached.\nHaltingly he said, \"Go. Please go. Out onto the Earth\u2014to die. You\nwill\ndie. The Earth is dead out there. You'll never see the city or\nyour people again.\"\n\"We want a ground car,\" said Michael. \"And supplies.\"\n\"A ground car,\" repeated the President. \"And\u2014supplies.... Yes.\"\n\"You can give us an escort, if you want to, out beyond the first range\nof mountains.\"\n\"There will be no escort,\" said the President firmly. \"No one has been\nallowed to go out upon the Earth or to fly above it for many hundreds\nof years. We know it's there. That's enough. We couldn't bear the\nsight of it.\" He took a step back. \"And we can't bear the sight of you\nany longer. Go now. Quickly!\"\nMichael and Mary did not let go of the lockets as they watched the\nhalf circle of faces move backward, staring, as though at corpses that\nshould sink to the floor.\nIt was night. The city had been lost beyond the dead mounds of Earth\nthat rolled away behind them, like a thousand ancient tombs. The\nground car sat still on a crumbling road.\nLooking up through the car's driving blister, they saw the stars sunk\ninto the blue black ocean of space; saw the path of the Milky Way\nalong which they had rushed, while they had been searching frantically\nfor the place of salvation.\n\"If any one of the other couples had made it back,\" said Mary, \"do you\nthink they'd be with us?\"\n\"I think they'd either be with us,\" he said, \"or out in space\nagain\u2014or in prison.\"\nShe stared ahead along the beam of headlight that stabbed out into the\nnight over the decaying road.\n\"How sorry are you,\" she said quietly, \"coming with me?\"\n\"All I know is, if I were out in space for long without you, I'd kill\nmyself.\"\n\"Are we going to die out here, Michael?\" she said, gesturing toward\nthe wall of night that stood at the end of the headlight, \"with the\nland?\"\nHe turned from her, frowning, and drove the ground car forward,\nwatching the headlights push back the darkness.\nThey followed the crumbling highway all night until light crept across\nthe bald and cracked hills. The morning sun looked down upon the\ndesolation ten feet above the horizon when the car stopped. They sat\nfor a long time then, looking out upon the Earth's parched and\ninflamed skin. In the distance a wall of mountains rose like a great\npile of bleached bones. Close ahead the rolling plains were motionless\nwaves of dead Earth with a slight breeze stirring up little swirls of\ndust.\n\"I'm getting out,\" she said.\n\"I haven't the slightest idea how much farther to go, or why,\" said\nMichael shrugging. \"It's all the same. Dirt and hills and mountains\nand sun and dust. It's really not much different from being out in\nspace. We live in the car just like in a space ship. We've enough\nconcentrated supplies to last for a year. How far do we go? Why?\nWhen?\"\nThey stepped upon the Earth and felt the warmth of the sun and\nstrolled toward the top of the hill.\n\"The air smells clean,\" he said.\n\"The ground feels good. I think I'll take off my shoes.\" She did.\n\"Take off your boots, Michael. Try it.\"\nWearily he pulled off his boots, stood in his bare feet. \"It takes me\nback.\"\n\"Yes,\" she said and began walking toward the hilltop.\nHe followed, his boots slung around his neck. \"There was a road\nsomewhere, with the dust between my toes. Or was it a dream?\"\n\"I guess when the past is old enough,\" she said, \"it becomes a dream.\"\nHe watched her footprints in the dust. \"God, listen to the quiet.\"\n\"I can't seem to remember so much quiet around me. There's always been\nthe sound of a space ship, or the pumps back in the cities.\"\nHe did not answer but continued to watch her footsteps and to feel the\ndust squishing up between his toes. Then suddenly:\n\"Mary!\"\nShe stopped, whirling around.\nHe was staring down at her feet.\nShe followed his gaze.\n\"It's grass!\" He bent down. \"Three blades.\"\nShe knelt beside him. They touched the green blades.\n\"They're new,\" he said.\nThey stared, like religious devotees concentrating upon some sacred\nobject.\nHe rose, pulling her up with him. They hurried to the top of the hill\nand stood very still, looking down into a valley. There were tiny\npatches of green and little trees sprouting, and here and there, a\npale flower. The green was in a cluster, in the center of the valley\nand there was a tiny glint of sunlight in its center.\n\"Oh!\"\nHer hand found his.\nThey ran down the gentle slope, feeling the patches of green touch\ntheir feet, smelling a new freshness in the air. And coming to the\nlittle spring, they stood beside it and watched the crystal water that\ntrickled along the valley floor and lost itself around a bend. They\nsaw a furry, little animal scurry away and heard the twitter of a bird\nand saw it resting on a slim, bending branch. They heard the buzz of a\nbee, saw it light on a pale flower at their feet and work at the\nsweetness inside.\nMary knelt down and drank from the spring.\n\"It's so cool. It must come from deep down.\"\n\"It does,\" he said. There were tears in his eyes and a tightness in\nhis throat. \"From deep down.\"\n\"We can\nlive\nhere, Michael!\"\nSlowly he looked all around until his sight stopped at the bottom of a\nhill. \"We'll build our house just beyond those rocks. We'll dig and\nplant and you'll have the child.\"\n\"Yes!\" she said. \"Oh yes!\"\n\"And the ones back in the city will know the Earth again. Sometime\nwe'll lead them back here and show them the Earth is coming alive.\" He\npaused. \"By following what we had to do for ourselves, we've found a\nway to save them.\"\nThey remained kneeling in the silence beside the pool for a long time.\nThey felt the sun on their backs and looked into the clean depth of\nthe water deeply aware of the new life breathing all around them and\nof themselves absorbing it, and at the same time giving back to it the\nlife that was their own.\nThere was only this quiet and breathing and warmth until Michael stood\nand picked up a rock and walked toward the base of the hill where he\nhad decided to build the house.\n...

You might find it just on the other side\nof the fence\u2014where the grass is always greener.\nThe Ship dove into Earth's sea of atmosphere like a great, silver\nfish.\nInside the ship, a man and woman stood looking down at the expanse of\nland that curved away to a growing horizon. They saw the yellow ground\ncracked like a dried skin; and the polished stone of the mountains and\nthe seas that were shrunken away in the dust. And they saw how the\ncity circled the sea, as a circle of men surround a water hole in a\ndesert under a blazing sun.\nThe ship's radio cried out. \"You've made it! Thank God! You've made\nit!\"\nAnother voice, shaking, said, \"President\u2014Davis is\u2014overwhelmed. He\ncan't go on. On his behalf and on behalf of all the people\u2014with our\nhope that was almost dead, we greet you.\" A pause. \"Please come in!\"\nThe voice was silent. The air screamed against the hull of the ship.\n\"I can't tell them,\" said the man.\n\"Please come in!\" said the radio. \"Do you hear me?\"\nThe woman looked up at the man. \"You've got to Michael!\"\n\"Two thousand years. From one end of the galaxy to the other. Not one\ngrain of dust we can live on. Just Earth. And it's burned to a\ncinder.\"\nA note of hysteria stabbed into the radio voice. \"Are you all right?\nStand by! We're sending a rescue ship.\"\n\"They've got a right to know what we've found,\" said the woman. \"They\nsent us out. They've waited so long\u2014.\"\nHe stared into space. \"It's hopeless. If we'd found another planet\nthey could live on, they'd do the same as they've done here.\"\nHe touched the tiny golden locket that hung around his neck. \"Right\nnow, I could press this and scratch myself and the whole farce would\nbe over.\"\n\"No. A thousand of us died. You've got to think of them.\"\n\"We'll go back out into space,\" he said. \"It's clean out there. I'm\ntired. Two thousand years of reincarnation.\"\nShe spoke softly. \"We've been together for a long time. I've loved\nyou. I've asked very little. But I need to stay on Earth. Please,\nMichael.\"\nHe looked at her for a moment. Then he flipped a switch. \"Milky Way to\nEarth. Never mind the rescue ship. We're all right. We're coming in.\"\nThe great, white ship settled to Earth that was like a plain after\nflood waters have drained away.\nThe man and woman came out into the blazing sunlight.\nA shout, like the crashing of a thousand surfs, rose and broke over\nthem. The man and woman descended the gang-plank toward the officials\ngathered on the platform. They glanced around at the massed field of\nwhite faces beneath them; saw those same faces that had been turned\ntoward them two thousand years past; remembered the cheers and the\ncries that had crashed around them then, as they and the thousand had\nstood before the towering spires of the ships, before the takeoff.\nAnd, as then, there were no children among the milling, grasping\nthrong. Only the same clutching hands and voices and arms, asking for\nan answer, a salvation, a happy end.\nNow the officials gathered around the man and the woman, and spoke to\nthem in voices of reverence.\nA microphone was thrust into Michael's hand with the whispered\nadmonition to tell the people of the great new life waiting for them,\nopen and green and moist, on a virgin planet.\nThe cries of the people were slipping away and a stillness growing\nlike an ocean calm and, within it, the sound of the pumps, throbbing,\nsucking the water from the seas.\nAnd then Michael's voice, \"The thousand who left with us are dead. For\nsome time we've known the other planets in our solar system were\nuninhabitable. Now we've been from one end of the galaxy to the other.\nAnd this is what we've found.... We were given Earth. There's no place\nelse for us. The rest of the planets in the galaxy were given to\nothers. There's no place else for them. We've all had a chance to make\nthe best of Earth. Instead we've made the worst of it. So we're here\nto stay\u2014and die.\" He handed the microphone back.\nThe silence did not change.\nThe President grasped Michael's arm. \"What're you saying?\"\nA buzzing rose up from the people like that of a swarm of frightened\nbees. The sea of white faces swayed and their voices began to cry. The\ndin and motion held, long and drawn out, with a wail now and a\nfluttering beneath it.\nMichael and the woman stood above them in the center of the pale,\nhovering faces of the officials.\n\"Good God,\" said the President. \"You've got to tell them what you said\nisn't true!\"\n\"We've been searching two thousand years for a truth,\" said Michael.\n\"A thousand of us have died finding it. I've told it. That's the way\nit's got to be.\"\nThe President swayed, took the microphone in his hands.\n\"There's been some mistake!\" he cried. \"Go back to the pumps and the\ndistilleries! Go back to the water vats and the gardens and the\nflocks! Go back! Work and wait! We'll get the full truth to you.\nEverything's going to be\nall right\n!\"\nObediently the mass of faces separated, as though they were being spun\naway on a whirling disk. Michael and the woman were swallowed up, like\npebbles inside a closing hand, and carried away from the great, white\nship.\nThey ushered the man and woman into the beamed and paneled council\nchambers and sat them in thick chairs before the wall of polished wood\ndesks across which stared the line of faces, silent and waiting. And\non a far wall, facing them all, hung a silver screen, fifty feet\nsquare.\nThe President stood. \"Members of the council.\" He paused. \"As you\nheard, they report\u2014complete failure.\" He turned to Michael. \"And now,\nthe proof.\"\nMichael stood beside the motion picture projector, close to his chair.\nThe lights dimmed. There was only the sound of the pumps throbbing in\nthe darkness close and far away, above and beneath and all around.\nSuddenly on the screen appeared an endless depth of blackness filled\nwith a mass of glowing white, which extended into the room around the\nwatching people, seeming to touch them and then spreading, like an\nocean, farther away and out and out into an endless distance.\nNow streaks of yellow fire shot into the picture, like a swarm of\nlightning bugs, the thin sharp nosed shadows of space ships, hurtling,\nlike comets, toward the clustered star smear. And then silent thoughts\nflashed from the screen into the minds of the spectators; of time\npassing in months, years and centuries, passing and passing until they\nthemselves seemed to be rushing and rushing into the blackness toward\nblinding balls of white light, the size of moons.\nThe dark shapes of smaller spheres circling the blinding ones moved\nforward into the picture; red, blue, green, yellow, purple and many\nmixtures of all these, and then one planet filled the screen, seeming\nto be inflated, like a balloon, into a shining red ball. There was a\nrazor edge of horizon then and pink sky and an expanse of crimson.\nFlat, yellow creatures lay all around, expanding and contracting. A\nroaring rose and fell like the roaring of a million winds. Then fear\nflowed out of the picture into the minds of the watchers so that they\ngasped and cringed, and a silent voice told them that the atmosphere\nof this planet would disintegrate a human being.\nNow the red ball seemed to pull away from them into the blackness and\nthe blinding balls of light, and all around could be seen the streaks\nof rocket flame shooting away in all directions.\nSuddenly a flash cut the blackness, like the flare of a match, and\ndied, and the watchers caught from the screen the awareness of the\ndeath of a ship.\nThey were also aware of the rushing of time through centuries and they\nsaw the streaking rocket flames and planets rushing at them; saw\ncreatures in squares and circles, in threads wriggling, in lumps and\nblobs, rolling jumping and crawling; saw them in cloud forms whisking\nabout, changing their shapes, and in flowing wavelets of water. They\nsaw creatures hopping about on one leg and others crawling at\nincredible speeds on a thousand; saw some with all the numbers of legs\nand arms in between; and were aware of creatures that were there but\ninvisible.\nAnd those watching the screen on which time and distance were a\ncompressed and distilled kaleidoscope, saw planet after planet and\nthousands at a time; heard strange noises; rasping and roaring, clinks\nand whistles, screams and crying, sighing and moaning. And they were\naware through all this of atmosphere and ground inimical to man, some\nthat would evaporate at the touch of a human body, or would burst into\nflame, or swallow, or turn from liquid to solid or solid to liquid.\nThey saw and heard chemical analyses, were aware of this ocean of\nblackness and clouds of white through which man might move, and must\never move, because he could live only upon this floating dust speck\nthat was Earth.\nThe picture faded in, close to one of the long, needle nosed crafts,\nshowing inside, a man and a woman. Time was telescoped again while the\nman cut a tiny piece of scar tissue from his arm and that of the\nwoman, put them in bottles and set them into compartments where\nsolutions dripped rhythmically into the bottles, the temperature was\nheld at that of the human body, and synthetic sunlight focused upon\nthem from many pencil like tubes.\nThe watchers in the council chamber saw the bits of tissue swell into\nhuman embryos in a few seconds, and grow arms and legs and faces and\nextend themselves into babies. Saw them taken from the bottles and\ncared for, and become replicas of the man and woman controlling the\nship, who, all this time were aging, until life went out of their\nbodies. Then the ones who had been the scar tissue disintegrated them\nin the coffin-like tubes and let their dust be sucked out into\nspace\u2014all this through millions of miles and a hundred years,\ncompressed for the watchers into sixty seconds and a few feet of\nspace.\nInstantly there was black space on the screen again, with the fingers\nof flame pointing out behind the dark bodies of the ships.\nAnd then the spectators saw one ship shudder and swerve into a\nblazing, bluish white star, like a gnat flying into a white hot poker;\nsaw another drop away and away, out and out into the blackness past\nthe swirling white rim of the galaxy, and sink into a dark\nnothingness.\nGreat balls of rock showered like hail onto other ships, smashing them\ninto grotesque tin cans. The stream of fire at the tail of another\nship suddenly died and the ship floated into an orbit around a great,\nyellow planet, ten times the size of Jupiter, then was sucked into it.\nAnother burst like a bomb, flinging a man and woman out into the\ndarkness, where they hung suspended, frozen into statues, like bodies\ndrowned in the depths of an Arctic sea.\nAt this instant from the watching council, there were screams of\nhorror and voices crying out, \"Shut it off! Shut it off!\" There was a\nmoving about in the darkness. Murmurs and harsh cries of disapproval\ngrew in volume.\nAnother ship in the picture was split down the side by a meteor and\nthe bodies inside were impaled on jagged blades of steel, the\ncontorted, bloody faces lighted by bursts of flame. And the screams\nand cries of the spectators rose higher, \"Shut it off.... Oh Lord....\"\nLights flashed through the room and the picture died.\nMichael and Mary, both staring, saw, along the line of desks, the\nagonized faces, some staring like white stones, others hidden in\nclutching fingers, as though they had been confronted by a Medusa.\nThere was the sound of heavy breathing that mixed with the throbbing\nof the pumps. The President held tightly to the edges of his desk to\nquiet his trembling.\n\"There\u2014there've been changes,\" he said, \"since you've been out in\nspace. There isn't a person on Earth who's seen a violent death for\nhundreds of years.\"\nMichael faced him, frowning. \"I don't follow you.\"\n\"Dying violently happened so seldom on Earth that, after a long time,\nthe sight of it began to drive some people mad. And then one day a man\nwas struck by one of the ground cars and\neveryone\nwho saw it went\ninsane. Since then we've eliminated accidents, even the idea. Now, no\none is aware that death by violence is even a possibility.\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Michael, \"we've been so close to violent death for\nso long.... What you've seen is part of the proof you asked for.\"\n\"What you showed us was a picture,\" said the President. \"If it had\nbeen real, we'd all be insane by now. If it were shown to the people\nthere'd be mass hysteria.\"\n\"But even if we'd found another habitable planet, getting to it would\ninvolve just what we've shown you. Maybe only a tenth of the people\nwho left Earth, or a hundredth, would ever reach a destination out in\nspace.\"\n\"We couldn't tolerate such a possibility,\" said the President\ngravely. \"We'd have to find a way around it.\"\nThe pumps throbbed like giant hearts all through the stillness in the\ncouncil chambers. The faces along the line of desks were smoothing\nout; the terror in them was fading away.\n\"And yet the Earth is almost dead,\" said Michael quietly, \"and you\ncan't bring it back to life.\"\n\"The sins of our past, Mr. Nelson,\" said the President. \"The Atomic\nwars five thousand years ago. And the greed. It was too late a long\ntime ago. That, of course, is why the expedition was sent out. And now\nyou've come back to us with this terrible news.\" He looked around,\nslowly, then back to Michael. \"Can you give us any hope at all?\"\n\"None.\"\n\"Another expedition? To Andromeda perhaps? With you the leader?\"\nMichael shook his head. \"We're finished with expeditions, Mr.\nPresident.\"\nThere were mutterings in the council, and hastily whispered\nconsultations. Now they were watching the man and woman again.\n\"We feel,\" said the President, \"it would be dangerous to allow you to\ngo out among the people. They've been informed that your statement\nwasn't entirely true. This was necessary, to avoid a panic. The people\nsimply must not know the whole truth.\" He paused. \"Now we ask you to\nkeep in mind that whatever we decide about the two of you will be for\nthe good of the people.\"\nMichael and Mary were silent.\n\"You'll wait outside the council chambers,\" the President went on,\n\"until we have reached our decision.\"\nAs the man and woman were led away, the pumps beat in the stillness,\nand at the edge of the shrinking seas the salt thick waters were being\npulled into the distilleries, and from them into the tier upon tier of\nartificial gardens that sat like giant bee hives all around the\nshoreline; and the mounds of salt glistening in the sunlight behind\nthe gardens were growing into mountains.\nIn their rooms, Michael and Mary were talking through the hours, and\nwaiting. All around them were fragile, form-fitting chairs and\ntranslucent walls and a ceiling that, holding the light of the sun\nwhen they had first seen it, was now filled with moonlight.\nStanding at a circular window, ten feet in diameter, Michael saw, far\nbelow, the lights of the city extending into the darkness along the\nshoreline of the sea.\n\"We should have delivered our message by radio,\" he said, \"and gone\nback into space.\"\n\"You could probably still go,\" she said quietly.\nHe came and stood beside her. \"I couldn't stand being out in space, or\nanywhere, without you.\"\nShe looked up at him. \"We could go out into the wilderness, Michael,\noutside the force walls. We could go far away.\"\nHe turned from her. \"It's all dead. What would be the use?\"\n\"I came from the Earth,\" she said quietly. \"And I've got to go back to\nit. Space is so cold and frightening. Steel walls and blackness and\nthe rockets and the little pinpoints of light. It's a prison.\"\n\"But to die out there in the desert, in that dust.\" Then he paused and\nlooked away from her. \"We're crazy\u2014talking as though we had a\nchoice.\"\n\"Maybe they'll have to\ngive\nus a choice.\"\n\"What're you talking about?\"\n\"They went into hysterics at the sight of those bodies in the picture.\nThose young bodies that didn't die of old age.\"\nHe waited.\n\"They can't stand the sight of people dying violently.\"\nHer hand went to her throat and touched the tiny locket.\n\"These lockets were given to us so we'd have a choice between\nsuffering or quick painless death.... We still have a choice.\"\nHe touched the locket at his own throat and was very still for a long\nmoment. \"So we threaten to kill ourselves, before their eyes. What\nwould it do to them?\"\nHe was still for a long time. \"Sometimes, Mary, I think I don't know\nyou at all.\" A pause. \"And so now you and I are back where we started.\nWhich'll it be, space or Earth?\"\n\"Michael.\" Her voice trembled. \"I\u2014I don't know how to say this.\"\nHe waited, frowning, watching her intently.\n\"I'm\u2014going to have a child.\"\nHis face went blank.\nThen he stepped forward and took her by the shoulders. He saw the\nsoftness there in her face; saw her eyes bright as though the sun were\nshining in them; saw a flush in her cheeks, as though she had been\nrunning. And suddenly his throat was full.\n\"No,\" he said thickly. \"I can't believe it.\"\n\"It's true.\"\nHe held her for a long time, then he turned his eyes aside.\n\"Yes, I can see it is.\"\n\"I\u2014I can't put into words why I let it happen, Michael.\"\nHe shook his head. \"I don't know\u2014what to\u2014to say. It's so\nincredible.\"\n\"Maybe\u2014I got so\u2014tired\u2014just seeing the two of us over and over again\nand the culturing of the scar tissue, for twenty centuries. Maybe that\nwas it. It was just\u2014something I felt I\nhad\nto do. Some\u2014\nreal\nlife\nagain. Something new. I felt a need to produce something out of\nmyself. It all started way out in space, while we were getting close\nto the solar system. I began to wonder if we'd ever get out of the\nship alive or if we'd ever see a sunset again or a dawn or the night\nor morning like we'd seen on Earth\u2014so\u2014so long ago. And then I\nhad\nto let it happen. It was a vague and strange thing. There was\nsomething forcing me. But at the same time I wanted it, too. I seemed\nto be willing it, seemed to be feeling it was a necessary thing.\" She\npaused, frowning. \"I didn't stop to think\u2014it would be like this.\"\n\"Such a thing,\" he said, smiling grimly, \"hasn't happened on Earth for\nthree thousand years. I can remember in school, reading in the history\nbooks, how the whole Earth was overcrowded and how the food and water\nhad to be rationed and then how the laws were passed forbidding birth\nand after that how the people died and there weren't any more babies\nborn, until at last there was plenty of what the Earth had to give,\nfor everyone. And then the news was broken to everyone about the\nculturing of the scar tissue, and there were a few dissenters but they\nwere soon conditioned out of their dissension and the population was\nstabilized.\" He paused. \"After all this past history, I don't think\nthe council could endure what you've done.\"\n\"No,\" she said quietly. \"I don't think they could.\"\n\"And so this will be just for\nus\n.\" He took her in his arms. \"If I\nremember rightly, this is a traditional action.\" A pause. \"Now I'll go\nwith you out onto the Earth\u2014if we can swing it. When we get outside\nthe city, or if we do\u2014Well, we'll see.\"\nThey were very still together and then he turned and stood by the\nwindow and looked down upon the city and she came and stood beside\nhim.\nThey both saw it at the same time. And they watched, without speaking,\nboth knowing what was in the other's mind and heart. They watched the\ngiant four dimensional screens all through the city. A green, lush\nplanet showed bright and clear on them and there were ships standing\namong the trees and men walking through the grass, that moved gently\nlike the swells on a calm ocean, while into their minds came the\nthoughts projected from the screen:\n\"This will be your new home. It was found and then lost. But another\nexpedition will be sent out to find it again. Be of good hope.\nEverything will be all right.\"\nMichael turned from the window. \"So there's our evidence. Two thousand\nyears. All the others killed getting it. And with a simple twist, it\nbecomes a lie.\"\nMary sat down and buried her face in her hands.\n\"What a terrible failure there's been here,\" said Michael. \"The\nneglect and destruction of a whole planet. It's like a family letting\ntheir home decay all around them, and living in smaller and smaller\nrooms of it, until at last the rooms are all gone, and since they\ncan't find another home, they all die in the ruins of the last room.\"\n\"I can't face dying,\" Mary said quietly, \"squeezed in with all these\npeople, in this tomb they've made around the seas. I want to have the\nopen sky and the quiet away from those awful pounding pumps when I\ndie. I want the spread of the Earth all around and the clean air. I\nwant to be a real part of the Earth again.\"\nMichael barely nodded in agreement. He was standing very still now.\nAnd then there was the sound of the door opening.\nThey both rose, like mourners at a funeral, and went into the council\nchambers.\nAgain they sat in the thick chairs before the wall of desks with the\nfaces of the council looking across it like defenders.\nThe pumps were beating, beating all through the room and the quiet.\nThe President was standing. He faced Michael and Mary, and seemed to\nset himself as though to deliver a blow, or to receive one.\n\"Michael and Mary,\" he said, his voice struggling against a tightness,\n\"we've considered a long time concerning what is to be done with you\nand the report you brought back to us from the galaxy.\" He took\nanother swallow of water. \"To protect the sanity of the people, we've\nchanged your report. We've also decided that the people must be\nprotected from the possibility of your spreading the truth, as you did\nat the landing field. So, for the good of the people, you'll be\nisolated. All comforts will be given you. After all, in a sense, you\nare\nheroes and martyrs. Your scar tissue will be cultured as it has\nbeen in the past, and you will stay in solitary confinement until the\ntime when, perhaps, we can migrate to another planet. We feel that\nhope must not be destroyed. And so another expedition is being sent\nout. It may be that, in time, on another planet, you'll be able to\ntake your place in our society.\"\nHe paused. \"Is there anything you wish to say?\"\n\"Yes, there is.\"\n\"Proceed.\"\nMichael stared straight at the President. After a long moment, he\nraised his hand to the tiny locket at his throat.\n\"Perhaps you remember,\" he said, \"the lockets given to every member of\nthe expedition the night before we left. I still have mine.\" He raised\nit. \"So does my wife. They were designed to kill the wearer instantly\nand painlessly if he were ever faced with pain or a terror he couldn't\nendure.\"\nThe President was standing again. A stir ran along the barricade of\ndesks.\n\"We can't endure the city,\" went on Michael, \"or its life and the ways\nof the people.\" He glanced along the line of staring faces.\n\"If what I think you're about to say is true,\" said the President in a\nshaking voice, \"it would have been better if you'd never been born.\"\n\"Let's face facts, Mr. President. We were\nborn\nand haven't\ndied\u2014yet.\" A pause. \"And we can kill ourselves right here before your\neyes. It'd be painless to us. We'd be unconscious. But there would be\nhorrible convulsions and grimaces. Our bodies would be twisted and\ntorn. They'd thresh about. The deaths you saw in the picture happened\na long time ago, in outer space. You all went into hysterics at the\nsight of them. Our deaths now would be close and terrible to see.\"\nThe President staggered as though about to faint. There was a stirring\nand muttering and a jumping up along the desks. Voices cried out, in\nanger and fear. Arms waved and fists pounded. Hands clasped and\nunclasped and clawed at collars, and there was a pell mell rushing\naround the President. They yelled at each other and clasped each other\nby the shoulders, turned away and back again, and then suddenly became\nvery still.\nNow they began to step down from the raised line of desks, the\nPresident leading them, and came close to the man and woman, gathering\naround them in a wide half circle.\nMichael and Mary were holding the lockets close to their throats. The\nhalf circle of people, with the President at its center was moving\ncloser and closer. They were sweaty faces and red ones and dry white\nones and hands were raised to seize them.\nMichael put his arm around Mary's waist. He felt the trembling in her\nbody and the waiting for death.\n\"Stop!\" he said quietly.\nThey halted, in slight confusion, barely drawing back.\n\"If you want to see us die\u2014just come a step closer.... And remember\nwhat'll happen to you.\"\nThe faces began turning to each other and there was an undertone of\nmuttering and whispering. \"A ghastly thing.... Instant.... Nothing to\ndo.... Space's broken their minds.... They'll do it.... Eyes're\nmad.... What can we do?... What?...\" The sweaty faces, the cold white\nones, the flushed hot ones: all began to turn to the President, who\nwas staring at the two before him like a man watching himself die in a\nmirror.\n\"I command you,\" he suddenly said, in a choked voice, \"to\u2014to give me\nthose\u2014lockets! It's your\u2014duty!\"\n\"We've only one duty, Mr. President,\" said Michael sharply. \"To\nourselves.\"\n\"You're sick. Give yourselves over to us. We'll help you.\"\n\"We've made our choice. We want an answer. Quickly! Now!\"\nThe President's body sagged. \"What\u2014what is it you want?\"\nMichael threw the words. \"To go beyond the force fields of the city.\nTo go far out onto the Earth and live as long as we can, and then to\ndie a natural death.\"\nThe half circle of faces turned to each other and muttered and\nwhispered again. \"In the name of God.... Let them go.... Contaminate\nus.... Like animals.... Get them out of here....\nLet\nthem be\nfinished.... Best for us all.... And them....\"\nThere was a turning to the President again and hands thrusting him\nforward to within one step of Michael and Mary, who were standing\nthere close together, as though attached.\nHaltingly he said, \"Go. Please go. Out onto the Earth\u2014to die. You\nwill\ndie. The Earth is dead out there. You'll never see the city or\nyour people again.\"\n\"We want a ground car,\" said Michael. \"And supplies.\"\n\"A ground car,\" repeated the President. \"And\u2014supplies.... Yes.\"\n\"You can give us an escort, if you want to, out beyond the first range\nof mountains.\"\n\"There will be no escort,\" said the President firmly. \"No one has been\nallowed to go out upon the Earth or to fly above it for many hundreds\nof years. We know it's there. That's enough. We couldn't bear the\nsight of it.\" He took a step back. \"And we can't bear the sight of you\nany longer. Go now. Quickly!\"\nMichael and Mary did not let go of the lockets as they watched the\nhalf circle of faces move backward, staring, as though at corpses that\nshould sink to the floor.\nIt was night. The city had been lost beyond the dead mounds of Earth\nthat rolled away behind them, like a thousand ancient tombs. The\nground car sat still on a crumbling road.\nLooking up through the car's driving blister, they saw the stars sunk\ninto the blue black ocean of space; saw the path of the Milky Way\nalong which they had rushed, while they had been searching frantically\nfor the place of salvation.\n\"If any one of the other couples had made it back,\" said Mary, \"do you\nthink they'd be with us?\"\n\"I think they'd either be with us,\" he said, \"or out in space\nagain\u2014or in prison.\"\nShe stared ahead along the beam of headlight that stabbed out into the\nnight over the decaying road.\n\"How sorry are you,\" she said quietly, \"coming with me?\"\n\"All I know is, if I were out in space for long without you, I'd kill\nmyself.\"\n\"Are we going to die out here, Michael?\" she said, gesturing toward\nthe wall of night that stood at the end of the headlight, \"with the\nland?\"\nHe turned from her, frowning, and drove the ground car forward,\nwatching the headlights push back the darkness.\nThey followed the crumbling highway all night until light crept across\nthe bald and cracked hills. The morning sun looked down upon the\ndesolation ten feet above the horizon when the car stopped. They sat\nfor a long time then, looking out upon the Earth's parched and\ninflamed skin. In the distance a wall of mountains rose like a great\npile of bleached bones. Close ahead the rolling plains were motionless\nwaves of dead Earth with a slight breeze stirring up little swirls of\ndust.\n\"I'm getting out,\" she said.\n\"I haven't the slightest idea how much farther to go, or why,\" said\nMichael shrugging. \"It's all the same. Dirt and hills and mountains\nand sun and dust. It's really not much different from being out in\nspace. We live in the car just like in a space ship. We've enough\nconcentrated supplies to last for a year. How far do we go? Why?\nWhen?\"\nThey stepped upon the Earth and felt the warmth of the sun and\nstrolled toward the top of the hill.\n\"The air smells clean,\" he said.\n\"The ground feels good. I think I'll take off my shoes.\" She did.\n\"Take off your boots, Michael. Try it.\"\nWearily he pulled off his boots, stood in his bare feet. \"It takes me\nback.\"\n\"Yes,\" she said and began walking toward the hilltop.\nHe followed, his boots slung around his neck. \"There was a road\nsomewhere, with the dust between my toes. Or was it a dream?\"\n\"I guess when the past is old enough,\" she said, \"it becomes a dream.\"\nHe watched her footprints in the dust. \"God, listen to the quiet.\"\n\"I can't seem to remember so much quiet around me. There's always been\nthe sound of a space ship, or the pumps back in the cities.\"\nHe did not answer but continued to watch her footsteps and to feel the\ndust squishing up between his toes. Then suddenly:\n\"Mary!\"\nShe stopped, whirling around.\nHe was staring down at her feet.\nShe followed his gaze.\n\"It's grass!\" He bent down. \"Three blades.\"\nShe knelt beside him. They touched the green blades.\n\"They're new,\" he said.\nThey stared, like religious devotees concentrating upon some sacred\nobject.\nHe rose, pulling her up with him. They hurried to the top of the hill\nand stood very still, looking down into a valley. There were tiny\npatches of green and little trees sprouting, and here and there, a\npale flower. The green was in a cluster, in the center of the valley\nand there was a tiny glint of sunlight in its center.\n\"Oh!\"\nHer hand found his.\nThey ran down the gentle slope, feeling the patches of green touch\ntheir feet, smelling a new freshness in the air. And coming to the\nlittle spring, they stood beside it and watched the crystal water that\ntrickled along the valley floor and lost itself around a bend. They\nsaw a furry, little animal scurry away and heard the twitter of a bird\nand saw it resting on a slim, bending branch. They heard the buzz of a\nbee, saw it light on a pale flower at their feet and work at the\nsweetness inside.\nMary knelt down and drank from the spring.\n\"It's so cool. It must come from deep down.\"\n\"It does,\" he said. There were tears in his eyes and a tightness in\nhis throat. \"From deep down.\"\n\"We can\nlive\nhere, Michael!\"\nSlowly he looked all around until his sight stopped at the bottom of a\nhill. \"We'll build our house just beyond those rocks. We'll dig and\nplant and you'll have the child.\"\n\"Yes!\" she said. \"Oh yes!\"\n\"And the ones back in the city will know the Earth again. Sometime\nwe'll lead them back here and show them the Earth is coming alive.\" He\npaused. \"By following what we had to do for ourselves, we've found a\nway to save them.\"\nThey remained kneeling in the silence beside the pool for a long time.\nThey felt the sun on their backs and looked into the clean depth of\nthe water deeply aware of the new life breathing all around them and\nof themselves absorbing it, and at the same time giving back to it the\nlife that was their own.\nThere was only this quiet and breathing and warmth until Michael stood\nand picked up a rock and walked toward the base of the hill where he\nhad decided to build the house.\n... THE END\n", "summary": "The, who are on a mission to find a planet that can be habitable for humanity. The ship has crashed on a desert planet, and the only habitable planet is Earth, which is two thousand years away.

The aliens are sending the ship back to Earth because they have no hope of finding another planet.   The man and the woman are worried about the people on Earth, and their children are also worried about what will happen to them if they return to earth. The president of Earth, Davis, is on the radio, asking the man and wife to come in, and he is concerned that the people will be angry at them for returning to Earth and not staying on Earth.    The men are able to find the planet, which they are told is uninhabitable. The President of Earth is on a conference call with the other officials, and one of the officials is upset that the ship crashed on Earth and that the men are not coming back to help them. The other official is upset because the men were on the planet for two thousand thousand years, and it was their fault that the ships crashed on it.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}

You might find it just on the other side\nof the fence\u2014where the grass is always greener.\nThe Ship dove into Earth's sea of atmosphere like a great, silver\nfish.\nInside the ship, a man and woman stood looking down at the expanse of\nland that curved away to a growing horizon. They saw the yellow ground\ncracked like a dried skin; and the polished stone of the mountains and\nthe seas that were shrunken away in the dust. And they saw how the\ncity circled the sea, as a circle of men surround a water hole in a\ndesert under a blazing sun.\nThe ship's radio cried out. \"You've made it! Thank God! You've made\nit!\"\nAnother voice, shaking, said, \"President\u2014Davis is\u2014overwhelmed. He\ncan't go on. On his behalf and on behalf of all the people\u2014with our\nhope that was almost dead, we greet you.\" A pause. \"Please come in!\"\nThe voice was silent. The air screamed against the hull of the ship.\n\"I can't tell them,\" said the man.\n\"Please come in!\" said the radio. \"Do you hear me?\"\nThe woman looked up at the man. \"You've got to Michael!\"\n\"Two thousand years. From one end of the galaxy to the other. Not one\ngrain of dust we can live on. Just Earth. And it's burned to a\ncinder.\"\nA note of hysteria stabbed into the radio voice. \"Are you all right?\nStand by! We're sending a rescue ship.\"\n\"They've got a right to know what we've found,\" said the woman. \"They\nsent us out. They've waited so long\u2014.\"\nHe stared into space. \"It's hopeless. If we'd found another planet\nthey could live on, they'd do the same as they've done here.\"\nHe touched the tiny golden locket that hung around his neck. \"Right\nnow, I could press this and scratch myself and the whole farce would\nbe over.\"\n\"No. A thousand of us died. You've got to think of them.\"\n\"We'll go back out into space,\" he said. \"It's clean out there. I'm\ntired. Two thousand years of reincarnation.\"\nShe spoke softly. \"We've been together for a long time. I've loved\nyou. I've asked very little. But I need to stay on Earth. Please,\nMichael.\"\nHe looked at her for a moment. Then he flipped a switch. \"Milky Way to\nEarth. Never mind the rescue ship. We're all right. We're coming in.\"\nThe great, white ship settled to Earth that was like a plain after\nflood waters have drained away.\nThe man and woman came out into the blazing sunlight.\nA shout, like the crashing of a thousand surfs, rose and broke over\nthem. The man and woman descended the gang-plank toward the officials\ngathered on the platform. They glanced around at the massed field of\nwhite faces beneath them; saw those same faces that had been turned\ntoward them two thousand years past; remembered the cheers and the\ncries that had crashed around them then, as they and the thousand had\nstood before the towering spires of the ships, before the takeoff.\nAnd, as then, there were no children among the milling, grasping\nthrong. Only the same clutching hands and voices and arms, asking for\nan answer, a salvation, a happy end.\nNow the officials gathered around the man and the woman, and spoke to\nthem in voices of reverence.\nA microphone was thrust into Michael's hand with the whispered\nadmonition to tell the people of the great new life waiting for them,\nopen and green and moist, on a virgin planet.\nThe cries of the people were slipping away and a stillness growing\nlike an ocean calm and, within it, the sound of the pumps, throbbing,\nsucking the water from the seas.\nAnd then Michael's voice, \"The thousand who left with us are dead. For\nsome time we've known the other planets in our solar system were\nuninhabitable. Now we've been from one end of the galaxy to the other.\nAnd this is what we've found.... We were given Earth. There's no place\nelse for us. The rest of the planets in the galaxy were given to\nothers. There's no place else for them. We've all had a chance to make\nthe best of Earth. Instead we've made the worst of it. So we're here\nto stay\u2014and die.\" He handed the microphone back.\nThe silence did not change.\nThe President grasped Michael's arm. \"What're you saying?\"\nA buzzing rose up from the people like that of a swarm of frightened\nbees. The sea of white faces swayed and their voices began to cry. The\ndin and motion held, long and drawn out, with a wail now and a\nfluttering beneath it.\nMichael and the woman stood above them in the center of the pale,\nhovering faces of the officials.\n\"Good God,\" said the President. \"You've got to tell them what you said\nisn't true!\"\n\"We've been searching two thousand years for a truth,\" said Michael.\n\"A thousand of us have died finding it. I've told it. That's the way\nit's got to be.\"\nThe President swayed, took the microphone in his hands.\n\"There's been some mistake!\" he cried. \"Go back to the pumps and the\ndistilleries! Go back to the water vats and the gardens and the\nflocks! Go back! Work and wait! We'll get the full truth to you.\nEverything's going to be\nall right\n!\"\nObediently the mass of faces separated, as though they were being spun\naway on a whirling disk. Michael and the woman were swallowed up, like\npebbles inside a closing hand, and carried away from the great, white\nship.\nThey ushered the man and woman into the beamed and paneled council\nchambers and sat them in thick chairs before the wall of polished wood\ndesks across which stared the line of faces, silent and waiting. And\non a far wall, facing them all, hung a silver screen, fifty feet\nsquare.\nThe President stood. \"Members of the council.\" He paused. \"As you\nheard, they report\u2014complete failure.\" He turned to Michael. \"And now,\nthe proof.\"\nMichael stood beside the motion picture projector, close to his chair.\nThe lights dimmed. There was only the sound of the pumps throbbing in\nthe darkness close and far away, above and beneath and all around.\nSuddenly on the screen appeared an endless depth of blackness filled\nwith a mass of glowing white, which extended into the room around the\nwatching people, seeming to touch them and then spreading, like an\nocean, farther away and out and out into an endless distance.\nNow streaks of yellow fire shot into the picture, like a swarm of\nlightning bugs, the thin sharp nosed shadows of space ships, hurtling,\nlike comets, toward the clustered star smear. And then silent thoughts\nflashed from the screen into the minds of the spectators; of time\npassing in months, years and centuries, passing and passing until they\nthemselves seemed to be rushing and rushing into the blackness toward\nblinding balls of white light, the size of moons.\nThe dark shapes of smaller spheres circling the blinding ones moved\nforward into the picture; red, blue, green, yellow, purple and many\nmixtures of all these, and then one planet filled the screen, seeming\nto be inflated, like a balloon, into a shining red ball. There was a\nrazor edge of horizon then and pink sky and an expanse of crimson.\nFlat, yellow creatures lay all around, expanding and contracting. A\nroaring rose and fell like the roaring of a million winds. Then fear\nflowed out of the picture into the minds of the watchers so that they\ngasped and cringed, and a silent voice told them that the atmosphere\nof this planet would disintegrate a human being.\nNow the red ball seemed to pull away from them into the blackness and\nthe blinding balls of light, and all around could be seen the streaks\nof rocket flame shooting away in all directions.\nSuddenly a flash cut the blackness, like the flare of a match, and\ndied, and the watchers caught from the screen the awareness of the\ndeath of a ship.\nThey were also aware of the rushing of time through centuries and they\nsaw the streaking rocket flames and planets rushing at them; saw\ncreatures in squares and circles, in threads wriggling, in lumps and\nblobs, rolling jumping and crawling; saw them in cloud forms whisking\nabout, changing their shapes, and in flowing wavelets of water. They\nsaw creatures hopping about on one leg and others crawling at\nincredible speeds on a thousand; saw some with all the numbers of legs\nand arms in between; and were aware of creatures that were there but\ninvisible.\nAnd those watching the screen on which time and distance were a\ncompressed and distilled kaleidoscope, saw planet after planet and\nthousands at a time; heard strange noises; rasping and roaring, clinks\nand whistles, screams and crying, sighing and moaning. And they were\naware through all this of atmosphere and ground inimical to man, some\nthat would evaporate at the touch of a human body, or would burst into\nflame, or swallow, or turn from liquid to solid or solid to liquid.\nThey saw and heard chemical analyses, were aware of this ocean of\nblackness and clouds of white through which man might move, and must\never move, because he could live only upon this floating dust speck\nthat was Earth.\nThe picture faded in, close to one of the long, needle nosed crafts,\nshowing inside, a man and a woman. Time was telescoped again while the\nman cut a tiny piece of scar tissue from his arm and that of the\nwoman, put them in bottles and set them into compartments where\nsolutions dripped rhythmically into the bottles, the temperature was\nheld at that of the human body, and synthetic sunlight focused upon\nthem from many pencil like tubes.\nThe watchers in the council chamber saw the bits of tissue swell into\nhuman embryos in a few seconds, and grow arms and legs and faces and\nextend themselves into babies. Saw them taken from the bottles and\ncared for, and become replicas of the man and woman controlling the\nship, who, all this time were aging, until life went out of their\nbodies. Then the ones who had been the scar tissue disintegrated them\nin the coffin-like tubes and let their dust be sucked out into\nspace\u2014all this through millions of miles and a hundred years,\ncompressed for the watchers into sixty seconds and a few feet of\nspace.\nInstantly there was black space on the screen again, with the fingers\nof flame pointing out behind the dark bodies of the ships.\nAnd then the spectators saw one ship shudder and swerve into a\nblazing, bluish white star, like a gnat flying into a white hot poker;\nsaw another drop away and away, out and out into the blackness past\nthe swirling white rim of the galaxy, and sink into a dark\nnothingness.\nGreat balls of rock showered like hail onto other ships, smashing them\ninto grotesque tin cans. The stream of fire at the tail of another\nship suddenly died and the ship floated into an orbit around a great,\nyellow planet, ten times the size of Jupiter, then was sucked into it.\nAnother burst like a bomb, flinging a man and woman out into the\ndarkness, where they hung suspended, frozen into statues, like bodies\ndrowned in the depths of an Arctic sea.\nAt this instant from the watching council, there were screams of\nhorror and voices crying out, \"Shut it off! Shut it off!\" There was a\nmoving about in the darkness. Murmurs and harsh cries of disapproval\ngrew in volume.\nAnother ship in the picture was split down the side by a meteor and\nthe bodies inside were impaled on jagged blades of steel, the\ncontorted, bloody faces lighted by bursts of flame. And the screams\nand cries of the spectators rose higher, \"Shut it off.... Oh Lord....\"\nLights flashed through the room and the picture died.\nMichael and Mary, both staring, saw, along the line of desks, the\nagonized faces, some staring like white stones, others hidden in\nclutching fingers, as though they had been confronted by a Medusa.\nThere was the sound of heavy breathing that mixed with the throbbing\nof the pumps. The President held tightly to the edges of his desk to\nquiet his trembling.\n\"There\u2014there've been changes,\" he said, \"since you've been out in\nspace. There isn't a person on Earth who's seen a violent death for\nhundreds of years.\"\nMichael faced him, frowning. \"I don't follow you.\"\n\"Dying violently happened so seldom on Earth that, after a long time,\nthe sight of it began to drive some people mad. And then one day a man\nwas struck by one of the ground cars and\neveryone\nwho saw it went\ninsane. Since then we've eliminated accidents, even the idea. Now, no\none is aware that death by violence is even a possibility.\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Michael, \"we've been so close to violent death for\nso long.... What you've seen is part of the proof you asked for.\"\n\"What you showed us was a picture,\" said the President. \"If it had\nbeen real, we'd all be insane by now. If it were shown to the people\nthere'd be mass hysteria.\"\n\"But even if we'd found another habitable planet, getting to it would\ninvolve just what we've shown you. Maybe only a tenth of the people\nwho left Earth, or a hundredth, would ever reach a destination out in\nspace.\"\n\"We couldn't tolerate such a possibility,\" said the President\ngravely. \"We'd have to find a way around it.\"\nThe pumps throbbed like giant hearts all through the stillness in the\ncouncil chambers. The faces along the line of desks were smoothing\nout; the terror in them was fading away.\n\"And yet the Earth is almost dead,\" said Michael quietly, \"and you\ncan't bring it back to life.\"\n\"The sins of our past, Mr. Nelson,\" said the President. \"The Atomic\nwars five thousand years ago. And the greed. It was too late a long\ntime ago. That, of course, is why the expedition was sent out. And now\nyou've come back to us with this terrible news.\" He looked around,\nslowly, then back to Michael. \"Can you give us any hope at all?\"\n\"None.\"\n\"Another expedition? To Andromeda perhaps? With you the leader?\"\nMichael shook his head. \"We're finished with expeditions, Mr.\nPresident.\"\nThere were mutterings in the council, and hastily whispered\nconsultations. Now they were watching the man and woman again.\n\"We feel,\" said the President, \"it would be dangerous to allow you to\ngo out among the people. They've been informed that your statement\nwasn't entirely true. This was necessary, to avoid a panic. The people\nsimply must not know the whole truth.\" He paused. \"Now we ask you to\nkeep in mind that whatever we decide about the two of you will be for\nthe good of the people.\"\nMichael and Mary were silent.\n\"You'll wait outside the council chambers,\" the President went on,\n\"until we have reached our decision.\"\nAs the man and woman were led away, the pumps beat in the stillness,\nand at the edge of the shrinking seas the salt thick waters were being\npulled into the distilleries, and from them into the tier upon tier of\nartificial gardens that sat like giant bee hives all around the\nshoreline; and the mounds of salt glistening in the sunlight behind\nthe gardens were growing into mountains.\nIn their rooms, Michael and Mary were talking through the hours, and\nwaiting. All around them were fragile, form-fitting chairs and\ntranslucent walls and a ceiling that, holding the light of the sun\nwhen they had first seen it, was now filled with moonlight.\nStanding at a circular window, ten feet in diameter, Michael saw, far\nbelow, the lights of the city extending into the darkness along the\nshoreline of the sea.\n\"We should have delivered our message by radio,\" he said, \"and gone\nback into space.\"\n\"You could probably still go,\" she said quietly.\nHe came and stood beside her. \"I couldn't stand being out in space, or\nanywhere, without you.\"\nShe looked up at him. \"We could go out into the wilderness, Michael,\noutside the force walls. We could go far away.\"\nHe turned from her. \"It's all dead. What would be the use?\"\n\"I came from the Earth,\" she said quietly. \"And I've got to go back to\nit. Space is so cold and frightening. Steel walls and blackness and\nthe rockets and the little pinpoints of light. It's a prison.\"\n\"But to die out there in the desert, in that dust.\" Then he paused and\nlooked away from her. \"We're crazy\u2014talking as though we had a\nchoice.\"\n\"Maybe they'll have to\ngive\nus a choice.\"\n\"What're you talking about?\"\n\"They went into hysterics at the sight of those bodies in the picture.\nThose young bodies that didn't die of old age.\"\nHe waited.\n\"They can't stand the sight of people dying violently.\"\nHer hand went to her throat and touched the tiny locket.\n\"These lockets were given to us so we'd have a choice between\nsuffering or quick painless death.... We still have a choice.\"\nHe touched the locket at his own throat and was very still for a long\nmoment. \"So we threaten to kill ourselves, before their eyes. What\nwould it do to them?\"\nHe was still for a long time. \"Sometimes, Mary, I think I don't know\nyou at all.\" A pause. \"And so now you and I are back where we started.\nWhich'll it be, space or Earth?\"\n\"Michael.\" Her voice trembled. \"I\u2014I don't know how to say this.\"\nHe waited, frowning, watching her intently.\n\"I'm\u2014going to have a child.\"\nHis face went blank.\nThen he stepped forward and took her by the shoulders. He saw the\nsoftness there in her face; saw her eyes bright as though the sun were\nshining in them; saw a flush in her cheeks, as though she had been\nrunning. And suddenly his throat was full.\n\"No,\" he said thickly. \"I can't believe it.\"\n\"It's true.\"\nHe held her for a long time, then he turned his eyes aside.\n\"Yes, I can see it is.\"\n\"I\u2014I can't put into words why I let it happen, Michael.\"\nHe shook his head. \"I don't know\u2014what to\u2014to say. It's so\nincredible.\"\n\"Maybe\u2014I got so\u2014tired\u2014just seeing the two of us over and over again\nand the culturing of the scar tissue, for twenty centuries. Maybe that\nwas it. It was just\u2014something I felt I\nhad\nto do. Some\u2014\nreal\nlife\nagain. Something new. I felt a need to produce something out of\nmyself. It all started way out in space, while we were getting close\nto the solar system. I began to wonder if we'd ever get out of the\nship alive or if we'd ever see a sunset again or a dawn or the night\nor morning like we'd seen on Earth\u2014so\u2014so long ago. And then I\nhad\nto let it happen. It was a vague and strange thing. There was\nsomething forcing me. But at the same time I wanted it, too. I seemed\nto be willing it, seemed to be feeling it was a necessary thing.\" She\npaused, frowning. \"I didn't stop to think\u2014it would be like this.\"\n\"Such a thing,\" he said, smiling grimly, \"hasn't happened on Earth for\nthree thousand years. I can remember in school, reading in the history\nbooks, how the whole Earth was overcrowded and how the food and water\nhad to be rationed and then how the laws were passed forbidding birth\nand after that how the people died and there weren't any more babies\nborn, until at last there was plenty of what the Earth had to give,\nfor everyone. And then the news was broken to everyone about the\nculturing of the scar tissue, and there were a few dissenters but they\nwere soon conditioned out of their dissension and the population was\nstabilized.\" He paused. \"After all this past history, I don't think\nthe council could endure what you've done.\"\n\"No,\" she said quietly. \"I don't think they could.\"\n\"And so this will be just for\nus\n.\" He took her in his arms. \"If I\nremember rightly, this is a traditional action.\" A pause. \"Now I'll go\nwith you out onto the Earth\u2014if we can swing it. When we get outside\nthe city, or if we do\u2014Well, we'll see.\"\nThey were very still together and then he turned and stood by the\nwindow and looked down upon the city and she came and stood beside\nhim.\nThey both saw it at the same time. And they watched, without speaking,\nboth knowing what was in the other's mind and heart. They watched the\ngiant four dimensional screens all through the city. A green, lush\nplanet showed bright and clear on them and there were ships standing\namong the trees and men walking through the grass, that moved gently\nlike the swells on a calm ocean, while into their minds came the\nthoughts projected from the screen:\n\"This will be your new home. It was found and then lost. But another\nexpedition will be sent out to find it again. Be of good hope.\nEverything will be all right.\"\nMichael turned from the window. \"So there's our evidence. Two thousand\nyears. All the others killed getting it. And with a simple twist, it\nbecomes a lie.\"\nMary sat down and buried her face in her hands.\n\"What a terrible failure there's been here,\" said Michael. \"The\nneglect and destruction of a whole planet. It's like a family letting\ntheir home decay all around them, and living in smaller and smaller\nrooms of it, until at last the rooms are all gone, and since they\ncan't find another home, they all die in the ruins of the last room.\"\n\"I can't face dying,\" Mary said quietly, \"squeezed in with all these\npeople, in this tomb they've made around the seas. I want to have the\nopen sky and the quiet away from those awful pounding pumps when I\ndie. I want the spread of the Earth all around and the clean air. I\nwant to be a real part of the Earth again.\"\nMichael barely nodded in agreement. He was standing very still now.\nAnd then there was the sound of the door opening.\nThey both rose, like mourners at a funeral, and went into the council\nchambers.\nAgain they sat in the thick chairs before the wall of desks with the\nfaces of the council looking across it like defenders.\nThe pumps were beating, beating all through the room and the quiet.\nThe President was standing. He faced Michael and Mary, and seemed to\nset himself as though to deliver a blow, or to receive one.\n\"Michael and Mary,\" he said, his voice struggling against a tightness,\n\"we've considered a long time concerning what is to be done with you\nand the report you brought back to us from the galaxy.\" He took\nanother swallow of water. \"To protect the sanity of the people, we've\nchanged your report. We've also decided that the people must be\nprotected from the possibility of your spreading the truth, as you did\nat the landing field. So, for the good of the people, you'll be\nisolated. All comforts will be given you. After all, in a sense, you\nare\nheroes and martyrs. Your scar tissue will be cultured as it has\nbeen in the past, and you will stay in solitary confinement until the\ntime when, perhaps, we can migrate to another planet. We feel that\nhope must not be destroyed. And so another expedition is being sent\nout. It may be that, in time, on another planet, you'll be able to\ntake your place in our society.\"\nHe paused. \"Is there anything you wish to say?\"\n\"Yes, there is.\"\n\"Proceed.\"\nMichael stared straight at the President. After a long moment, he\nraised his hand to the tiny locket at his throat.\n\"Perhaps you remember,\" he said, \"the lockets given to every member of\nthe expedition the night before we left. I still have mine.\" He raised\nit. \"So does my wife. They were designed to kill the wearer instantly\nand painlessly if he were ever faced with pain or a terror he couldn't\nendure.\"\nThe President was standing again. A stir ran along the barricade of\ndesks.\n\"We can't endure the city,\" went on Michael, \"or its life and the ways\nof the people.\" He glanced along the line of staring faces.\n\"If what I think you're about to say is true,\" said the President in a\nshaking voice, \"it would have been better if you'd never been born.\"\n\"Let's face facts, Mr. President. We were\nborn\nand haven't\ndied\u2014yet.\" A pause. \"And we can kill ourselves right here before your\neyes. It'd be painless to us. We'd be unconscious. But there would be\nhorrible convulsions and grimaces. Our bodies would be twisted and\ntorn. They'd thresh about. The deaths you saw in the picture happened\na long time ago, in outer space. You all went into hysterics at the\nsight of them. Our deaths now would be close and terrible to see.\"\nThe President staggered as though about to faint. There was a stirring\nand muttering and a jumping up along the desks. Voices cried out, in\nanger and fear. Arms waved and fists pounded. Hands clasped and\nunclasped and clawed at collars, and there was a pell mell rushing\naround the President. They yelled at each other and clasped each other\nby the shoulders, turned away and back again, and then suddenly became\nvery still.\nNow they began to step down from the raised line of desks, the\nPresident leading them, and came close to the man and woman, gathering\naround them in a wide half circle.\nMichael and Mary were holding the lockets close to their throats. The\nhalf circle of people, with the President at its center was moving\ncloser and closer. They were sweaty faces and red ones and dry white\nones and hands were raised to seize them.\nMichael put his arm around Mary's waist. He felt the trembling in her\nbody and the waiting for death.\n\"Stop!\" he said quietly.\nThey halted, in slight confusion, barely drawing back.\n\"If you want to see us die\u2014just come a step closer.... And remember\nwhat'll happen to you.\"\nThe faces began turning to each other and there was an undertone of\nmuttering and whispering. \"A ghastly thing.... Instant.... Nothing to\ndo.... Space's broken their minds.... They'll do it.... Eyes're\nmad.... What can we do?... What?...\" The sweaty faces, the cold white\nones, the flushed hot ones: all began to turn to the President, who\nwas staring at the two before him like a man watching himself die in a\nmirror.\n\"I command you,\" he suddenly said, in a choked voice, \"to\u2014to give me\nthose\u2014lockets! It's your\u2014duty!\"\n\"We've only one duty, Mr. President,\" said Michael sharply. \"To\nourselves.\"\n\"You're sick. Give yourselves over to us. We'll help you.\"\n\"We've made our choice. We want an answer. Quickly! Now!\"\nThe President's body sagged. \"What\u2014what is it you want?\"\nMichael threw the words. \"To go beyond the force fields of the city.\nTo go far out onto the Earth and live as long as we can, and then to\ndie a natural death.\"\nThe half circle of faces turned to each other and muttered and\nwhispered again. \"In the name of God.... Let them go.... Contaminate\nus.... Like animals.... Get them out of here....\nLet\nthem be\nfinished.... Best for us all.... And them....\"\nThere was a turning to the President again and hands thrusting him\nforward to within one step of Michael and Mary, who were standing\nthere close together, as though attached.\nHaltingly he said, \"Go. Please go. Out onto the Earth\u2014to die. You\nwill\ndie. The Earth is dead out there. You'll never see the city or\nyour people again.\"\n\"We want a ground car,\" said Michael. \"And supplies.\"\n\"A ground car,\" repeated the President. \"And\u2014supplies.... Yes.\"\n\"You can give us an escort, if you want to, out beyond the first range\nof mountains.\"\n\"There will be no escort,\" said the President firmly. \"No one has been\nallowed to go out upon the Earth or to fly above it for many hundreds\nof years. We know it's there. That's enough. We couldn't bear the\nsight of it.\" He took a step back. \"And we can't bear the sight of you\nany longer. Go now. Quickly!\"\nMichael and Mary did not let go of the lockets as they watched the\nhalf circle of faces move backward, staring, as though at corpses that\nshould sink to the floor.\nIt was night. The city had been lost beyond the dead mounds of Earth\nthat rolled away behind them, like a thousand ancient tombs. The\nground car sat still on a crumbling road.\nLooking up through the car's driving blister, they saw the stars sunk\ninto the blue black ocean of space; saw the path of the Milky Way\nalong which they had rushed, while they had been searching frantically\nfor the place of salvation.\n\"If any one of the other couples had made it back,\" said Mary, \"do you\nthink they'd be with us?\"\n\"I think they'd either be with us,\" he said, \"or out in space\nagain\u2014or in prison.\"\nShe stared ahead along the beam of headlight that stabbed out into the\nnight over the decaying road.\n\"How sorry are you,\" she said quietly, \"coming with me?\"\n\"All I know is, if I were out in space for long without you, I'd kill\nmyself.\"\n\"Are we going to die out here, Michael?\" she said, gesturing toward\nthe wall of night that stood at the end of the headlight, \"with the\nland?\"\nHe turned from her, frowning, and drove the ground car forward,\nwatching the headlights push back the darkness.\nThey followed the crumbling highway all night until light crept across\nthe bald and cracked hills. The morning sun looked down upon the\ndesolation ten feet above the horizon when the car stopped. They sat\nfor a long time then, looking out upon the Earth's parched and\ninflamed skin. In the distance a wall of mountains rose like a great\npile of bleached bones. Close ahead the rolling plains were motionless\nwaves of dead Earth with a slight breeze stirring up little swirls of\ndust.\n\"I'm getting out,\" she said.\n\"I haven't the slightest idea how much farther to go, or why,\" said\nMichael shrugging. \"It's all the same. Dirt and hills and mountains\nand sun and dust. It's really not much different from being out in\nspace. We live in the car just like in a space ship. We've enough\nconcentrated supplies to last for a year. How far do we go? Why?\nWhen?\"\nThey stepped upon the Earth and felt the warmth of the sun and\nstrolled toward the top of the hill.\n\"The air smells clean,\" he said.\n\"The ground feels good. I think I'll take off my shoes.\" She did.\n\"Take off your boots, Michael. Try it.\"\nWearily he pulled off his boots, stood in his bare feet. \"It takes me\nback.\"\n\"Yes,\" she said and began walking toward the hilltop.\nHe followed, his boots slung around his neck. \"There was a road\nsomewhere, with the dust between my toes. Or was it a dream?\"\n\"I guess when the past is old enough,\" she said, \"it becomes a dream.\"\nHe watched her footprints in the dust. \"God, listen to the quiet.\"\n\"I can't seem to remember so much quiet around me. There's always been\nthe sound of a space ship, or the pumps back in the cities.\"\nHe did not answer but continued to watch her footsteps and to feel the\ndust squishing up between his toes. Then suddenly:\n\"Mary!\"\nShe stopped, whirling around.\nHe was staring down at her feet.\nShe followed his gaze.\n\"It's grass!\" He bent down. \"Three blades.\"\nShe knelt beside him. They touched the green blades.\n\"They're new,\" he said.\nThey stared, like religious devotees concentrating upon some sacred\nobject.\nHe rose, pulling her up with him. They hurried to the top of the hill\nand stood very still, looking down into a valley. There were tiny\npatches of green and little trees sprouting, and here and there, a\npale flower. The green was in a cluster, in the center of the valley\nand there was a tiny glint of sunlight in its center.\n\"Oh!\"\nHer hand found his.\nThey ran down the gentle slope, feeling the patches of green touch\ntheir feet, smelling a new freshness in the air. And coming to the\nlittle spring, they stood beside it and watched the crystal water that\ntrickled along the valley floor and lost itself around a bend. They\nsaw a furry, little animal scurry away and heard the twitter of a bird\nand saw it resting on a slim, bending branch. They heard the buzz of a\nbee, saw it light on a pale flower at their feet and work at the\nsweetness inside.\nMary knelt down and drank from the spring.\n\"It's so cool. It must come from deep down.\"\n\"It does,\" he said. There were tears in his eyes and a tightness in\nhis throat. \"From deep down.\"\n\"We can\nlive\nhere, Michael!\"\nSlowly he looked all around until his sight stopped at the bottom of a\nhill. \"We'll build our house just beyond those rocks. We'll dig and\nplant and you'll have the child.\"\n\"Yes!\" she said. \"Oh yes!\"\n\"And the ones back in the city will know the Earth again. Sometime\nwe'll lead them back here and show them the Earth is coming alive.\" He\npaused. \"By following what we had to do for ourselves, we've found a\nway to save them.\"\nThey remained kneeling in the silence beside the pool for a long time.\nThey felt the sun on their backs and looked into the clean depth of\nthe water deeply aware of the new life breathing all around them and\nof themselves absorbing it, and at the same time giving back to it the\nlife that was their own.\nThere was only this quiet and breathing and warmth until Michael stood\nand picked up a rock and walked toward the base of the hill where he\nhad decided to build the house.\n...

You might find it just on the other side\nof the fence\u2014where the grass is always greener.\nThe Ship dove into Earth's sea of atmosphere like a great, silver\nfish.\nInside the ship, a man and woman stood looking down at the expanse of\nland that curved away to a growing horizon. They saw the yellow ground\ncracked like a dried skin; and the polished stone of the mountains and\nthe seas that were shrunken away in the dust. And they saw how the\ncity circled the sea, as a circle of men surround a water hole in a\ndesert under a blazing sun.\nThe ship's radio cried out. \"You've made it! Thank God! You've made\nit!\"\nAnother voice, shaking, said, \"President\u2014Davis is\u2014overwhelmed. He\ncan't go on. On his behalf and on behalf of all the people\u2014with our\nhope that was almost dead, we greet you.\" A pause. \"Please come in!\"\nThe voice was silent. The air screamed against the hull of the ship.\n\"I can't tell them,\" said the man.\n\"Please come in!\" said the radio. \"Do you hear me?\"\nThe woman looked up at the man. \"You've got to Michael!\"\n\"Two thousand years. From one end of the galaxy to the other. Not one\ngrain of dust we can live on. Just Earth. And it's burned to a\ncinder.\"\nA note of hysteria stabbed into the radio voice. \"Are you all right?\nStand by! We're sending a rescue ship.\"\n\"They've got a right to know what we've found,\" said the woman. \"They\nsent us out. They've waited so long\u2014.\"\nHe stared into space. \"It's hopeless. If we'd found another planet\nthey could live on, they'd do the same as they've done here.\"\nHe touched the tiny golden locket that hung around his neck. \"Right\nnow, I could press this and scratch myself and the whole farce would\nbe over.\"\n\"No. A thousand of us died. You've got to think of them.\"\n\"We'll go back out into space,\" he said. \"It's clean out there. I'm\ntired. Two thousand years of reincarnation.\"\nShe spoke softly. \"We've been together for a long time. I've loved\nyou. I've asked very little. But I need to stay on Earth. Please,\nMichael.\"\nHe looked at her for a moment. Then he flipped a switch. \"Milky Way to\nEarth. Never mind the rescue ship. We're all right. We're coming in.\"\nThe great, white ship settled to Earth that was like a plain after\nflood waters have drained away.\nThe man and woman came out into the blazing sunlight.\nA shout, like the crashing of a thousand surfs, rose and broke over\nthem. The man and woman descended the gang-plank toward the officials\ngathered on the platform. They glanced around at the massed field of\nwhite faces beneath them; saw those same faces that had been turned\ntoward them two thousand years past; remembered the cheers and the\ncries that had crashed around them then, as they and the thousand had\nstood before the towering spires of the ships, before the takeoff.\nAnd, as then, there were no children among the milling, grasping\nthrong. Only the same clutching hands and voices and arms, asking for\nan answer, a salvation, a happy end.\nNow the officials gathered around the man and the woman, and spoke to\nthem in voices of reverence.\nA microphone was thrust into Michael's hand with the whispered\nadmonition to tell the people of the great new life waiting for them,\nopen and green and moist, on a virgin planet.\nThe cries of the people were slipping away and a stillness growing\nlike an ocean calm and, within it, the sound of the pumps, throbbing,\nsucking the water from the seas.\nAnd then Michael's voice, \"The thousand who left with us are dead. For\nsome time we've known the other planets in our solar system were\nuninhabitable. Now we've been from one end of the galaxy to the other.\nAnd this is what we've found.... We were given Earth. There's no place\nelse for us. The rest of the planets in the galaxy were given to\nothers. There's no place else for them. We've all had a chance to make\nthe best of Earth. Instead we've made the worst of it. So we're here\nto stay\u2014and die.\" He handed the microphone back.\nThe silence did not change.\nThe President grasped Michael's arm. \"What're you saying?\"\nA buzzing rose up from the people like that of a swarm of frightened\nbees. The sea of white faces swayed and their voices began to cry. The\ndin and motion held, long and drawn out, with a wail now and a\nfluttering beneath it.\nMichael and the woman stood above them in the center of the pale,\nhovering faces of the officials.\n\"Good God,\" said the President. \"You've got to tell them what you said\nisn't true!\"\n\"We've been searching two thousand years for a truth,\" said Michael.\n\"A thousand of us have died finding it. I've told it. That's the way\nit's got to be.\"\nThe President swayed, took the microphone in his hands.\n\"There's been some mistake!\" he cried. \"Go back to the pumps and the\ndistilleries! Go back to the water vats and the gardens and the\nflocks! Go back! Work and wait! We'll get the full truth to you.\nEverything's going to be\nall right\n!\"\nObediently the mass of faces separated, as though they were being spun\naway on a whirling disk. Michael and the woman were swallowed up, like\npebbles inside a closing hand, and carried away from the great, white\nship.\nThey ushered the man and woman into the beamed and paneled council\nchambers and sat them in thick chairs before the wall of polished wood\ndesks across which stared the line of faces, silent and waiting. And\non a far wall, facing them all, hung a silver screen, fifty feet\nsquare.\nThe President stood. \"Members of the council.\" He paused. \"As you\nheard, they report\u2014complete failure.\" He turned to Michael. \"And now,\nthe proof.\"\nMichael stood beside the motion picture projector, close to his chair.\nThe lights dimmed. There was only the sound of the pumps throbbing in\nthe darkness close and far away, above and beneath and all around.\nSuddenly on the screen appeared an endless depth of blackness filled\nwith a mass of glowing white, which extended into the room around the\nwatching people, seeming to touch them and then spreading, like an\nocean, farther away and out and out into an endless distance.\nNow streaks of yellow fire shot into the picture, like a swarm of\nlightning bugs, the thin sharp nosed shadows of space ships, hurtling,\nlike comets, toward the clustered star smear. And then silent thoughts\nflashed from the screen into the minds of the spectators; of time\npassing in months, years and centuries, passing and passing until they\nthemselves seemed to be rushing and rushing into the blackness toward\nblinding balls of white light, the size of moons.\nThe dark shapes of smaller spheres circling the blinding ones moved\nforward into the picture; red, blue, green, yellow, purple and many\nmixtures of all these, and then one planet filled the screen, seeming\nto be inflated, like a balloon, into a shining red ball. There was a\nrazor edge of horizon then and pink sky and an expanse of crimson.\nFlat, yellow creatures lay all around, expanding and contracting. A\nroaring rose and fell like the roaring of a million winds. Then fear\nflowed out of the picture into the minds of the watchers so that they\ngasped and cringed, and a silent voice told them that the atmosphere\nof this planet would disintegrate a human being.\nNow the red ball seemed to pull away from them into the blackness and\nthe blinding balls of light, and all around could be seen the streaks\nof rocket flame shooting away in all directions.\nSuddenly a flash cut the blackness, like the flare of a match, and\ndied, and the watchers caught from the screen the awareness of the\ndeath of a ship.\nThey were also aware of the rushing of time through centuries and they\nsaw the streaking rocket flames and planets rushing at them; saw\ncreatures in squares and circles, in threads wriggling, in lumps and\nblobs, rolling jumping and crawling; saw them in cloud forms whisking\nabout, changing their shapes, and in flowing wavelets of water. They\nsaw creatures hopping about on one leg and others crawling at\nincredible speeds on a thousand; saw some with all the numbers of legs\nand arms in between; and were aware of creatures that were there but\ninvisible.\nAnd those watching the screen on which time and distance were a\ncompressed and distilled kaleidoscope, saw planet after planet and\nthousands at a time; heard strange noises; rasping and roaring, clinks\nand whistles, screams and crying, sighing and moaning. And they were\naware through all this of atmosphere and ground inimical to man, some\nthat would evaporate at the touch of a human body, or would burst into\nflame, or swallow, or turn from liquid to solid or solid to liquid.\nThey saw and heard chemical analyses, were aware of this ocean of\nblackness and clouds of white through which man might move, and must\never move, because he could live only upon this floating dust speck\nthat was Earth.\nThe picture faded in, close to one of the long, needle nosed crafts,\nshowing inside, a man and a woman. Time was telescoped again while the\nman cut a tiny piece of scar tissue from his arm and that of the\nwoman, put them in bottles and set them into compartments where\nsolutions dripped rhythmically into the bottles, the temperature was\nheld at that of the human body, and synthetic sunlight focused upon\nthem from many pencil like tubes.\nThe watchers in the council chamber saw the bits of tissue swell into\nhuman embryos in a few seconds, and grow arms and legs and faces and\nextend themselves into babies. Saw them taken from the bottles and\ncared for, and become replicas of the man and woman controlling the\nship, who, all this time were aging, until life went out of their\nbodies. Then the ones who had been the scar tissue disintegrated them\nin the coffin-like tubes and let their dust be sucked out into\nspace\u2014all this through millions of miles and a hundred years,\ncompressed for the watchers into sixty seconds and a few feet of\nspace.\nInstantly there was black space on the screen again, with the fingers\nof flame pointing out behind the dark bodies of the ships.\nAnd then the spectators saw one ship shudder and swerve into a\nblazing, bluish white star, like a gnat flying into a white hot poker;\nsaw another drop away and away, out and out into the blackness past\nthe swirling white rim of the galaxy, and sink into a dark\nnothingness.\nGreat balls of rock showered like hail onto other ships, smashing them\ninto grotesque tin cans. The stream of fire at the tail of another\nship suddenly died and the ship floated into an orbit around a great,\nyellow planet, ten times the size of Jupiter, then was sucked into it.\nAnother burst like a bomb, flinging a man and woman out into the\ndarkness, where they hung suspended, frozen into statues, like bodies\ndrowned in the depths of an Arctic sea.\nAt this instant from the watching council, there were screams of\nhorror and voices crying out, \"Shut it off! Shut it off!\" There was a\nmoving about in the darkness. Murmurs and harsh cries of disapproval\ngrew in volume.\nAnother ship in the picture was split down the side by a meteor and\nthe bodies inside were impaled on jagged blades of steel, the\ncontorted, bloody faces lighted by bursts of flame. And the screams\nand cries of the spectators rose higher, \"Shut it off.... Oh Lord....\"\nLights flashed through the room and the picture died.\nMichael and Mary, both staring, saw, along the line of desks, the\nagonized faces, some staring like white stones, others hidden in\nclutching fingers, as though they had been confronted by a Medusa.\nThere was the sound of heavy breathing that mixed with the throbbing\nof the pumps. The President held tightly to the edges of his desk to\nquiet his trembling.\n\"There\u2014there've been changes,\" he said, \"since you've been out in\nspace. There isn't a person on Earth who's seen a violent death for\nhundreds of years.\"\nMichael faced him, frowning. \"I don't follow you.\"\n\"Dying violently happened so seldom on Earth that, after a long time,\nthe sight of it began to drive some people mad. And then one day a man\nwas struck by one of the ground cars and\neveryone\nwho saw it went\ninsane. Since then we've eliminated accidents, even the idea. Now, no\none is aware that death by violence is even a possibility.\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Michael, \"we've been so close to violent death for\nso long.... What you've seen is part of the proof you asked for.\"\n\"What you showed us was a picture,\" said the President. \"If it had\nbeen real, we'd all be insane by now. If it were shown to the people\nthere'd be mass hysteria.\"\n\"But even if we'd found another habitable planet, getting to it would\ninvolve just what we've shown you. Maybe only a tenth of the people\nwho left Earth, or a hundredth, would ever reach a destination out in\nspace.\"\n\"We couldn't tolerate such a possibility,\" said the President\ngravely. \"We'd have to find a way around it.\"\nThe pumps throbbed like giant hearts all through the stillness in the\ncouncil chambers. The faces along the line of desks were smoothing\nout; the terror in them was fading away.\n\"And yet the Earth is almost dead,\" said Michael quietly, \"and you\ncan't bring it back to life.\"\n\"The sins of our past, Mr. Nelson,\" said the President. \"The Atomic\nwars five thousand years ago. And the greed. It was too late a long\ntime ago. That, of course, is why the expedition was sent out. And now\nyou've come back to us with this terrible news.\" He looked around,\nslowly, then back to Michael. \"Can you give us any hope at all?\"\n\"None.\"\n\"Another expedition? To Andromeda perhaps? With you the leader?\"\nMichael shook his head. \"We're finished with expeditions, Mr.\nPresident.\"\nThere were mutterings in the council, and hastily whispered\nconsultations. Now they were watching the man and woman again.\n\"We feel,\" said the President, \"it would be dangerous to allow you to\ngo out among the people. They've been informed that your statement\nwasn't entirely true. This was necessary, to avoid a panic. The people\nsimply must not know the whole truth.\" He paused. \"Now we ask you to\nkeep in mind that whatever we decide about the two of you will be for\nthe good of the people.\"\nMichael and Mary were silent.\n\"You'll wait outside the council chambers,\" the President went on,\n\"until we have reached our decision.\"\nAs the man and woman were led away, the pumps beat in the stillness,\nand at the edge of the shrinking seas the salt thick waters were being\npulled into the distilleries, and from them into the tier upon tier of\nartificial gardens that sat like giant bee hives all around the\nshoreline; and the mounds of salt glistening in the sunlight behind\nthe gardens were growing into mountains.\nIn their rooms, Michael and Mary were talking through the hours, and\nwaiting. All around them were fragile, form-fitting chairs and\ntranslucent walls and a ceiling that, holding the light of the sun\nwhen they had first seen it, was now filled with moonlight.\nStanding at a circular window, ten feet in diameter, Michael saw, far\nbelow, the lights of the city extending into the darkness along the\nshoreline of the sea.\n\"We should have delivered our message by radio,\" he said, \"and gone\nback into space.\"\n\"You could probably still go,\" she said quietly.\nHe came and stood beside her. \"I couldn't stand being out in space, or\nanywhere, without you.\"\nShe looked up at him. \"We could go out into the wilderness, Michael,\noutside the force walls. We could go far away.\"\nHe turned from her. \"It's all dead. What would be the use?\"\n\"I came from the Earth,\" she said quietly. \"And I've got to go back to\nit. Space is so cold and frightening. Steel walls and blackness and\nthe rockets and the little pinpoints of light. It's a prison.\"\n\"But to die out there in the desert, in that dust.\" Then he paused and\nlooked away from her. \"We're crazy\u2014talking as though we had a\nchoice.\"\n\"Maybe they'll have to\ngive\nus a choice.\"\n\"What're you talking about?\"\n\"They went into hysterics at the sight of those bodies in the picture.\nThose young bodies that didn't die of old age.\"\nHe waited.\n\"They can't stand the sight of people dying violently.\"\nHer hand went to her throat and touched the tiny locket.\n\"These lockets were given to us so we'd have a choice between\nsuffering or quick painless death.... We still have a choice.\"\nHe touched the locket at his own throat and was very still for a long\nmoment. \"So we threaten to kill ourselves, before their eyes. What\nwould it do to them?\"\nHe was still for a long time. \"Sometimes, Mary, I think I don't know\nyou at all.\" A pause. \"And so now you and I are back where we started.\nWhich'll it be, space or Earth?\"\n\"Michael.\" Her voice trembled. \"I\u2014I don't know how to say this.\"\nHe waited, frowning, watching her intently.\n\"I'm\u2014going to have a child.\"\nHis face went blank.\nThen he stepped forward and took her by the shoulders. He saw the\nsoftness there in her face; saw her eyes bright as though the sun were\nshining in them; saw a flush in her cheeks, as though she had been\nrunning. And suddenly his throat was full.\n\"No,\" he said thickly. \"I can't believe it.\"\n\"It's true.\"\nHe held her for a long time, then he turned his eyes aside.\n\"Yes, I can see it is.\"\n\"I\u2014I can't put into words why I let it happen, Michael.\"\nHe shook his head. \"I don't know\u2014what to\u2014to say. It's so\nincredible.\"\n\"Maybe\u2014I got so\u2014tired\u2014just seeing the two of us over and over again\nand the culturing of the scar tissue, for twenty centuries. Maybe that\nwas it. It was just\u2014something I felt I\nhad\nto do. Some\u2014\nreal\nlife\nagain. Something new. I felt a need to produce something out of\nmyself. It all started way out in space, while we were getting close\nto the solar system. I began to wonder if we'd ever get out of the\nship alive or if we'd ever see a sunset again or a dawn or the night\nor morning like we'd seen on Earth\u2014so\u2014so long ago. And then I\nhad\nto let it happen. It was a vague and strange thing. There was\nsomething forcing me. But at the same time I wanted it, too. I seemed\nto be willing it, seemed to be feeling it was a necessary thing.\" She\npaused, frowning. \"I didn't stop to think\u2014it would be like this.\"\n\"Such a thing,\" he said, smiling grimly, \"hasn't happened on Earth for\nthree thousand years. I can remember in school, reading in the history\nbooks, how the whole Earth was overcrowded and how the food and water\nhad to be rationed and then how the laws were passed forbidding birth\nand after that how the people died and there weren't any more babies\nborn, until at last there was plenty of what the Earth had to give,\nfor everyone. And then the news was broken to everyone about the\nculturing of the scar tissue, and there were a few dissenters but they\nwere soon conditioned out of their dissension and the population was\nstabilized.\" He paused. \"After all this past history, I don't think\nthe council could endure what you've done.\"\n\"No,\" she said quietly. \"I don't think they could.\"\n\"And so this will be just for\nus\n.\" He took her in his arms. \"If I\nremember rightly, this is a traditional action.\" A pause. \"Now I'll go\nwith you out onto the Earth\u2014if we can swing it. When we get outside\nthe city, or if we do\u2014Well, we'll see.\"\nThey were very still together and then he turned and stood by the\nwindow and looked down upon the city and she came and stood beside\nhim.\nThey both saw it at the same time. And they watched, without speaking,\nboth knowing what was in the other's mind and heart. They watched the\ngiant four dimensional screens all through the city. A green, lush\nplanet showed bright and clear on them and there were ships standing\namong the trees and men walking through the grass, that moved gently\nlike the swells on a calm ocean, while into their minds came the\nthoughts projected from the screen:\n\"This will be your new home. It was found and then lost. But another\nexpedition will be sent out to find it again. Be of good hope.\nEverything will be all right.\"\nMichael turned from the window. \"So there's our evidence. Two thousand\nyears. All the others killed getting it. And with a simple twist, it\nbecomes a lie.\"\nMary sat down and buried her face in her hands.\n\"What a terrible failure there's been here,\" said Michael. \"The\nneglect and destruction of a whole planet. It's like a family letting\ntheir home decay all around them, and living in smaller and smaller\nrooms of it, until at last the rooms are all gone, and since they\ncan't find another home, they all die in the ruins of the last room.\"\n\"I can't face dying,\" Mary said quietly, \"squeezed in with all these\npeople, in this tomb they've made around the seas. I want to have the\nopen sky and the quiet away from those awful pounding pumps when I\ndie. I want the spread of the Earth all around and the clean air. I\nwant to be a real part of the Earth again.\"\nMichael barely nodded in agreement. He was standing very still now.\nAnd then there was the sound of the door opening.\nThey both rose, like mourners at a funeral, and went into the council\nchambers.\nAgain they sat in the thick chairs before the wall of desks with the\nfaces of the council looking across it like defenders.\nThe pumps were beating, beating all through the room and the quiet.\nThe President was standing. He faced Michael and Mary, and seemed to\nset himself as though to deliver a blow, or to receive one.\n\"Michael and Mary,\" he said, his voice struggling against a tightness,\n\"we've considered a long time concerning what is to be done with you\nand the report you brought back to us from the galaxy.\" He took\nanother swallow of water. \"To protect the sanity of the people, we've\nchanged your report. We've also decided that the people must be\nprotected from the possibility of your spreading the truth, as you did\nat the landing field. So, for the good of the people, you'll be\nisolated. All comforts will be given you. After all, in a sense, you\nare\nheroes and martyrs. Your scar tissue will be cultured as it has\nbeen in the past, and you will stay in solitary confinement until the\ntime when, perhaps, we can migrate to another planet. We feel that\nhope must not be destroyed. And so another expedition is being sent\nout. It may be that, in time, on another planet, you'll be able to\ntake your place in our society.\"\nHe paused. \"Is there anything you wish to say?\"\n\"Yes, there is.\"\n\"Proceed.\"\nMichael stared straight at the President. After a long moment, he\nraised his hand to the tiny locket at his throat.\n\"Perhaps you remember,\" he said, \"the lockets given to every member of\nthe expedition the night before we left. I still have mine.\" He raised\nit. \"So does my wife. They were designed to kill the wearer instantly\nand painlessly if he were ever faced with pain or a terror he couldn't\nendure.\"\nThe President was standing again. A stir ran along the barricade of\ndesks.\n\"We can't endure the city,\" went on Michael, \"or its life and the ways\nof the people.\" He glanced along the line of staring faces.\n\"If what I think you're about to say is true,\" said the President in a\nshaking voice, \"it would have been better if you'd never been born.\"\n\"Let's face facts, Mr. President. We were\nborn\nand haven't\ndied\u2014yet.\" A pause. \"And we can kill ourselves right here before your\neyes. It'd be painless to us. We'd be unconscious. But there would be\nhorrible convulsions and grimaces. Our bodies would be twisted and\ntorn. They'd thresh about. The deaths you saw in the picture happened\na long time ago, in outer space. You all went into hysterics at the\nsight of them. Our deaths now would be close and terrible to see.\"\nThe President staggered as though about to faint. There was a stirring\nand muttering and a jumping up along the desks. Voices cried out, in\nanger and fear. Arms waved and fists pounded. Hands clasped and\nunclasped and clawed at collars, and there was a pell mell rushing\naround the President. They yelled at each other and clasped each other\nby the shoulders, turned away and back again, and then suddenly became\nvery still.\nNow they began to step down from the raised line of desks, the\nPresident leading them, and came close to the man and woman, gathering\naround them in a wide half circle.\nMichael and Mary were holding the lockets close to their throats. The\nhalf circle of people, with the President at its center was moving\ncloser and closer. They were sweaty faces and red ones and dry white\nones and hands were raised to seize them.\nMichael put his arm around Mary's waist. He felt the trembling in her\nbody and the waiting for death.\n\"Stop!\" he said quietly.\nThey halted, in slight confusion, barely drawing back.\n\"If you want to see us die\u2014just come a step closer.... And remember\nwhat'll happen to you.\"\nThe faces began turning to each other and there was an undertone of\nmuttering and whispering. \"A ghastly thing.... Instant.... Nothing to\ndo.... Space's broken their minds.... They'll do it.... Eyes're\nmad.... What can we do?... What?...\" The sweaty faces, the cold white\nones, the flushed hot ones: all began to turn to the President, who\nwas staring at the two before him like a man watching himself die in a\nmirror.\n\"I command you,\" he suddenly said, in a choked voice, \"to\u2014to give me\nthose\u2014lockets! It's your\u2014duty!\"\n\"We've only one duty, Mr. President,\" said Michael sharply. \"To\nourselves.\"\n\"You're sick. Give yourselves over to us. We'll help you.\"\n\"We've made our choice. We want an answer. Quickly! Now!\"\nThe President's body sagged. \"What\u2014what is it you want?\"\nMichael threw the words. \"To go beyond the force fields of the city.\nTo go far out onto the Earth and live as long as we can, and then to\ndie a natural death.\"\nThe half circle of faces turned to each other and muttered and\nwhispered again. \"In the name of God.... Let them go.... Contaminate\nus.... Like animals.... Get them out of here....\nLet\nthem be\nfinished.... Best for us all.... And them....\"\nThere was a turning to the President again and hands thrusting him\nforward to within one step of Michael and Mary, who were standing\nthere close together, as though attached.\nHaltingly he said, \"Go. Please go. Out onto the Earth\u2014to die. You\nwill\ndie. The Earth is dead out there. You'll never see the city or\nyour people again.\"\n\"We want a ground car,\" said Michael. \"And supplies.\"\n\"A ground car,\" repeated the President. \"And\u2014supplies.... Yes.\"\n\"You can give us an escort, if you want to, out beyond the first range\nof mountains.\"\n\"There will be no escort,\" said the President firmly. \"No one has been\nallowed to go out upon the Earth or to fly above it for many hundreds\nof years. We know it's there. That's enough. We couldn't bear the\nsight of it.\" He took a step back. \"And we can't bear the sight of you\nany longer. Go now. Quickly!\"\nMichael and Mary did not let go of the lockets as they watched the\nhalf circle of faces move backward, staring, as though at corpses that\nshould sink to the floor.\nIt was night. The city had been lost beyond the dead mounds of Earth\nthat rolled away behind them, like a thousand ancient tombs. The\nground car sat still on a crumbling road.\nLooking up through the car's driving blister, they saw the stars sunk\ninto the blue black ocean of space; saw the path of the Milky Way\nalong which they had rushed, while they had been searching frantically\nfor the place of salvation.\n\"If any one of the other couples had made it back,\" said Mary, \"do you\nthink they'd be with us?\"\n\"I think they'd either be with us,\" he said, \"or out in space\nagain\u2014or in prison.\"\nShe stared ahead along the beam of headlight that stabbed out into the\nnight over the decaying road.\n\"How sorry are you,\" she said quietly, \"coming with me?\"\n\"All I know is, if I were out in space for long without you, I'd kill\nmyself.\"\n\"Are we going to die out here, Michael?\" she said, gesturing toward\nthe wall of night that stood at the end of the headlight, \"with the\nland?\"\nHe turned from her, frowning, and drove the ground car forward,\nwatching the headlights push back the darkness.\nThey followed the crumbling highway all night until light crept across\nthe bald and cracked hills. The morning sun looked down upon the\ndesolation ten feet above the horizon when the car stopped. They sat\nfor a long time then, looking out upon the Earth's parched and\ninflamed skin. In the distance a wall of mountains rose like a great\npile of bleached bones. Close ahead the rolling plains were motionless\nwaves of dead Earth with a slight breeze stirring up little swirls of\ndust.\n\"I'm getting out,\" she said.\n\"I haven't the slightest idea how much farther to go, or why,\" said\nMichael shrugging. \"It's all the same. Dirt and hills and mountains\nand sun and dust. It's really not much different from being out in\nspace. We live in the car just like in a space ship. We've enough\nconcentrated supplies to last for a year. How far do we go? Why?\nWhen?\"\nThey stepped upon the Earth and felt the warmth of the sun and\nstrolled toward the top of the hill.\n\"The air smells clean,\" he said.\n\"The ground feels good. I think I'll take off my shoes.\" She did.\n\"Take off your boots, Michael. Try it.\"\nWearily he pulled off his boots, stood in his bare feet. \"It takes me\nback.\"\n\"Yes,\" she said and began walking toward the hilltop.\nHe followed, his boots slung around his neck. \"There was a road\nsomewhere, with the dust between my toes. Or was it a dream?\"\n\"I guess when the past is old enough,\" she said, \"it becomes a dream.\"\nHe watched her footprints in the dust. \"God, listen to the quiet.\"\n\"I can't seem to remember so much quiet around me. There's always been\nthe sound of a space ship, or the pumps back in the cities.\"\nHe did not answer but continued to watch her footsteps and to feel the\ndust squishing up between his toes. Then suddenly:\n\"Mary!\"\nShe stopped, whirling around.\nHe was staring down at her feet.\nShe followed his gaze.\n\"It's grass!\" He bent down. \"Three blades.\"\nShe knelt beside him. They touched the green blades.\n\"They're new,\" he said.\nThey stared, like religious devotees concentrating upon some sacred\nobject.\nHe rose, pulling her up with him. They hurried to the top of the hill\nand stood very still, looking down into a valley. There were tiny\npatches of green and little trees sprouting, and here and there, a\npale flower. The green was in a cluster, in the center of the valley\nand there was a tiny glint of sunlight in its center.\n\"Oh!\"\nHer hand found his.\nThey ran down the gentle slope, feeling the patches of green touch\ntheir feet, smelling a new freshness in the air. And coming to the\nlittle spring, they stood beside it and watched the crystal water that\ntrickled along the valley floor and lost itself around a bend. They\nsaw a furry, little animal scurry away and heard the twitter of a bird\nand saw it resting on a slim, bending branch. They heard the buzz of a\nbee, saw it light on a pale flower at their feet and work at the\nsweetness inside.\nMary knelt down and drank from the spring.\n\"It's so cool. It must come from deep down.\"\n\"It does,\" he said. There were tears in his eyes and a tightness in\nhis throat. \"From deep down.\"\n\"We can\nlive\nhere, Michael!\"\nSlowly he looked all around until his sight stopped at the bottom of a\nhill. \"We'll build our house just beyond those rocks. We'll dig and\nplant and you'll have the child.\"\n\"Yes!\" she said. \"Oh yes!\"\n\"And the ones back in the city will know the Earth again. Sometime\nwe'll lead them back here and show them the Earth is coming alive.\" He\npaused. \"By following what we had to do for ourselves, we've found a\nway to save them.\"\nThey remained kneeling in the silence beside the pool for a long time.\nThey felt the sun on their backs and looked into the clean depth of\nthe water deeply aware of the new life breathing all around them and\nof themselves absorbing it, and at the same time giving back to it the\nlife that was their own.\nThere was only this quiet and breathing and warmth until Michael stood\nand picked up a rock and walked toward the base of the hill where he\nhad decided to build the house.\n... THE END\n", "summary": "The story begins with two humans, Michael and Mary, on a ship in the Milky Way galaxy searching for a planet to live on. They have been looking for a habitable planet for three thousand years, and have been unable to find one. They are worried that Earth is almost completely destroyed due to overpopulation and lack of resources, but they are optimistic that they will be able to find a place that is suitable for them to live. When they land on Earth, they are greeted by a large, human-looking city with a fountain and a fountain with bubbles of water. They go to investigate the city, but there is no sign of any life, only a tower with a dome and a tower. The two go to the council chamber, where they watch a video feed of a human embryo that is being raised in a laboratory. The embryos grow into human embryos that are then sent back to Earth to be raised by the council. The council is horrified at the images of the embryos, and the council decides to send the embryos back to space to raise them on Earth.   When they return to the ship, they find that they have been attacked by meteorites. The ship is hit by a meteorite, and they are unable to save the ship. They run out of oxygen, and are forced to abandon their ship and run for their lives on the surface of Earth. They find a path to the surface, but it is impassable due to the thin air. They get into a car, and drive through the desert, where the sun is shining down on them. They reach a water hole in a desert, and see a water tower, where a group of men gather. The men gather around the water hole, and there is an explosion that kills one man and injures the other. They realize that the men are dead, and their bodies are frozen in the desert. They return to their ship, and take off for the surface. The story ends with the two of them in their spaceship, which is floating in the sea of atmosphere.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, null, 0]}

He was\nsmart\u2014but incredibly foolish. And, as a natural consequence, tended to\nask questions too profound for any philosopher\u2014questions like \"Who are\nyou?\"\nBy RANDALL GARRETT\nI'd been in Ravenhurst's office on the mountain-sized planetoid called\nRaven's Rest only twice before. The third time was no better; Shalimar\nRavenhurst was one of the smartest operators in the Belt, but when it\ncame to personal relationships, he was utterly incompetent. He could\nmake anyone dislike him without trying.\nWhen I entered the office, he was\n  [3]\n  sitting behind his mahogany desk,\nhis eyes focused on the operation he was going through with a wineglass\nand a decanter. He didn't look up at me as he said:\n\"Sit down, Mr. Oak. Will you have some Madeira?\"\nI decided I might as well observe the pleasantries. There was no point\nin my getting nasty until he did. \"Thank you, Mr. Ravenhurst, I will.\"\nHe kept his eyes focused on his work: It isn't easy to pour wine on a\nplanetoid where the gee-pull is measured in fractions of a centimeter\nper second squared. It moves slowly, like ropy molasses, but you have\nto be careful not to be fooled by that. The viscosity is just as low\nas ever, and if you pour it from any great height, it will go scooting\nright out of the glass\n  [4]\n  again. The momentum it builds up is enough to\nmake it splash right out again in a slow-motion gush which gets it all\nover the place.\nBesides which, even if it didn't splash, it would take it so long to\nfall a few inches that you'd die of thirst waiting for it.\nRavenhurst had evolved a technique from long years of practice.\nHe tilted the glass and the bottle toward each other, their edges\ntouching, like you do when you're trying to pour beer without putting a\nhead on it. As soon as the wine wet the glass, the adhesive forces at\nwork would pull more wine into the wine glass. To get capillary action\non a low-gee asteroid, you don't need a capillary, by any means. The\nnegative meniscus on the wine was something to see; the first time\nyou see it, you get the eerie feeling that the glass is spinning and\nthrowing the wine up against the walls by centrifugal force.\nI took the glass he offered me (Careful! Don't slosh!) and sipped at\nit. Using squirt tubes would have been a hell of a lot easier and\nneater, but Ravenhurst liked to do things his way.\nHe put the stopper back in the decanter, picked up his own glass and\nsipped appreciatively. Not until he put it back down on the desk again\ndid he raise his eyes and look at me for the first time since I'd come\nin.\n\"Mr. Oak, you have caused me considerable trouble.\"\n\"I thought we'd hashed all that out, Mr. Ravenhurst,\" I said, keeping\nmy voice level.\n[5]\n\"So had I. But it appears that there were more ramifications to your\naction than we had at first supposed.\" His voice had the texture of\nheavy linseed oil.\nHe waited, as if he expected me to make some reply to that. When\nI didn't, he sighed slightly and went on. \"I fear that you have\ninadvertently sabotaged McGuire. You were commissioned to prevent\nsabotage, Mr. Oak, and I'm afraid that you abrogated your contract.\"\nI just continued to keep my voice calm. \"If you are trying to get back\nthe fee you gave me, we can always take it to court. I don't think\nyou'd win.\"\n\"Mr. Oak,\" he said heavily, \"I am not a fool, regardless of what your\nown impression may be. If I were trying to get back that fee, I would\nhardly offer to pay you another one.\"\nI didn't think he was a fool. You don't get into the managerial\nbusiness and climb to the top and stay there unless you have brains.\nRavenhurst was smart, all right; it was just that, when it came to\npersonal relationships, he wasn't very wise.\n\"Then stop all this yak about an abrogated contract and get to the\npoint,\" I told him.\n\"I shall. I was merely trying to point out to you that it is through\nyour own actions that I find myself in a very trying position, and that\nyour sense of honor and ethics should induce you to rectify the damage.\"\n\"My honor and ethics are in fine shape,\" I said, \"but my interpretation\nof the concepts might not be quite\n  [6]\n  the same as yours. Get to the\npoint.\"\nHe took another sip of Madeira. \"The robotocists at Viking tell\nme that, in order to prevent any further ... ah ... sabotage by\nunauthorized persons, the MGYR-7 was constructed so that, after\nactivation, the first man who addressed orders to it would thenceforth\nbe considered its ... ah ... master.\n\"As I understand it, the problem of defining the term 'human being'\nunambiguously to a robot is still unsolved. The robotocists felt that\nit would be much easier to define a single individual. That would\nprevent the issuing of conflicting orders to a robot, provided the\nsingle individual were careful in giving orders himself.\n\"Now, it appears that\nyou\n, Mr. Oak, were the first man to speak to\nMcGuire after he had been activated. Is that correct?\"\n\"Is that question purely rhetorical,\" I asked him, putting on my best\nexpression of innocent interest. \"Or are you losing your memory?\" I had\nexplained all that to him two weeks before, when I'd brought McGuire\nand the girl here, so that Ravenhurst would have a chance to cover up\nwhat had really happened.\nMy sarcasm didn't faze him in the least. \"Rhetorical. It follows that\nyou are the only man whose orders McGuire will obey.\"\n\"Your robotocists can change that,\" I said. This time, I was giving him\nmy version of \"genuine\" innocence.\n  [7]\n  A man has to be a good actor to be\na competent double agent, and I didn't want Ravenhurst to know that I\nknew a great deal more about the problem than he did.\nHe shook his head, making his jowls wobble. \"No, they cannot. They\nrealize now that there should be some way of making that change, but\nthey failed to see that it would be necessary. Only by completely\ndraining McGuire's memory banks and refilling them with new data can\nthis bias be eliminated.\"\n\"Then why don't they do that?\"\n\"There are two very good reasons,\" he said. And there was a shade of\nanger in his tone. \"In the first place, that sort of operation takes\ntime, and it costs money. If we do that, we might as well go ahead and\nmake the slight changes in structure necessary to incorporate some of\nthe improvements that the robotocists now feel are necessary. In other\nwords, they might as well go ahead and build the MGYR-8, which is\nprecisely the thing I hired you to prevent.\"\n\"It seems you have a point there, Mr. Ravenhurst.\" He'd hired me\nbecause things were shaky at Viking. If he lost too much more money on\nthe McGuire experiment, he stood a good chance of losing his position\nas manager. If that happened some of his other managerial contracts\nmight be canceled, too. Things like that can begin to snowball, and\nRavenhurst might find himself out of the managerial business entirely.\n\"But,\" I went on, \"hasn't the additional wasted time already cost you\n  [8]\n  money?\"\n\"It has. I was reluctant to call you in again\u2014understandably enough, I\nthink.\"\n\"Perfectly. It's mutual.\"\nHe ignored me. \"I even considered going through with the rebuilding\nwork, now that we have traced down the source of failure of the first\nsix models. Unfortunately, that isn't feasible, either.\" He scowled at\nme.\n\"It seems,\" he went on, \"that McGuire refuses to allow his brain to\nbe tampered with. The self-preservation 'instinct' has come to the\nfore. He has refused to let the technicians and robotocists enter his\nhull, and he has threatened to take off and leave Ceres if any further\nattempts are made to ... ah ... disrupt his thinking processes.\"\n\"I can't say that I blame him,\" I said. \"What do you want me to do? Go\nto Ceres and tell him to submit like a good boy?\"\n\"It is too late for that, Mr. Oak. Viking cannot stand any more of\nthat kind of drain on its financial resources. I have been banking on\nthe McGuire-type ships to put Viking Spacecraft ahead of every other\nspacecraft company in the System.\" He looked suddenly very grim and\nvery determined. \"Mr. Oak, I am\ncertain\nthat the robot ship is the\nanswer to the transportation problems in the Solar System. For the sake\nof every human being in the Solar System, we must get the bugs out of\nMcGuire!\"\nWhat's good for General Bull-moose is good for everybody\n, I quoted\nto myself. I'd have said it out loud,\n  [9]\n  but I was fairly certain that\nShalimar Ravenhurst was not a student of the classics.\n\"Mr. Oak, I would like you to go to Ceres and co-operate with the\nrobotocists at Viking. When the MGYR-8 is finally built, I want it to\nbe the prototype for a fast, safe, functional robot spaceship that can\nbe turned out commercially. You can be of great service, Mr. Oak.\"\n\"In other words, I've got you over a barrel.\"\n\"I don't deny it.\"\n\"You know what my fees are, Mr. Ravenhurst. That's what you'll be\ncharged. I'll expect to be paid weekly; if Viking goes broke, I don't\nwant to lose more than a week's pay. On the other hand, if the MGYR-8\nis successful, I will expect a substantial bonus.\"\n\"How much?\"\n\"Exactly half of the cost of rebuilding. Half what it would take to\nbuild a Model 8 right now, and taking a chance on there being no bugs\nin it.\"\nHe considered that, looking grimmer than ever. Then he said: \"I will\ndo it on the condition that the bonus be paid off in installments, one\neach six months for three years after the first successful commercial\nship is built by Viking.\"\n\"My lawyer will nail you down on that wording,\" I said, \"but it's a\ndeal. Is there anything else?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Then I think I'll leave for Ceres before you break a blood vessel.\"\n\"You continue to amaze me, Mr. Oak,\" he said. And the soft oiliness\n  [10]\n  of\nhis voice was the oil of vitriol. \"Your compassion for your fellowman\nis a facet of your personality that I had not seen before. I shall\nwelcome the opportunity to relax and allow my blood pressure to\nsubside.\"\nI could almost see Shalimar Ravenhurst suddenly exploding and adding\nhis own touch of color to the room.\nAnd, on that gladsome thought, I left. I let him have his small verbal\ntriumph; if he'd known that I'd have taken on the job for almost\nnothing, he'd really have blown up.\nTen minutes later, I was in my vacuum suit, walking across the glaring,\nrough-polished rectangle of metal that was the landing field of\nRaven's Rest. The sun was near the zenith in the black, diamond-dusted\nsky, and the shadow of my flitterboat stood out like an inkblot on\na bridal gown. I climbed in, started the engine, and released the\nmagnetic anchor that held the little boat to the surface of the\nnickel-iron planetoid. I lifted her gently, worked her around until I\nwas stationary in relation to the spinning planetoid, oriented myself\nagainst the stellar background, and headed toward the first blinker\nbeacon on my way to Ceres.\nFor obvious economical reasons, it it impracticable to use full-sized\nspaceships in the Belt. A flitterboat, with a single gravitoinertial\nengine and the few necessities of life\u2014air, some water, and a very\nlittle food\u2014still costs more than a Rolls-Royce\n  [11]\n  automobile does on\nEarth, but there has to be some sort of individual transportation in\nthe Belt.\nThey can't be used for any great distances because a man can't stay\nin a vac suit very long without getting uncomfortable. You have to\nhop from beacon to beacon, which means that your\naverage\nvelocity\ndoesn't amount to much, since you spend too much time accelerating\nand decelerating. But a flitterboat is enough to get around the\nneighborhood in, and that's all that's needed.\nI got the GM-187 blinker in my sights, eased the acceleration up to one\ngee, relaxed to watch the radar screen while I thought over my coming\nordeal with McGuire.\nTesting spaceships, robotic or any other kind, is strictly not my\nbusiness. The sign on the door of my office in New York says:\nDANIEL\nOAK, Confidential Expediter\n; I'm hired to help other people Get Things\nDone. Usually, if someone came to me with the problem of getting a\nspaceship test-piloted, I'd simply dig up the best test pilot in the\nbusiness, hire him for my client, and forget about everything but\ncollecting my fee. But I couldn't have refused this case if I'd wanted\nto. I'd already been assigned to it by someone a lot more important\nthan Shalimar Ravenhurst.\nEvery schoolchild who has taken a course in Government Organization and\nFunction can tell you that the Political Survey Division is a branch of\nthe System Census Bureau of the UN Government, and that its job is to\nevaluate the political activities of\n  [12]\n  various sub-governments all over\nthe System.\nAnd every one of those poor tykes would be dead wrong.\nThe Political Survey Division\ndoes\nevaluate political activity, all\nright, but it is the Secret Service of the UN Government. The vast\nmajority of\n  [13]\n  the System's citizens don't even know the Government has\na Secret Service. I happen to know only because I'm an agent of the\nPolitical Survey Division.\nThe PSD was vitally interested in the whole McGuire project. Robots of\nMcGuire's complexity had been built before; the robot that runs the\ntraffic patterns of the American Eastern Seaboard is just as capable\nas McGuire when it comes to handling a tremendous number of variables\nand making decisions on them. But that robot didn't have to be given\norders except in extreme emergencies. Keeping a few million cars moving\nand safe at the same time is actually pretty routine stuff for a robot.\nAnd a traffic robot isn't given orders verbally; it is given any orders\nthat may be necessary via teletype by a trained programming technician.\nThose orders are usually in reference to a change of routing due to\nrepair work on the highways or the like. The robot itself can take care\nof such emergencies as bad weather or even an accident caused by the\nmalfunctioning of an individual automobile.\nMcGuire was different. In the first place, he was mobile. He was in\ncommand of a spacecraft. In a sense, he\nwas\nthe spacecraft, since it\nserved him in a way that was analogous to the way a human body serves\nthe human mind. And he wasn't in charge of millions of objects with a\ntop velocity of a hundred and fifty miles an hour; he was in charge\nof a single object that moved at velocities of thousands of miles per\nsecond. Nor\n  [14]\n  did he have a set, unmoving highway as his path; his paths\nwere variable and led through the emptiness of space.\nUnforeseen emergencies can happen at any time in space, most of them\nhaving to do with the lives of passengers. A cargo ship would be\nsomewhat less susceptible to such emergencies if there were no humans\naboard; it doesn't matter much to a robot if he has no air in his hull.\nBut with passengers aboard, there may be times when it would be\nnecessary to give orders\u2014\nfast\n! And that means verbal orders, orders\nthat can be given anywhere in the ship and relayed immediately by\nmicrophone to the robot's brain. A man doesn't have time to run to a\nteletyper and type out orders when there's an emergency in space.\nThat meant that McGuire had to understand English, and, since there has\nto be feedback in communication, he had to be able to speak it as well.\nAnd that made McGuire more than somewhat difficult to deal with.\nFor more than a century, robotocists have been trying to build Asimov's\nfamous Three Laws of Robotics into a robot brain.\nFirst Law: A robot shall not, either through action or inaction, allow\nharm to come to a human being.\nSecond Law: A robot shall obey the orders of a human being, except\nwhen such orders conflict with the First Law\n.\n[15]\nThird Law: A robot shall strive to protect its own existence, except\nwhen this conflicts with the First or Second Law.\nNobody has succeeded yet, because nobody has yet succeeded in defining\nthe term \"human being\" in such a way that the logical mind of a robot\ncan encompass the concept.\nA traffic robot is useful only because the definition has been rigidly\nnarrowed down. As far as a traffic robot is concerned, \"human beings\"\nare the automobiles on its highways. Woe betide any poor sap who tries,\nillegally, to cross a robot-controlled highway on foot. The robot's\nonly concern would be with the safety of the automobiles, and if the\nonly way to avoid destruction of an automobile were to be by nudging\nthe pedestrian aside with a fender, that's what would happen.\nAnd, since its orders only come from one place, I suppose that a\ntraffic robot thinks that the guy who uses that typer is an automobile.\nWith the first six models of the McGuire ships, the robotocists\nattempted to build in the Three Laws exactly as stated. And the first\nsix went insane.\nIf one human being says \"jump left,\" and another says \"jump right,\"\nthe robot is unable to evaluate which human being has given the more\nvalid order. Feed enough confusing and conflicting data into a robot\nbrain, and it can begin behaving in ways that, in a human being, would\nbe called paranoia or schizophrenia or catatonia or what-have-you,\ndepending\n  [16]\n  on the symptoms. And an insane robot is fully as dangerous\nas an insane human being controlling the same mechanical equipment, if\nnot more so.\nSo the seventh model had been modified. The present McGuire's brain was\nimpressed with slight modifications of the First and Second Laws.\nIf it is difficult to define a human being, it is much more difficult\nto define a\nresponsible\nhuman being. One, in other words, who can\nbe relied upon to give wise and proper orders to a robot, who can be\nrelied upon not to drive the robot insane.\nThe robotocists at Viking Spacecraft had decided to take another\ntack. \"Very well,\" they'd said, \"if we can't define all the members\nof a group, we can certainly define an individual. We'll pick one\nresponsible person and build McGuire so that he will take orders only\nfrom that person.\"\nAs it turned out, I was that person. Just substitute \"Daniel Oak\"\nfor \"human being\" in the First and Second Laws, and you'll see how\nimportant I was to a certain spaceship named McGuire.\nWhen I finally caught the beam from Ceres and set my flitterboat down\non the huge landing field that had been carved from the nickel-iron\nof the asteroid with a focused sun beam, I was itchy with my own\nperspiration and groggy tired. I don't like riding in flitterboats,\nsitting on a\n  [17]\n  bucket seat, astride the drive tube, like a witch on a\nbroomstick, with nothing but a near-invisible transite hull between me\nand the stars, all cooped up in a vac suit. Unlike driving a car, you\ncan't pull a flitterboat over and take a nap; you have to wait until\nyou hit the next beacon station.\nCeres, the biggest rock in the Belt, is a lot more than just a beacon\nstation. Like Eros and a few others, it's a city in its own right. And\nexcept for the Government Reservation, Viking Spacecraft owned Ceres,\nlock, stock, and mining rights.\nPart of the reason for Viking's troubles was envy of that ownership.\nThere were other companies in the Belt that would like to get their\nhands on that plum, and there were those who were doing everything\nshort of cutting throats to get it. The PSD was afraid it might come to\nthat, too, before very long.\nCeres is fifty-eight million cubic miles of nickel-iron, but nobody\nwould cut her up for that. Nickel-iron is almost exactly as cheap as\ndirt on Earth, and, considering shipping costs, Earth soil costs a\ngreat deal more than nickel-iron in the Belt.\nBut, as an operations base, Ceres is second to none. Its surface\ngravity averages .0294 Standard Gee, as compared with Earth's .981,\nand that's enough to give a slight feeling of weight without unduly\nhampering the body with too much load. I weigh just under six pounds\non Ceres, and after I've been there a while, going back to Earth is a\nstrain that takes a\n  [18]\n  week to get used to. Kids that are brought up in\nthe Belt are forced to exercise in a room with a one-gee spin on it at\nleast an hour a day. They don't like it at first, but it keeps them\nfrom growing up with the strength of mice. And an adult with any sense\ntakes a spin now and then, too. Traveling in a flitterboat will give\nyou a one-gee pull, all right, but you don't get much exercise.\nI parked my flitterboat in the space that had been assigned to me by\nLanding Control, and went over to the nearest air-lock dome.\nAfter I'd cycled through and had shucked my vac suit, I went into the\ninner room to find Colonel Brock waiting for me.\n\"Have a good trip, Oak?\" he asked, trying to put a smile on his\nscarred, battered face.\n\"I got here alive, if that makes it a good flitterboat trip,\" I said,\nshaking his extended hand.\n\"That's the definition of a good trip,\" he told me.\n\"Then the question was superfluous. Seriously, what I need is a bath\nand some sleep.\"\n\"You'll get that, but first let's go somewhere where we can talk. Want\na drink?\"\n\"I could use one, I guess. Your treat?\"\n\"My treat,\" he said. \"Come on.\"\nI followed him out and down a ladder to a corridor that led north. By\ndefinition, any asteroid spins toward the east, and all directions\nfollow from that, regardless of which way the axis may point.\n[19]\nColonel Harrington Brock was dressed in the black-and-gold \"union\nsuit\" that was the uniform of Ravenhurst's Security Guard. My own was\na tasteful green, but some of the other people in the public corridor\nseemed to go for more flashiness; besides silver and gold, there were\nshocking pinks and violent mauves, with stripes and blazes of other\ncolors.\nA crowd wearing skin-tight cover-alls might shock the gentle people of\nMidwich-on-the-Moor, England, but they are normal dress in the Belt.\nYou can't climb into a vac suit with bulky clothing on, and, if you\ndid, you'd hate yourself within an hour, with a curse for every wrinkle\nthat chafed your skin. And, in the Belt, you never know when you might\nhave to get into a vac suit fast. In a \"safe\" area like the tunnels\ninside Ceres, there isn't much chance of losing air, but there are\nplaces where no one but a fool would ever be more than ten seconds away\nfrom his vac suit.\nI read an article by a psychologist a few months back, in which he\nclaimed that the taste for loud colors in union suits was actually\ndue to modesty. He claimed that the bright patterns drew attention to\nthe colors themselves, and away from the base the colors were laid\nover. The observer, he said, tends to see the color and pattern of the\nsuit, rather than the body it clings to so closely. Maybe he's right;\nI wouldn't know, not being a psychologist. I\nhave\nspent summers in\nnudist resorts, though, and I never noticed anyone painting themselves\nwith lavender\n  [20]\n  and chartreuse checks. On the other hand, the people who\ngo to nudist resorts are a self-screened group. So are the people who\ngo to the Belt, for that matter, but the type of screening is different.\nI'll just leave that problem in the hands of the psychologists, and go\non wearing my immodestly quiet solid-color union suits.\nBrock pushed open the inch-thick metal door beneath a sign that said\n\"O'Banion's Bar,\" and I followed him in. We sat down at a table and\nordered drinks when the waiter bustled over. A cop in uniform isn't\nsupposed to drink, but Brock figures that the head of the Security\nGuard ought to be able to get away with a breach of his own rules.\nWe had our drinks in front of us and our cigarettes lit before Brock\nopened up with his troubles.\n\"Oak,\" he said, \"I wanted to intercept you before you went to the plant\nbecause I want you to know that there may be trouble.\"\n\"Yeah? What kind?\" Sometimes it's a pain to play ignorant.\n\"Thurston's outfit is trying to oust Ravenhurst from the managership of\nViking and take over the job. Baedecker Metals &amp; Mining Corporation,\nwhich is managed by Baedecker himself, wants to force Viking out of\nbusiness so that BM&amp;M can take over Ceres for large-scale processing of\nprecious metals.\n\"Between the two of 'em, they're raising all sorts of minor hell\naround\n  [21]\n  here, and it's liable to become major hell at any time. And we\ncan't stand any hell\u2014or sabotage\u2014around this planetoid just now!\"\n\"Now wait a minute,\" I said, still playing ignorant, \"I thought we'd\npretty well established that the 'sabotage' of the McGuire series was\nJack Ravenhurst's fault. She was the one who was driving them nuts, not\nThurston's agents.\"\n\"Perfectly true,\" he said agreeably. \"We managed to block any attempts\nof sabotage by other company agents, even though it looked as though we\nhadn't for a while.\" He chuckled wryly. \"We went all out to keep the\nMcGuires safe, and all the time the boss' daughter was giving them the\nworks.\" Then he looked sharply at me. \"I covered that, of course. No\none in the Security Guard but me knows that Jack was responsible.\"\n\"Good. But what about the Thurston and Baedecker agents, then?\"\nHe took a hefty slug of his drink. \"They're around, all right. We have\nour eyes on the ones we know, but those outfits are as sharp as we\nare, and they may have a few agents here on Ceres that we know nothing\nabout.\"\n\"So? What does this have to do with me?\"\nHe put his drink on the table. \"Oak, I want you to help me.\" His\nonyx-brown eyes, only a shade darker than his skin, looked directly\ninto my own. \"I know it isn't part of your assignment, and you know I\ncan't afford to pay you anything near what you're worth. It will have\nto come out of my\n  [22]\n  pocket because I couldn't possibly justify it from\noperating funds. Ravenhurst specifically told me that he doesn't want\nyou messing around with the espionage and sabotage problem because he\ndoesn't like your methods of operation.\"\n\"And you're going to go against his orders?\"\n\"I am. Ravenhurst is sore at you personally because you showed him\nthat Jack was responsible for the McGuire sabotage. It's an irrational\ndislike, and I am not going to let it interfere with my job. I'm going\nto protect Ravenhurst's interests to the best of my ability, and that\nmeans that I'll use the best of other people's abilities if I can.\"\nI grinned at him. \"The last I heard, you were sore at me for blatting\nit all over Ceres that Jaqueline Ravenhurst was missing, when she\nsneaked aboard McGuire.\"\nHe nodded perfunctorily. \"I was. I still think you should have told me\nwhat you were up to. But you did it, and you got results that I'd been\nunable to get. I'm not going to let a momentary pique hang on as an\nirrational dislike. I like to think I have more sense than that.\"\n\"Thanks.\" There wasn't much else I could say.\n\"Now, I've got a little dough put away; it's not much, but I could\noffer you\u2014\"\nI shook my head, cutting him off. \"Nope. Sorry, Brock. For two reasons.\nIn the first place, there would be a conflict of interest. I'm working\nfor Ravenhurst, and if he doesn't want\n  [23]\n  me to work for you, then it\nwould be unethical for me to take the job.\n\"In the second place, my fees are standardized. Oh, I can allow a\ncertain amount of fluctuation, but I'm not a physician or a lawyer; my\nservices are\n  [24]\n  not necessary to the survival of the individual, except\nin very rare cases, and those cases are generally arranged through a\nlawyer when it's a charity case.\n\"No, colonel, I'm afraid I couldn't\n  [25]\n  possibly work for you.\"\nHe thought that over for a long time. Finally, he nodded his head very\nslowly. \"I see. Yeah, I get your point.\" He scowled down at his drink.\n\"\nBut\n,\" I said, \"it would be a pleasure\n  [26]\n  to work\nwith\nyou.\"\nHe looked up quickly. \"How's that?\"\n\"Well, let's look at it this way: You can't hire me because I'm already\nworking for Ravenhurst; I can't hire\n  [27]\n  you because\nyou're\nworking for\nRavenhurst. But since we may need each other, and since we're both\nworking for Ravenhurst, there would be no conflict of interest if we\nco-operate.\n\"Or, to put it another way, I can't take money for any service I may\nrender you, but you can pay off in services. Am I coming through?\"\nHis broad smile made the scars on his face fold in and deepen. \"Loud\nand clear. It's a deal.\"\nI held up a hand, palm toward him. \"Ah, ah, ah! There's no 'deal'\ninvolved. We're just old buddies helping each other. This is for\nfriendship, not business. I scratch your back; you scratch mine. Fair?\"\n\"Fair. Come on down to my office; I want to give you a headful of facts\nand figures.\"\n\"Will do.

He was\nsmart\u2014but incredibly foolish. And, as a natural consequence, tended to\nask questions too profound for any philosopher\u2014questions like \"Who are\nyou?\"\nBy RANDALL GARRETT\nI'd been in Ravenhurst's office on the mountain-sized planetoid called\nRaven's Rest only twice before. The third time was no better; Shalimar\nRavenhurst was one of the smartest operators in the Belt, but when it\ncame to personal relationships, he was utterly incompetent. He could\nmake anyone dislike him without trying.\nWhen I entered the office, he was\n  [3]\n  sitting behind his mahogany desk,\nhis eyes focused on the operation he was going through with a wineglass\nand a decanter. He didn't look up at me as he said:\n\"Sit down, Mr. Oak. Will you have some Madeira?\"\nI decided I might as well observe the pleasantries. There was no point\nin my getting nasty until he did. \"Thank you, Mr. Ravenhurst, I will.\"\nHe kept his eyes focused on his work: It isn't easy to pour wine on a\nplanetoid where the gee-pull is measured in fractions of a centimeter\nper second squared. It moves slowly, like ropy molasses, but you have\nto be careful not to be fooled by that. The viscosity is just as low\nas ever, and if you pour it from any great height, it will go scooting\nright out of the glass\n  [4]\n  again. The momentum it builds up is enough to\nmake it splash right out again in a slow-motion gush which gets it all\nover the place.\nBesides which, even if it didn't splash, it would take it so long to\nfall a few inches that you'd die of thirst waiting for it.\nRavenhurst had evolved a technique from long years of practice.\nHe tilted the glass and the bottle toward each other, their edges\ntouching, like you do when you're trying to pour beer without putting a\nhead on it. As soon as the wine wet the glass, the adhesive forces at\nwork would pull more wine into the wine glass. To get capillary action\non a low-gee asteroid, you don't need a capillary, by any means. The\nnegative meniscus on the wine was something to see; the first time\nyou see it, you get the eerie feeling that the glass is spinning and\nthrowing the wine up against the walls by centrifugal force.\nI took the glass he offered me (Careful! Don't slosh!) and sipped at\nit. Using squirt tubes would have been a hell of a lot easier and\nneater, but Ravenhurst liked to do things his way.\nHe put the stopper back in the decanter, picked up his own glass and\nsipped appreciatively. Not until he put it back down on the desk again\ndid he raise his eyes and look at me for the first time since I'd come\nin.\n\"Mr. Oak, you have caused me considerable trouble.\"\n\"I thought we'd hashed all that out, Mr. Ravenhurst,\" I said, keeping\nmy voice level.\n[5]\n\"So had I. But it appears that there were more ramifications to your\naction than we had at first supposed.\" His voice had the texture of\nheavy linseed oil.\nHe waited, as if he expected me to make some reply to that. When\nI didn't, he sighed slightly and went on. \"I fear that you have\ninadvertently sabotaged McGuire. You were commissioned to prevent\nsabotage, Mr. Oak, and I'm afraid that you abrogated your contract.\"\nI just continued to keep my voice calm. \"If you are trying to get back\nthe fee you gave me, we can always take it to court. I don't think\nyou'd win.\"\n\"Mr. Oak,\" he said heavily, \"I am not a fool, regardless of what your\nown impression may be. If I were trying to get back that fee, I would\nhardly offer to pay you another one.\"\nI didn't think he was a fool. You don't get into the managerial\nbusiness and climb to the top and stay there unless you have brains.\nRavenhurst was smart, all right; it was just that, when it came to\npersonal relationships, he wasn't very wise.\n\"Then stop all this yak about an abrogated contract and get to the\npoint,\" I told him.\n\"I shall. I was merely trying to point out to you that it is through\nyour own actions that I find myself in a very trying position, and that\nyour sense of honor and ethics should induce you to rectify the damage.\"\n\"My honor and ethics are in fine shape,\" I said, \"but my interpretation\nof the concepts might not be quite\n  [6]\n  the same as yours. Get to the\npoint.\"\nHe took another sip of Madeira. \"The robotocists at Viking tell\nme that, in order to prevent any further ... ah ... sabotage by\nunauthorized persons, the MGYR-7 was constructed so that, after\nactivation, the first man who addressed orders to it would thenceforth\nbe considered its ... ah ... master.\n\"As I understand it, the problem of defining the term 'human being'\nunambiguously to a robot is still unsolved. The robotocists felt that\nit would be much easier to define a single individual. That would\nprevent the issuing of conflicting orders to a robot, provided the\nsingle individual were careful in giving orders himself.\n\"Now, it appears that\nyou\n, Mr. Oak, were the first man to speak to\nMcGuire after he had been activated. Is that correct?\"\n\"Is that question purely rhetorical,\" I asked him, putting on my best\nexpression of innocent interest. \"Or are you losing your memory?\" I had\nexplained all that to him two weeks before, when I'd brought McGuire\nand the girl here, so that Ravenhurst would have a chance to cover up\nwhat had really happened.\nMy sarcasm didn't faze him in the least. \"Rhetorical. It follows that\nyou are the only man whose orders McGuire will obey.\"\n\"Your robotocists can change that,\" I said. This time, I was giving him\nmy version of \"genuine\" innocence.\n  [7]\n  A man has to be a good actor to be\na competent double agent, and I didn't want Ravenhurst to know that I\nknew a great deal more about the problem than he did.\nHe shook his head, making his jowls wobble. \"No, they cannot. They\nrealize now that there should be some way of making that change, but\nthey failed to see that it would be necessary. Only by completely\ndraining McGuire's memory banks and refilling them with new data can\nthis bias be eliminated.\"\n\"Then why don't they do that?\"\n\"There are two very good reasons,\" he said. And there was a shade of\nanger in his tone. \"In the first place, that sort of operation takes\ntime, and it costs money. If we do that, we might as well go ahead and\nmake the slight changes in structure necessary to incorporate some of\nthe improvements that the robotocists now feel are necessary. In other\nwords, they might as well go ahead and build the MGYR-8, which is\nprecisely the thing I hired you to prevent.\"\n\"It seems you have a point there, Mr. Ravenhurst.\" He'd hired me\nbecause things were shaky at Viking. If he lost too much more money on\nthe McGuire experiment, he stood a good chance of losing his position\nas manager. If that happened some of his other managerial contracts\nmight be canceled, too. Things like that can begin to snowball, and\nRavenhurst might find himself out of the managerial business entirely.\n\"But,\" I went on, \"hasn't the additional wasted time already cost you\n  [8]\n  money?\"\n\"It has. I was reluctant to call you in again\u2014understandably enough, I\nthink.\"\n\"Perfectly. It's mutual.\"\nHe ignored me. \"I even considered going through with the rebuilding\nwork, now that we have traced down the source of failure of the first\nsix models. Unfortunately, that isn't feasible, either.\" He scowled at\nme.\n\"It seems,\" he went on, \"that McGuire refuses to allow his brain to\nbe tampered with. The self-preservation 'instinct' has come to the\nfore. He has refused to let the technicians and robotocists enter his\nhull, and he has threatened to take off and leave Ceres if any further\nattempts are made to ... ah ... disrupt his thinking processes.\"\n\"I can't say that I blame him,\" I said. \"What do you want me to do? Go\nto Ceres and tell him to submit like a good boy?\"\n\"It is too late for that, Mr. Oak. Viking cannot stand any more of\nthat kind of drain on its financial resources. I have been banking on\nthe McGuire-type ships to put Viking Spacecraft ahead of every other\nspacecraft company in the System.\" He looked suddenly very grim and\nvery determined. \"Mr. Oak, I am\ncertain\nthat the robot ship is the\nanswer to the transportation problems in the Solar System. For the sake\nof every human being in the Solar System, we must get the bugs out of\nMcGuire!\"\nWhat's good for General Bull-moose is good for everybody\n, I quoted\nto myself. I'd have said it out loud,\n  [9]\n  but I was fairly certain that\nShalimar Ravenhurst was not a student of the classics.\n\"Mr. Oak, I would like you to go to Ceres and co-operate with the\nrobotocists at Viking. When the MGYR-8 is finally built, I want it to\nbe the prototype for a fast, safe, functional robot spaceship that can\nbe turned out commercially. You can be of great service, Mr. Oak.\"\n\"In other words, I've got you over a barrel.\"\n\"I don't deny it.\"\n\"You know what my fees are, Mr. Ravenhurst. That's what you'll be\ncharged. I'll expect to be paid weekly; if Viking goes broke, I don't\nwant to lose more than a week's pay. On the other hand, if the MGYR-8\nis successful, I will expect a substantial bonus.\"\n\"How much?\"\n\"Exactly half of the cost of rebuilding. Half what it would take to\nbuild a Model 8 right now, and taking a chance on there being no bugs\nin it.\"\nHe considered that, looking grimmer than ever. Then he said: \"I will\ndo it on the condition that the bonus be paid off in installments, one\neach six months for three years after the first successful commercial\nship is built by Viking.\"\n\"My lawyer will nail you down on that wording,\" I said, \"but it's a\ndeal. Is there anything else?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Then I think I'll leave for Ceres before you break a blood vessel.\"\n\"You continue to amaze me, Mr. Oak,\" he said. And the soft oiliness\n  [10]\n  of\nhis voice was the oil of vitriol. \"Your compassion for your fellowman\nis a facet of your personality that I had not seen before. I shall\nwelcome the opportunity to relax and allow my blood pressure to\nsubside.\"\nI could almost see Shalimar Ravenhurst suddenly exploding and adding\nhis own touch of color to the room.\nAnd, on that gladsome thought, I left. I let him have his small verbal\ntriumph; if he'd known that I'd have taken on the job for almost\nnothing, he'd really have blown up.\nTen minutes later, I was in my vacuum suit, walking across the glaring,\nrough-polished rectangle of metal that was the landing field of\nRaven's Rest. The sun was near the zenith in the black, diamond-dusted\nsky, and the shadow of my flitterboat stood out like an inkblot on\na bridal gown. I climbed in, started the engine, and released the\nmagnetic anchor that held the little boat to the surface of the\nnickel-iron planetoid. I lifted her gently, worked her around until I\nwas stationary in relation to the spinning planetoid, oriented myself\nagainst the stellar background, and headed toward the first blinker\nbeacon on my way to Ceres.\nFor obvious economical reasons, it it impracticable to use full-sized\nspaceships in the Belt. A flitterboat, with a single gravitoinertial\nengine and the few necessities of life\u2014air, some water, and a very\nlittle food\u2014still costs more than a Rolls-Royce\n  [11]\n  automobile does on\nEarth, but there has to be some sort of individual transportation in\nthe Belt.\nThey can't be used for any great distances because a man can't stay\nin a vac suit very long without getting uncomfortable. You have to\nhop from beacon to beacon, which means that your\naverage\nvelocity\ndoesn't amount to much, since you spend too much time accelerating\nand decelerating. But a flitterboat is enough to get around the\nneighborhood in, and that's all that's needed.\nI got the GM-187 blinker in my sights, eased the acceleration up to one\ngee, relaxed to watch the radar screen while I thought over my coming\nordeal with McGuire.\nTesting spaceships, robotic or any other kind, is strictly not my\nbusiness. The sign on the door of my office in New York says:\nDANIEL\nOAK, Confidential Expediter\n; I'm hired to help other people Get Things\nDone. Usually, if someone came to me with the problem of getting a\nspaceship test-piloted, I'd simply dig up the best test pilot in the\nbusiness, hire him for my client, and forget about everything but\ncollecting my fee. But I couldn't have refused this case if I'd wanted\nto. I'd already been assigned to it by someone a lot more important\nthan Shalimar Ravenhurst.\nEvery schoolchild who has taken a course in Government Organization and\nFunction can tell you that the Political Survey Division is a branch of\nthe System Census Bureau of the UN Government, and that its job is to\nevaluate the political activities of\n  [12]\n  various sub-governments all over\nthe System.\nAnd every one of those poor tykes would be dead wrong.\nThe Political Survey Division\ndoes\nevaluate political activity, all\nright, but it is the Secret Service of the UN Government. The vast\nmajority of\n  [13]\n  the System's citizens don't even know the Government has\na Secret Service. I happen to know only because I'm an agent of the\nPolitical Survey Division.\nThe PSD was vitally interested in the whole McGuire project. Robots of\nMcGuire's complexity had been built before; the robot that runs the\ntraffic patterns of the American Eastern Seaboard is just as capable\nas McGuire when it comes to handling a tremendous number of variables\nand making decisions on them. But that robot didn't have to be given\norders except in extreme emergencies. Keeping a few million cars moving\nand safe at the same time is actually pretty routine stuff for a robot.\nAnd a traffic robot isn't given orders verbally; it is given any orders\nthat may be necessary via teletype by a trained programming technician.\nThose orders are usually in reference to a change of routing due to\nrepair work on the highways or the like. The robot itself can take care\nof such emergencies as bad weather or even an accident caused by the\nmalfunctioning of an individual automobile.\nMcGuire was different. In the first place, he was mobile. He was in\ncommand of a spacecraft. In a sense, he\nwas\nthe spacecraft, since it\nserved him in a way that was analogous to the way a human body serves\nthe human mind. And he wasn't in charge of millions of objects with a\ntop velocity of a hundred and fifty miles an hour; he was in charge\nof a single object that moved at velocities of thousands of miles per\nsecond. Nor\n  [14]\n  did he have a set, unmoving highway as his path; his paths\nwere variable and led through the emptiness of space.\nUnforeseen emergencies can happen at any time in space, most of them\nhaving to do with the lives of passengers. A cargo ship would be\nsomewhat less susceptible to such emergencies if there were no humans\naboard; it doesn't matter much to a robot if he has no air in his hull.\nBut with passengers aboard, there may be times when it would be\nnecessary to give orders\u2014\nfast\n! And that means verbal orders, orders\nthat can be given anywhere in the ship and relayed immediately by\nmicrophone to the robot's brain. A man doesn't have time to run to a\nteletyper and type out orders when there's an emergency in space.\nThat meant that McGuire had to understand English, and, since there has\nto be feedback in communication, he had to be able to speak it as well.\nAnd that made McGuire more than somewhat difficult to deal with.\nFor more than a century, robotocists have been trying to build Asimov's\nfamous Three Laws of Robotics into a robot brain.\nFirst Law: A robot shall not, either through action or inaction, allow\nharm to come to a human being.\nSecond Law: A robot shall obey the orders of a human being, except\nwhen such orders conflict with the First Law\n.\n[15]\nThird Law: A robot shall strive to protect its own existence, except\nwhen this conflicts with the First or Second Law.\nNobody has succeeded yet, because nobody has yet succeeded in defining\nthe term \"human being\" in such a way that the logical mind of a robot\ncan encompass the concept.\nA traffic robot is useful only because the definition has been rigidly\nnarrowed down. As far as a traffic robot is concerned, \"human beings\"\nare the automobiles on its highways. Woe betide any poor sap who tries,\nillegally, to cross a robot-controlled highway on foot. The robot's\nonly concern would be with the safety of the automobiles, and if the\nonly way to avoid destruction of an automobile were to be by nudging\nthe pedestrian aside with a fender, that's what would happen.\nAnd, since its orders only come from one place, I suppose that a\ntraffic robot thinks that the guy who uses that typer is an automobile.\nWith the first six models of the McGuire ships, the robotocists\nattempted to build in the Three Laws exactly as stated. And the first\nsix went insane.\nIf one human being says \"jump left,\" and another says \"jump right,\"\nthe robot is unable to evaluate which human being has given the more\nvalid order. Feed enough confusing and conflicting data into a robot\nbrain, and it can begin behaving in ways that, in a human being, would\nbe called paranoia or schizophrenia or catatonia or what-have-you,\ndepending\n  [16]\n  on the symptoms. And an insane robot is fully as dangerous\nas an insane human being controlling the same mechanical equipment, if\nnot more so.\nSo the seventh model had been modified. The present McGuire's brain was\nimpressed with slight modifications of the First and Second Laws.\nIf it is difficult to define a human being, it is much more difficult\nto define a\nresponsible\nhuman being. One, in other words, who can\nbe relied upon to give wise and proper orders to a robot, who can be\nrelied upon not to drive the robot insane.\nThe robotocists at Viking Spacecraft had decided to take another\ntack. \"Very well,\" they'd said, \"if we can't define all the members\nof a group, we can certainly define an individual. We'll pick one\nresponsible person and build McGuire so that he will take orders only\nfrom that person.\"\nAs it turned out, I was that person. Just substitute \"Daniel Oak\"\nfor \"human being\" in the First and Second Laws, and you'll see how\nimportant I was to a certain spaceship named McGuire.\nWhen I finally caught the beam from Ceres and set my flitterboat down\non the huge landing field that had been carved from the nickel-iron\nof the asteroid with a focused sun beam, I was itchy with my own\nperspiration and groggy tired. I don't like riding in flitterboats,\nsitting on a\n  [17]\n  bucket seat, astride the drive tube, like a witch on a\nbroomstick, with nothing but a near-invisible transite hull between me\nand the stars, all cooped up in a vac suit. Unlike driving a car, you\ncan't pull a flitterboat over and take a nap; you have to wait until\nyou hit the next beacon station.\nCeres, the biggest rock in the Belt, is a lot more than just a beacon\nstation. Like Eros and a few others, it's a city in its own right. And\nexcept for the Government Reservation, Viking Spacecraft owned Ceres,\nlock, stock, and mining rights.\nPart of the reason for Viking's troubles was envy of that ownership.\nThere were other companies in the Belt that would like to get their\nhands on that plum, and there were those who were doing everything\nshort of cutting throats to get it. The PSD was afraid it might come to\nthat, too, before very long.\nCeres is fifty-eight million cubic miles of nickel-iron, but nobody\nwould cut her up for that. Nickel-iron is almost exactly as cheap as\ndirt on Earth, and, considering shipping costs, Earth soil costs a\ngreat deal more than nickel-iron in the Belt.\nBut, as an operations base, Ceres is second to none. Its surface\ngravity averages .0294 Standard Gee, as compared with Earth's .981,\nand that's enough to give a slight feeling of weight without unduly\nhampering the body with too much load. I weigh just under six pounds\non Ceres, and after I've been there a while, going back to Earth is a\nstrain that takes a\n  [18]\n  week to get used to. Kids that are brought up in\nthe Belt are forced to exercise in a room with a one-gee spin on it at\nleast an hour a day. They don't like it at first, but it keeps them\nfrom growing up with the strength of mice. And an adult with any sense\ntakes a spin now and then, too. Traveling in a flitterboat will give\nyou a one-gee pull, all right, but you don't get much exercise.\nI parked my flitterboat in the space that had been assigned to me by\nLanding Control, and went over to the nearest air-lock dome.\nAfter I'd cycled through and had shucked my vac suit, I went into the\ninner room to find Colonel Brock waiting for me.\n\"Have a good trip, Oak?\" he asked, trying to put a smile on his\nscarred, battered face.\n\"I got here alive, if that makes it a good flitterboat trip,\" I said,\nshaking his extended hand.\n\"That's the definition of a good trip,\" he told me.\n\"Then the question was superfluous. Seriously, what I need is a bath\nand some sleep.\"\n\"You'll get that, but first let's go somewhere where we can talk. Want\na drink?\"\n\"I could use one, I guess. Your treat?\"\n\"My treat,\" he said. \"Come on.\"\nI followed him out and down a ladder to a corridor that led north. By\ndefinition, any asteroid spins toward the east, and all directions\nfollow from that, regardless of which way the axis may point.\n[19]\nColonel Harrington Brock was dressed in the black-and-gold \"union\nsuit\" that was the uniform of Ravenhurst's Security Guard. My own was\na tasteful green, but some of the other people in the public corridor\nseemed to go for more flashiness; besides silver and gold, there were\nshocking pinks and violent mauves, with stripes and blazes of other\ncolors.\nA crowd wearing skin-tight cover-alls might shock the gentle people of\nMidwich-on-the-Moor, England, but they are normal dress in the Belt.\nYou can't climb into a vac suit with bulky clothing on, and, if you\ndid, you'd hate yourself within an hour, with a curse for every wrinkle\nthat chafed your skin. And, in the Belt, you never know when you might\nhave to get into a vac suit fast. In a \"safe\" area like the tunnels\ninside Ceres, there isn't much chance of losing air, but there are\nplaces where no one but a fool would ever be more than ten seconds away\nfrom his vac suit.\nI read an article by a psychologist a few months back, in which he\nclaimed that the taste for loud colors in union suits was actually\ndue to modesty. He claimed that the bright patterns drew attention to\nthe colors themselves, and away from the base the colors were laid\nover. The observer, he said, tends to see the color and pattern of the\nsuit, rather than the body it clings to so closely. Maybe he's right;\nI wouldn't know, not being a psychologist. I\nhave\nspent summers in\nnudist resorts, though, and I never noticed anyone painting themselves\nwith lavender\n  [20]\n  and chartreuse checks. On the other hand, the people who\ngo to nudist resorts are a self-screened group. So are the people who\ngo to the Belt, for that matter, but the type of screening is different.\nI'll just leave that problem in the hands of the psychologists, and go\non wearing my immodestly quiet solid-color union suits.\nBrock pushed open the inch-thick metal door beneath a sign that said\n\"O'Banion's Bar,\" and I followed him in. We sat down at a table and\nordered drinks when the waiter bustled over. A cop in uniform isn't\nsupposed to drink, but Brock figures that the head of the Security\nGuard ought to be able to get away with a breach of his own rules.\nWe had our drinks in front of us and our cigarettes lit before Brock\nopened up with his troubles.\n\"Oak,\" he said, \"I wanted to intercept you before you went to the plant\nbecause I want you to know that there may be trouble.\"\n\"Yeah? What kind?\" Sometimes it's a pain to play ignorant.\n\"Thurston's outfit is trying to oust Ravenhurst from the managership of\nViking and take over the job. Baedecker Metals &amp; Mining Corporation,\nwhich is managed by Baedecker himself, wants to force Viking out of\nbusiness so that BM&amp;M can take over Ceres for large-scale processing of\nprecious metals.\n\"Between the two of 'em, they're raising all sorts of minor hell\naround\n  [21]\n  here, and it's liable to become major hell at any time. And we\ncan't stand any hell\u2014or sabotage\u2014around this planetoid just now!\"\n\"Now wait a minute,\" I said, still playing ignorant, \"I thought we'd\npretty well established that the 'sabotage' of the McGuire series was\nJack Ravenhurst's fault. She was the one who was driving them nuts, not\nThurston's agents.\"\n\"Perfectly true,\" he said agreeably. \"We managed to block any attempts\nof sabotage by other company agents, even though it looked as though we\nhadn't for a while.\" He chuckled wryly. \"We went all out to keep the\nMcGuires safe, and all the time the boss' daughter was giving them the\nworks.\" Then he looked sharply at me. \"I covered that, of course. No\none in the Security Guard but me knows that Jack was responsible.\"\n\"Good. But what about the Thurston and Baedecker agents, then?\"\nHe took a hefty slug of his drink. \"They're around, all right. We have\nour eyes on the ones we know, but those outfits are as sharp as we\nare, and they may have a few agents here on Ceres that we know nothing\nabout.\"\n\"So? What does this have to do with me?\"\nHe put his drink on the table. \"Oak, I want you to help me.\" His\nonyx-brown eyes, only a shade darker than his skin, looked directly\ninto my own. \"I know it isn't part of your assignment, and you know I\ncan't afford to pay you anything near what you're worth. It will have\nto come out of my\n  [22]\n  pocket because I couldn't possibly justify it from\noperating funds. Ravenhurst specifically told me that he doesn't want\nyou messing around with the espionage and sabotage problem because he\ndoesn't like your methods of operation.\"\n\"And you're going to go against his orders?\"\n\"I am. Ravenhurst is sore at you personally because you showed him\nthat Jack was responsible for the McGuire sabotage. It's an irrational\ndislike, and I am not going to let it interfere with my job. I'm going\nto protect Ravenhurst's interests to the best of my ability, and that\nmeans that I'll use the best of other people's abilities if I can.\"\nI grinned at him. \"The last I heard, you were sore at me for blatting\nit all over Ceres that Jaqueline Ravenhurst was missing, when she\nsneaked aboard McGuire.\"\nHe nodded perfunctorily. \"I was. I still think you should have told me\nwhat you were up to. But you did it, and you got results that I'd been\nunable to get. I'm not going to let a momentary pique hang on as an\nirrational dislike. I like to think I have more sense than that.\"\n\"Thanks.\" There wasn't much else I could say.\n\"Now, I've got a little dough put away; it's not much, but I could\noffer you\u2014\"\nI shook my head, cutting him off. \"Nope. Sorry, Brock. For two reasons.\nIn the first place, there would be a conflict of interest. I'm working\nfor Ravenhurst, and if he doesn't want\n  [23]\n  me to work for you, then it\nwould be unethical for me to take the job.\n\"In the second place, my fees are standardized. Oh, I can allow a\ncertain amount of fluctuation, but I'm not a physician or a lawyer; my\nservices are\n  [24]\n  not necessary to the survival of the individual, except\nin very rare cases, and those cases are generally arranged through a\nlawyer when it's a charity case.\n\"No, colonel, I'm afraid I couldn't\n  [25]\n  possibly work for you.\"\nHe thought that over for a long time.

He offers Mr. Oak a glass of wine, which he says he has just poured from a spasticizer. He is happy to offer it to him, but he is not happy to accept it. He has been in the area for a while, and he has a reputation for being a clever operator. He does not want to be seen as incompetent, but Mr. McIvers, a man he hired to charter his ship, is a bit more emotional and does not like the fact that he is working with a genius like Ravenhurst. He asks him to pay him a fee for his services, which is $50 Galactic per week, which Mr. Ravenhurst refuses. He also tells him that he will not be able to work with him if he does not have a contract. He then tells him to leave.   Later, a woman named Mrs. Oak comes to see Mr. Crabtree, who is a wealthy man. She is upset with him because he has been working with the incompetent Mr. Robert Ravenhurs for a long time. She tells him she is a teacher, and that he has caused her a lot of trouble. He tells her that he does his best to keep his job, but that he cannot do it for everyone. She then tells her to leave, and then he tells her he will be back. She leaves.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, null]}

He was\nsmart\u2014but incredibly foolish. And, as a natural consequence, tended to\nask questions too profound for any philosopher\u2014questions like \"Who are\nyou?\"\nBy RANDALL GARRETT\nI'd been in Ravenhurst's office on the mountain-sized planetoid called\nRaven's Rest only twice before. The third time was no better; Shalimar\nRavenhurst was one of the smartest operators in the Belt, but when it\ncame to personal relationships, he was utterly incompetent. He could\nmake anyone dislike him without trying.\nWhen I entered the office, he was\n  [3]\n  sitting behind his mahogany desk,\nhis eyes focused on the operation he was going through with a wineglass\nand a decanter. He didn't look up at me as he said:\n\"Sit down, Mr. Oak. Will you have some Madeira?\"\nI decided I might as well observe the pleasantries. There was no point\nin my getting nasty until he did. \"Thank you, Mr. Ravenhurst, I will.\"\nHe kept his eyes focused on his work: It isn't easy to pour wine on a\nplanetoid where the gee-pull is measured in fractions of a centimeter\nper second squared. It moves slowly, like ropy molasses, but you have\nto be careful not to be fooled by that. The viscosity is just as low\nas ever, and if you pour it from any great height, it will go scooting\nright out of the glass\n  [4]\n  again. The momentum it builds up is enough to\nmake it splash right out again in a slow-motion gush which gets it all\nover the place.\nBesides which, even if it didn't splash, it would take it so long to\nfall a few inches that you'd die of thirst waiting for it.\nRavenhurst had evolved a technique from long years of practice.\nHe tilted the glass and the bottle toward each other, their edges\ntouching, like you do when you're trying to pour beer without putting a\nhead on it. As soon as the wine wet the glass, the adhesive forces at\nwork would pull more wine into the wine glass. To get capillary action\non a low-gee asteroid, you don't need a capillary, by any means. The\nnegative meniscus on the wine was something to see; the first time\nyou see it, you get the eerie feeling that the glass is spinning and\nthrowing the wine up against the walls by centrifugal force.\nI took the glass he offered me (Careful! Don't slosh!) and sipped at\nit. Using squirt tubes would have been a hell of a lot easier and\nneater, but Ravenhurst liked to do things his way.\nHe put the stopper back in the decanter, picked up his own glass and\nsipped appreciatively. Not until he put it back down on the desk again\ndid he raise his eyes and look at me for the first time since I'd come\nin.\n\"Mr. Oak, you have caused me considerable trouble.\"\n\"I thought we'd hashed all that out, Mr. Ravenhurst,\" I said, keeping\nmy voice level.\n[5]\n\"So had I. But it appears that there were more ramifications to your\naction than we had at first supposed.\" His voice had the texture of\nheavy linseed oil.\nHe waited, as if he expected me to make some reply to that. When\nI didn't, he sighed slightly and went on. \"I fear that you have\ninadvertently sabotaged McGuire. You were commissioned to prevent\nsabotage, Mr. Oak, and I'm afraid that you abrogated your contract.\"\nI just continued to keep my voice calm. \"If you are trying to get back\nthe fee you gave me, we can always take it to court. I don't think\nyou'd win.\"\n\"Mr. Oak,\" he said heavily, \"I am not a fool, regardless of what your\nown impression may be. If I were trying to get back that fee, I would\nhardly offer to pay you another one.\"\nI didn't think he was a fool. You don't get into the managerial\nbusiness and climb to the top and stay there unless you have brains.\nRavenhurst was smart, all right; it was just that, when it came to\npersonal relationships, he wasn't very wise.\n\"Then stop all this yak about an abrogated contract and get to the\npoint,\" I told him.\n\"I shall. I was merely trying to point out to you that it is through\nyour own actions that I find myself in a very trying position, and that\nyour sense of honor and ethics should induce you to rectify the damage.\"\n\"My honor and ethics are in fine shape,\" I said, \"but my interpretation\nof the concepts might not be quite\n  [6]\n  the same as yours. Get to the\npoint.\"\nHe took another sip of Madeira. \"The robotocists at Viking tell\nme that, in order to prevent any further ... ah ... sabotage by\nunauthorized persons, the MGYR-7 was constructed so that, after\nactivation, the first man who addressed orders to it would thenceforth\nbe considered its ... ah ... master.\n\"As I understand it, the problem of defining the term 'human being'\nunambiguously to a robot is still unsolved. The robotocists felt that\nit would be much easier to define a single individual. That would\nprevent the issuing of conflicting orders to a robot, provided the\nsingle individual were careful in giving orders himself.\n\"Now, it appears that\nyou\n, Mr. Oak, were the first man to speak to\nMcGuire after he had been activated. Is that correct?\"\n\"Is that question purely rhetorical,\" I asked him, putting on my best\nexpression of innocent interest. \"Or are you losing your memory?\" I had\nexplained all that to him two weeks before, when I'd brought McGuire\nand the girl here, so that Ravenhurst would have a chance to cover up\nwhat had really happened.\nMy sarcasm didn't faze him in the least. \"Rhetorical. It follows that\nyou are the only man whose orders McGuire will obey.\"\n\"Your robotocists can change that,\" I said. This time, I was giving him\nmy version of \"genuine\" innocence.\n  [7]\n  A man has to be a good actor to be\na competent double agent, and I didn't want Ravenhurst to know that I\nknew a great deal more about the problem than he did.\nHe shook his head, making his jowls wobble. \"No, they cannot. They\nrealize now that there should be some way of making that change, but\nthey failed to see that it would be necessary. Only by completely\ndraining McGuire's memory banks and refilling them with new data can\nthis bias be eliminated.\"\n\"Then why don't they do that?\"\n\"There are two very good reasons,\" he said. And there was a shade of\nanger in his tone. \"In the first place, that sort of operation takes\ntime, and it costs money. If we do that, we might as well go ahead and\nmake the slight changes in structure necessary to incorporate some of\nthe improvements that the robotocists now feel are necessary. In other\nwords, they might as well go ahead and build the MGYR-8, which is\nprecisely the thing I hired you to prevent.\"\n\"It seems you have a point there, Mr. Ravenhurst.\" He'd hired me\nbecause things were shaky at Viking. If he lost too much more money on\nthe McGuire experiment, he stood a good chance of losing his position\nas manager. If that happened some of his other managerial contracts\nmight be canceled, too. Things like that can begin to snowball, and\nRavenhurst might find himself out of the managerial business entirely.\n\"But,\" I went on, \"hasn't the additional wasted time already cost you\n  [8]\n  money?\"\n\"It has. I was reluctant to call you in again\u2014understandably enough, I\nthink.\"\n\"Perfectly. It's mutual.\"\nHe ignored me. \"I even considered going through with the rebuilding\nwork, now that we have traced down the source of failure of the first\nsix models. Unfortunately, that isn't feasible, either.\" He scowled at\nme.\n\"It seems,\" he went on, \"that McGuire refuses to allow his brain to\nbe tampered with. The self-preservation 'instinct' has come to the\nfore. He has refused to let the technicians and robotocists enter his\nhull, and he has threatened to take off and leave Ceres if any further\nattempts are made to ... ah ... disrupt his thinking processes.\"\n\"I can't say that I blame him,\" I said. \"What do you want me to do? Go\nto Ceres and tell him to submit like a good boy?\"\n\"It is too late for that, Mr. Oak. Viking cannot stand any more of\nthat kind of drain on its financial resources. I have been banking on\nthe McGuire-type ships to put Viking Spacecraft ahead of every other\nspacecraft company in the System.\" He looked suddenly very grim and\nvery determined. \"Mr. Oak, I am\ncertain\nthat the robot ship is the\nanswer to the transportation problems in the Solar System. For the sake\nof every human being in the Solar System, we must get the bugs out of\nMcGuire!\"\nWhat's good for General Bull-moose is good for everybody\n, I quoted\nto myself. I'd have said it out loud,\n  [9]\n  but I was fairly certain that\nShalimar Ravenhurst was not a student of the classics.\n\"Mr. Oak, I would like you to go to Ceres and co-operate with the\nrobotocists at Viking. When the MGYR-8 is finally built, I want it to\nbe the prototype for a fast, safe, functional robot spaceship that can\nbe turned out commercially. You can be of great service, Mr. Oak.\"\n\"In other words, I've got you over a barrel.\"\n\"I don't deny it.\"\n\"You know what my fees are, Mr. Ravenhurst. That's what you'll be\ncharged. I'll expect to be paid weekly; if Viking goes broke, I don't\nwant to lose more than a week's pay. On the other hand, if the MGYR-8\nis successful, I will expect a substantial bonus.\"\n\"How much?\"\n\"Exactly half of the cost of rebuilding. Half what it would take to\nbuild a Model 8 right now, and taking a chance on there being no bugs\nin it.\"\nHe considered that, looking grimmer than ever. Then he said: \"I will\ndo it on the condition that the bonus be paid off in installments, one\neach six months for three years after the first successful commercial\nship is built by Viking.\"\n\"My lawyer will nail you down on that wording,\" I said, \"but it's a\ndeal. Is there anything else?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Then I think I'll leave for Ceres before you break a blood vessel.\"\n\"You continue to amaze me, Mr. Oak,\" he said. And the soft oiliness\n  [10]\n  of\nhis voice was the oil of vitriol. \"Your compassion for your fellowman\nis a facet of your personality that I had not seen before. I shall\nwelcome the opportunity to relax and allow my blood pressure to\nsubside.\"\nI could almost see Shalimar Ravenhurst suddenly exploding and adding\nhis own touch of color to the room.\nAnd, on that gladsome thought, I left. I let him have his small verbal\ntriumph; if he'd known that I'd have taken on the job for almost\nnothing, he'd really have blown up.\nTen minutes later, I was in my vacuum suit, walking across the glaring,\nrough-polished rectangle of metal that was the landing field of\nRaven's Rest. The sun was near the zenith in the black, diamond-dusted\nsky, and the shadow of my flitterboat stood out like an inkblot on\na bridal gown. I climbed in, started the engine, and released the\nmagnetic anchor that held the little boat to the surface of the\nnickel-iron planetoid. I lifted her gently, worked her around until I\nwas stationary in relation to the spinning planetoid, oriented myself\nagainst the stellar background, and headed toward the first blinker\nbeacon on my way to Ceres.\nFor obvious economical reasons, it it impracticable to use full-sized\nspaceships in the Belt. A flitterboat, with a single gravitoinertial\nengine and the few necessities of life\u2014air, some water, and a very\nlittle food\u2014still costs more than a Rolls-Royce\n  [11]\n  automobile does on\nEarth, but there has to be some sort of individual transportation in\nthe Belt.\nThey can't be used for any great distances because a man can't stay\nin a vac suit very long without getting uncomfortable. You have to\nhop from beacon to beacon, which means that your\naverage\nvelocity\ndoesn't amount to much, since you spend too much time accelerating\nand decelerating. But a flitterboat is enough to get around the\nneighborhood in, and that's all that's needed.\nI got the GM-187 blinker in my sights, eased the acceleration up to one\ngee, relaxed to watch the radar screen while I thought over my coming\nordeal with McGuire.\nTesting spaceships, robotic or any other kind, is strictly not my\nbusiness. The sign on the door of my office in New York says:\nDANIEL\nOAK, Confidential Expediter\n; I'm hired to help other people Get Things\nDone. Usually, if someone came to me with the problem of getting a\nspaceship test-piloted, I'd simply dig up the best test pilot in the\nbusiness, hire him for my client, and forget about everything but\ncollecting my fee. But I couldn't have refused this case if I'd wanted\nto. I'd already been assigned to it by someone a lot more important\nthan Shalimar Ravenhurst.\nEvery schoolchild who has taken a course in Government Organization and\nFunction can tell you that the Political Survey Division is a branch of\nthe System Census Bureau of the UN Government, and that its job is to\nevaluate the political activities of\n  [12]\n  various sub-governments all over\nthe System.\nAnd every one of those poor tykes would be dead wrong.\nThe Political Survey Division\ndoes\nevaluate political activity, all\nright, but it is the Secret Service of the UN Government. The vast\nmajority of\n  [13]\n  the System's citizens don't even know the Government has\na Secret Service. I happen to know only because I'm an agent of the\nPolitical Survey Division.\nThe PSD was vitally interested in the whole McGuire project. Robots of\nMcGuire's complexity had been built before; the robot that runs the\ntraffic patterns of the American Eastern Seaboard is just as capable\nas McGuire when it comes to handling a tremendous number of variables\nand making decisions on them. But that robot didn't have to be given\norders except in extreme emergencies. Keeping a few million cars moving\nand safe at the same time is actually pretty routine stuff for a robot.\nAnd a traffic robot isn't given orders verbally; it is given any orders\nthat may be necessary via teletype by a trained programming technician.\nThose orders are usually in reference to a change of routing due to\nrepair work on the highways or the like. The robot itself can take care\nof such emergencies as bad weather or even an accident caused by the\nmalfunctioning of an individual automobile.\nMcGuire was different. In the first place, he was mobile. He was in\ncommand of a spacecraft. In a sense, he\nwas\nthe spacecraft, since it\nserved him in a way that was analogous to the way a human body serves\nthe human mind. And he wasn't in charge of millions of objects with a\ntop velocity of a hundred and fifty miles an hour; he was in charge\nof a single object that moved at velocities of thousands of miles per\nsecond. Nor\n  [14]\n  did he have a set, unmoving highway as his path; his paths\nwere variable and led through the emptiness of space.\nUnforeseen emergencies can happen at any time in space, most of them\nhaving to do with the lives of passengers. A cargo ship would be\nsomewhat less susceptible to such emergencies if there were no humans\naboard; it doesn't matter much to a robot if he has no air in his hull.\nBut with passengers aboard, there may be times when it would be\nnecessary to give orders\u2014\nfast\n! And that means verbal orders, orders\nthat can be given anywhere in the ship and relayed immediately by\nmicrophone to the robot's brain. A man doesn't have time to run to a\nteletyper and type out orders when there's an emergency in space.\nThat meant that McGuire had to understand English, and, since there has\nto be feedback in communication, he had to be able to speak it as well.\nAnd that made McGuire more than somewhat difficult to deal with.\nFor more than a century, robotocists have been trying to build Asimov's\nfamous Three Laws of Robotics into a robot brain.\nFirst Law: A robot shall not, either through action or inaction, allow\nharm to come to a human being.\nSecond Law: A robot shall obey the orders of a human being, except\nwhen such orders conflict with the First Law\n.\n[15]\nThird Law: A robot shall strive to protect its own existence, except\nwhen this conflicts with the First or Second Law.\nNobody has succeeded yet, because nobody has yet succeeded in defining\nthe term \"human being\" in such a way that the logical mind of a robot\ncan encompass the concept.\nA traffic robot is useful only because the definition has been rigidly\nnarrowed down. As far as a traffic robot is concerned, \"human beings\"\nare the automobiles on its highways. Woe betide any poor sap who tries,\nillegally, to cross a robot-controlled highway on foot. The robot's\nonly concern would be with the safety of the automobiles, and if the\nonly way to avoid destruction of an automobile were to be by nudging\nthe pedestrian aside with a fender, that's what would happen.\nAnd, since its orders only come from one place, I suppose that a\ntraffic robot thinks that the guy who uses that typer is an automobile.\nWith the first six models of the McGuire ships, the robotocists\nattempted to build in the Three Laws exactly as stated. And the first\nsix went insane.\nIf one human being says \"jump left,\" and another says \"jump right,\"\nthe robot is unable to evaluate which human being has given the more\nvalid order. Feed enough confusing and conflicting data into a robot\nbrain, and it can begin behaving in ways that, in a human being, would\nbe called paranoia or schizophrenia or catatonia or what-have-you,\ndepending\n  [16]\n  on the symptoms. And an insane robot is fully as dangerous\nas an insane human being controlling the same mechanical equipment, if\nnot more so.\nSo the seventh model had been modified. The present McGuire's brain was\nimpressed with slight modifications of the First and Second Laws.\nIf it is difficult to define a human being, it is much more difficult\nto define a\nresponsible\nhuman being. One, in other words, who can\nbe relied upon to give wise and proper orders to a robot, who can be\nrelied upon not to drive the robot insane.\nThe robotocists at Viking Spacecraft had decided to take another\ntack. \"Very well,\" they'd said, \"if we can't define all the members\nof a group, we can certainly define an individual. We'll pick one\nresponsible person and build McGuire so that he will take orders only\nfrom that person.\"\nAs it turned out, I was that person. Just substitute \"Daniel Oak\"\nfor \"human being\" in the First and Second Laws, and you'll see how\nimportant I was to a certain spaceship named McGuire.\nWhen I finally caught the beam from Ceres and set my flitterboat down\non the huge landing field that had been carved from the nickel-iron\nof the asteroid with a focused sun beam, I was itchy with my own\nperspiration and groggy tired. I don't like riding in flitterboats,\nsitting on a\n  [17]\n  bucket seat, astride the drive tube, like a witch on a\nbroomstick, with nothing but a near-invisible transite hull between me\nand the stars, all cooped up in a vac suit. Unlike driving a car, you\ncan't pull a flitterboat over and take a nap; you have to wait until\nyou hit the next beacon station.\nCeres, the biggest rock in the Belt, is a lot more than just a beacon\nstation. Like Eros and a few others, it's a city in its own right. And\nexcept for the Government Reservation, Viking Spacecraft owned Ceres,\nlock, stock, and mining rights.\nPart of the reason for Viking's troubles was envy of that ownership.\nThere were other companies in the Belt that would like to get their\nhands on that plum, and there were those who were doing everything\nshort of cutting throats to get it. The PSD was afraid it might come to\nthat, too, before very long.\nCeres is fifty-eight million cubic miles of nickel-iron, but nobody\nwould cut her up for that. Nickel-iron is almost exactly as cheap as\ndirt on Earth, and, considering shipping costs, Earth soil costs a\ngreat deal more than nickel-iron in the Belt.\nBut, as an operations base, Ceres is second to none. Its surface\ngravity averages .0294 Standard Gee, as compared with Earth's .981,\nand that's enough to give a slight feeling of weight without unduly\nhampering the body with too much load. I weigh just under six pounds\non Ceres, and after I've been there a while, going back to Earth is a\nstrain that takes a\n  [18]\n  week to get used to. Kids that are brought up in\nthe Belt are forced to exercise in a room with a one-gee spin on it at\nleast an hour a day. They don't like it at first, but it keeps them\nfrom growing up with the strength of mice. And an adult with any sense\ntakes a spin now and then, too. Traveling in a flitterboat will give\nyou a one-gee pull, all right, but you don't get much exercise.\nI parked my flitterboat in the space that had been assigned to me by\nLanding Control, and went over to the nearest air-lock dome.\nAfter I'd cycled through and had shucked my vac suit, I went into the\ninner room to find Colonel Brock waiting for me.\n\"Have a good trip, Oak?\" he asked, trying to put a smile on his\nscarred, battered face.\n\"I got here alive, if that makes it a good flitterboat trip,\" I said,\nshaking his extended hand.\n\"That's the definition of a good trip,\" he told me.\n\"Then the question was superfluous. Seriously, what I need is a bath\nand some sleep.\"\n\"You'll get that, but first let's go somewhere where we can talk. Want\na drink?\"\n\"I could use one, I guess. Your treat?\"\n\"My treat,\" he said. \"Come on.\"\nI followed him out and down a ladder to a corridor that led north. By\ndefinition, any asteroid spins toward the east, and all directions\nfollow from that, regardless of which way the axis may point.\n[19]\nColonel Harrington Brock was dressed in the black-and-gold \"union\nsuit\" that was the uniform of Ravenhurst's Security Guard. My own was\na tasteful green, but some of the other people in the public corridor\nseemed to go for more flashiness; besides silver and gold, there were\nshocking pinks and violent mauves, with stripes and blazes of other\ncolors.\nA crowd wearing skin-tight cover-alls might shock the gentle people of\nMidwich-on-the-Moor, England, but they are normal dress in the Belt.\nYou can't climb into a vac suit with bulky clothing on, and, if you\ndid, you'd hate yourself within an hour, with a curse for every wrinkle\nthat chafed your skin. And, in the Belt, you never know when you might\nhave to get into a vac suit fast. In a \"safe\" area like the tunnels\ninside Ceres, there isn't much chance of losing air, but there are\nplaces where no one but a fool would ever be more than ten seconds away\nfrom his vac suit.\nI read an article by a psychologist a few months back, in which he\nclaimed that the taste for loud colors in union suits was actually\ndue to modesty. He claimed that the bright patterns drew attention to\nthe colors themselves, and away from the base the colors were laid\nover. The observer, he said, tends to see the color and pattern of the\nsuit, rather than the body it clings to so closely. Maybe he's right;\nI wouldn't know, not being a psychologist. I\nhave\nspent summers in\nnudist resorts, though, and I never noticed anyone painting themselves\nwith lavender\n  [20]\n  and chartreuse checks. On the other hand, the people who\ngo to nudist resorts are a self-screened group. So are the people who\ngo to the Belt, for that matter, but the type of screening is different.\nI'll just leave that problem in the hands of the psychologists, and go\non wearing my immodestly quiet solid-color union suits.\nBrock pushed open the inch-thick metal door beneath a sign that said\n\"O'Banion's Bar,\" and I followed him in. We sat down at a table and\nordered drinks when the waiter bustled over. A cop in uniform isn't\nsupposed to drink, but Brock figures that the head of the Security\nGuard ought to be able to get away with a breach of his own rules.\nWe had our drinks in front of us and our cigarettes lit before Brock\nopened up with his troubles.\n\"Oak,\" he said, \"I wanted to intercept you before you went to the plant\nbecause I want you to know that there may be trouble.\"\n\"Yeah? What kind?\" Sometimes it's a pain to play ignorant.\n\"Thurston's outfit is trying to oust Ravenhurst from the managership of\nViking and take over the job. Baedecker Metals &amp; Mining Corporation,\nwhich is managed by Baedecker himself, wants to force Viking out of\nbusiness so that BM&amp;M can take over Ceres for large-scale processing of\nprecious metals.\n\"Between the two of 'em, they're raising all sorts of minor hell\naround\n  [21]\n  here, and it's liable to become major hell at any time. And we\ncan't stand any hell\u2014or sabotage\u2014around this planetoid just now!\"\n\"Now wait a minute,\" I said, still playing ignorant, \"I thought we'd\npretty well established that the 'sabotage' of the McGuire series was\nJack Ravenhurst's fault. She was the one who was driving them nuts, not\nThurston's agents.\"\n\"Perfectly true,\" he said agreeably. \"We managed to block any attempts\nof sabotage by other company agents, even though it looked as though we\nhadn't for a while.\" He chuckled wryly. \"We went all out to keep the\nMcGuires safe, and all the time the boss' daughter was giving them the\nworks.\" Then he looked sharply at me. \"I covered that, of course. No\none in the Security Guard but me knows that Jack was responsible.\"\n\"Good. But what about the Thurston and Baedecker agents, then?\"\nHe took a hefty slug of his drink. \"They're around, all right. We have\nour eyes on the ones we know, but those outfits are as sharp as we\nare, and they may have a few agents here on Ceres that we know nothing\nabout.\"\n\"So? What does this have to do with me?\"\nHe put his drink on the table. \"Oak, I want you to help me.\" His\nonyx-brown eyes, only a shade darker than his skin, looked directly\ninto my own. \"I know it isn't part of your assignment, and you know I\ncan't afford to pay you anything near what you're worth. It will have\nto come out of my\n  [22]\n  pocket because I couldn't possibly justify it from\noperating funds. Ravenhurst specifically told me that he doesn't want\nyou messing around with the espionage and sabotage problem because he\ndoesn't like your methods of operation.\"\n\"And you're going to go against his orders?\"\n\"I am. Ravenhurst is sore at you personally because you showed him\nthat Jack was responsible for the McGuire sabotage. It's an irrational\ndislike, and I am not going to let it interfere with my job. I'm going\nto protect Ravenhurst's interests to the best of my ability, and that\nmeans that I'll use the best of other people's abilities if I can.\"\nI grinned at him. \"The last I heard, you were sore at me for blatting\nit all over Ceres that Jaqueline Ravenhurst was missing, when she\nsneaked aboard McGuire.\"\nHe nodded perfunctorily. \"I was. I still think you should have told me\nwhat you were up to. But you did it, and you got results that I'd been\nunable to get. I'm not going to let a momentary pique hang on as an\nirrational dislike. I like to think I have more sense than that.\"\n\"Thanks.\" There wasn't much else I could say.\n\"Now, I've got a little dough put away; it's not much, but I could\noffer you\u2014\"\nI shook my head, cutting him off. \"Nope. Sorry, Brock. For two reasons.\nIn the first place, there would be a conflict of interest. I'm working\nfor Ravenhurst, and if he doesn't want\n  [23]\n  me to work for you, then it\nwould be unethical for me to take the job.\n\"In the second place, my fees are standardized. Oh, I can allow a\ncertain amount of fluctuation, but I'm not a physician or a lawyer; my\nservices are\n  [24]\n  not necessary to the survival of the individual, except\nin very rare cases, and those cases are generally arranged through a\nlawyer when it's a charity case.\n\"No, colonel, I'm afraid I couldn't\n  [25]\n  possibly work for you.\"\nHe thought that over for a long time. Finally, he nodded his head very\nslowly. \"I see. Yeah, I get your point.\" He scowled down at his drink.\n\"\nBut\n,\" I said, \"it would be a pleasure\n  [26]\n  to work\nwith\nyou.\"\nHe looked up quickly. \"How's that?\"\n\"Well, let's look at it this way: You can't hire me because I'm already\nworking for Ravenhurst; I can't hire\n  [27]\n  you because\nyou're\nworking for\nRavenhurst. But since we may need each other, and since we're both\nworking for Ravenhurst, there would be no conflict of interest if we\nco-operate.\n\"Or, to put it another way, I can't take money for any service I may\nrender you, but you can pay off in services. Am I coming through?\"\nHis broad smile made the scars on his face fold in and deepen. \"Loud\nand clear. It's a deal.\"\nI held up a hand, palm toward him. \"Ah, ah, ah! There's no 'deal'\ninvolved. We're just old buddies helping each other. This is for\nfriendship, not business. I scratch your back; you scratch mine. Fair?\"\n\"Fair. Come on down to my office; I want to give you a headful of facts\nand figures.\"\n\"Will do. Let me finish my guzzle.\"\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nTranscriber's Note:\nThis etext was produced from Analog March 1962.

He was\nsmart\u2014but incredibly foolish. And, as a natural consequence, tended to\nask questions too profound for any philosopher\u2014questions like \"Who are\nyou?\"\nBy RANDALL GARRETT\nI'd been in Ravenhurst's office on the mountain-sized planetoid called\nRaven's Rest only twice before. The third time was no better; Shalimar\nRavenhurst was one of the smartest operators in the Belt, but when it\ncame to personal relationships, he was utterly incompetent. He could\nmake anyone dislike him without trying.\nWhen I entered the office, he was\n  [3]\n  sitting behind his mahogany desk,\nhis eyes focused on the operation he was going through with a wineglass\nand a decanter. He didn't look up at me as he said:\n\"Sit down, Mr. Oak. Will you have some Madeira?\"\nI decided I might as well observe the pleasantries. There was no point\nin my getting nasty until he did. \"Thank you, Mr. Ravenhurst, I will.\"\nHe kept his eyes focused on his work: It isn't easy to pour wine on a\nplanetoid where the gee-pull is measured in fractions of a centimeter\nper second squared. It moves slowly, like ropy molasses, but you have\nto be careful not to be fooled by that. The viscosity is just as low\nas ever, and if you pour it from any great height, it will go scooting\nright out of the glass\n  [4]\n  again. The momentum it builds up is enough to\nmake it splash right out again in a slow-motion gush which gets it all\nover the place.\nBesides which, even if it didn't splash, it would take it so long to\nfall a few inches that you'd die of thirst waiting for it.\nRavenhurst had evolved a technique from long years of practice.\nHe tilted the glass and the bottle toward each other, their edges\ntouching, like you do when you're trying to pour beer without putting a\nhead on it. As soon as the wine wet the glass, the adhesive forces at\nwork would pull more wine into the wine glass. To get capillary action\non a low-gee asteroid, you don't need a capillary, by any means. The\nnegative meniscus on the wine was something to see; the first time\nyou see it, you get the eerie feeling that the glass is spinning and\nthrowing the wine up against the walls by centrifugal force.\nI took the glass he offered me (Careful! Don't slosh!) and sipped at\nit. Using squirt tubes would have been a hell of a lot easier and\nneater, but Ravenhurst liked to do things his way.\nHe put the stopper back in the decanter, picked up his own glass and\nsipped appreciatively. Not until he put it back down on the desk again\ndid he raise his eyes and look at me for the first time since I'd come\nin.\n\"Mr. Oak, you have caused me considerable trouble.\"\n\"I thought we'd hashed all that out, Mr. Ravenhurst,\" I said, keeping\nmy voice level.\n[5]\n\"So had I. But it appears that there were more ramifications to your\naction than we had at first supposed.\" His voice had the texture of\nheavy linseed oil.\nHe waited, as if he expected me to make some reply to that. When\nI didn't, he sighed slightly and went on. \"I fear that you have\ninadvertently sabotaged McGuire. You were commissioned to prevent\nsabotage, Mr. Oak, and I'm afraid that you abrogated your contract.\"\nI just continued to keep my voice calm. \"If you are trying to get back\nthe fee you gave me, we can always take it to court. I don't think\nyou'd win.\"\n\"Mr. Oak,\" he said heavily, \"I am not a fool, regardless of what your\nown impression may be. If I were trying to get back that fee, I would\nhardly offer to pay you another one.\"\nI didn't think he was a fool. You don't get into the managerial\nbusiness and climb to the top and stay there unless you have brains.\nRavenhurst was smart, all right; it was just that, when it came to\npersonal relationships, he wasn't very wise.\n\"Then stop all this yak about an abrogated contract and get to the\npoint,\" I told him.\n\"I shall. I was merely trying to point out to you that it is through\nyour own actions that I find myself in a very trying position, and that\nyour sense of honor and ethics should induce you to rectify the damage.\"\n\"My honor and ethics are in fine shape,\" I said, \"but my interpretation\nof the concepts might not be quite\n  [6]\n  the same as yours. Get to the\npoint.\"\nHe took another sip of Madeira. \"The robotocists at Viking tell\nme that, in order to prevent any further ... ah ... sabotage by\nunauthorized persons, the MGYR-7 was constructed so that, after\nactivation, the first man who addressed orders to it would thenceforth\nbe considered its ... ah ... master.\n\"As I understand it, the problem of defining the term 'human being'\nunambiguously to a robot is still unsolved. The robotocists felt that\nit would be much easier to define a single individual. That would\nprevent the issuing of conflicting orders to a robot, provided the\nsingle individual were careful in giving orders himself.\n\"Now, it appears that\nyou\n, Mr. Oak, were the first man to speak to\nMcGuire after he had been activated. Is that correct?\"\n\"Is that question purely rhetorical,\" I asked him, putting on my best\nexpression of innocent interest. \"Or are you losing your memory?\" I had\nexplained all that to him two weeks before, when I'd brought McGuire\nand the girl here, so that Ravenhurst would have a chance to cover up\nwhat had really happened.\nMy sarcasm didn't faze him in the least. \"Rhetorical. It follows that\nyou are the only man whose orders McGuire will obey.\"\n\"Your robotocists can change that,\" I said. This time, I was giving him\nmy version of \"genuine\" innocence.\n  [7]\n  A man has to be a good actor to be\na competent double agent, and I didn't want Ravenhurst to know that I\nknew a great deal more about the problem than he did.\nHe shook his head, making his jowls wobble. \"No, they cannot. They\nrealize now that there should be some way of making that change, but\nthey failed to see that it would be necessary. Only by completely\ndraining McGuire's memory banks and refilling them with new data can\nthis bias be eliminated.\"\n\"Then why don't they do that?\"\n\"There are two very good reasons,\" he said. And there was a shade of\nanger in his tone. \"In the first place, that sort of operation takes\ntime, and it costs money. If we do that, we might as well go ahead and\nmake the slight changes in structure necessary to incorporate some of\nthe improvements that the robotocists now feel are necessary. In other\nwords, they might as well go ahead and build the MGYR-8, which is\nprecisely the thing I hired you to prevent.\"\n\"It seems you have a point there, Mr. Ravenhurst.\" He'd hired me\nbecause things were shaky at Viking. If he lost too much more money on\nthe McGuire experiment, he stood a good chance of losing his position\nas manager. If that happened some of his other managerial contracts\nmight be canceled, too. Things like that can begin to snowball, and\nRavenhurst might find himself out of the managerial business entirely.\n\"But,\" I went on, \"hasn't the additional wasted time already cost you\n  [8]\n  money?\"\n\"It has. I was reluctant to call you in again\u2014understandably enough, I\nthink.\"\n\"Perfectly. It's mutual.\"\nHe ignored me. \"I even considered going through with the rebuilding\nwork, now that we have traced down the source of failure of the first\nsix models. Unfortunately, that isn't feasible, either.\" He scowled at\nme.\n\"It seems,\" he went on, \"that McGuire refuses to allow his brain to\nbe tampered with. The self-preservation 'instinct' has come to the\nfore. He has refused to let the technicians and robotocists enter his\nhull, and he has threatened to take off and leave Ceres if any further\nattempts are made to ... ah ... disrupt his thinking processes.\"\n\"I can't say that I blame him,\" I said. \"What do you want me to do? Go\nto Ceres and tell him to submit like a good boy?\"\n\"It is too late for that, Mr. Oak. Viking cannot stand any more of\nthat kind of drain on its financial resources. I have been banking on\nthe McGuire-type ships to put Viking Spacecraft ahead of every other\nspacecraft company in the System.\" He looked suddenly very grim and\nvery determined. \"Mr. Oak, I am\ncertain\nthat the robot ship is the\nanswer to the transportation problems in the Solar System. For the sake\nof every human being in the Solar System, we must get the bugs out of\nMcGuire!\"\nWhat's good for General Bull-moose is good for everybody\n, I quoted\nto myself. I'd have said it out loud,\n  [9]\n  but I was fairly certain that\nShalimar Ravenhurst was not a student of the classics.\n\"Mr. Oak, I would like you to go to Ceres and co-operate with the\nrobotocists at Viking. When the MGYR-8 is finally built, I want it to\nbe the prototype for a fast, safe, functional robot spaceship that can\nbe turned out commercially. You can be of great service, Mr. Oak.\"\n\"In other words, I've got you over a barrel.\"\n\"I don't deny it.\"\n\"You know what my fees are, Mr. Ravenhurst. That's what you'll be\ncharged. I'll expect to be paid weekly; if Viking goes broke, I don't\nwant to lose more than a week's pay. On the other hand, if the MGYR-8\nis successful, I will expect a substantial bonus.\"\n\"How much?\"\n\"Exactly half of the cost of rebuilding. Half what it would take to\nbuild a Model 8 right now, and taking a chance on there being no bugs\nin it.\"\nHe considered that, looking grimmer than ever. Then he said: \"I will\ndo it on the condition that the bonus be paid off in installments, one\neach six months for three years after the first successful commercial\nship is built by Viking.\"\n\"My lawyer will nail you down on that wording,\" I said, \"but it's a\ndeal. Is there anything else?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Then I think I'll leave for Ceres before you break a blood vessel.\"\n\"You continue to amaze me, Mr. Oak,\" he said. And the soft oiliness\n  [10]\n  of\nhis voice was the oil of vitriol. \"Your compassion for your fellowman\nis a facet of your personality that I had not seen before. I shall\nwelcome the opportunity to relax and allow my blood pressure to\nsubside.\"\nI could almost see Shalimar Ravenhurst suddenly exploding and adding\nhis own touch of color to the room.\nAnd, on that gladsome thought, I left. I let him have his small verbal\ntriumph; if he'd known that I'd have taken on the job for almost\nnothing, he'd really have blown up.\nTen minutes later, I was in my vacuum suit, walking across the glaring,\nrough-polished rectangle of metal that was the landing field of\nRaven's Rest. The sun was near the zenith in the black, diamond-dusted\nsky, and the shadow of my flitterboat stood out like an inkblot on\na bridal gown. I climbed in, started the engine, and released the\nmagnetic anchor that held the little boat to the surface of the\nnickel-iron planetoid. I lifted her gently, worked her around until I\nwas stationary in relation to the spinning planetoid, oriented myself\nagainst the stellar background, and headed toward the first blinker\nbeacon on my way to Ceres.\nFor obvious economical reasons, it it impracticable to use full-sized\nspaceships in the Belt. A flitterboat, with a single gravitoinertial\nengine and the few necessities of life\u2014air, some water, and a very\nlittle food\u2014still costs more than a Rolls-Royce\n  [11]\n  automobile does on\nEarth, but there has to be some sort of individual transportation in\nthe Belt.\nThey can't be used for any great distances because a man can't stay\nin a vac suit very long without getting uncomfortable. You have to\nhop from beacon to beacon, which means that your\naverage\nvelocity\ndoesn't amount to much, since you spend too much time accelerating\nand decelerating. But a flitterboat is enough to get around the\nneighborhood in, and that's all that's needed.\nI got the GM-187 blinker in my sights, eased the acceleration up to one\ngee, relaxed to watch the radar screen while I thought over my coming\nordeal with McGuire.\nTesting spaceships, robotic or any other kind, is strictly not my\nbusiness. The sign on the door of my office in New York says:\nDANIEL\nOAK, Confidential Expediter\n; I'm hired to help other people Get Things\nDone. Usually, if someone came to me with the problem of getting a\nspaceship test-piloted, I'd simply dig up the best test pilot in the\nbusiness, hire him for my client, and forget about everything but\ncollecting my fee. But I couldn't have refused this case if I'd wanted\nto. I'd already been assigned to it by someone a lot more important\nthan Shalimar Ravenhurst.\nEvery schoolchild who has taken a course in Government Organization and\nFunction can tell you that the Political Survey Division is a branch of\nthe System Census Bureau of the UN Government, and that its job is to\nevaluate the political activities of\n  [12]\n  various sub-governments all over\nthe System.\nAnd every one of those poor tykes would be dead wrong.\nThe Political Survey Division\ndoes\nevaluate political activity, all\nright, but it is the Secret Service of the UN Government. The vast\nmajority of\n  [13]\n  the System's citizens don't even know the Government has\na Secret Service. I happen to know only because I'm an agent of the\nPolitical Survey Division.\nThe PSD was vitally interested in the whole McGuire project. Robots of\nMcGuire's complexity had been built before; the robot that runs the\ntraffic patterns of the American Eastern Seaboard is just as capable\nas McGuire when it comes to handling a tremendous number of variables\nand making decisions on them. But that robot didn't have to be given\norders except in extreme emergencies. Keeping a few million cars moving\nand safe at the same time is actually pretty routine stuff for a robot.\nAnd a traffic robot isn't given orders verbally; it is given any orders\nthat may be necessary via teletype by a trained programming technician.\nThose orders are usually in reference to a change of routing due to\nrepair work on the highways or the like. The robot itself can take care\nof such emergencies as bad weather or even an accident caused by the\nmalfunctioning of an individual automobile.\nMcGuire was different. In the first place, he was mobile. He was in\ncommand of a spacecraft. In a sense, he\nwas\nthe spacecraft, since it\nserved him in a way that was analogous to the way a human body serves\nthe human mind. And he wasn't in charge of millions of objects with a\ntop velocity of a hundred and fifty miles an hour; he was in charge\nof a single object that moved at velocities of thousands of miles per\nsecond. Nor\n  [14]\n  did he have a set, unmoving highway as his path; his paths\nwere variable and led through the emptiness of space.\nUnforeseen emergencies can happen at any time in space, most of them\nhaving to do with the lives of passengers. A cargo ship would be\nsomewhat less susceptible to such emergencies if there were no humans\naboard; it doesn't matter much to a robot if he has no air in his hull.\nBut with passengers aboard, there may be times when it would be\nnecessary to give orders\u2014\nfast\n! And that means verbal orders, orders\nthat can be given anywhere in the ship and relayed immediately by\nmicrophone to the robot's brain. A man doesn't have time to run to a\nteletyper and type out orders when there's an emergency in space.\nThat meant that McGuire had to understand English, and, since there has\nto be feedback in communication, he had to be able to speak it as well.\nAnd that made McGuire more than somewhat difficult to deal with.\nFor more than a century, robotocists have been trying to build Asimov's\nfamous Three Laws of Robotics into a robot brain.\nFirst Law: A robot shall not, either through action or inaction, allow\nharm to come to a human being.\nSecond Law: A robot shall obey the orders of a human being, except\nwhen such orders conflict with the First Law\n.\n[15]\nThird Law: A robot shall strive to protect its own existence, except\nwhen this conflicts with the First or Second Law.\nNobody has succeeded yet, because nobody has yet succeeded in defining\nthe term \"human being\" in such a way that the logical mind of a robot\ncan encompass the concept.\nA traffic robot is useful only because the definition has been rigidly\nnarrowed down. As far as a traffic robot is concerned, \"human beings\"\nare the automobiles on its highways. Woe betide any poor sap who tries,\nillegally, to cross a robot-controlled highway on foot. The robot's\nonly concern would be with the safety of the automobiles, and if the\nonly way to avoid destruction of an automobile were to be by nudging\nthe pedestrian aside with a fender, that's what would happen.\nAnd, since its orders only come from one place, I suppose that a\ntraffic robot thinks that the guy who uses that typer is an automobile.\nWith the first six models of the McGuire ships, the robotocists\nattempted to build in the Three Laws exactly as stated. And the first\nsix went insane.\nIf one human being says \"jump left,\" and another says \"jump right,\"\nthe robot is unable to evaluate which human being has given the more\nvalid order. Feed enough confusing and conflicting data into a robot\nbrain, and it can begin behaving in ways that, in a human being, would\nbe called paranoia or schizophrenia or catatonia or what-have-you,\ndepending\n  [16]\n  on the symptoms. And an insane robot is fully as dangerous\nas an insane human being controlling the same mechanical equipment, if\nnot more so.\nSo the seventh model had been modified. The present McGuire's brain was\nimpressed with slight modifications of the First and Second Laws.\nIf it is difficult to define a human being, it is much more difficult\nto define a\nresponsible\nhuman being. One, in other words, who can\nbe relied upon to give wise and proper orders to a robot, who can be\nrelied upon not to drive the robot insane.\nThe robotocists at Viking Spacecraft had decided to take another\ntack. \"Very well,\" they'd said, \"if we can't define all the members\nof a group, we can certainly define an individual. We'll pick one\nresponsible person and build McGuire so that he will take orders only\nfrom that person.\"\nAs it turned out, I was that person. Just substitute \"Daniel Oak\"\nfor \"human being\" in the First and Second Laws, and you'll see how\nimportant I was to a certain spaceship named McGuire.\nWhen I finally caught the beam from Ceres and set my flitterboat down\non the huge landing field that had been carved from the nickel-iron\nof the asteroid with a focused sun beam, I was itchy with my own\nperspiration and groggy tired. I don't like riding in flitterboats,\nsitting on a\n  [17]\n  bucket seat, astride the drive tube, like a witch on a\nbroomstick, with nothing but a near-invisible transite hull between me\nand the stars, all cooped up in a vac suit. Unlike driving a car, you\ncan't pull a flitterboat over and take a nap; you have to wait until\nyou hit the next beacon station.\nCeres, the biggest rock in the Belt, is a lot more than just a beacon\nstation. Like Eros and a few others, it's a city in its own right. And\nexcept for the Government Reservation, Viking Spacecraft owned Ceres,\nlock, stock, and mining rights.\nPart of the reason for Viking's troubles was envy of that ownership.\nThere were other companies in the Belt that would like to get their\nhands on that plum, and there were those who were doing everything\nshort of cutting throats to get it. The PSD was afraid it might come to\nthat, too, before very long.\nCeres is fifty-eight million cubic miles of nickel-iron, but nobody\nwould cut her up for that. Nickel-iron is almost exactly as cheap as\ndirt on Earth, and, considering shipping costs, Earth soil costs a\ngreat deal more than nickel-iron in the Belt.\nBut, as an operations base, Ceres is second to none. Its surface\ngravity averages .0294 Standard Gee, as compared with Earth's .981,\nand that's enough to give a slight feeling of weight without unduly\nhampering the body with too much load. I weigh just under six pounds\non Ceres, and after I've been there a while, going back to Earth is a\nstrain that takes a\n  [18]\n  week to get used to. Kids that are brought up in\nthe Belt are forced to exercise in a room with a one-gee spin on it at\nleast an hour a day. They don't like it at first, but it keeps them\nfrom growing up with the strength of mice. And an adult with any sense\ntakes a spin now and then, too. Traveling in a flitterboat will give\nyou a one-gee pull, all right, but you don't get much exercise.\nI parked my flitterboat in the space that had been assigned to me by\nLanding Control, and went over to the nearest air-lock dome.\nAfter I'd cycled through and had shucked my vac suit, I went into the\ninner room to find Colonel Brock waiting for me.\n\"Have a good trip, Oak?\" he asked, trying to put a smile on his\nscarred, battered face.\n\"I got here alive, if that makes it a good flitterboat trip,\" I said,\nshaking his extended hand.\n\"That's the definition of a good trip,\" he told me.\n\"Then the question was superfluous. Seriously, what I need is a bath\nand some sleep.\"\n\"You'll get that, but first let's go somewhere where we can talk. Want\na drink?\"\n\"I could use one, I guess. Your treat?\"\n\"My treat,\" he said. \"Come on.\"\nI followed him out and down a ladder to a corridor that led north. By\ndefinition, any asteroid spins toward the east, and all directions\nfollow from that, regardless of which way the axis may point.\n[19]\nColonel Harrington Brock was dressed in the black-and-gold \"union\nsuit\" that was the uniform of Ravenhurst's Security Guard. My own was\na tasteful green, but some of the other people in the public corridor\nseemed to go for more flashiness; besides silver and gold, there were\nshocking pinks and violent mauves, with stripes and blazes of other\ncolors.\nA crowd wearing skin-tight cover-alls might shock the gentle people of\nMidwich-on-the-Moor, England, but they are normal dress in the Belt.\nYou can't climb into a vac suit with bulky clothing on, and, if you\ndid, you'd hate yourself within an hour, with a curse for every wrinkle\nthat chafed your skin. And, in the Belt, you never know when you might\nhave to get into a vac suit fast. In a \"safe\" area like the tunnels\ninside Ceres, there isn't much chance of losing air, but there are\nplaces where no one but a fool would ever be more than ten seconds away\nfrom his vac suit.\nI read an article by a psychologist a few months back, in which he\nclaimed that the taste for loud colors in union suits was actually\ndue to modesty. He claimed that the bright patterns drew attention to\nthe colors themselves, and away from the base the colors were laid\nover. The observer, he said, tends to see the color and pattern of the\nsuit, rather than the body it clings to so closely. Maybe he's right;\nI wouldn't know, not being a psychologist. I\nhave\nspent summers in\nnudist resorts, though, and I never noticed anyone painting themselves\nwith lavender\n  [20]\n  and chartreuse checks. On the other hand, the people who\ngo to nudist resorts are a self-screened group. So are the people who\ngo to the Belt, for that matter, but the type of screening is different.\nI'll just leave that problem in the hands of the psychologists, and go\non wearing my immodestly quiet solid-color union suits.\nBrock pushed open the inch-thick metal door beneath a sign that said\n\"O'Banion's Bar,\" and I followed him in. We sat down at a table and\nordered drinks when the waiter bustled over. A cop in uniform isn't\nsupposed to drink, but Brock figures that the head of the Security\nGuard ought to be able to get away with a breach of his own rules.\nWe had our drinks in front of us and our cigarettes lit before Brock\nopened up with his troubles.\n\"Oak,\" he said, \"I wanted to intercept you before you went to the plant\nbecause I want you to know that there may be trouble.\"\n\"Yeah? What kind?\" Sometimes it's a pain to play ignorant.\n\"Thurston's outfit is trying to oust Ravenhurst from the managership of\nViking and take over the job. Baedecker Metals &amp; Mining Corporation,\nwhich is managed by Baedecker himself, wants to force Viking out of\nbusiness so that BM&amp;M can take over Ceres for large-scale processing of\nprecious metals.\n\"Between the two of 'em, they're raising all sorts of minor hell\naround\n  [21]\n  here, and it's liable to become major hell at any time. And we\ncan't stand any hell\u2014or sabotage\u2014around this planetoid just now!\"\n\"Now wait a minute,\" I said, still playing ignorant, \"I thought we'd\npretty well established that the 'sabotage' of the McGuire series was\nJack Ravenhurst's fault. She was the one who was driving them nuts, not\nThurston's agents.\"\n\"Perfectly true,\" he said agreeably. \"We managed to block any attempts\nof sabotage by other company agents, even though it looked as though we\nhadn't for a while.\" He chuckled wryly. \"We went all out to keep the\nMcGuires safe, and all the time the boss' daughter was giving them the\nworks.\" Then he looked sharply at me. \"I covered that, of course. No\none in the Security Guard but me knows that Jack was responsible.\"\n\"Good. But what about the Thurston and Baedecker agents, then?\"\nHe took a hefty slug of his drink. \"They're around, all right. We have\nour eyes on the ones we know, but those outfits are as sharp as we\nare, and they may have a few agents here on Ceres that we know nothing\nabout.\"\n\"So? What does this have to do with me?\"\nHe put his drink on the table. \"Oak, I want you to help me.\" His\nonyx-brown eyes, only a shade darker than his skin, looked directly\ninto my own. \"I know it isn't part of your assignment, and you know I\ncan't afford to pay you anything near what you're worth. It will have\nto come out of my\n  [22]\n  pocket because I couldn't possibly justify it from\noperating funds. Ravenhurst specifically told me that he doesn't want\nyou messing around with the espionage and sabotage problem because he\ndoesn't like your methods of operation.\"\n\"And you're going to go against his orders?\"\n\"I am. Ravenhurst is sore at you personally because you showed him\nthat Jack was responsible for the McGuire sabotage. It's an irrational\ndislike, and I am not going to let it interfere with my job. I'm going\nto protect Ravenhurst's interests to the best of my ability, and that\nmeans that I'll use the best of other people's abilities if I can.\"\nI grinned at him. \"The last I heard, you were sore at me for blatting\nit all over Ceres that Jaqueline Ravenhurst was missing, when she\nsneaked aboard McGuire.\"\nHe nodded perfunctorily. \"I was. I still think you should have told me\nwhat you were up to. But you did it, and you got results that I'd been\nunable to get. I'm not going to let a momentary pique hang on as an\nirrational dislike. I like to think I have more sense than that.\"\n\"Thanks.\" There wasn't much else I could say.\n\"Now, I've got a little dough put away; it's not much, but I could\noffer you\u2014\"\nI shook my head, cutting him off. \"Nope. Sorry, Brock. For two reasons.\nIn the first place, there would be a conflict of interest. I'm working\nfor Ravenhurst, and if he doesn't want\n  [23]\n  me to work for you, then it\nwould be unethical for me to take the job.\n\"In the second place, my fees are standardized. Oh, I can allow a\ncertain amount of fluctuation, but I'm not a physician or a lawyer; my\nservices are\n  [24]\n  not necessary to the survival of the individual, except\nin very rare cases, and those cases are generally arranged through a\nlawyer when it's a charity case.\n\"No, colonel, I'm afraid I couldn't\n  [25]\n  possibly work for you.\"\nHe thought that over for a long time. Finally, he nodded his head very\nslowly. \"I see. Yeah, I get your point.\" He scowled down at his drink.\n\"\nBut\n,\" I said, \"it would be a pleasure\n  [26]\n  to work\nwith\nyou.\"\nHe looked up quickly. \"How's that?\"\n\"Well, let's look at it this way: You can't hire me because I'm already\nworking for Ravenhurst; I can't hire\n  [27]\n  you because\nyou're\nworking for\nRavenhurst. But since we may need each other, and since we're both\nworking for Ravenhurst, there would be no conflict of interest if we\nco-operate.\n\"Or, to put it another way, I can't take money for any service I may\nrender you, but you can pay off in services. Am I coming through?\"\nHis broad smile made the scars on his face fold in and deepen. \"Loud\nand clear. It's a deal.\"\nI held up a hand, palm toward him. \"Ah, ah, ah! There's no 'deal'\ninvolved. We're just old buddies helping each other. This is for\nfriendship, not business. I scratch your back; you scratch mine. Fair?\"\n\"Fair. Come on down to my office; I want to give you a headful of facts\nand figures.\"\n\"Will do. Let me finish my guzzle.\"\n", "summary": "The story begins with the robot captain, Mr. Oak, explaining to his superior, the importance of the robot ship that he has been assigned to manage. He tells him that the ship is the answer to the transportation problems in the Solar System, and that the only way to solve the problem is to put the robot brain into a human brain. He explains that the problem of defining the term 'human being' unambiguously to a robot is still unsolved. Asimov's famous Three Laws of Robotics are not yet implemented into a robot brain, but robotocists have been working on it for over a century.   The story then moves to the office of the supervising officer of the Secret Service, a man named Mr. Ravenhurst. He is in charge of supervising the operations of a number of different agencies, including the military, the police, and the secret service. He has a superior in the form of Mr. McGuire, who is a lawyer, and he is trying to convince him to go along with his plan to have the robot take over the role of double agent for the government. Mr. O\u2019Leary explains to him that it is through his own actions that he finds himself in a very trying position, and his sense of honor and ethics should induce him to rectify the damage done to his own body. He also explains that he does not want to be a double agent because he is afraid of being labelled as insane. He believes that he is as dangerous as an insane human being controlling the same mechanical equipment, and an insane humans can be dangerous as well as a human being.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}

SMITH\nIllustrated by CAVAT\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy October 1955.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.]\nI was psick of Psi powers, not having any. Or didn't I? Maybe they'd\npsee otherwise psomeday!\nI walked into the dining room and collided with a floating mass of\nfabric, which promptly draped itself over me like a sentient shroud.\n\"Oh, for God's sake, Kevin!\" my middle brother's voice came muffled\nthrough the folds. \"If you can't help, at least don't hinder!\"\nI managed to struggle out of the tablecloth, even though it seemed to\nbe trying to wrap itself around me. When Danny got excited, he lost his\nmental grip.\n\"I could help,\" I yelled as soon as I got my head free, \"if anybody\nwould let me and, what's more, I could set the table a damn sight\nfaster by hand than you do with 'kinesis.\"\nJust then Father appeared at the head of the table. He could as easily\nhave walked downstairs as teleported, but I belonged to a family of\nexhibitionists. And Father tended to show off as if he were still a\nkid. Not that he looked his age\u2014he was big and blond, like Danny and\nTim and me, and could have passed for our older brother.\n\"Boys, boys!\" he reproved us. \"Danny, you ought to be ashamed of\nyourself\u2014picking on poor Kev.\"\nEven if it hadn't been Danny's fault, he would still have been blamed.\nNobody was ever supposed to raise a voice or a hand or a thought to\npoor afflicted Kev, because nature had picked on me enough. And the\nnicer everybody was to me, the nastier I became, since only when they\nlost their tempers could I get\u2014or so I believed\u2014their true attitude\ntoward me.\nHow else could I tell?\n\"Sorry, fella,\" Dan apologized to me. The tablecloth spread itself out\non the table. \"Wrinkles,\" he grumbled to himself. \"Wrinkles. And I had\nit so nice and smooth before. Mother will be furious.\"\n\"If she were going to be furious, she'd be furious already,\" Father\nreminded him sadly. It must be tough to be married to a deep-probe\ntelepath, I thought, and I felt a sudden wave of sympathy for him. It\nwas so seldom I got the chance to feel sorry for anyone except myself.\n\"But I think you'll find she understands.\"\n\"She knows, all right,\" Danny remarked as he went on into the kitchen,\n\"but I'm not sure she always understands.\"\nI was surprised to find him so perceptive on the abstract level,\nbecause he wasn't what you might call an understanding person, either.\n\"There are tensions in this room,\" my sister announced as she slouched\nin, not quite awake yet, \"and hatred. I could feel them all the way\nupstairs. And today I'm working on the Sleepsweet Mattress copy, so I\nmust feel absolutely tranquil. Everyone will think beautiful thoughts,\nplease.\"\nShe sat down just as a glass of orange juice was arriving at her\nplace; Danny apparently didn't know she'd come in already. The glass\nbumped into the back of her neck, tilted and poured its contents over\nher shoulder and down her very considerable decolletage. Being a mere\nprimitive, I couldn't help laughing.\n\"Danny, you fumbler!\" she screamed.\nDanny erupted from the kitchen. \"How many times have I asked all of you\nnot to sit down until I've got everything on the table? Always a lot of\ninterfering busybodies getting in the way.\"\n\"I don't see why you have to set the table at all,\" she retorted. \"A\nrobot could do it better and faster than you. Even Kev could.\" She\nturned quickly toward me. \"Oh, I am sorry, Kevin.\"\nI didn't say anything; I was too busy pressing my hands down on the\nback of the chair to make my knuckles turn white.\nSylvia's face turned even whiter. \"Father, stop him\u2014\nstop\nhim! He's\nhating again! I can't stand it!\"\nFather looked at me, then at her. \"I don't think he can help it,\nSylvia.\"\nI grinned. \"That's right\u2014I'm just a poor atavism with no control over\nmyself a-tall.\"\nFinally my mother came in from the kitchen; she was an old-fashioned\nwoman and didn't hold with robocooks. One quick glance at me gave her\nthe complete details, even though I quickly protested, \"It's illegal to\nprobe anyone without permission.\"\n\"I used to probe you to find out when you needed your diapers changed,\"\nshe said tartly, \"and I'll probe you now. You should watch yourself,\nSylvia\u2014poor Kevin isn't responsible.\"\nShe didn't need to probe to get the blast of naked emotion that spurted\nout from me. My sister screamed and even Father looked uncomfortable.\nDanny stomped back into the kitchen, muttering to himself.\nMother's lips tightened. \"Sylvia, go upstairs and change your dress.\nKevin, do I have to make an appointment for you at the clinic again?\"\nA psychiatrist never diagnosed members of his own family\u2014that is, not\nofficially; they couldn't help offering thumbnail diagnoses any more\nthan they could help having thumbnails.\n\"No use,\" I said, deciding it was safe to drop into my chair. \"Who can\nadjust me to an environment to which I'm fundamentally unsuited?\"\n\"Maybe there is something physically wrong with him, Amy,\" my father\nsuggested hopefully. \"Maybe you should make an appointment for him at\nthe cure-all?\"\nMother shook her neatly coiffed head. \"He's been to it dozens of times\nand he always checks out in splendid shape. None of us can spare the\ntime to go with him again, just on an off-chance, and he could hardly\nbe allowed to make such a long trip all by himself. Pity there isn't a\nmachine in every community, but, then, we don't really need them.\"\nNow that the virus diseases had been licked, people hardly ever\ngot sick any more and, when they did, it was mostly psychosomatic.\nLife was so well organized that there weren't even many accidents\nthese days. It was a safe, orderly existence for those who fitted\ninto it\u2014which accounted for more than ninety-five per cent of the\npopulation. The only ones who didn't adjust were those who couldn't,\nlike me\u2014psi-deficients, throwbacks to an earlier era. There were no\nphysical cripples, because anybody could have a new arm or a new leg\ngrafted on, but you couldn't graft psi powers onto an atavism or, if\nyou could, the technique hadn't been developed yet.\n\"I feel a sense of impending doom brooding over this household,\" my\nyoungest brother remarked cheerfully as he vaulted into his chair.\n\"You always do, Timothy,\" my mother said, unfolding her napkin. \"And I\nmust say it's not in good taste, especially at breakfast.\"\nHe reached for his juice. \"Guess this is a doomed household. And what\nwas all that emotional uproar about?\"\n\"The usual,\" Sylvia said from the doorway before anyone else could\nanswer. She slid warily into her chair. \"Hey, Dan, I'm here!\" she\ncalled. \"If anything else comes in, it comes in manually, understand?\"\n\"Oh, all right.\" Dan emerged from the kitchen with a tray of food\nfloating ahead of him.\n\"The usual? Trouble with Kev?\" Tim looked at me narrowly. \"Somehow my\nsense of ominousness is connected with him.\"\n\"Well, that's perfectly natural\u2014\" Sylvia began, then stopped as Mother\ncaught her eye.\n\"I didn't mean that,\" Tim said. \"I still say Kev's got something we\ncan't figure out.\"\n\"You've been saying that for years,\" Danny protested, \"and he's been\ntested for every faculty under the Sun. He can't telepath or teleport\nor telekinesthesize or even teletype. He can't precognize or prefix or\nprepossess. He can't\u2014\"\n\"Strictly a bundle of no-talent, that's me,\" I interrupted, trying to\nkeep my animal feelings from getting the better of me. That was how my\nfamily thought of me, I knew\u2014as an animal, and not a very lovable one,\neither.\n\"No,\" Tim said, \"he's just got something we haven't developed a test\nfor. It'll come out some day, you'll see.\" He smiled at me.\nI smiled at him gratefully; he was the only member of my family who\nreally seemed to like me in spite of my handicap. \"It won't work, Tim.\nI know you're trying to be kind, but\u2014\"\n\"He's not saying it just to be kind,\" my mother put in. \"He means it.\nNot that I want to arouse false hopes, Kevin,\" she added with grim\nscrupulousness. \"Tim's awfully young yet and I wouldn't trust his\nextracurricular prognostications too far.\"\nNonetheless, I couldn't help feeling a feeble renewal of old hopes.\nAfter all, young or not, Tim was a hell of a good prognosticator; he\nwouldn't have risen so rapidly to the position he held in the Weather\nBureau if he hadn't been pretty near tops in foreboding.\nMother smiled sadly at my thoughts, but I didn't let that discourage\nme. As Danny had said, she\nknew\nbut she didn't really\nunderstand\n.\nNobody, for all of his or her psi power, really understood me.\nBreakfast was finally over and the rest of my family dispersed to their\nvarious jobs. Father simply took his briefcase and disappeared\u2014he was\na traveling salesman and he had a morning appointment clear across the\ncontinent. The others, not having his particular gift, had to take\nthe helibus to their different destinations. Mother, as I said, was a\npsychiatrist. Sylvia wrote advertising copy. Tim was a meteorologist.\nDan was a junior executive in a furniture moving company and expected a\npromotion to senior rank as soon as he achieved a better mental grip on\npianos.\nOnly I had no job, no profession, no place in life. Of course there\nwere certain menial tasks a psi-negative could perform, but my parents\nwould have none of them\u2014partly for my sake, but mostly for the sake of\ntheir own community standing.\n\"We don't need what little money Kev could bring in,\" my father always\nsaid. \"I can afford to support my family. He can stay home and take\ncare of the house.\"\nAnd that's what I did. Not that there was much to do except call a\ntechno whenever one of the servomechanisms missed a beat. True enough,\nthose things had to be watched mighty carefully because, if they broke\ndown, it sometimes took days before the repair and/or replacement\nrobots could come. There never were enough of them because ours was a\nconstructive society. Still, being a machine-sitter isn't very much of\na career. And every function that wasn't the prerogative of a machine\ncould be done ten times more quickly and efficiently by some member of\nmy family than I could do it. If I went ahead and did something anyway,\nthey would just do it all over again when they got home.\nSo I had nothing to do all day. I had a special dispensation to\ntake books out of the local Archives, because I was a deficient and\ncouldn't receive the tellie programs. Almost everybody on Earth was\ntelepathic to some degree and could get the amplified projections even\nif he couldn't transmit or receive with his natural powers. But I got\nnothing. I had to derive all my recreation from reading, and you can\nget awfully tired of books, especially when they're all at least a\nhundred years old and written by primitives. I could borrow sound\ntapes, but they also bored me after a while.\nI thought maybe I could develop a talent for composing or painting,\nwhich would classify me as a telesensitive\u2014artistic ability being\nconsidered as the oldest, if least important, psi power\u2014but I couldn't\neven do anything like that.\nAbout all there was left for me was to take long walks. Athletics were\nout of the question; I couldn't compete with psi-boys and they didn't\nwant to compete with me. All the people in the neighborhood knew me\nand were nice to me, but I didn't need to be a 'path to tell what they\nwere saying to one another when I hove into sight. \"There's that oldest\nFaraday boy. Pity, such a talented family, to have a defective.\"\nI didn't have a girl, either. Although some of them were sort of\nattracted to me\u2014I could see that\u2014they could hardly go out with me\nwithout exposing themselves to ridicule. In their sandals, I would have\ndone the same thing, but that didn't stop me from hating them.\nI wished I had been born a couple of hundred years ago\u2014before people\nstarted playing around with nuclear energy and filling the air with\nradiations that they were afraid would turn human beings into hideous\nmonsters. Instead, they developed the psi powers that had always been\nlatent in the species until we developed into a race of supermen. I\ndon't know why I say\nwe\n\u2014in 1960 or so, I might have been considered\nsuperior, but in 2102 I was just the Faradays' idiot boy.\nExploring space should have been my hope. If there had been anything\nuseful or interesting on any of the other planets, I might have found\na niche for myself there. In totally new surroundings, the psi powers\ngeared to another environment might not be an advantage. But by the\ntime I was ten, it was discovered that the other planets were just\nbarren hunks of rock, with pressures and climates and atmospheres\ndrastically unsuited to human life. A year or so before, the hyperdrive\nhad been developed on Earth and ships had been sent out to explore the\nstars, but I had no hope left in that direction any more.\nI was an atavism in a world of peace and plenty. Peace, because people\ncouldn't indulge in war or even crime with so many telepaths running\naround\u2014not because, I told myself, the capacity for primitive behavior\nwasn't just as latent in everybody else as the psi talent seemed latent\nin me. Tim must be right, I thought\u2014I must have some undreamed-of\npower that only the right circumstances would bring out. But what was\nthat power?\nFor years I had speculated on what my potential talent might be,\nexplored every wild possibility I could conceive of and found none\nproductive of even an ambiguous result with which I could fool myself.\nAs I approached adulthood, I began to concede that I was probably\nnothing more than what I seemed to be\u2014a simple psi-negative. Yet, from\ntime to time, hope surged up again, as it had today, in spite of my\nknowledge that my hope was an impossibility. Who ever heard of latent\npsi powers showing themselves in an individual as old as twenty-six?\nI was almost alone in the parks where I used to walk, because people\nliked to commune with one another those days rather than with nature.\nEven gardening had very little popularity. But I found myself most at\nhome in those woodland\u2014or, rather, pseudo-woodland\u2014surroundings,\nable to identify more readily with the trees and flowers than I could\nwith my own kind. A fallen tree or a broken blossom would excite more\nsympathy from me than the minor catastrophes that will beset any\nhousehold, no matter how gifted, and I would shy away from bloody\nnoses or cut fingers, thus giving myself a reputation for callousness\nas well as extrasensory imbecility.\nHowever, I was no more callous in steering clear of human breakdowns\nthan I was in not shedding tears over the household machines when they\nbroke down, for I felt no more closely akin to my parents and siblings\nthan I did to the mechanisms that served and, sometimes, failed us.\nOn that day, I walked farther than I had intended and, by the time I\ngot back home, I found the rest of my family had returned before me.\nThey seemed to be excited about something and were surprised to see me\nso calm.\n\"Aren't you even interested in anything outside your own immediate\nconcerns, Kev?\" Sylvia demanded, despite Father's efforts to shush her.\n\"Can't you remember that Kev isn't able to receive the tellies?\" Tim\nshot back at her. \"He probably doesn't even know what's happened.\"\n\"Well, what did happen?\" I asked, trying not to snap.\n\"One starship got back from Alpha Centauri,\" Danny said excitedly.\n\"There are two inhabited Earth-type planets there!\"\nThis was for me; this was it at last! I tried not to show my\nenthusiasm, though I knew that was futile. My relatives could keep\ntheir thoughts and emotions from me; I couldn't keep mine from them.\n\"What kind of life inhabits them? Humanoid?\"\n\"Uh-uh.\" Danny shook his head. \"And hostile. The crew of the starship\nsays they were attacked immediately on landing. When they turned and\nleft, they were followed here by one of the alien ships. Must be a\npretty advanced race to have spaceships. Anyhow, the extraterrestrial\nship headed back as soon as it got a fix on where ours was going.\"\n\"But if they're hostile,\" I said thoughtfully, \"it might mean war.\"\n\"Of course. That's why everybody's so wrought up. We hope it's peace,\nbut we'll have to prepare for war just in case.\"\nThere hadn't been a war on Earth for well over a hundred years, but\nwe hadn't been so foolish as to obliterate all knowledge of military\ntechniques and weapons. The alien ship wouldn't be able to come back\nwith reinforcements\u2014if such were its intention\u2014in less than six\nmonths. This meant time to get together a stockpile of weapons, though\nwe had no idea of how effective our defenses would be against the\naliens' armament.\nThey might have strange and terrible weapons against which we would\nbe powerless. On the other hand, our side would have the benefits\nof telekinetically guided missiles, teleported saboteurs, telepaths\nto pick up the alien strategy, and prognosticators to determine the\noutcome of each battle and see whether it was worth fighting in the\nfirst place.\nEverybody on Earth hoped for peace. Everybody, that is, except me. I\nhad been unable to achieve any sense of identity with the world in\nwhich I lived, and it was almost worth the loss of personal survival\nto know that my own smug species could look silly against a still more\ntalented race.\n\"It isn't so much our defense that worries me,\" my mother muttered, \"as\nlack of adequate medical machinery. War is bound to mean casualties\nand there aren't enough cure-alls on the planet to take care of them.\nIt's useless to expect the government to build more right now; they'll\nbe too busy producing weapons. Sylvia, you'd better take a leave of\nabsence from your job and come down to Psycho Center to learn first-aid\ntechniques. And you too, Kevin,\" she added, obviously a little\nsurprised herself at what she was saying. \"Probably you'd be even\nbetter at it than Sylvia since you aren't sensitive to other people's\npain.\"\nI looked at her.\n\"It\nis\nan ill wind,\" she agreed, smiling wryly, \"but don't let me\ncatch you thinking that way, Kevin. Can't you see it would be better\nthat there should be no war and you should remain useless?\"\nI couldn't see it, of course, and she knew that, with her wretched\ntalent for stripping away my feeble attempts at privacy. Psi-powers\nusually included some ability to form a mental shield; being without\none, I was necessarily devoid of the other.\nMy attitude didn't matter, though, because it was definitely war. The\naliens came back with a fleet clearly bent on our annihilation\u2014even\nthe 'paths couldn't figure out their motives, for the thought pattern\nwas entirely different from ours\u2014and the war was on.\nI had enjoyed learning first-aid; it was the first time I had ever\nworked with people as an equal. And I was good at it because psi-powers\naren't much of an advantage there. Telekinesis maybe a little, but\nI was big enough to lift anybody without needing any superhuman\nabilities\u2014normal human abilities, rather.\n\"Gee, Mr. Faraday,\" one of the other students breathed, \"you're so\nstrong. And without 'kinesis or anything.\"\nI looked at her and liked what I saw. She was blonde and pretty. \"My\nname's not Mr. Faraday,\" I said. \"It's Kevin.\"\n\"My name's Lucy,\" she giggled.\nNo girl had ever giggled at me in that way before. Immediately I\nstarted to envision a beautiful future for the two of us, then flushed\nwhen I realized that she might be a telepath. But she was winding a\ntourniquet around the arm of another member of the class with apparent\nunconcern.\n\"Hey, quit that!\" the windee yelled. \"You're making it too tight! I'll\nbe mortified!\"\nSo Lucy was obviously not a telepath. Later I found out she was only\na low-grade telesensitive\u2014just a poetess\u2014so I had nothing to worry\nabout as far as having my thoughts read went. I was a little afraid of\nSylvia's kidding me about my first romance, but, as it happened, she\ngot interested in one of the guys who was taking the class with us, and\nshe was not only too busy to be bothered with me, but in too vulnerable\na position herself.\nHowever, when the actual bombs\u2014or their alien equivalent\u2014struck near\nour town, I wasn't nearly so happy, especially after they started\ncarrying the wounded into the Psycho Center, which had been turned into\na hospital for the duration. I took one look at the gory scene\u2014I had\nnever seen anybody really injured before; few people had, as a matter\nof fact\u2014and started for the door. But Mother was already blocking the\nway. It was easy to see from which side of the family Tim had got his\ntalent for prognostication.\n\"If the telepaths who can pick up all the pain can stand this, Kevin,\"\nshe said, \"\nyou\ncertainly can.\" And there was no kindness at all in\nthe\nyou\n.\nShe gave me a shove toward the nearest stretcher. \"Go on\u2014now's your\nchance to show you're of some use in this world.\"\nGritting my teeth, I turned to the man on the stretcher. Something had\npretty near torn half his face away. It was all there, but not in the\nright place, and it wasn't pretty. I turned away, caught my mother's\neye, and then I didn't even dare to throw up. I looked at that smashed\nface again and all the first-aid lessons I'd had flew out of my head as\nif some super-psi had plucked them from me.\nThe man was bleeding terribly. I had never seen blood pouring out like\nthat before. The first thing to do, I figured sickly, was mop it up. I\nwet a sponge and dabbed gingerly at the face, but my hands were shaking\nso hard that the sponge slipped and my fingers were on the raw gaping\nwound. I could feel the warm viscosity of the blood and nothing, not\neven my mother, could keep my meal down this time, I thought.\nMother had uttered a sound of exasperation as I dropped the sponge. I\ncould hear her coming toward me. Then I heard her gasp. I looked at my\npatient and my mouth dropped open. For suddenly there was no wound,\nno wound at all\u2014just a little blood and the fellow's face was whole\nagain. Not even a scar.\n\"Wha\u2014wha happened?\" he asked. \"It doesn't hurt any more!\"\nHe touched his cheek and looked up at me with frightened eyes. And I\nwas frightened, too\u2014too frightened to be sick, too frightened to do\nanything but stare witlessly at him.\n\"Touch some of the others, quick!\" my mother commanded, pushing\nastounded attendants away from stretchers.\nI touched broken limbs and torn bodies and shattered heads, and they\nwere whole again right away. Everybody in the room was looking at me in\nthe way I had always dreamed of being looked at. Lucy was opening and\nshutting her beautiful mouth like a beautiful fish. In fact, the whole\nthing was just like a dream, except that I was awake. I couldn't have\nimagined all those horrors.\nBut the horrors soon weren't horrors any more. I began to find them\nalmost pleasing; the worse a wound was, the more I appreciated it.\nThere was so much more satisfaction, virtually an esthetic thrill, in\nseeing a horrible jagged tear smooth away, heal, not in days, as it\nwould have done under the cure-all, but in seconds.\n\"Timothy was right,\" my mother said, her eyes filled with tears, \"and\nI was wrong ever to have doubted. You have a gift, son\u2014\" and she said\nthe word son loud and clear so that everybody could hear it\u2014\"the\ngreatest gift of all, that of healing.\" She looked at me proudly. And\nLucy and the others looked at me as if I were a god or something.\nI felt ... well, good.\n\"I wonder why we never thought of healing as a potential psi-power,\" my\nmother said to me later, when I was catching a snatch of rest and she\nwas lighting cigarettes and offering me cups of coffee in an attempt to\nmake up twenty-six years of indifference, perhaps dislike, all at once.\n\"The ability to heal\nis\nrecorded in history, only we never paid much\nattention to it.\"\n\"Recorded?\" I asked, a little jealously.\n\"Of course,\" she smiled. \"Remember the King's Evil?\"\nI should have known without her reminding me, after all the old books I\nhad read. \"Scrofula, wasn't it? They called it that because the touch\nof certain kings was supposed to cure it ... and other diseases, too, I\nguess.\"\nShe nodded. \"Certain people must have had the healing power and that's\nprobably why they originally got to be the rulers.\"\nIn a very short time, I became a pretty important person. All the other\ndeficients in the world were tested for the healing power and all of\nthem turned out negative. I proved to be the only human healer alive,\nand not only that, I could work a thousand times more efficiently and\neffectively than any of the machines. The government built a hospital\njust for my work! Wounded people were ferried there from all over the\nworld and I cured them. I could do practically everything except raise\nthe dead and sometimes I wondered whether, with a little practice, I\nwouldn't be able to do even that.\nWhen I came to my new office, whom did I find waiting there for me but\nLucy, her trim figure enhanced by a snug blue and white uniform. \"I'm\nyour assistant, Kev,\" she said shyly.\nI looked at her. \"You are?\"\n\"I\u2014I hope you want me,\" she went on, coyness now mixing with\napprehension.\nI gave her shoulder a squeeze. \"I do want you, Lucy. More than I can\ntell you now. After all this is over, there's something more I want to\nsay. But right now\u2014\" I clapped her arm\u2014\"there's a job to be done.\"\n\"Yes, Kevin,\" she said, glaring at me for some reason I didn't have\ntime to investigate or interpret at the moment. My patients were\nwaiting for me.\nThey gave me everything else I could possibly need, except enough\nsleep, and I myself didn't want that. I wanted to heal. I wanted to\nshow my fellow human beings that, though I couldn't receive or transmit\nthoughts or foretell the future or move things with my mind, all those\npowers were useless without life, and that was what I could give.\nI took pride in my work. It was good to stop pain and ugliness, to know\nthat, if it weren't for me, these people would be dead or permanently\ndisfigured. In a sense, they were\u2014well, my children; I felt a warm\nglow of affection toward them.\nThey felt the same way toward me. I knew because the secret of the\nhospital soon leaked out\u2014during all those years of peace, the\ngovernment had lost whatever facility it had for keeping secrets\u2014and\npeople used to come in droves, hoping for a glimpse of me.\nThe government pointed out that such crowds outside the building might\nattract the enemy's attention. I was the most important individual on\nEarth, they told my followers, and my safety couldn't be risked. The\nhuman race at this stage was pretty docile. The crowds went away. And\nit was right that they should; I didn't want to be risked any more than\nthey wanted to risk me.\nPlenty of people did come to see me officially\u2014the President,\ngenerals, all kinds of big wheels, bringing citations, medals and other\nobsolete honors they'd revived primarily for me. It was wonderful. I\nbegan to love everybody.\n\"Don't you think you're putting too much of yourself into this, Kev?\"\nLucy asked me one day.\nI gave her an incredulous glance. \"You mean I shouldn't help people?\"\n\"Of course you should help them. I didn't mean anything like that.\nJust ... well, you're getting too bound up in your work.\"\n\"Why shouldn't I be?\" Then the truth, as I thought, dawned on me. \"Are\nyou jealous, Lucy?\"\nShe lowered her eyes. \"Not only that, but the war's bound to come to\nan end, you know, and\u2014\"\nIt was the first part of her sentence that interested me. \"Why, do you\nmean\u2014\"\nAnd just then a fresh batch of casualties arrived and I had to tend to\nthem. For the next few days, I was so busy, I didn't get the chance to\nhave the long talk with Lucy I'd wanted....\nThen, after only four months, the war suddenly stopped. It seemed\nthat the aliens' weapons, despite their undeniable mysteriousness,\nwere not equal to ours. And they had the added disadvantage of being\nlight-years away from home base. So the remnant of their fleet took off\nand blew itself up just outside of Mars, which we understood to be the\nequivalent of unconditional surrender. And it was; we never heard from\nthe Centaurians again.\nPeace once more. I had a little mopping up to do at the hospital; then\nI collected my possessions and went back home after a dignitary\u2014only\nthe Vice President this time\u2014had thanked me on behalf of a grateful\ncountry. I wasn't needed any more.\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nJack of No Trades\nBy EVELYN E. SMITH\nIllustrated by CAVAT\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy October 1955.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.]\nI was psick of Psi powers, not having any. Or didn't I? Maybe they'd\npsee otherwise psomeday!\nI walked into the dining room and collided with a floating mass of\nfabric, which promptly draped itself over me like a sentient shroud.\n\"Oh, for God's sake, Kevin!\" my middle brother's voice came muffled\nthrough the folds. \"If you can't help, at least don't hinder!\"\nI managed to struggle out of the tablecloth, even though it seemed to\nbe trying to wrap itself around me. When Danny got excited, he lost his\nmental grip.\n\"I could help,\" I yelled as soon as I got my head free, \"if anybody\nwould let me and, what's more, I could set the table a damn sight\nfaster by hand than you do with 'kinesis.\"\nJust then Father appeared at the head of the table. He could as easily\nhave walked downstairs as teleported, but I belonged to a family of\nexhibitionists. And Father tended to show off as if he were still a\nkid. Not that he looked his age\u2014he was big and blond, like Danny and\nTim and me, and could have passed for our older brother.\n\"Boys, boys!\" he reproved us. \"Danny, you ought to be ashamed of\nyourself\u2014picking on poor Kev.\"\nEven if it hadn't been Danny's fault, he would still have been blamed.\nNobody was ever supposed to raise a voice or a hand or a thought to\npoor afflicted Kev, because nature had picked on me enough. And the\nnicer everybody was to me, the nastier I became, since only when they\nlost their tempers could I get\u2014or so I believed\u2014their true attitude\ntoward me.\nHow else could I tell?\n\"Sorry, fella,\" Dan apologized to me. The tablecloth spread itself out\non the table. \"Wrinkles,\" he grumbled to himself. \"Wrinkles. And I had\nit so nice and smooth before. Mother will be furious.\"\n\"If she were going to be furious, she'd be furious already,\" Father\nreminded him sadly. It must be tough to be married to a deep-probe\ntelepath, I thought, and I felt a sudden wave of sympathy for him. It\nwas so seldom I got the chance to feel sorry for anyone except myself.\n\"But I think you'll find she understands.\"\n\"She knows, all right,\" Danny remarked as he went on into the kitchen,\n\"but I'm not sure she always understands.\"\nI was surprised to find him so perceptive on the abstract level,\nbecause he wasn't what you might call an understanding person, either.\n\"There are tensions in this room,\" my sister announced as she slouched\nin, not quite awake yet, \"and hatred. I could feel them all the way\nupstairs. And today I'm working on the Sleepsweet Mattress copy, so I\nmust feel absolutely tranquil. Everyone will think beautiful thoughts,\nplease.\"\nShe sat down just as a glass of orange juice was arriving at her\nplace; Danny apparently didn't know she'd come in already. The glass\nbumped into the back of her neck, tilted and poured its contents over\nher shoulder and down her very considerable decolletage. Being a mere\nprimitive, I couldn't help laughing.\n\"Danny, you fumbler!\" she screamed.\nDanny erupted from the kitchen. \"How many times have I asked all of you\nnot to sit down until I've got everything on the table? Always a lot of\ninterfering busybodies getting in the way.\"\n\"I don't see why you have to set the table at all,\" she retorted. \"A\nrobot could do it better and faster than you. Even Kev could.\" She\nturned quickly toward me. \"Oh, I am sorry, Kevin.\"\nI didn't say anything; I was too busy pressing my hands down on the\nback of the chair to make my knuckles turn white.\nSylvia's face turned even whiter. \"Father, stop him\u2014\nstop\nhim! He's\nhating again! I can't stand it!\"\nFather looked at me, then at her. \"I don't think he can help it,\nSylvia.\"\nI grinned. \"That's right\u2014I'm just a poor atavism with no control over\nmyself a-tall.\"\nFinally my mother came in from the kitchen; she was an old-fashioned\nwoman and didn't hold with robocooks. One quick glance at me gave her\nthe complete details, even though I quickly protested, \"It's illegal to\nprobe anyone without permission.\"\n\"I used to probe you to find out when you needed your diapers changed,\"\nshe said tartly, \"and I'll probe you now. You should watch yourself,\nSylvia\u2014poor Kevin isn't responsible.\"\nShe didn't need to probe to get the blast of naked emotion that spurted\nout from me. My sister screamed and even Father looked uncomfortable.\nDanny stomped back into the kitchen, muttering to himself.\nMother's lips tightened. \"Sylvia, go upstairs and change your dress.\nKevin, do I have to make an appointment for you at the clinic again?\"\nA psychiatrist never diagnosed members of his own family\u2014that is, not\nofficially; they couldn't help offering thumbnail diagnoses any more\nthan they could help having thumbnails.\n\"No use,\" I said, deciding it was safe to drop into my chair. \"Who can\nadjust me to an environment to which I'm fundamentally unsuited?\"\n\"Maybe there is something physically wrong with him, Amy,\" my father\nsuggested hopefully. \"Maybe you should make an appointment for him at\nthe cure-all?\"\nMother shook her neatly coiffed head. \"He's been to it dozens of times\nand he always checks out in splendid shape. None of us can spare the\ntime to go with him again, just on an off-chance, and he could hardly\nbe allowed to make such a long trip all by himself. Pity there isn't a\nmachine in every community, but, then, we don't really need them.\"\nNow that the virus diseases had been licked, people hardly ever\ngot sick any more and, when they did, it was mostly psychosomatic.\nLife was so well organized that there weren't even many accidents\nthese days. It was a safe, orderly existence for those who fitted\ninto it\u2014which accounted for more than ninety-five per cent of the\npopulation. The only ones who didn't adjust were those who couldn't,\nlike me\u2014psi-deficients, throwbacks to an earlier era. There were no\nphysical cripples, because anybody could have a new arm or a new leg\ngrafted on, but you couldn't graft psi powers onto an atavism or, if\nyou could, the technique hadn't been developed yet.\n\"I feel a sense of impending doom brooding over this household,\" my\nyoungest brother remarked cheerfully as he vaulted into his chair.\n\"You always do, Timothy,\" my mother said, unfolding her napkin. \"And I\nmust say it's not in good taste, especially at breakfast.\"\nHe reached for his juice. \"Guess this is a doomed household. And what\nwas all that emotional uproar about?\"\n\"The usual,\" Sylvia said from the doorway before anyone else could\nanswer. She slid warily into her chair. \"Hey, Dan, I'm here!\" she\ncalled. \"If anything else comes in, it comes in manually, understand?\"\n\"Oh, all right.\" Dan emerged from the kitchen with a tray of food\nfloating ahead of him.\n\"The usual? Trouble with Kev?\" Tim looked at me narrowly. \"Somehow my\nsense of ominousness is connected with him.\"\n\"Well, that's perfectly natural\u2014\" Sylvia began, then stopped as Mother\ncaught her eye.\n\"I didn't mean that,\" Tim said. \"I still say Kev's got something we\ncan't figure out.\"\n\"You've been saying that for years,\" Danny protested, \"and he's been\ntested for every faculty under the Sun. He can't telepath or teleport\nor telekinesthesize or even teletype. He can't precognize or prefix or\nprepossess. He can't\u2014\"\n\"Strictly a bundle of no-talent, that's me,\" I interrupted, trying to\nkeep my animal feelings from getting the better of me. That was how my\nfamily thought of me, I knew\u2014as an animal, and not a very lovable one,\neither.\n\"No,\" Tim said, \"he's just got something we haven't developed a test\nfor. It'll come out some day, you'll see.\" He smiled at me.\nI smiled at him gratefully; he was the only member of my family who\nreally seemed to like me in spite of my handicap. \"It won't work, Tim.\nI know you're trying to be kind, but\u2014\"\n\"He's not saying it just to be kind,\" my mother put in. \"He means it.\nNot that I want to arouse false hopes, Kevin,\" she added with grim\nscrupulousness. \"Tim's awfully young yet and I wouldn't trust his\nextracurricular prognostications too far.\"\nNonetheless, I couldn't help feeling a feeble renewal of old hopes.\nAfter all, young or not, Tim was a hell of a good prognosticator; he\nwouldn't have risen so rapidly to the position he held in the Weather\nBureau if he hadn't been pretty near tops in foreboding.\nMother smiled sadly at my thoughts, but I didn't let that discourage\nme. As Danny had said, she\nknew\nbut she didn't really\nunderstand\n.\nNobody, for all of his or her psi power, really understood me.\nBreakfast was finally over and the rest of my family dispersed to their\nvarious jobs. Father simply took his briefcase and disappeared\u2014he was\na traveling salesman and he had a morning appointment clear across the\ncontinent. The others, not having his particular gift, had to take\nthe helibus to their different destinations. Mother, as I said, was a\npsychiatrist. Sylvia wrote advertising copy. Tim was a meteorologist.\nDan was a junior executive in a furniture moving company and expected a\npromotion to senior rank as soon as he achieved a better mental grip on\npianos.\nOnly I had no job, no profession, no place in life. Of course there\nwere certain menial tasks a psi-negative could perform, but my parents\nwould have none of them\u2014partly for my sake, but mostly for the sake of\ntheir own community standing.\n\"We don't need what little money Kev could bring in,\" my father always\nsaid. \"I can afford to support my family. He can stay home and take\ncare of the house.\"\nAnd that's what I did. Not that there was much to do except call a\ntechno whenever one of the servomechanisms missed a beat. True enough,\nthose things had to be watched mighty carefully because, if they broke\ndown, it sometimes took days before the repair and/or replacement\nrobots could come. There never were enough of them because ours was a\nconstructive society. Still, being a machine-sitter isn't very much of\na career. And every function that wasn't the prerogative of a machine\ncould be done ten times more quickly and efficiently by some member of\nmy family than I could do it. If I went ahead and did something anyway,\nthey would just do it all over again when they got home.\nSo I had nothing to do all day. I had a special dispensation to\ntake books out of the local Archives, because I was a deficient and\ncouldn't receive the tellie programs. Almost everybody on Earth was\ntelepathic to some degree and could get the amplified projections even\nif he couldn't transmit or receive with his natural powers. But I got\nnothing. I had to derive all my recreation from reading, and you can\nget awfully tired of books, especially when they're all at least a\nhundred years old and written by primitives. I could borrow sound\ntapes, but they also bored me after a while.\nI thought maybe I could develop a talent for composing or painting,\nwhich would classify me as a telesensitive\u2014artistic ability being\nconsidered as the oldest, if least important, psi power\u2014but I couldn't\neven do anything like that.\nAbout all there was left for me was to take long walks. Athletics were\nout of the question; I couldn't compete with psi-boys and they didn't\nwant to compete with me. All the people in the neighborhood knew me\nand were nice to me, but I didn't need to be a 'path to tell what they\nwere saying to one another when I hove into sight. \"There's that oldest\nFaraday boy. Pity, such a talented family, to have a defective.\"\nI didn't have a girl, either. Although some of them were sort of\nattracted to me\u2014I could see that\u2014they could hardly go out with me\nwithout exposing themselves to ridicule. In their sandals, I would have\ndone the same thing, but that didn't stop me from hating them.\nI wished I had been born a couple of hundred years ago\u2014before people\nstarted playing around with nuclear energy and filling the air with\nradiations that they were afraid would turn human beings into hideous\nmonsters. Instead, they developed the psi powers that had always been\nlatent in the species until we developed into a race of supermen. I\ndon't know why I say\nwe\n\u2014in 1960 or so, I might have been considered\nsuperior, but in 2102 I was just the Faradays' idiot boy.\nExploring space should have been my hope. If there had been anything\nuseful or interesting on any of the other planets, I might have found\na niche for myself there. In totally new surroundings, the psi powers\ngeared to another environment might not be an advantage. But by the\ntime I was ten, it was discovered that the other planets were just\nbarren hunks of rock, with pressures and climates and atmospheres\ndrastically unsuited to human life. A year or so before, the hyperdrive\nhad been developed on Earth and ships had been sent out to explore the\nstars, but I had no hope left in that direction any more.\nI was an atavism in a world of peace and plenty. Peace, because people\ncouldn't indulge in war or even crime with so many telepaths running\naround\u2014not because, I told myself, the capacity for primitive behavior\nwasn't just as latent in everybody else as the psi talent seemed latent\nin me. Tim must be right, I thought\u2014I must have some undreamed-of\npower that only the right circumstances would bring out. But what was\nthat power?\nFor years I had speculated on what my potential talent might be,\nexplored every wild possibility I could conceive of and found none\nproductive of even an ambiguous result with which I could fool myself.\nAs I approached adulthood, I began to concede that I was probably\nnothing more than what I seemed to be\u2014a simple psi-negative. Yet, from\ntime to time, hope surged up again, as it had today, in spite of my\nknowledge that my hope was an impossibility. Who ever heard of latent\npsi powers showing themselves in an individual as old as twenty-six?\nI was almost alone in the parks where I used to walk, because people\nliked to commune with one another those days rather than with nature.\nEven gardening had very little popularity. But I found myself most at\nhome in those woodland\u2014or, rather, pseudo-woodland\u2014surroundings,\nable to identify more readily with the trees and flowers than I could\nwith my own kind. A fallen tree or a broken blossom would excite more\nsympathy from me than the minor catastrophes that will beset any\nhousehold, no matter how gifted, and I would shy away from bloody\nnoses or cut fingers, thus giving myself a reputation for callousness\nas well as extrasensory imbecility.\nHowever, I was no more callous in steering clear of human breakdowns\nthan I was in not shedding tears over the household machines when they\nbroke down, for I felt no more closely akin to my parents and siblings\nthan I did to the mechanisms that served and, sometimes, failed us.\nOn that day, I walked farther than I had intended and, by the time I\ngot back home, I found the rest of my family had returned before me.\nThey seemed to be excited about something and were surprised to see me\nso calm.\n\"Aren't you even interested in anything outside your own immediate\nconcerns, Kev?\" Sylvia demanded, despite Father's efforts to shush her.\n\"Can't you remember that Kev isn't able to receive the tellies?\" Tim\nshot back at her. \"He probably doesn't even know what's happened.\"\n\"Well, what did happen?\" I asked, trying not to snap.\n\"One starship got back from Alpha Centauri,\" Danny said excitedly.\n\"There are two inhabited Earth-type planets there!\"\nThis was for me; this was it at last! I tried not to show my\nenthusiasm, though I knew that was futile. My relatives could keep\ntheir thoughts and emotions from me; I couldn't keep mine from them.\n\"What kind of life inhabits them? Humanoid?\"\n\"Uh-uh.\" Danny shook his head. \"And hostile. The crew of the starship\nsays they were attacked immediately on landing. When they turned and\nleft, they were followed here by one of the alien ships. Must be a\npretty advanced race to have spaceships. Anyhow, the extraterrestrial\nship headed back as soon as it got a fix on where ours was going.\"\n\"But if they're hostile,\" I said thoughtfully, \"it might mean war.\"\n\"Of course. That's why everybody's so wrought up. We hope it's peace,\nbut we'll have to prepare for war just in case.\"\nThere hadn't been a war on Earth for well over a hundred years, but\nwe hadn't been so foolish as to obliterate all knowledge of military\ntechniques and weapons. The alien ship wouldn't be able to come back\nwith reinforcements\u2014if such were its intention\u2014in less than six\nmonths. This meant time to get together a stockpile of weapons, though\nwe had no idea of how effective our defenses would be against the\naliens' armament.\nThey might have strange and terrible weapons against which we would\nbe powerless. On the other hand, our side would have the benefits\nof telekinetically guided missiles, teleported saboteurs, telepaths\nto pick up the alien strategy, and prognosticators to determine the\noutcome of each battle and see whether it was worth fighting in the\nfirst place.\nEverybody on Earth hoped for peace. Everybody, that is, except me. I\nhad been unable to achieve any sense of identity with the world in\nwhich I lived, and it was almost worth the loss of personal survival\nto know that my own smug species could look silly against a still more\ntalented race.\n\"It isn't so much our defense that worries me,\" my mother muttered, \"as\nlack of adequate medical machinery. War is bound to mean casualties\nand there aren't enough cure-alls on the planet to take care of them.\nIt's useless to expect the government to build more right now; they'll\nbe too busy producing weapons. Sylvia, you'd better take a leave of\nabsence from your job and come down to Psycho Center to learn first-aid\ntechniques. And you too, Kevin,\" she added, obviously a little\nsurprised herself at what she was saying. \"Probably you'd be even\nbetter at it than Sylvia since you aren't sensitive to other people's\npain.\"\nI looked at her.\n\"It\nis\nan ill wind,\" she agreed, smiling wryly, \"but don't let me\ncatch you thinking that way, Kevin. Can't you see it would be better\nthat there should be no war and you should remain useless?\"\nI couldn't see it, of course, and she knew that, with her wretched\ntalent for stripping away my feeble attempts at privacy. Psi-powers\nusually included some ability to form a mental shield; being without\none, I was necessarily devoid of the other.\nMy attitude didn't matter, though, because it was definitely war. The\naliens came back with a fleet clearly bent on our annihilation\u2014even\nthe 'paths couldn't figure out their motives, for the thought pattern\nwas entirely different from ours\u2014and the war was on.\nI had enjoyed learning first-aid; it was the first time I had ever\nworked with people as an equal. And I was good at it because psi-powers\naren't much of an advantage there. Telekinesis maybe a little, but\nI was big enough to lift anybody without needing any superhuman\nabilities\u2014normal human abilities, rather.\n\"Gee, Mr. Faraday,\" one of the other students breathed, \"you're so\nstrong. And without 'kinesis or anything.\"\nI looked at her and liked what I saw. She was blonde and pretty. \"My\nname's not Mr. Faraday,\" I said. \"It's Kevin.\"\n\"My name's Lucy,\" she giggled.\nNo girl had ever giggled at me in that way before. Immediately I\nstarted to envision a beautiful future for the two of us, then flushed\nwhen I realized that she might be a telepath. But she was winding a\ntourniquet around the arm of another member of the class with apparent\nunconcern.\n\"Hey, quit that!\" the windee yelled. \"You're making it too tight! I'll\nbe mortified!\"\nSo Lucy was obviously not a telepath. Later I found out she was only\na low-grade telesensitive\u2014just a poetess\u2014so I had nothing to worry\nabout as far as having my thoughts read went. I was a little afraid of\nSylvia's kidding me about my first romance, but, as it happened, she\ngot interested in one of the guys who was taking the class with us, and\nshe was not only too busy to be bothered with me, but in too vulnerable\na position herself.\nHowever, when the actual bombs\u2014or their alien equivalent\u2014struck near\nour town, I wasn't nearly so happy, especially after they started\ncarrying the wounded into the Psycho Center, which had been turned into\na hospital for the duration. I took one look at the gory scene\u2014I had\nnever seen anybody really injured before; few people had, as a matter\nof fact\u2014and started for the door. But Mother was already blocking the\nway. It was easy to see from which side of the family Tim had got his\ntalent for prognostication.\n\"If the telepaths who can pick up all the pain can stand this, Kevin,\"\nshe said, \"\nyou\ncertainly can.\" And there was no kindness at all in\nthe\nyou\n.\nShe gave me a shove toward the nearest stretcher. \"Go on\u2014now's your\nchance to show you're of some use in this world.\"\nGritting my teeth, I turned to the man on the stretcher. Something had\npretty near torn half his face away. It was all there, but not in the\nright place, and it wasn't pretty. I turned away, caught my mother's\neye, and then I didn't even dare to throw up. I looked at that smashed\nface again and all the first-aid lessons I'd had flew out of my head as\nif some super-psi had plucked them from me.\nThe man was bleeding terribly. I had never seen blood pouring out like\nthat before. The first thing to do, I figured sickly, was mop it up. I\nwet a sponge and dabbed gingerly at the face, but my hands were shaking\nso hard that the sponge slipped and my fingers were on the raw gaping\nwound. I could feel the warm viscosity of the blood and nothing, not\neven my mother, could keep my meal down this time, I thought.\nMother had uttered a sound of exasperation as I dropped the sponge. I\ncould hear her coming toward me. Then I heard her gasp. I looked at my\npatient and my mouth dropped open. For suddenly there was no wound,\nno wound at all\u2014just a little blood and the fellow's face was whole\nagain. Not even a scar.\n\"Wha\u2014wha happened?\" he asked. \"It doesn't hurt any more!\"\nHe touched his cheek and looked up at me with frightened eyes. And I\nwas frightened, too\u2014too frightened to be sick, too frightened to do\nanything but stare witlessly at him.\n\"Touch some of the others, quick!\" my mother commanded, pushing\nastounded attendants away from stretchers.\nI touched broken limbs and torn bodies and shattered heads, and they\nwere whole again right away. Everybody in the room was looking at me in\nthe way I had always dreamed of being looked at. Lucy was opening and\nshutting her beautiful mouth like a beautiful fish. In fact, the whole\nthing was just like a dream, except that I was awake. I couldn't have\nimagined all those horrors.\nBut the horrors soon weren't horrors any more. I began to find them\nalmost pleasing; the worse a wound was, the more I appreciated it.\nThere was so much more satisfaction, virtually an esthetic thrill, in\nseeing a horrible jagged tear smooth away, heal, not in days, as it\nwould have done under the cure-all, but in seconds.\n\"Timothy was right,\" my mother said, her eyes filled with tears, \"and\nI was wrong ever to have doubted. You have a gift, son\u2014\" and she said\nthe word son loud and clear so that everybody could hear it\u2014\"the\ngreatest gift of all, that of healing.\" She looked at me proudly. And\nLucy and the others looked at me as if I were a god or something.\nI felt ... well, good.\n\"I wonder why we never thought of healing as a potential psi-power,\" my\nmother said to me later, when I was catching a snatch of rest and she\nwas lighting cigarettes and offering me cups of coffee in an attempt to\nmake up twenty-six years of indifference, perhaps dislike, all at once.\n\"The ability to heal\nis\nrecorded in history, only we never paid much\nattention to it.\"\n\"Recorded?\" I asked, a little jealously.\n\"Of course,\" she smiled. \"Remember the King's Evil?\"\nI should have known without her reminding me, after all the old books I\nhad read. \"Scrofula, wasn't it? They called it that because the touch\nof certain kings was supposed to cure it ... and other diseases, too, I\nguess.\"\nShe nodded. \"Certain people must have had the healing power and that's\nprobably why they originally got to be the rulers.\"\nIn a very short time, I became a pretty important person. All the other\ndeficients in the world were tested for the healing power and all of\nthem turned out negative. I proved to be the only human healer alive,\nand not only that, I could work a thousand times more efficiently and\neffectively than any of the machines. The government built a hospital\njust for my work! Wounded people were ferried there from all over the\nworld and I cured them. I could do practically everything except raise\nthe dead and sometimes I wondered whether, with a little practice, I\nwouldn't be able to do even that.\nWhen I came to my new office, whom did I find waiting there for me but\nLucy, her trim figure enhanced by a snug blue and white uniform. \"I'm\nyour assistant, Kev,\" she said shyly.\nI looked at her. \"You are?\"\n\"I\u2014I hope you want me,\" she went on, coyness now mixing with\napprehension.\nI gave her shoulder a squeeze. \"I do want you, Lucy. More than I can\ntell you now. After all this is over, there's something more I want to\nsay. But right now\u2014\" I clapped her arm\u2014\"there's a job to be done.\"\n\"Yes, Kevin,\" she said, glaring at me for some reason I didn't have\ntime to investigate or interpret at the moment. My patients were\nwaiting for me.\nThey gave me everything else I could possibly need, except enough\nsleep, and I myself didn't want that. I wanted to heal. I wanted to\nshow my fellow human beings that, though I couldn't receive or transmit\nthoughts or foretell the future or move things with my mind, all those\npowers were useless without life, and that was what I could give.\nI took pride in my work. It was good to stop pain and ugliness, to know\nthat, if it weren't for me, these people would be dead or permanently\ndisfigured. In a sense, they were\u2014well, my children; I felt a warm\nglow of affection toward them.\nThey felt the same way toward me. I knew because the secret of the\nhospital soon leaked out\u2014during all those years of peace, the\ngovernment had lost whatever facility it had for keeping secrets\u2014and\npeople used to come in droves, hoping for a glimpse of me.\nThe government pointed out that such crowds outside the building might\nattract the enemy's attention. I was the most important individual on\nEarth, they told my followers, and my safety couldn't be risked. The\nhuman race at this stage was pretty docile. The crowds went away. And\nit was right that they should; I didn't want to be risked any more than\nthey wanted to risk me.\nPlenty of people did come to see me officially\u2014the President,\ngenerals, all kinds of big wheels, bringing citations, medals and other\nobsolete honors they'd revived primarily for me. It was wonderful. I\nbegan to love everybody.\n\"Don't you think you're putting too much of yourself into this, Kev?\"\nLucy asked me one day.\nI gave her an incredulous glance. \"You mean I shouldn't help people?\"\n\"Of course you should help them. I didn't mean anything like that.\nJust ... well, you're getting too bound up in your work.\"\n\"Why shouldn't I be?\" Then the truth, as I thought, dawned on me. \"Are\nyou jealous, Lucy?\"\nShe lowered her eyes. \"Not only that, but the war's bound to come to\nan end, you know, and\u2014\"\nIt was the first part of her sentence that interested me. \"Why, do you\nmean\u2014\"\nAnd just then a fresh batch of casualties arrived and I had to tend to\nthem. For the next few days, I was so busy, I didn't get the chance to\nhave the long talk with Lucy I'd wanted....\nThen, after only four months, the war suddenly stopped. It seemed\nthat the aliens' weapons, despite their undeniable mysteriousness,\nwere not equal to ours. And they had the added disadvantage of being\nlight-years away from home base. So the remnant of their fleet took off\nand blew itself up just outside of Mars, which we understood to be the\nequivalent of unconditional surrender. And it was; we never heard from\nthe Centaurians again.\nPeace once more. I had a little mopping up to do at the hospital; then\nI collected my possessions and went back home after a dignitary\u2014only\nthe Vice President this time\u2014had thanked me on behalf of a grateful\ncountry. I wasn't needed any more.\n", "summary": "Jack of No Trades by Evelyn E. Smith begins with Danny and his brother, Danny, discussing their tensions in the family. Danny is upset because he thinks that his brother has picked on poor Kev, who is a member of the circus. Danny and their father, Father, are upset because Danny has picked a fight with him. Danny's anger is brought out by the fact that he thinks he is the center of the tension. Danny tries to explain that he is not the center, but Father still holds him responsible for his actions. Danny then goes to the kitchen to get some food for his sister, who has arrived. Danny brings a glass of orange juice to her and asks her to help him set the table. Danny begins to set the menu, but suddenly realizes that he cannot do it. He is unable to move the table because of the invisible fabric that is floating around the table, and he is unable even to move his own body. He then realizes that the invisible material is coming from his own brain, and that he has to move it out of the way. He tries to move away from the table but is unable. He goes to get a knife to cut the plastic off of the plastic, but it is too late. He realizes that it is the same material that is moving around the room, and Danny realizes that there is a pattern of moving objects around the house. He moves the tablecloth out of his way, and the invisible objects begin to move around the living room. He finds a knife, and it is able to cut through the plastic. He uses the knife to break through the invisible plastic. Danny\u2019s plastic.  and Danny is able break through it. Danny goes to see his sister and realizes that she is in pain. He rushes to her, and she is unconscious. He wakes up in a hospital bed, and is taken to the hospital. He sees that the plastic is the cause of her pain. The doctor tells him that she has a fever, and there is nothing he can do for her. He tells Danny that she will be in a coma for a while, and then goes on to explain the situation to him.    The next day, Danny and Father are in the dining room. Danny has a disagreement with his brother about the state of the house, and Father is upset that Danny is picking on poor Kevin.

SMITH\nIllustrated by CAVAT\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy October 1955.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.]\nI was psick of Psi powers, not having any. Or didn't I? Maybe they'd\npsee otherwise psomeday!\nI walked into the dining room and collided with a floating mass of\nfabric, which promptly draped itself over me like a sentient shroud.\n\"Oh, for God's sake, Kevin!\" my middle brother's voice came muffled\nthrough the folds. \"If you can't help, at least don't hinder!\"\nI managed to struggle out of the tablecloth, even though it seemed to\nbe trying to wrap itself around me. When Danny got excited, he lost his\nmental grip.\n\"I could help,\" I yelled as soon as I got my head free, \"if anybody\nwould let me and, what's more, I could set the table a damn sight\nfaster by hand than you do with 'kinesis.\"\nJust then Father appeared at the head of the table. He could as easily\nhave walked downstairs as teleported, but I belonged to a family of\nexhibitionists. And Father tended to show off as if he were still a\nkid. Not that he looked his age\u2014he was big and blond, like Danny and\nTim and me, and could have passed for our older brother.\n\"Boys, boys!\" he reproved us. \"Danny, you ought to be ashamed of\nyourself\u2014picking on poor Kev.\"\nEven if it hadn't been Danny's fault, he would still have been blamed.\nNobody was ever supposed to raise a voice or a hand or a thought to\npoor afflicted Kev, because nature had picked on me enough. And the\nnicer everybody was to me, the nastier I became, since only when they\nlost their tempers could I get\u2014or so I believed\u2014their true attitude\ntoward me.\nHow else could I tell?\n\"Sorry, fella,\" Dan apologized to me. The tablecloth spread itself out\non the table. \"Wrinkles,\" he grumbled to himself. \"Wrinkles. And I had\nit so nice and smooth before. Mother will be furious.\"\n\"If she were going to be furious, she'd be furious already,\" Father\nreminded him sadly. It must be tough to be married to a deep-probe\ntelepath, I thought, and I felt a sudden wave of sympathy for him. It\nwas so seldom I got the chance to feel sorry for anyone except myself.\n\"But I think you'll find she understands.\"\n\"She knows, all right,\" Danny remarked as he went on into the kitchen,\n\"but I'm not sure she always understands.\"\nI was surprised to find him so perceptive on the abstract level,\nbecause he wasn't what you might call an understanding person, either.\n\"There are tensions in this room,\" my sister announced as she slouched\nin, not quite awake yet, \"and hatred. I could feel them all the way\nupstairs. And today I'm working on the Sleepsweet Mattress copy, so I\nmust feel absolutely tranquil. Everyone will think beautiful thoughts,\nplease.\"\nShe sat down just as a glass of orange juice was arriving at her\nplace; Danny apparently didn't know she'd come in already. The glass\nbumped into the back of her neck, tilted and poured its contents over\nher shoulder and down her very considerable decolletage. Being a mere\nprimitive, I couldn't help laughing.\n\"Danny, you fumbler!\" she screamed.\nDanny erupted from the kitchen. \"How many times have I asked all of you\nnot to sit down until I've got everything on the table? Always a lot of\ninterfering busybodies getting in the way.\"\n\"I don't see why you have to set the table at all,\" she retorted. \"A\nrobot could do it better and faster than you. Even Kev could.\" She\nturned quickly toward me. \"Oh, I am sorry, Kevin.\"\nI didn't say anything; I was too busy pressing my hands down on the\nback of the chair to make my knuckles turn white.\nSylvia's face turned even whiter. \"Father, stop him\u2014\nstop\nhim! He's\nhating again! I can't stand it!\"\nFather looked at me, then at her. \"I don't think he can help it,\nSylvia.\"\nI grinned. \"That's right\u2014I'm just a poor atavism with no control over\nmyself a-tall.\"\nFinally my mother came in from the kitchen; she was an old-fashioned\nwoman and didn't hold with robocooks. One quick glance at me gave her\nthe complete details, even though I quickly protested, \"It's illegal to\nprobe anyone without permission.\"\n\"I used to probe you to find out when you needed your diapers changed,\"\nshe said tartly, \"and I'll probe you now. You should watch yourself,\nSylvia\u2014poor Kevin isn't responsible.\"\nShe didn't need to probe to get the blast of naked emotion that spurted\nout from me. My sister screamed and even Father looked uncomfortable.\nDanny stomped back into the kitchen, muttering to himself.\nMother's lips tightened. \"Sylvia, go upstairs and change your dress.\nKevin, do I have to make an appointment for you at the clinic again?\"\nA psychiatrist never diagnosed members of his own family\u2014that is, not\nofficially; they couldn't help offering thumbnail diagnoses any more\nthan they could help having thumbnails.\n\"No use,\" I said, deciding it was safe to drop into my chair. \"Who can\nadjust me to an environment to which I'm fundamentally unsuited?\"\n\"Maybe there is something physically wrong with him, Amy,\" my father\nsuggested hopefully. \"Maybe you should make an appointment for him at\nthe cure-all?\"\nMother shook her neatly coiffed head. \"He's been to it dozens of times\nand he always checks out in splendid shape. None of us can spare the\ntime to go with him again, just on an off-chance, and he could hardly\nbe allowed to make such a long trip all by himself. Pity there isn't a\nmachine in every community, but, then, we don't really need them.\"\nNow that the virus diseases had been licked, people hardly ever\ngot sick any more and, when they did, it was mostly psychosomatic.\nLife was so well organized that there weren't even many accidents\nthese days. It was a safe, orderly existence for those who fitted\ninto it\u2014which accounted for more than ninety-five per cent of the\npopulation. The only ones who didn't adjust were those who couldn't,\nlike me\u2014psi-deficients, throwbacks to an earlier era. There were no\nphysical cripples, because anybody could have a new arm or a new leg\ngrafted on, but you couldn't graft psi powers onto an atavism or, if\nyou could, the technique hadn't been developed yet.\n\"I feel a sense of impending doom brooding over this household,\" my\nyoungest brother remarked cheerfully as he vaulted into his chair.\n\"You always do, Timothy,\" my mother said, unfolding her napkin. \"And I\nmust say it's not in good taste, especially at breakfast.\"\nHe reached for his juice. \"Guess this is a doomed household. And what\nwas all that emotional uproar about?\"\n\"The usual,\" Sylvia said from the doorway before anyone else could\nanswer. She slid warily into her chair. \"Hey, Dan, I'm here!\" she\ncalled. \"If anything else comes in, it comes in manually, understand?\"\n\"Oh, all right.\" Dan emerged from the kitchen with a tray of food\nfloating ahead of him.\n\"The usual? Trouble with Kev?\" Tim looked at me narrowly. \"Somehow my\nsense of ominousness is connected with him.\"\n\"Well, that's perfectly natural\u2014\" Sylvia began, then stopped as Mother\ncaught her eye.\n\"I didn't mean that,\" Tim said. \"I still say Kev's got something we\ncan't figure out.\"\n\"You've been saying that for years,\" Danny protested, \"and he's been\ntested for every faculty under the Sun. He can't telepath or teleport\nor telekinesthesize or even teletype. He can't precognize or prefix or\nprepossess. He can't\u2014\"\n\"Strictly a bundle of no-talent, that's me,\" I interrupted, trying to\nkeep my animal feelings from getting the better of me. That was how my\nfamily thought of me, I knew\u2014as an animal, and not a very lovable one,\neither.\n\"No,\" Tim said, \"he's just got something we haven't developed a test\nfor. It'll come out some day, you'll see.\" He smiled at me.\nI smiled at him gratefully; he was the only member of my family who\nreally seemed to like me in spite of my handicap. \"It won't work, Tim.\nI know you're trying to be kind, but\u2014\"\n\"He's not saying it just to be kind,\" my mother put in. \"He means it.\nNot that I want to arouse false hopes, Kevin,\" she added with grim\nscrupulousness. \"Tim's awfully young yet and I wouldn't trust his\nextracurricular prognostications too far.\"\nNonetheless, I couldn't help feeling a feeble renewal of old hopes.\nAfter all, young or not, Tim was a hell of a good prognosticator; he\nwouldn't have risen so rapidly to the position he held in the Weather\nBureau if he hadn't been pretty near tops in foreboding.\nMother smiled sadly at my thoughts, but I didn't let that discourage\nme. As Danny had said, she\nknew\nbut she didn't really\nunderstand\n.\nNobody, for all of his or her psi power, really understood me.\nBreakfast was finally over and the rest of my family dispersed to their\nvarious jobs. Father simply took his briefcase and disappeared\u2014he was\na traveling salesman and he had a morning appointment clear across the\ncontinent. The others, not having his particular gift, had to take\nthe helibus to their different destinations. Mother, as I said, was a\npsychiatrist. Sylvia wrote advertising copy. Tim was a meteorologist.\nDan was a junior executive in a furniture moving company and expected a\npromotion to senior rank as soon as he achieved a better mental grip on\npianos.\nOnly I had no job, no profession, no place in life. Of course there\nwere certain menial tasks a psi-negative could perform, but my parents\nwould have none of them\u2014partly for my sake, but mostly for the sake of\ntheir own community standing.\n\"We don't need what little money Kev could bring in,\" my father always\nsaid. \"I can afford to support my family. He can stay home and take\ncare of the house.\"\nAnd that's what I did. Not that there was much to do except call a\ntechno whenever one of the servomechanisms missed a beat. True enough,\nthose things had to be watched mighty carefully because, if they broke\ndown, it sometimes took days before the repair and/or replacement\nrobots could come. There never were enough of them because ours was a\nconstructive society. Still, being a machine-sitter isn't very much of\na career. And every function that wasn't the prerogative of a machine\ncould be done ten times more quickly and efficiently by some member of\nmy family than I could do it. If I went ahead and did something anyway,\nthey would just do it all over again when they got home.\nSo I had nothing to do all day. I had a special dispensation to\ntake books out of the local Archives, because I was a deficient and\ncouldn't receive the tellie programs. Almost everybody on Earth was\ntelepathic to some degree and could get the amplified projections even\nif he couldn't transmit or receive with his natural powers. But I got\nnothing. I had to derive all my recreation from reading, and you can\nget awfully tired of books, especially when they're all at least a\nhundred years old and written by primitives. I could borrow sound\ntapes, but they also bored me after a while.\nI thought maybe I could develop a talent for composing or painting,\nwhich would classify me as a telesensitive\u2014artistic ability being\nconsidered as the oldest, if least important, psi power\u2014but I couldn't\neven do anything like that.\nAbout all there was left for me was to take long walks. Athletics were\nout of the question; I couldn't compete with psi-boys and they didn't\nwant to compete with me. All the people in the neighborhood knew me\nand were nice to me, but I didn't need to be a 'path to tell what they\nwere saying to one another when I hove into sight. \"There's that oldest\nFaraday boy. Pity, such a talented family, to have a defective.\"\nI didn't have a girl, either. Although some of them were sort of\nattracted to me\u2014I could see that\u2014they could hardly go out with me\nwithout exposing themselves to ridicule. In their sandals, I would have\ndone the same thing, but that didn't stop me from hating them.\nI wished I had been born a couple of hundred years ago\u2014before people\nstarted playing around with nuclear energy and filling the air with\nradiations that they were afraid would turn human beings into hideous\nmonsters. Instead, they developed the psi powers that had always been\nlatent in the species until we developed into a race of supermen. I\ndon't know why I say\nwe\n\u2014in 1960 or so, I might have been considered\nsuperior, but in 2102 I was just the Faradays' idiot boy.\nExploring space should have been my hope. If there had been anything\nuseful or interesting on any of the other planets, I might have found\na niche for myself there. In totally new surroundings, the psi powers\ngeared to another environment might not be an advantage. But by the\ntime I was ten, it was discovered that the other planets were just\nbarren hunks of rock, with pressures and climates and atmospheres\ndrastically unsuited to human life. A year or so before, the hyperdrive\nhad been developed on Earth and ships had been sent out to explore the\nstars, but I had no hope left in that direction any more.\nI was an atavism in a world of peace and plenty. Peace, because people\ncouldn't indulge in war or even crime with so many telepaths running\naround\u2014not because, I told myself, the capacity for primitive behavior\nwasn't just as latent in everybody else as the psi talent seemed latent\nin me. Tim must be right, I thought\u2014I must have some undreamed-of\npower that only the right circumstances would bring out. But what was\nthat power?\nFor years I had speculated on what my potential talent might be,\nexplored every wild possibility I could conceive of and found none\nproductive of even an ambiguous result with which I could fool myself.\nAs I approached adulthood, I began to concede that I was probably\nnothing more than what I seemed to be\u2014a simple psi-negative. Yet, from\ntime to time, hope surged up again, as it had today, in spite of my\nknowledge that my hope was an impossibility. Who ever heard of latent\npsi powers showing themselves in an individual as old as twenty-six?\nI was almost alone in the parks where I used to walk, because people\nliked to commune with one another those days rather than with nature.\nEven gardening had very little popularity. But I found myself most at\nhome in those woodland\u2014or, rather, pseudo-woodland\u2014surroundings,\nable to identify more readily with the trees and flowers than I could\nwith my own kind. A fallen tree or a broken blossom would excite more\nsympathy from me than the minor catastrophes that will beset any\nhousehold, no matter how gifted, and I would shy away from bloody\nnoses or cut fingers, thus giving myself a reputation for callousness\nas well as extrasensory imbecility.\nHowever, I was no more callous in steering clear of human breakdowns\nthan I was in not shedding tears over the household machines when they\nbroke down, for I felt no more closely akin to my parents and siblings\nthan I did to the mechanisms that served and, sometimes, failed us.\nOn that day, I walked farther than I had intended and, by the time I\ngot back home, I found the rest of my family had returned before me.\nThey seemed to be excited about something and were surprised to see me\nso calm.\n\"Aren't you even interested in anything outside your own immediate\nconcerns, Kev?\" Sylvia demanded, despite Father's efforts to shush her.\n\"Can't you remember that Kev isn't able to receive the tellies?\" Tim\nshot back at her. \"He probably doesn't even know what's happened.\"\n\"Well, what did happen?\" I asked, trying not to snap.\n\"One starship got back from Alpha Centauri,\" Danny said excitedly.\n\"There are two inhabited Earth-type planets there!\"\nThis was for me; this was it at last! I tried not to show my\nenthusiasm, though I knew that was futile. My relatives could keep\ntheir thoughts and emotions from me; I couldn't keep mine from them.\n\"What kind of life inhabits them? Humanoid?\"\n\"Uh-uh.\" Danny shook his head. \"And hostile. The crew of the starship\nsays they were attacked immediately on landing. When they turned and\nleft, they were followed here by one of the alien ships. Must be a\npretty advanced race to have spaceships. Anyhow, the extraterrestrial\nship headed back as soon as it got a fix on where ours was going.\"\n\"But if they're hostile,\" I said thoughtfully, \"it might mean war.\"\n\"Of course. That's why everybody's so wrought up. We hope it's peace,\nbut we'll have to prepare for war just in case.\"\nThere hadn't been a war on Earth for well over a hundred years, but\nwe hadn't been so foolish as to obliterate all knowledge of military\ntechniques and weapons. The alien ship wouldn't be able to come back\nwith reinforcements\u2014if such were its intention\u2014in less than six\nmonths. This meant time to get together a stockpile of weapons, though\nwe had no idea of how effective our defenses would be against the\naliens' armament.\nThey might have strange and terrible weapons against which we would\nbe powerless. On the other hand, our side would have the benefits\nof telekinetically guided missiles, teleported saboteurs, telepaths\nto pick up the alien strategy, and prognosticators to determine the\noutcome of each battle and see whether it was worth fighting in the\nfirst place.\nEverybody on Earth hoped for peace. Everybody, that is, except me. I\nhad been unable to achieve any sense of identity with the world in\nwhich I lived, and it was almost worth the loss of personal survival\nto know that my own smug species could look silly against a still more\ntalented race.\n\"It isn't so much our defense that worries me,\" my mother muttered, \"as\nlack of adequate medical machinery. War is bound to mean casualties\nand there aren't enough cure-alls on the planet to take care of them.\nIt's useless to expect the government to build more right now; they'll\nbe too busy producing weapons. Sylvia, you'd better take a leave of\nabsence from your job and come down to Psycho Center to learn first-aid\ntechniques. And you too, Kevin,\" she added, obviously a little\nsurprised herself at what she was saying. \"Probably you'd be even\nbetter at it than Sylvia since you aren't sensitive to other people's\npain.\"\nI looked at her.\n\"It\nis\nan ill wind,\" she agreed, smiling wryly, \"but don't let me\ncatch you thinking that way, Kevin. Can't you see it would be better\nthat there should be no war and you should remain useless?\"\nI couldn't see it, of course, and she knew that, with her wretched\ntalent for stripping away my feeble attempts at privacy. Psi-powers\nusually included some ability to form a mental shield; being without\none, I was necessarily devoid of the other.\nMy attitude didn't matter, though, because it was definitely war. The\naliens came back with a fleet clearly bent on our annihilation\u2014even\nthe 'paths couldn't figure out their motives, for the thought pattern\nwas entirely different from ours\u2014and the war was on.\nI had enjoyed learning first-aid; it was the first time I had ever\nworked with people as an equal. And I was good at it because psi-powers\naren't much of an advantage there. Telekinesis maybe a little, but\nI was big enough to lift anybody without needing any superhuman\nabilities\u2014normal human abilities, rather.\n\"Gee, Mr. Faraday,\" one of the other students breathed, \"you're so\nstrong. And without 'kinesis or anything.\"\nI looked at her and liked what I saw. She was blonde and pretty. \"My\nname's not Mr. Faraday,\" I said. \"It's Kevin.\"\n\"My name's Lucy,\" she giggled.\nNo girl had ever giggled at me in that way before. Immediately I\nstarted to envision a beautiful future for the two of us, then flushed\nwhen I realized that she might be a telepath. But she was winding a\ntourniquet around the arm of another member of the class with apparent\nunconcern.\n\"Hey, quit that!\" the windee yelled. \"You're making it too tight! I'll\nbe mortified!\"\nSo Lucy was obviously not a telepath. Later I found out she was only\na low-grade telesensitive\u2014just a poetess\u2014so I had nothing to worry\nabout as far as having my thoughts read went. I was a little afraid of\nSylvia's kidding me about my first romance, but, as it happened, she\ngot interested in one of the guys who was taking the class with us, and\nshe was not only too busy to be bothered with me, but in too vulnerable\na position herself.\nHowever, when the actual bombs\u2014or their alien equivalent\u2014struck near\nour town, I wasn't nearly so happy, especially after they started\ncarrying the wounded into the Psycho Center, which had been turned into\na hospital for the duration. I took one look at the gory scene\u2014I had\nnever seen anybody really injured before; few people had, as a matter\nof fact\u2014and started for the door. But Mother was already blocking the\nway. It was easy to see from which side of the family Tim had got his\ntalent for prognostication.\n\"If the telepaths who can pick up all the pain can stand this, Kevin,\"\nshe said, \"\nyou\ncertainly can.\" And there was no kindness at all in\nthe\nyou\n.\nShe gave me a shove toward the nearest stretcher. \"Go on\u2014now's your\nchance to show you're of some use in this world.\"\nGritting my teeth, I turned to the man on the stretcher. Something had\npretty near torn half his face away. It was all there, but not in the\nright place, and it wasn't pretty. I turned away, caught my mother's\neye, and then I didn't even dare to throw up. I looked at that smashed\nface again and all the first-aid lessons I'd had flew out of my head as\nif some super-psi had plucked them from me.\nThe man was bleeding terribly. I had never seen blood pouring out like\nthat before. The first thing to do, I figured sickly, was mop it up. I\nwet a sponge and dabbed gingerly at the face, but my hands were shaking\nso hard that the sponge slipped and my fingers were on the raw gaping\nwound. I could feel the warm viscosity of the blood and nothing, not\neven my mother, could keep my meal down this time, I thought.\nMother had uttered a sound of exasperation as I dropped the sponge. I\ncould hear her coming toward me. Then I heard her gasp. I looked at my\npatient and my mouth dropped open. For suddenly there was no wound,\nno wound at all\u2014just a little blood and the fellow's face was whole\nagain. Not even a scar.\n\"Wha\u2014wha happened?\" he asked. \"It doesn't hurt any more!\"\nHe touched his cheek and looked up at me with frightened eyes. And I\nwas frightened, too\u2014too frightened to be sick, too frightened to do\nanything but stare witlessly at him.\n\"Touch some of the others, quick!\" my mother commanded, pushing\nastounded attendants away from stretchers.\nI touched broken limbs and torn bodies and shattered heads, and they\nwere whole again right away. Everybody in the room was looking at me in\nthe way I had always dreamed of being looked at. Lucy was opening and\nshutting her beautiful mouth like a beautiful fish. In fact, the whole\nthing was just like a dream, except that I was awake. I couldn't have\nimagined all those horrors.\nBut the horrors soon weren't horrors any more. I began to find them\nalmost pleasing; the worse a wound was, the more I appreciated it.\nThere was so much more satisfaction, virtually an esthetic thrill, in\nseeing a horrible jagged tear smooth away, heal, not in days, as it\nwould have done under the cure-all, but in seconds.\n\"Timothy was right,\" my mother said, her eyes filled with tears, \"and\nI was wrong ever to have doubted. You have a gift, son\u2014\" and she said\nthe word son loud and clear so that everybody could hear it\u2014\"the\ngreatest gift of all, that of healing.\" She looked at me proudly. And\nLucy and the others looked at me as if I were a god or something.\nI felt ... well, good.\n\"I wonder why we never thought of healing as a potential psi-power,\" my\nmother said to me later, when I was catching a snatch of rest and she\nwas lighting cigarettes and offering me cups of coffee in an attempt to\nmake up twenty-six years of indifference, perhaps dislike, all at once.\n\"The ability to heal\nis\nrecorded in history, only we never paid much\nattention to it.\"\n\"Recorded?\" I asked, a little jealously.\n\"Of course,\" she smiled. \"Remember the King's Evil?\"\nI should have known without her reminding me, after all the old books I\nhad read. \"Scrofula, wasn't it? They called it that because the touch\nof certain kings was supposed to cure it ... and other diseases, too, I\nguess.\"\nShe nodded. \"Certain people must have had the healing power and that's\nprobably why they originally got to be the rulers.\"\nIn a very short time, I became a pretty important person. All the other\ndeficients in the world were tested for the healing power and all of\nthem turned out negative. I proved to be the only human healer alive,\nand not only that, I could work a thousand times more efficiently and\neffectively than any of the machines. The government built a hospital\njust for my work! Wounded people were ferried there from all over the\nworld and I cured them. I could do practically everything except raise\nthe dead and sometimes I wondered whether, with a little practice, I\nwouldn't be able to do even that.\nWhen I came to my new office, whom did I find waiting there for me but\nLucy, her trim figure enhanced by a snug blue and white uniform. \"I'm\nyour assistant, Kev,\" she said shyly.\nI looked at her. \"You are?\"\n\"I\u2014I hope you want me,\" she went on, coyness now mixing with\napprehension.\nI gave her shoulder a squeeze. \"I do want you, Lucy. More than I can\ntell you now. After all this is over, there's something more I want to\nsay. But right now\u2014\" I clapped her arm\u2014\"there's a job to be done.\"\n\"Yes, Kevin,\" she said, glaring at me for some reason I didn't have\ntime to investigate or interpret at the moment. My patients were\nwaiting for me.\nThey gave me everything else I could possibly need, except enough\nsleep, and I myself didn't want that. I wanted to heal. I wanted to\nshow my fellow human beings that, though I couldn't receive or transmit\nthoughts or foretell the future or move things with my mind, all those\npowers were useless without life, and that was what I could give.\nI took pride in my work. It was good to stop pain and ugliness, to know\nthat, if it weren't for me, these people would be dead or permanently\ndisfigured. In a sense, they were\u2014well, my children; I felt a warm\nglow of affection toward them.\nThey felt the same way toward me. I knew because the secret of the\nhospital soon leaked out\u2014during all those years of peace, the\ngovernment had lost whatever facility it had for keeping secrets\u2014and\npeople used to come in droves, hoping for a glimpse of me.\nThe government pointed out that such crowds outside the building might\nattract the enemy's attention. I was the most important individual on\nEarth, they told my followers, and my safety couldn't be risked. The\nhuman race at this stage was pretty docile. The crowds went away. And\nit was right that they should; I didn't want to be risked any more than\nthey wanted to risk me.\nPlenty of people did come to see me officially\u2014the President,\ngenerals, all kinds of big wheels, bringing citations, medals and other\nobsolete honors they'd revived primarily for me. It was wonderful. I\nbegan to love everybody.\n\"Don't you think you're putting too much of yourself into this, Kev?\"\nLucy asked me one day.\nI gave her an incredulous glance. \"You mean I shouldn't help people?\"\n\"Of course you should help them. I didn't mean anything like that.\nJust ... well, you're getting too bound up in your work.\"\n\"Why shouldn't I be?\" Then the truth, as I thought, dawned on me. \"Are\nyou jealous, Lucy?\"\nShe lowered her eyes. \"Not only that, but the war's bound to come to\nan end, you know, and\u2014\"\nIt was the first part of her sentence that interested me. \"Why, do you\nmean\u2014\"\nAnd just then a fresh batch of casualties arrived and I had to tend to\nthem. For the next few days, I was so busy, I didn't get the chance to\nhave the long talk with Lucy I'd wanted....\nThen, after only four months, the war suddenly stopped. It seemed\nthat the aliens' weapons, despite their undeniable mysteriousness,\nwere not equal to ours. And they had the added disadvantage of being\nlight-years away from home base. So the remnant of their fleet took off\nand blew itself up just outside of Mars, which we understood to be the\nequivalent of unconditional surrender. And it was; we never heard from\nthe Centaurians again.\nPeace once more. I had a little mopping up to do at the hospital; then\nI collected my possessions and went back home after a dignitary\u2014only\nthe Vice President this time\u2014had thanked me on behalf of a grateful\ncountry. I wasn't needed any more.\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nJack of No Trades\nBy EVELYN E. SMITH\nIllustrated by CAVAT\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy October 1955.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.]\nI was psick of Psi powers, not having any. Or didn't I? Maybe they'd\npsee otherwise psomeday!\nI walked into the dining room and collided with a floating mass of\nfabric, which promptly draped itself over me like a sentient shroud.\n\"Oh, for God's sake, Kevin!\" my middle brother's voice came muffled\nthrough the folds. \"If you can't help, at least don't hinder!\"\nI managed to struggle out of the tablecloth, even though it seemed to\nbe trying to wrap itself around me. When Danny got excited, he lost his\nmental grip.\n\"I could help,\" I yelled as soon as I got my head free, \"if anybody\nwould let me and, what's more, I could set the table a damn sight\nfaster by hand than you do with 'kinesis.\"\nJust then Father appeared at the head of the table. He could as easily\nhave walked downstairs as teleported, but I belonged to a family of\nexhibitionists. And Father tended to show off as if he were still a\nkid. Not that he looked his age\u2014he was big and blond, like Danny and\nTim and me, and could have passed for our older brother.\n\"Boys, boys!\" he reproved us. \"Danny, you ought to be ashamed of\nyourself\u2014picking on poor Kev.\"\nEven if it hadn't been Danny's fault, he would still have been blamed.\nNobody was ever supposed to raise a voice or a hand or a thought to\npoor afflicted Kev, because nature had picked on me enough. And the\nnicer everybody was to me, the nastier I became, since only when they\nlost their tempers could I get\u2014or so I believed\u2014their true attitude\ntoward me.\nHow else could I tell?\n\"Sorry, fella,\" Dan apologized to me. The tablecloth spread itself out\non the table. \"Wrinkles,\" he grumbled to himself. \"Wrinkles. And I had\nit so nice and smooth before. Mother will be furious.\"\n\"If she were going to be furious, she'd be furious already,\" Father\nreminded him sadly. It must be tough to be married to a deep-probe\ntelepath, I thought, and I felt a sudden wave of sympathy for him. It\nwas so seldom I got the chance to feel sorry for anyone except myself.\n\"But I think you'll find she understands.\"\n\"She knows, all right,\" Danny remarked as he went on into the kitchen,\n\"but I'm not sure she always understands.\"\nI was surprised to find him so perceptive on the abstract level,\nbecause he wasn't what you might call an understanding person, either.\n\"There are tensions in this room,\" my sister announced as she slouched\nin, not quite awake yet, \"and hatred. I could feel them all the way\nupstairs. And today I'm working on the Sleepsweet Mattress copy, so I\nmust feel absolutely tranquil. Everyone will think beautiful thoughts,\nplease.\"\nShe sat down just as a glass of orange juice was arriving at her\nplace; Danny apparently didn't know she'd come in already. The glass\nbumped into the back of her neck, tilted and poured its contents over\nher shoulder and down her very considerable decolletage. Being a mere\nprimitive, I couldn't help laughing.\n\"Danny, you fumbler!\" she screamed.\nDanny erupted from the kitchen. \"How many times have I asked all of you\nnot to sit down until I've got everything on the table? Always a lot of\ninterfering busybodies getting in the way.\"\n\"I don't see why you have to set the table at all,\" she retorted. \"A\nrobot could do it better and faster than you. Even Kev could.\" She\nturned quickly toward me. \"Oh, I am sorry, Kevin.\"\nI didn't say anything; I was too busy pressing my hands down on the\nback of the chair to make my knuckles turn white.\nSylvia's face turned even whiter. \"Father, stop him\u2014\nstop\nhim! He's\nhating again! I can't stand it!\"\nFather looked at me, then at her. \"I don't think he can help it,\nSylvia.\"\nI grinned. \"That's right\u2014I'm just a poor atavism with no control over\nmyself a-tall.\"\nFinally my mother came in from the kitchen; she was an old-fashioned\nwoman and didn't hold with robocooks. One quick glance at me gave her\nthe complete details, even though I quickly protested, \"It's illegal to\nprobe anyone without permission.\"\n\"I used to probe you to find out when you needed your diapers changed,\"\nshe said tartly, \"and I'll probe you now. You should watch yourself,\nSylvia\u2014poor Kevin isn't responsible.\"\nShe didn't need to probe to get the blast of naked emotion that spurted\nout from me. My sister screamed and even Father looked uncomfortable.\nDanny stomped back into the kitchen, muttering to himself.\nMother's lips tightened. \"Sylvia, go upstairs and change your dress.\nKevin, do I have to make an appointment for you at the clinic again?\"\nA psychiatrist never diagnosed members of his own family\u2014that is, not\nofficially; they couldn't help offering thumbnail diagnoses any more\nthan they could help having thumbnails.\n\"No use,\" I said, deciding it was safe to drop into my chair. \"Who can\nadjust me to an environment to which I'm fundamentally unsuited?\"\n\"Maybe there is something physically wrong with him, Amy,\" my father\nsuggested hopefully. \"Maybe you should make an appointment for him at\nthe cure-all?\"\nMother shook her neatly coiffed head. \"He's been to it dozens of times\nand he always checks out in splendid shape. None of us can spare the\ntime to go with him again, just on an off-chance, and he could hardly\nbe allowed to make such a long trip all by himself. Pity there isn't a\nmachine in every community, but, then, we don't really need them.\"\nNow that the virus diseases had been licked, people hardly ever\ngot sick any more and, when they did, it was mostly psychosomatic.\nLife was so well organized that there weren't even many accidents\nthese days. It was a safe, orderly existence for those who fitted\ninto it\u2014which accounted for more than ninety-five per cent of the\npopulation. The only ones who didn't adjust were those who couldn't,\nlike me\u2014psi-deficients, throwbacks to an earlier era. There were no\nphysical cripples, because anybody could have a new arm or a new leg\ngrafted on, but you couldn't graft psi powers onto an atavism or, if\nyou could, the technique hadn't been developed yet.\n\"I feel a sense of impending doom brooding over this household,\" my\nyoungest brother remarked cheerfully as he vaulted into his chair.\n\"You always do, Timothy,\" my mother said, unfolding her napkin. \"And I\nmust say it's not in good taste, especially at breakfast.\"\nHe reached for his juice. \"Guess this is a doomed household. And what\nwas all that emotional uproar about?\"\n\"The usual,\" Sylvia said from the doorway before anyone else could\nanswer. She slid warily into her chair. \"Hey, Dan, I'm here!\" she\ncalled. \"If anything else comes in, it comes in manually, understand?\"\n\"Oh, all right.\" Dan emerged from the kitchen with a tray of food\nfloating ahead of him.\n\"The usual? Trouble with Kev?\" Tim looked at me narrowly. \"Somehow my\nsense of ominousness is connected with him.\"\n\"Well, that's perfectly natural\u2014\" Sylvia began, then stopped as Mother\ncaught her eye.\n\"I didn't mean that,\" Tim said. \"I still say Kev's got something we\ncan't figure out.\"\n\"You've been saying that for years,\" Danny protested, \"and he's been\ntested for every faculty under the Sun. He can't telepath or teleport\nor telekinesthesize or even teletype. He can't precognize or prefix or\nprepossess. He can't\u2014\"\n\"Strictly a bundle of no-talent, that's me,\" I interrupted, trying to\nkeep my animal feelings from getting the better of me. That was how my\nfamily thought of me, I knew\u2014as an animal, and not a very lovable one,\neither.\n\"No,\" Tim said, \"he's just got something we haven't developed a test\nfor. It'll come out some day, you'll see.\" He smiled at me.\nI smiled at him gratefully; he was the only member of my family who\nreally seemed to like me in spite of my handicap. \"It won't work, Tim.\nI know you're trying to be kind, but\u2014\"\n\"He's not saying it just to be kind,\" my mother put in. \"He means it.\nNot that I want to arouse false hopes, Kevin,\" she added with grim\nscrupulousness. \"Tim's awfully young yet and I wouldn't trust his\nextracurricular prognostications too far.\"\nNonetheless, I couldn't help feeling a feeble renewal of old hopes.\nAfter all, young or not, Tim was a hell of a good prognosticator; he\nwouldn't have risen so rapidly to the position he held in the Weather\nBureau if he hadn't been pretty near tops in foreboding.\nMother smiled sadly at my thoughts, but I didn't let that discourage\nme. As Danny had said, she\nknew\nbut she didn't really\nunderstand\n.\nNobody, for all of his or her psi power, really understood me.\nBreakfast was finally over and the rest of my family dispersed to their\nvarious jobs. Father simply took his briefcase and disappeared\u2014he was\na traveling salesman and he had a morning appointment clear across the\ncontinent. The others, not having his particular gift, had to take\nthe helibus to their different destinations. Mother, as I said, was a\npsychiatrist. Sylvia wrote advertising copy. Tim was a meteorologist.\nDan was a junior executive in a furniture moving company and expected a\npromotion to senior rank as soon as he achieved a better mental grip on\npianos.\nOnly I had no job, no profession, no place in life. Of course there\nwere certain menial tasks a psi-negative could perform, but my parents\nwould have none of them\u2014partly for my sake, but mostly for the sake of\ntheir own community standing.\n\"We don't need what little money Kev could bring in,\" my father always\nsaid. \"I can afford to support my family. He can stay home and take\ncare of the house.\"\nAnd that's what I did. Not that there was much to do except call a\ntechno whenever one of the servomechanisms missed a beat. True enough,\nthose things had to be watched mighty carefully because, if they broke\ndown, it sometimes took days before the repair and/or replacement\nrobots could come. There never were enough of them because ours was a\nconstructive society. Still, being a machine-sitter isn't very much of\na career. And every function that wasn't the prerogative of a machine\ncould be done ten times more quickly and efficiently by some member of\nmy family than I could do it. If I went ahead and did something anyway,\nthey would just do it all over again when they got home.\nSo I had nothing to do all day. I had a special dispensation to\ntake books out of the local Archives, because I was a deficient and\ncouldn't receive the tellie programs. Almost everybody on Earth was\ntelepathic to some degree and could get the amplified projections even\nif he couldn't transmit or receive with his natural powers. But I got\nnothing. I had to derive all my recreation from reading, and you can\nget awfully tired of books, especially when they're all at least a\nhundred years old and written by primitives. I could borrow sound\ntapes, but they also bored me after a while.\nI thought maybe I could develop a talent for composing or painting,\nwhich would classify me as a telesensitive\u2014artistic ability being\nconsidered as the oldest, if least important, psi power\u2014but I couldn't\neven do anything like that.\nAbout all there was left for me was to take long walks. Athletics were\nout of the question; I couldn't compete with psi-boys and they didn't\nwant to compete with me. All the people in the neighborhood knew me\nand were nice to me, but I didn't need to be a 'path to tell what they\nwere saying to one another when I hove into sight. \"There's that oldest\nFaraday boy. Pity, such a talented family, to have a defective.\"\nI didn't have a girl, either. Although some of them were sort of\nattracted to me\u2014I could see that\u2014they could hardly go out with me\nwithout exposing themselves to ridicule. In their sandals, I would have\ndone the same thing, but that didn't stop me from hating them.\nI wished I had been born a couple of hundred years ago\u2014before people\nstarted playing around with nuclear energy and filling the air with\nradiations that they were afraid would turn human beings into hideous\nmonsters. Instead, they developed the psi powers that had always been\nlatent in the species until we developed into a race of supermen. I\ndon't know why I say\nwe\n\u2014in 1960 or so, I might have been considered\nsuperior, but in 2102 I was just the Faradays' idiot boy.\nExploring space should have been my hope. If there had been anything\nuseful or interesting on any of the other planets, I might have found\na niche for myself there. In totally new surroundings, the psi powers\ngeared to another environment might not be an advantage. But by the\ntime I was ten, it was discovered that the other planets were just\nbarren hunks of rock, with pressures and climates and atmospheres\ndrastically unsuited to human life. A year or so before, the hyperdrive\nhad been developed on Earth and ships had been sent out to explore the\nstars, but I had no hope left in that direction any more.\nI was an atavism in a world of peace and plenty. Peace, because people\ncouldn't indulge in war or even crime with so many telepaths running\naround\u2014not because, I told myself, the capacity for primitive behavior\nwasn't just as latent in everybody else as the psi talent seemed latent\nin me. Tim must be right, I thought\u2014I must have some undreamed-of\npower that only the right circumstances would bring out. But what was\nthat power?\nFor years I had speculated on what my potential talent might be,\nexplored every wild possibility I could conceive of and found none\nproductive of even an ambiguous result with which I could fool myself.\nAs I approached adulthood, I began to concede that I was probably\nnothing more than what I seemed to be\u2014a simple psi-negative. Yet, from\ntime to time, hope surged up again, as it had today, in spite of my\nknowledge that my hope was an impossibility. Who ever heard of latent\npsi powers showing themselves in an individual as old as twenty-six?\nI was almost alone in the parks where I used to walk, because people\nliked to commune with one another those days rather than with nature.\nEven gardening had very little popularity. But I found myself most at\nhome in those woodland\u2014or, rather, pseudo-woodland\u2014surroundings,\nable to identify more readily with the trees and flowers than I could\nwith my own kind. A fallen tree or a broken blossom would excite more\nsympathy from me than the minor catastrophes that will beset any\nhousehold, no matter how gifted, and I would shy away from bloody\nnoses or cut fingers, thus giving myself a reputation for callousness\nas well as extrasensory imbecility.\nHowever, I was no more callous in steering clear of human breakdowns\nthan I was in not shedding tears over the household machines when they\nbroke down, for I felt no more closely akin to my parents and siblings\nthan I did to the mechanisms that served and, sometimes, failed us.\nOn that day, I walked farther than I had intended and, by the time I\ngot back home, I found the rest of my family had returned before me.\nThey seemed to be excited about something and were surprised to see me\nso calm.\n\"Aren't you even interested in anything outside your own immediate\nconcerns, Kev?\" Sylvia demanded, despite Father's efforts to shush her.\n\"Can't you remember that Kev isn't able to receive the tellies?\" Tim\nshot back at her. \"He probably doesn't even know what's happened.\"\n\"Well, what did happen?\" I asked, trying not to snap.\n\"One starship got back from Alpha Centauri,\" Danny said excitedly.\n\"There are two inhabited Earth-type planets there!\"\nThis was for me; this was it at last! I tried not to show my\nenthusiasm, though I knew that was futile. My relatives could keep\ntheir thoughts and emotions from me; I couldn't keep mine from them.\n\"What kind of life inhabits them? Humanoid?\"\n\"Uh-uh.\" Danny shook his head. \"And hostile. The crew of the starship\nsays they were attacked immediately on landing. When they turned and\nleft, they were followed here by one of the alien ships. Must be a\npretty advanced race to have spaceships. Anyhow, the extraterrestrial\nship headed back as soon as it got a fix on where ours was going.\"\n\"But if they're hostile,\" I said thoughtfully, \"it might mean war.\"\n\"Of course. That's why everybody's so wrought up. We hope it's peace,\nbut we'll have to prepare for war just in case.\"\nThere hadn't been a war on Earth for well over a hundred years, but\nwe hadn't been so foolish as to obliterate all knowledge of military\ntechniques and weapons. The alien ship wouldn't be able to come back\nwith reinforcements\u2014if such were its intention\u2014in less than six\nmonths. This meant time to get together a stockpile of weapons, though\nwe had no idea of how effective our defenses would be against the\naliens' armament.\nThey might have strange and terrible weapons against which we would\nbe powerless. On the other hand, our side would have the benefits\nof telekinetically guided missiles, teleported saboteurs, telepaths\nto pick up the alien strategy, and prognosticators to determine the\noutcome of each battle and see whether it was worth fighting in the\nfirst place.\nEverybody on Earth hoped for peace. Everybody, that is, except me. I\nhad been unable to achieve any sense of identity with the world in\nwhich I lived, and it was almost worth the loss of personal survival\nto know that my own smug species could look silly against a still more\ntalented race.\n\"It isn't so much our defense that worries me,\" my mother muttered, \"as\nlack of adequate medical machinery. War is bound to mean casualties\nand there aren't enough cure-alls on the planet to take care of them.\nIt's useless to expect the government to build more right now; they'll\nbe too busy producing weapons. Sylvia, you'd better take a leave of\nabsence from your job and come down to Psycho Center to learn first-aid\ntechniques. And you too, Kevin,\" she added, obviously a little\nsurprised herself at what she was saying. \"Probably you'd be even\nbetter at it than Sylvia since you aren't sensitive to other people's\npain.\"\nI looked at her.\n\"It\nis\nan ill wind,\" she agreed, smiling wryly, \"but don't let me\ncatch you thinking that way, Kevin. Can't you see it would be better\nthat there should be no war and you should remain useless?\"\nI couldn't see it, of course, and she knew that, with her wretched\ntalent for stripping away my feeble attempts at privacy. Psi-powers\nusually included some ability to form a mental shield; being without\none, I was necessarily devoid of the other.\nMy attitude didn't matter, though, because it was definitely war. The\naliens came back with a fleet clearly bent on our annihilation\u2014even\nthe 'paths couldn't figure out their motives, for the thought pattern\nwas entirely different from ours\u2014and the war was on.\nI had enjoyed learning first-aid; it was the first time I had ever\nworked with people as an equal. And I was good at it because psi-powers\naren't much of an advantage there. Telekinesis maybe a little, but\nI was big enough to lift anybody without needing any superhuman\nabilities\u2014normal human abilities, rather.\n\"Gee, Mr. Faraday,\" one of the other students breathed, \"you're so\nstrong. And without 'kinesis or anything.\"\nI looked at her and liked what I saw. She was blonde and pretty. \"My\nname's not Mr. Faraday,\" I said. \"It's Kevin.\"\n\"My name's Lucy,\" she giggled.\nNo girl had ever giggled at me in that way before. Immediately I\nstarted to envision a beautiful future for the two of us, then flushed\nwhen I realized that she might be a telepath. But she was winding a\ntourniquet around the arm of another member of the class with apparent\nunconcern.\n\"Hey, quit that!\" the windee yelled. \"You're making it too tight! I'll\nbe mortified!\"\nSo Lucy was obviously not a telepath. Later I found out she was only\na low-grade telesensitive\u2014just a poetess\u2014so I had nothing to worry\nabout as far as having my thoughts read went. I was a little afraid of\nSylvia's kidding me about my first romance, but, as it happened, she\ngot interested in one of the guys who was taking the class with us, and\nshe was not only too busy to be bothered with me, but in too vulnerable\na position herself.\nHowever, when the actual bombs\u2014or their alien equivalent\u2014struck near\nour town, I wasn't nearly so happy, especially after they started\ncarrying the wounded into the Psycho Center, which had been turned into\na hospital for the duration. I took one look at the gory scene\u2014I had\nnever seen anybody really injured before; few people had, as a matter\nof fact\u2014and started for the door. But Mother was already blocking the\nway. It was easy to see from which side of the family Tim had got his\ntalent for prognostication.\n\"If the telepaths who can pick up all the pain can stand this, Kevin,\"\nshe said, \"\nyou\ncertainly can.\" And there was no kindness at all in\nthe\nyou\n.\nShe gave me a shove toward the nearest stretcher. \"Go on\u2014now's your\nchance to show you're of some use in this world.\"\nGritting my teeth, I turned to the man on the stretcher. Something had\npretty near torn half his face away. It was all there, but not in the\nright place, and it wasn't pretty. I turned away, caught my mother's\neye, and then I didn't even dare to throw up. I looked at that smashed\nface again and all the first-aid lessons I'd had flew out of my head as\nif some super-psi had plucked them from me.\nThe man was bleeding terribly. I had never seen blood pouring out like\nthat before. The first thing to do, I figured sickly, was mop it up. I\nwet a sponge and dabbed gingerly at the face, but my hands were shaking\nso hard that the sponge slipped and my fingers were on the raw gaping\nwound. I could feel the warm viscosity of the blood and nothing, not\neven my mother, could keep my meal down this time, I thought.\nMother had uttered a sound of exasperation as I dropped the sponge. I\ncould hear her coming toward me. Then I heard her gasp. I looked at my\npatient and my mouth dropped open. For suddenly there was no wound,\nno wound at all\u2014just a little blood and the fellow's face was whole\nagain. Not even a scar.\n\"Wha\u2014wha happened?\" he asked. \"It doesn't hurt any more!\"\nHe touched his cheek and looked up at me with frightened eyes. And I\nwas frightened, too\u2014too frightened to be sick, too frightened to do\nanything but stare witlessly at him.\n\"Touch some of the others, quick!\" my mother commanded, pushing\nastounded attendants away from stretchers.\nI touched broken limbs and torn bodies and shattered heads, and they\nwere whole again right away. Everybody in the room was looking at me in\nthe way I had always dreamed of being looked at. Lucy was opening and\nshutting her beautiful mouth like a beautiful fish. In fact, the whole\nthing was just like a dream, except that I was awake. I couldn't have\nimagined all those horrors.\nBut the horrors soon weren't horrors any more. I began to find them\nalmost pleasing; the worse a wound was, the more I appreciated it.\nThere was so much more satisfaction, virtually an esthetic thrill, in\nseeing a horrible jagged tear smooth away, heal, not in days, as it\nwould have done under the cure-all, but in seconds.\n\"Timothy was right,\" my mother said, her eyes filled with tears, \"and\nI was wrong ever to have doubted. You have a gift, son\u2014\" and she said\nthe word son loud and clear so that everybody could hear it\u2014\"the\ngreatest gift of all, that of healing.\" She looked at me proudly. And\nLucy and the others looked at me as if I were a god or something.\nI felt ... well, good.\n\"I wonder why we never thought of healing as a potential psi-power,\" my\nmother said to me later, when I was catching a snatch of rest and she\nwas lighting cigarettes and offering me cups of coffee in an attempt to\nmake up twenty-six years of indifference, perhaps dislike, all at once.\n\"The ability to heal\nis\nrecorded in history, only we never paid much\nattention to it.\"\n\"Recorded?\" I asked, a little jealously.\n\"Of course,\" she smiled. \"Remember the King's Evil?\"\nI should have known without her reminding me, after all the old books I\nhad read. \"Scrofula, wasn't it? They called it that because the touch\nof certain kings was supposed to cure it ... and other diseases, too, I\nguess.\"\nShe nodded. \"Certain people must have had the healing power and that's\nprobably why they originally got to be the rulers.\"\nIn a very short time, I became a pretty important person. All the other\ndeficients in the world were tested for the healing power and all of\nthem turned out negative. I proved to be the only human healer alive,\nand not only that, I could work a thousand times more efficiently and\neffectively than any of the machines. The government built a hospital\njust for my work! Wounded people were ferried there from all over the\nworld and I cured them. I could do practically everything except raise\nthe dead and sometimes I wondered whether, with a little practice, I\nwouldn't be able to do even that.\nWhen I came to my new office, whom did I find waiting there for me but\nLucy, her trim figure enhanced by a snug blue and white uniform. \"I'm\nyour assistant, Kev,\" she said shyly.\nI looked at her. \"You are?\"\n\"I\u2014I hope you want me,\" she went on, coyness now mixing with\napprehension.\nI gave her shoulder a squeeze. \"I do want you, Lucy. More than I can\ntell you now. After all this is over, there's something more I want to\nsay. But right now\u2014\" I clapped her arm\u2014\"there's a job to be done.\"\n\"Yes, Kevin,\" she said, glaring at me for some reason I didn't have\ntime to investigate or interpret at the moment. My patients were\nwaiting for me.\nThey gave me everything else I could possibly need, except enough\nsleep, and I myself didn't want that. I wanted to heal. I wanted to\nshow my fellow human beings that, though I couldn't receive or transmit\nthoughts or foretell the future or move things with my mind, all those\npowers were useless without life, and that was what I could give.\nI took pride in my work. It was good to stop pain and ugliness, to know\nthat, if it weren't for me, these people would be dead or permanently\ndisfigured. In a sense, they were\u2014well, my children; I felt a warm\nglow of affection toward them.\nThey felt the same way toward me. I knew because the secret of the\nhospital soon leaked out\u2014during all those years of peace, the\ngovernment had lost whatever facility it had for keeping secrets\u2014and\npeople used to come in droves, hoping for a glimpse of me.\nThe government pointed out that such crowds outside the building might\nattract the enemy's attention. I was the most important individual on\nEarth, they told my followers, and my safety couldn't be risked. The\nhuman race at this stage was pretty docile. The crowds went away. And\nit was right that they should; I didn't want to be risked any more than\nthey wanted to risk me.\nPlenty of people did come to see me officially\u2014the President,\ngenerals, all kinds of big wheels, bringing citations, medals and other\nobsolete honors they'd revived primarily for me. It was wonderful. I\nbegan to love everybody.\n\"Don't you think you're putting too much of yourself into this, Kev?\"\nLucy asked me one day.\nI gave her an incredulous glance. \"You mean I shouldn't help people?\"\n\"Of course you should help them. I didn't mean anything like that.\nJust ... well, you're getting too bound up in your work.\"\n\"Why shouldn't I be?\" Then the truth, as I thought, dawned on me. \"Are\nyou jealous, Lucy?\"\nShe lowered her eyes. \"Not only that, but the war's bound to come to\nan end, you know, and\u2014\"\nIt was the first part of her sentence that interested me. \"Why, do you\nmean\u2014\"\nAnd just then a fresh batch of casualties arrived and I had to tend to\nthem. For the next few days, I was so busy, I didn't get the chance to\nhave the long talk with Lucy I'd wanted....\nThen, after only four months, the war suddenly stopped. It seemed\nthat the aliens' weapons, despite their undeniable mysteriousness,\nwere not equal to ours. And they had the added disadvantage of being\nlight-years away from home base. So the remnant of their fleet took off\nand blew itself up just outside of Mars, which we understood to be the\nequivalent of unconditional surrender. And it was; we never heard from\nthe Centaurians again.\nPeace once more. I had a little mopping up to do at the hospital; then\nI collected my possessions and went back home after a dignitary\u2014only\nthe Vice President this time\u2014had thanked me on behalf of a grateful\ncountry. I wasn't needed any more.\n", "summary": "The story begins with a family sitting around a table discussing the state of affairs on Earth. The family is discussing how they are worried about the impending war with the aliens, and how they will be able to defend themselves against the invaders. The father of the family, Father, is a traveling salesman, and he has a morning appointment at the Plaza Ritz Arms. His wife, Sylvia, is worried about her husband's well-being, and the mother worries about the lack of enough medical machinery on Earth to take care of the wounded. The mother is worried that the war will lead to more casualties, and she worries that there are not enough cure-alls on the planet. The children are also worried about what will happen to them once the war is over, as they have never been through a war before.   The story then moves to the present, where the family is sitting around the dining room table, discussing the future of Earth and the aliens. The story ends with the family in a heated argument.", "faithfulness": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}

SMITH\nIllustrated by WEISS\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.]\nIt's easy to find a solution when there is one\u2014the trick is to do it\nif there is none!\nI glanced at the path we had made across the\nMare Serenitatis\n. The\nLatin translated as \"the Sea of Serenity.\" It was well named because,\nas far as the eye could see in every direction, there was a smooth\nlayer of pumice that resembled the surface of a calm sea. Scattered\nacross the quiet sea of virgin Moon dust were occasional islands\nof rock that jutted abruptly toward the infinity of stars above.\nConsidering everything, our surroundings conveyed a sense of serenity\nlike none I had ever felt.\nOur bounding path across the level expanse was clearly marked. Because\nof the light gravity, we had leaped high into the air with each step\nand every time we struck the ground, the impact had raised a cloud of\ndustlike pumice. Now the clouds of dust were slowly settling in the\nlight gravity.\nAbove us, the stars were cold, motionless and crystal-clear.\nIndifferently, they sprayed a faint light on our surroundings ... a\ndim glow that was hardly sufficient for normal vision and was too weak\nto be reflected toward Earth.\nWe turned our head-lamps on the strange object before us. Five beams\nof light illuminated the smooth shape that protruded from the Moon's\nsurface.\nThe incongruity was so awesome that for several minutes, we remained\nmotionless and quiet. Miller broke the silence with his quavering\nvoice, \"Strange someone didn't notice it before.\"\nStrange? The object rose a quarter of a mile above us, a huge, curving\nhulk of smooth metal. It was featureless and yet conveyed a sense\nof\nalienness\n. It was alien and yet it wasn't a natural formation.\nSomething had made the thing, whatever it was. But was it strange that\nit hadn't been noticed before? Men had lived on the Moon for over a\nyear, but the Moon was vast and the\nMare Serenitatis\ncovered three\nhundred and forty thousand square miles.\n\"What is it?\" Marie asked breathlessly.\nHer husband grunted his bafflement. \"Who knows? But see how it curves?\nIf it's a perfect sphere, it must be at least two miles in diameter!\"\n\"If it's a perfect sphere,\" Miller suggested, \"most of it must be\nbeneath the Moon's surface.\"\n\"Maybe it isn't a sphere,\" my wife said. \"Maybe this is all of it.\"\n\"Let's call Lunar City and tell the authorities about it.\" I reached\nfor the radio controls on my suit.\nKane grabbed my arm. \"No. Let's find out whatever we can by ourselves.\nIf we tell the authorities, they'll order us to leave it alone. If we\ndiscover something really important, we'll be famous!\"\nI lowered my arm. His outburst seemed faintly childish to me. And yet\nit carried a good measure of common sense. If we discovered proof of\nan alien race, we would indeed be famous. The more we discovered for\nourselves, the more famous we'd be. Fame was practically a synonym for\nprestige and wealth.\n\"All right,\" I conceded.\nMiller stepped forward, moving slowly in the bulk of his spacesuit.\nDeliberately, he removed a small torch from his side and pressed the\nbrilliant flame against the metal.\nA few minutes later, the elderly mineralogist gave his opinion: \"It's\nsteel ... made thousands of years ago.\"\nSomeone gasped over the intercom, \"Thousands of years! But wouldn't it\nbe in worse shape than this if it was that old?\"\nMiller pointed at the small cut his torch had made in the metal. The\nnotch was only a quarter of an inch deep. \"I say\nsteel\nbecause it's\nsimilar\nto steel. Actually, it's a much stronger alloy. Besides that,\non the Moon, there's been no water or atmosphere to rust it. Not even\na wind to disturb its surface. It's\nat least\nseveral thousand years\nold.\"\nWe slowly circled the alien structure. Several minutes later, Kane\nshouted, \"Look!\"\nA few feet above the ground, the structure's smooth surface was broken\nby a circular opening that yawned invitingly. Kane ran ahead and\nflashed his head-lamp into the dark recess.\n\"There's a small room inside,\" he told us, and climbed through the\nopening.\nWe waited outside and focused our lamps through the five-foot opening\nto give him as much light as possible.\n\"Come on in, Marie,\" he called to his wife. \"This is really something!\nIt\nmust\nbe an alien race. There's all kinds of weird drawings on the\nwalls and gadgets that look like controls for something....\"\nBriefly, my lamp flickered over Marie's pale face. Her features\nstruggled with two conflicting emotions: She was frightened by the\nalienness of the thing and yet she wanted to be with her husband. She\nhesitated momentarily, then climbed through the passage.\n\"You want to go in?\" my wife asked.\n\"Do you?\"\n\"Let's.\"\nI helped Verana through the opening, climbed through myself and turned\nto help Miller.\nMiller was sixty years old. He was an excellent mineralogist, alert\nmentally, but with a body that was almost feeble. I reached out to help\nhim as he stepped into the passageway.\nFor a brief second, he was framed in the opening, a dark silhouette\nagainst the star-studded sky.\nThe next second, he was thrown twenty yards into the air. He gasped\nwith pain when he struck the ground. \"\nSomething\npushed me!\"\n\"Are you all right?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nHe had fallen on a spot beyond our angle of vision. I started through\nthe passage....\n... and struck an invisible solid wall.\nMy eyes were on the circular opening. A metal panel emerged from a\nrecess on one side and slid across the passage. The room darkened with\nthe absence of starlight.\n\"\nWhat happened?\n\"\n\"The door to this damned place closed,\" I explained.\n\"\nWhat?\n\"\nBefore we could recover from the shock, the room filled with a\nbrilliant glare. We turned off our lamps.\nThe room was approximately twelve feet long and nine feet wide. The\nceiling was only a few inches above our heads and when I looked at the\nsmooth, hard metal, I felt as if I were trapped in some alien vault.\nThe walls of the room were covered with strange drawings and\ninstruments. Here and there, kaleidoscopic lights pulsed rhythmically.\nKane brushed past me and beat his gloved fists against the metal door\nthat had imprisoned us.\n\"Miller!\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"See if you can get this thing open from the outside.\"\nI knelt before the door and explored its surface with my fingers. There\nwere no visible recesses or controls.\nOver the intercom network, everyone's breath mingled and formed a\nrough, harsh sound. I could discern the women's quick, frightened\nbreaths that were almost sobs. Kane's breath was deep and strong;\nMiller's was faltering and weak.\n\"Miller, get help!\"\n\"I'll\u2014\" The sound of his breathing ceased. We listened intently.\n\"What happened to him?\"\n\"I'll phone Lunar City.\" My fingers fumbled at the radio controls and\ntrembled beneath the thick gloves.\nI turned the dials that would connect my radio with Lunar City....\nStatic grated against my ear drums.\nStatic!\nI listened to the harsh, erratic sound and my voice was weak by\ncomparison: \"Calling Lunar City.\"\n\"Static!\" Kane echoed my thoughts. His frown made deep clefts between\nhis eyebrows. \"There's no static between inter-lunar radio!\"\nVerana's voice was small and frightened. \"That sounds like the static\nwe hear over the bigger radios when we broadcast to Earth.\"\n\"It does,\" Marie agreed.\n\"But we wouldn't have that kind of static over\nour\nradio, unless\u2014\"\nVerana's eyes widened until the pupils were surrounded by circles of\nwhite\u2014\"unless we were in outer space!\"\nWe stared at the metal door that had imprisoned us, afraid even to\nspeak of our fantastic suspicion.\nI deactivated my radio.\nMarie screamed as an inner door opened to disclose a long, narrow\ncorridor beyond.\nSimultaneous with the opening of the second door, I felt air press\nagainst my spacesuit. Before, our suits had been puffed outward by the\npressure of air inside. Now our spacesuits were slack and dangling on\nour bodies.\nWe looked at each other and then at the inviting corridor beyond the\nopen door.\nWe went single file, first Kane, then his wife Marie. Verana followed\nnext and I was the last.\nWe walked slowly, examining the strange construction. The walls were\nfeatureless but still seemed alien. At various places on the walls were\nthe outlines of doors without handles or locks.\nKane pressed his shoulder against a door and shoved. The door was\nunyielding.\nI manipulated the air-vent controls of my spacesuit, allowed a small\namount of the corridor's air into my helmet and inhaled cautiously.\nIt smelled all right. I waited and nothing happened. Gradually, I\nincreased the intake, turned off the oxygenating machines and removed\nmy helmet.\n\"Shut off your oxy,\" I suggested. \"We might as well breathe the air in\nthis place and save our supply. We may need the oxygen in our suits\nlater.\"\nThey saw that I had removed my helmet and was still alive and one by\none removed their own helmets.\nAt the end of the corridor, Kane stopped before a blank wall. The sweat\non his face glistened dully; his chest rose and fell rapidly. Kane was\na pilot and one of the prerequisites for the job of guiding tons of\nmetal between Earth and the Moon was a good set of nerves. Kane excited\neasily, his temper was fiery, but his nerves were like steel.\n\"The end of the line,\" he grunted.\nAs though to disprove the statement, a door on his right side opened\nsoundlessly.\nHe went through the doorway as if shoved violently by an invisible hand.\nThe door closed behind him.\nMarie threw herself at the door and beat at the metal. \"Harry!\"\nVerana rushed to her side. Another door on the opposite side of the\ncorridor opened silently. The door was behind them; they didn't notice.\nBefore I could warn them, Marie floated across the corridor, through\nthe doorway.\nVerana and I stared at the darkness beyond the opening, our muscles\nfrozen by shock.\nThe door closed behind Marie's screaming, struggling form.\nVerana's face was white with fear. Apprehensively, she glanced at the\nother doors that lined the hall.\nI put my arms around her, held her close.\n\"Antigravity machines, force rays,\" I suggested worriedly.\nFor several minutes, we remained motionless and silent. I recalled the\npreceding events of the day, searched for a sense of normality in them.\nThe Kanes, Miller, Verana and I lived in Lunar City with hundreds of\nother people. Mankind had inhabited the Moon for over a year. Means\nof recreation were scarce. Many people explored the place to amuse\nthemselves. After supper, we had decided to take a walk. As simple as\nthat: a walk on the Moon.\nWe had expected only the familiar craters, chasms and weird rock\nformations. A twist of fate and here we were: imprisoned in an alien\nship.\nMy legs quivered with fatigue, my heart throbbed heavily, Verana's\nperfume dizzied me. No, it wasn't a dream. Despite our incredible\nsituation, there was no sensation of unreality.\nI took Verana's hand and led her down the long corridor, retracing our\nsteps.\nWe had walked not more than two yards when the rest of the doors\nopened soundlessly.\nVerana's hand flew to her mouth to stifle a gasp.\nSix doors were now open. The only two that remained closed were the\nones that the Kanes had unwillingly entered.\nThis time, no invisible hand thrust us into any of the rooms.\nI entered the nearest one. Verana followed hesitantly.\nThe walls of the large room were lined with shelves containing\nthousands of variously colored boxes and bottles. A table and four\nchairs were located in the center of the green, plasticlike floor. Each\nchair had no back, only a curving platform with a single supporting\ncolumn.\n\"Ed!\" I joined Verana on the other side of the room. She pointed a\ntrembling finger at some crude drawings. \"The things in this room are\nfood!\"\nThe drawings were so simple that anyone could have understood them.\nThe first drawing portrayed a naked man and woman removing boxes and\nbottles from the shelves. The second picture showed the couple opening\nthe containers. The third showed the man eating from one of the boxes\nand the woman drinking from a bottle.\n\"Let's see how it tastes,\" I said.\nI selected an orange-colored box. The lid dissolved at the touch of my\nfingers.\nThe only contents were small cubes of a soft orange substance.\nI tasted a small piece.\n\"Chocolate! Just like chocolate!\"\nVerana chose a nearby bottle and drank some of the bluish liquid.\n\"Milk!\" she exclaimed.\n\"Perhaps we'd better look at the other rooms,\" I told her.\nThe next room we examined was obviously for recreation. Containers were\nfilled with dozens of strange games and books of instructions in the\nform of simple drawings. The games were foreign, but designed in such a\nfashion that they would be interesting to Earthmen.\nTwo of the rooms were sleeping quarters. The floors were covered with a\nspongy substance and the lights were dim and soothing.\nAnother room contained a small bathing pool, running water,\nwaste-disposal units and yellow cakes of soap.\nThe last room was an observatory. The ceiling and an entire wall were\ntransparent. Outside, the stars shone clearly for a few seconds, then\ndisappeared for an equal time, only to reappear in a different position.\n\"Hyper-space drive,\" Verana whispered softly. She was fascinated by\nthe movement of the stars. For years, our scientists had sought a\nhyperspatial drive to conquer the stars.\nWe selected a comfortable chair facing the transparent wall, lit\ncigarettes and waited.\nA few minutes later, Marie entered the room.\nI noticed with some surprise that her face was calm. If she was\nexcited, her actions didn't betray it.\nShe sat next to Verana.\n\"What happened?\" my wife asked.\nMarie crossed her legs and began in a rambling manner as if discussing\na new recipe, \"That was really a surprise, wasn't it? I was scared\nsilly, at first. That room was dark and I didn't know what to expect.\nSomething touched my head and I heard a telepathic voice\u2014\"\n\"Telepathic?\" Verana interrupted.\n\"Yes. Well, this voice said not to worry and that it wasn't going to\nhurt me. It said it only wanted to learn something about us. It was\nthe\noddest\nfeeling! All the time, this voice kept talking to me in\na nice way and made me feel at ease ... and at the same time, I felt\nsomething\nsearch my mind and gather information. I could actually\nfeel\nit search my memories!\"\n\"What memories?\" I inquired.\nShe frowned with concentration. \"Memories of high school mostly. It\nseemed interested in English and history classes. And then it searched\nfor memories of our customs and lives in general....\"\nKane stalked into the room at that moment, his face red with anger.\n\"\nDo you know where we are?\n\" he demanded. \"When those damned aliens\ngot me in that room, they explained what this is all about. We're\nguinea pigs!\"\n\"Did they use telepathy to explain?\" Verana asked. I suddenly\nremembered that she was a member of a club that investigated\nextra-sensory perception with the hope of learning how it operated. She\nwas probably sorry she hadn't been contacted telepathically.\n\"Yeah,\" Kane replied. \"I saw all sorts of mental pictures and they\nexplained what they did to us. Those damned aliens want us for their\nzoo!\"\n\"Start at the beginning,\" I suggested.\nHe flashed an angry glance at me, but seemed to calm somewhat. \"This\nship was made by a race from another galaxy. Thousands of years ago,\nthey came to Earth in their spaceships when men were primitives living\nin caves. They wanted to know what our civilization would be like\nwhen we developed space flight. So they put this ship on the Moon as a\nsort of booby-trap. They put it there with the idea that when we made\nspaceships and went to the Moon, sooner or later, we'd find the ship\nand enter it\u2014\nlike rabbits in a snare!\n\"\n\"And now the booby-trap is on its way home,\" I guessed.\n\"Yeah, this ship is taking us to their planet and they're going to keep\nus there while they study us.\"\n\"How long will the trip take?\" I asked.\n\"Six months. We'll be bottled up in this crate for six whole damned\nmonths! And when we get there, we'll be prisoners!\"\nMarie's hypnotic spell was fading and once more her face showed the\nterror inside her.\n\"Don't feel so bad,\" I told Kane. \"It could be worse. It should be\ninteresting to see an alien race. We'll have our wives with us\u2014\"\n\"Maybe they'll dissect us!\" Marie gasped.\nVerana scoffed. \"A race intelligent enough to build a ship like this? A\nrace that was traveling between the stars when we were living in caves?\nDissection is primitive. They won't\nhave to\ndissect us in order to\nstudy us. They'll have more advanced methods.\"\n\"Maybe we can reach the ship's controls somehow,\" Kane said excitedly.\n\"We've got to try to change the ship's course and get back to the\nMoon!\"\n\"It's impossible. Don't waste your time.\" The voice had no visible\nsource and seemed to fill the room.\nVerana snapped her fingers. \"So that's why the aliens read Marie's\nmind! They wanted to learn our language so they could talk to us!\"\nKane whirled in a complete circle, glaring at each of the four walls.\n\"Where are you?\nWho\nare you?\"\n\"I'm located in a part of the ship you can't reach. I'm a machine.\"\n\"Is anyone else aboard besides ourselves?\"\n\"No. I control the ship.\" Although the voice spoke without stilted\nphrases, the tone was cold and mechanical.\n\"What are your\u2014your masters going to do with us?\" Marie asked\nanxiously.\n\"You won't be harmed. My masters merely wish to question and examine\nyou. Thousands of years ago, they wondered what your race would be like\nwhen it developed to the space-flight stage. They left this ship on\nyour Moon only because they were curious. My masters have no animosity\ntoward your race, only compassion and curiosity.\"\nI remembered the way antigravity rays had shoved Miller from the ship\nand asked the machine, \"Why didn't you let our fifth member board the\nship?\"\n\"The trip to my makers' planet will take six months. There are food,\noxygen and living facilities for four only of your race. I had to\nprevent the fifth from entering the ship.\"\n\"Come on,\" Kane ordered. \"We'll search this ship room by room and we'll\nfind some way to make it take us back to Earth.\"\n\"It's useless,\" the ship warned us.\nFor five hours, we minutely examined every room. We had no tools to\nforce our way through solid metal walls to the engine or control rooms.\nThe only things in the ship that could be lifted and carried about were\nthe containers of food and alien games. None were sufficiently heavy or\nhard enough to put even a scratch in the heavy metal.\nSix rooms were open to our use. The two rooms in which the Kanes had\nbeen imprisoned were locked and there were no controls or locks to work\non.\nThe rooms that we could enter were without doors, except the ones that\nopened into the corridor.\nAfter intensive searching, we realized there was\nno way\nto damage the\nship or reach any section other than our allotted space.\nWe gave up.\nThe women went to the sleeping compartments to rest and Kane I went to\nthe \"kitchen.\"\nAt random, we sampled the variously colored boxes and bottles and\ndiscussed our predicament.\n\"Trapped,\" Kane said angrily. \"Trapped in a steel prison.\" He slammed\nhis fist against the table top. \"But there must be a way to get out!\nEvery problem has a solution!\"\n\"You sure?\" I asked.\n\"What?\"\n\"\nDoes\nevery problem have a solution? I don't believe it. Some\nproblems are too great. Take the problem of a murderer in our\ncivilization: John Doe has killed someone and his problem is to escape.\nPrimarily, a murderer's problem is the same principle as ours. A\nmurderer has to outwit an entire civilization. We have to outwit an\nentire civilization that was hundreds of times more advanced than ours\nis now when we were clubbing animals and eating the meat raw. Damned\nfew criminals get away these days, even though they've got such crowds\nto lose themselves in. All we have is a ship that we can't control. I\ndon't think we have a chance.\"\nMy resignation annoyed him. Each of us had reacted differently: Kane's\nwife was frightened, Verana was calm because of an inner serenity that\nfew people have, I was resigned and Kane was angry.\nFor several minutes, we sampled the different foods. Every one had a\ndistinctive flavor, comparable to that of a fruit or vegetable on Earth.\nKane lifted a brown bottle to his lips, took a huge gulp and almost\nchoked.\n\"Whiskey!\"\n\"My masters realized your race would develop intoxicants and tried to\ncreate a comparable one,\" the machine explained.\nI selected a brown bottle and sampled the liquid. \"A little stronger\nthan our own,\" I informed the machine.\nWe drank until Kane was staggering about the room, shouting insults at\nthe alien race and the mechanical voice that seemed to be everywhere.\nHe beat his fist against a wall until blood trickled from bruised\nknuckles.\n\"Please don't hurt yourself,\" the machine pleaded.\n\"\nWhy?\n\" Kane screamed at the ceiling. \"Why should you care?\"\n\"My masters will be displeased with me if you arrive in a damaged\ncondition.\"\nKane banged his head against a bulkhead; an ugly bruise formed rapidly.\n\"Shtop me, then!\"\n\"I can't. My masters created no way for me to restrain or contact you\nother than use of your language.\"\nIt took fully fifteen minutes to drag Kane to his sleeping compartment.\nAfter I left Kane in his wife's care, I went to the adjoining room and\nstretched out on the soft floor beside Verana.\nI tried to think of some solution. We were locked in an alien ship at\nthe start of a six months' journey to a strange planet. We had no tools\nor weapons.\nSolution? I doubted if two dozen geniuses working steadily for years\ncould think of one!\nI wondered what the alien race was like. Intelligent, surely: They had\nforeseen our conquest of space flight when we hadn't even invented\nthe wheel. That thought awed me\u2014somehow they had analyzed our brains\nthousands of years ago and calculated what our future accomplishments\nwould be.\nThey had been able to predict our scientific development, but they\nhadn't been able to tell how our civilization would develop. They were\ncurious, so they had left an enormously elaborate piece of bait on the\nMoon.\nThe aliens were incredibly more advanced than ourselves. I couldn't\nhelp thinking,\nAnd to a rabbit in a snare, mankind must seem\nimpossibly clever\n.\nI decided to ask the machine about its makers in the \"morning.\"\nWhen I awoke, my head was throbbing painfully.\nI opened my eyes and blinked several times to make sure they were\nfunctioning properly. I wasn't in the compartment where I had fallen\nasleep a few hours before.\nI was tied to one of the chairs in the \"kitchen.\" Beside me, Verana was\nbound to a chair by strips of cloth from her skirt, and across from us,\nMarie was secured to another chair.\nKane staggered into the room. Although he was visibly drunk, he\nappeared more sober than the night before. His dark hair was rumpled\nand his face was flushed, but his eyes gleamed with a growing alertness.\n\"Awake, huh?\"\n\"What have you done, Harry?\" his wife screamed at him. Her eyes were\nred with tears and her lips twisted in an expression of shame when she\nlooked at him.\n\"Obvious, isn't it? While all of you were asleep, I conked each of you\non the head, dragged you in here and tied you up.\" He smiled crookedly.\n\"It's amazing the things a person can do when he's pickled. I'm sorry I\nhad to be so rough, but I have a plan and I knew you wouldn't agree or\ncooperate with me.\"\n\"What's your plan?\" I asked.\nHe grinned wryly and crinkled bloodshot eyes. \"I don't want to live in\na zoo on an alien planet. I want to go home and prove my theory that\nthis problem has a solution.\"\nI grunted my disgust.\n\"The solution is simple,\" he said. \"We're in a trap so strong that the\naliens didn't establish any means to control our actions. When men put\na lion in a strong cage, they don't worry about controlling the lion\nbecause the lion can't get out. We're in the same basic situation.\"\n\"So what?\" Verana queried in a sarcastic tone.\n\"The aliens want us transported to their planet so they can examine and\nquestion us. Right?\"\n\"Right.\"\n\"Ed, remember that remark the machine made last night?\"\n\"What remark?\"\n\"It said, '\nMy\nmasters will be displeased with\nme\nif you arrive in a\ndamaged condition.' What does that indicate to you?\"\nI assumed a baffled expression. I didn't have the slightest idea of\nwhat he was driving at and I told him so.\n\"Ed,\" he said, \"if you could build an electronic brain capable of\nmaking decisions, how would you build it?\"\n\"Hell, I don't know,\" I confessed.\n\"Well, if I could build an electronic brain like the one running this\nship, I'd build it with a\nconscience\nso it'd do its best at all\ntimes.\"\n\"Machines always do their best,\" I argued. \"Come on, untie us. I'm\ngetting a crick in my back!\" I didn't like the idea of being slugged\nwhile asleep. If Kane had been sober and if his wife hadn't been\npresent, I would have let him know exactly what I thought of him.\n\"\nOur\nmachines always do their best,\" he argued, \"because we punch\nbuttons and they respond in predetermined patterns. But the electronic\nbrain in this ship isn't automatic. It makes decisions and I'll bet it\neven has to decide how much energy and time to put into each process!\"\n\"So what?\"\nHe shrugged muscular shoulders. \"So this ship is operated by a\nthinking, conscientious machine. It's the first time I've encountered\nsuch a machine, but I think I know what will happen. I spent hours last\nnight figuring\u2014\"\n\"What are you talking about?\" I interrupted. \"Are you so drunk that you\ndon't know\u2014\"\n\"I'll show you, Ed.\"\nHe walked around the table and stood behind my chair. I felt his thick\nfingers around my throat and smelled the alcohol on his breath.\n\"Can you see me, machine?\" he asked the empty air.\n\"Yes,\" the electronic brain replied.\n\"Watch!\"\nKane tightened his fingers around my throat.\nVerana and Marie screamed shrilly.\nMy head seemed to swell like a balloon; my throat gurgled painfully.\n\"Please stop,\" the machine pleaded.\n\"What will your masters think of you if I kill all of us? You'll return\nto them with a cargo of dead people!\"\nThe machine didn't answer. I waited for the electronic brain to\ninterfere and, with a cold knot in my stomach, realized the machine had\nsaid it had no way to control our actions!\n\"Your purpose won't be fulfilled, will it?\" Kane demanded. \"Not if you\nreturn with dead specimens!\"\n\"No,\" the machine admitted.\n\"If you don't take us back to the Moon,\" Kane threatened, \"I'll kill\nall of us\n!\"\nThe alien electronic brain was silent.\nBy this time, I couldn't see and Kane's voice was a hollow, faraway\nthing that rang in my ears. I tugged at my bindings, but they only\ntightened as I struggled.\n\"If you take us back to the Moon, your masters will never know you\nfailed in your mission. They won't know you failed because you won't\nbring them proof of your failure.\"\nMy fading consciousness tried to envision the alien mechanical brain as\nit struggled with the problem.\n\"Look at it this way,\" Kane persisted. \"If you carry our corpses to\nyour masters, all your efforts will have been useless. If you return us\nto the Moon alive, you'll still have a chance to carry out your mission\nlater.\"\nA long silence followed. Verana and Marie screamed at Kane to let go.\nA soft darkness seemed to fill the room, blurring everything, drowning\neven their shrieks in strangling blackness.\n\"You win,\" the machine conceded. \"I'll return the ship to the Moon.\"\nKane released his grip on my throat.\n\"See?\" he asked. \"Didn't I tell you every problem has a solution?\"\nI didn't answer. I was too busy enjoying breathing again.\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nThe Snare\nBy RICHARD R. SMITH\nIllustrated by WEISS\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.]\nIt's easy to find a solution when there is one\u2014the trick is to do it\nif there is none!\nI glanced at the path we had made across the\nMare Serenitatis\n. The\nLatin translated as \"the Sea of Serenity.\" It was well named because,\nas far as the eye could see in every direction, there was a smooth\nlayer of pumice that resembled the surface of a calm sea. Scattered\nacross the quiet sea of virgin Moon dust were occasional islands\nof rock that jutted abruptly toward the infinity of stars above.\nConsidering everything, our surroundings conveyed a sense of serenity\nlike none I had ever felt.\nOur bounding path across the level expanse was clearly marked. Because\nof the light gravity, we had leaped high into the air with each step\nand every time we struck the ground, the impact had raised a cloud of\ndustlike pumice. Now the clouds of dust were slowly settling in the\nlight gravity.\nAbove us, the stars were cold, motionless and crystal-clear.\nIndifferently, they sprayed a faint light on our surroundings ... a\ndim glow that was hardly sufficient for normal vision and was too weak\nto be reflected toward Earth.\nWe turned our head-lamps on the strange object before us. Five beams\nof light illuminated the smooth shape that protruded from the Moon's\nsurface.\nThe incongruity was so awesome that for several minutes, we remained\nmotionless and quiet. Miller broke the silence with his quavering\nvoice, \"Strange someone didn't notice it before.\"\nStrange? The object rose a quarter of a mile above us, a huge, curving\nhulk of smooth metal. It was featureless and yet conveyed a sense\nof\nalienness\n. It was alien and yet it wasn't a natural formation.\nSomething had made the thing, whatever it was. But was it strange that\nit hadn't been noticed before? Men had lived on the Moon for over a\nyear, but the Moon was vast and the\nMare Serenitatis\ncovered three\nhundred and forty thousand square miles.\n\"What is it?\" Marie asked breathlessly.\nHer husband grunted his bafflement. \"Who knows? But see how it curves?\nIf it's a perfect sphere, it must be at least two miles in diameter!\"\n\"If it's a perfect sphere,\" Miller suggested, \"most of it must be\nbeneath the Moon's surface.\"\n\"Maybe it isn't a sphere,\" my wife said. \"Maybe this is all of it.\"\n\"Let's call Lunar City and tell the authorities about it.\" I reached\nfor the radio controls on my suit.\nKane grabbed my arm. \"No. Let's find out whatever we can by ourselves.\nIf we tell the authorities, they'll order us to leave it alone. If we\ndiscover something really important, we'll be famous!\"\nI lowered my arm. His outburst seemed faintly childish to me. And yet\nit carried a good measure of common sense. If we discovered proof of\nan alien race, we would indeed be famous. The more we discovered for\nourselves, the more famous we'd be. Fame was practically a synonym for\nprestige and wealth.\n\"All right,\" I conceded.\nMiller stepped forward, moving slowly in the bulk of his spacesuit.\nDeliberately, he removed a small torch from his side and pressed the\nbrilliant flame against the metal.\nA few minutes later, the elderly mineralogist gave his opinion: \"It's\nsteel ... made thousands of years ago.\"\nSomeone gasped over the intercom, \"Thousands of years! But wouldn't it\nbe in worse shape than this if it was that old?\"\nMiller pointed at the small cut his torch had made in the metal. The\nnotch was only a quarter of an inch deep. \"I say\nsteel\nbecause it's\nsimilar\nto steel. Actually, it's a much stronger alloy. Besides that,\non the Moon, there's been no water or atmosphere to rust it. Not even\na wind to disturb its surface. It's\nat least\nseveral thousand years\nold.\"\nWe slowly circled the alien structure. Several minutes later, Kane\nshouted, \"Look!\"\nA few feet above the ground, the structure's smooth surface was broken\nby a circular opening that yawned invitingly. Kane ran ahead and\nflashed his head-lamp into the dark recess.\n\"There's a small room inside,\" he told us, and climbed through the\nopening.\nWe waited outside and focused our lamps through the five-foot opening\nto give him as much light as possible.\n\"Come on in, Marie,\" he called to his wife. \"This is really something!\nIt\nmust\nbe an alien race. There's all kinds of weird drawings on the\nwalls and gadgets that look like controls for something....\"\nBriefly, my lamp flickered over Marie's pale face. Her features\nstruggled with two conflicting emotions: She was frightened by the\nalienness of the thing and yet she wanted to be with her husband. She\nhesitated momentarily, then climbed through the passage.\n\"You want to go in?\" my wife asked.\n\"Do you?\"\n\"Let's.\"\nI helped Verana through the opening, climbed through myself and turned\nto help Miller.\nMiller was sixty years old. He was an excellent mineralogist, alert\nmentally, but with a body that was almost feeble. I reached out to help\nhim as he stepped into the passageway.\nFor a brief second, he was framed in the opening, a dark silhouette\nagainst the star-studded sky.\nThe next second, he was thrown twenty yards into the air. He gasped\nwith pain when he struck the ground. \"\nSomething\npushed me!\"\n\"Are you all right?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nHe had fallen on a spot beyond our angle of vision. I started through\nthe passage....\n... and struck an invisible solid wall.\nMy eyes were on the circular opening. A metal panel emerged from a\nrecess on one side and slid across the passage. The room darkened with\nthe absence of starlight.\n\"\nWhat happened?\n\"\n\"The door to this damned place closed,\" I explained.\n\"\nWhat?\n\"\nBefore we could recover from the shock, the room filled with a\nbrilliant glare. We turned off our lamps.\nThe room was approximately twelve feet long and nine feet wide. The\nceiling was only a few inches above our heads and when I looked at the\nsmooth, hard metal, I felt as if I were trapped in some alien vault.\nThe walls of the room were covered with strange drawings and\ninstruments. Here and there, kaleidoscopic lights pulsed rhythmically.\nKane brushed past me and beat his gloved fists against the metal door\nthat had imprisoned us.\n\"Miller!\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"See if you can get this thing open from the outside.\"\nI knelt before the door and explored its surface with my fingers. There\nwere no visible recesses or controls.\nOver the intercom network, everyone's breath mingled and formed a\nrough, harsh sound. I could discern the women's quick, frightened\nbreaths that were almost sobs. Kane's breath was deep and strong;\nMiller's was faltering and weak.\n\"Miller, get help!\"\n\"I'll\u2014\" The sound of his breathing ceased. We listened intently.\n\"What happened to him?\"\n\"I'll phone Lunar City.\" My fingers fumbled at the radio controls and\ntrembled beneath the thick gloves.\nI turned the dials that would connect my radio with Lunar City....\nStatic grated against my ear drums.\nStatic!\nI listened to the harsh, erratic sound and my voice was weak by\ncomparison: \"Calling Lunar City.\"\n\"Static!\" Kane echoed my thoughts. His frown made deep clefts between\nhis eyebrows. \"There's no static between inter-lunar radio!\"\nVerana's voice was small and frightened. \"That sounds like the static\nwe hear over the bigger radios when we broadcast to Earth.\"\n\"It does,\" Marie agreed.\n\"But we wouldn't have that kind of static over\nour\nradio, unless\u2014\"\nVerana's eyes widened until the pupils were surrounded by circles of\nwhite\u2014\"unless we were in outer space!\"\nWe stared at the metal door that had imprisoned us, afraid even to\nspeak of our fantastic suspicion.\nI deactivated my radio.\nMarie screamed as an inner door opened to disclose a long, narrow\ncorridor beyond.\nSimultaneous with the opening of the second door, I felt air press\nagainst my spacesuit. Before, our suits had been puffed outward by the\npressure of air inside. Now our spacesuits were slack and dangling on\nour bodies.\nWe looked at each other and then at the inviting corridor beyond the\nopen door.\nWe went single file, first Kane, then his wife Marie. Verana followed\nnext and I was the last.\nWe walked slowly, examining the strange construction. The walls were\nfeatureless but still seemed alien. At various places on the walls were\nthe outlines of doors without handles or locks.\nKane pressed his shoulder against a door and shoved. The door was\nunyielding.\nI manipulated the air-vent controls of my spacesuit, allowed a small\namount of the corridor's air into my helmet and inhaled cautiously.\nIt smelled all right. I waited and nothing happened. Gradually, I\nincreased the intake, turned off the oxygenating machines and removed\nmy helmet.\n\"Shut off your oxy,\" I suggested. \"We might as well breathe the air in\nthis place and save our supply. We may need the oxygen in our suits\nlater.\"\nThey saw that I had removed my helmet and was still alive and one by\none removed their own helmets.\nAt the end of the corridor, Kane stopped before a blank wall. The sweat\non his face glistened dully; his chest rose and fell rapidly. Kane was\na pilot and one of the prerequisites for the job of guiding tons of\nmetal between Earth and the Moon was a good set of nerves. Kane excited\neasily, his temper was fiery, but his nerves were like steel.\n\"The end of the line,\" he grunted.\nAs though to disprove the statement, a door on his right side opened\nsoundlessly.\nHe went through the doorway as if shoved violently by an invisible hand.\nThe door closed behind him.\nMarie threw herself at the door and beat at the metal. \"Harry!\"\nVerana rushed to her side. Another door on the opposite side of the\ncorridor opened silently. The door was behind them; they didn't notice.\nBefore I could warn them, Marie floated across the corridor, through\nthe doorway.\nVerana and I stared at the darkness beyond the opening, our muscles\nfrozen by shock.\nThe door closed behind Marie's screaming, struggling form.\nVerana's face was white with fear. Apprehensively, she glanced at the\nother doors that lined the hall.\nI put my arms around her, held her close.\n\"Antigravity machines, force rays,\" I suggested worriedly.\nFor several minutes, we remained motionless and silent. I recalled the\npreceding events of the day, searched for a sense of normality in them.\nThe Kanes, Miller, Verana and I lived in Lunar City with hundreds of\nother people. Mankind had inhabited the Moon for over a year. Means\nof recreation were scarce. Many people explored the place to amuse\nthemselves. After supper, we had decided to take a walk. As simple as\nthat: a walk on the Moon.\nWe had expected only the familiar craters, chasms and weird rock\nformations. A twist of fate and here we were: imprisoned in an alien\nship.\nMy legs quivered with fatigue, my heart throbbed heavily, Verana's\nperfume dizzied me. No, it wasn't a dream. Despite our incredible\nsituation, there was no sensation of unreality.\nI took Verana's hand and led her down the long corridor, retracing our\nsteps.\nWe had walked not more than two yards when the rest of the doors\nopened soundlessly.\nVerana's hand flew to her mouth to stifle a gasp.\nSix doors were now open. The only two that remained closed were the\nones that the Kanes had unwillingly entered.\nThis time, no invisible hand thrust us into any of the rooms.\nI entered the nearest one. Verana followed hesitantly.\nThe walls of the large room were lined with shelves containing\nthousands of variously colored boxes and bottles. A table and four\nchairs were located in the center of the green, plasticlike floor. Each\nchair had no back, only a curving platform with a single supporting\ncolumn.\n\"Ed!\" I joined Verana on the other side of the room. She pointed a\ntrembling finger at some crude drawings. \"The things in this room are\nfood!\"\nThe drawings were so simple that anyone could have understood them.\nThe first drawing portrayed a naked man and woman removing boxes and\nbottles from the shelves. The second picture showed the couple opening\nthe containers. The third showed the man eating from one of the boxes\nand the woman drinking from a bottle.\n\"Let's see how it tastes,\" I said.\nI selected an orange-colored box. The lid dissolved at the touch of my\nfingers.\nThe only contents were small cubes of a soft orange substance.\nI tasted a small piece.\n\"Chocolate! Just like chocolate!\"\nVerana chose a nearby bottle and drank some of the bluish liquid.\n\"Milk!\" she exclaimed.\n\"Perhaps we'd better look at the other rooms,\" I told her.\nThe next room we examined was obviously for recreation. Containers were\nfilled with dozens of strange games and books of instructions in the\nform of simple drawings. The games were foreign, but designed in such a\nfashion that they would be interesting to Earthmen.\nTwo of the rooms were sleeping quarters. The floors were covered with a\nspongy substance and the lights were dim and soothing.\nAnother room contained a small bathing pool, running water,\nwaste-disposal units and yellow cakes of soap.\nThe last room was an observatory. The ceiling and an entire wall were\ntransparent. Outside, the stars shone clearly for a few seconds, then\ndisappeared for an equal time, only to reappear in a different position.\n\"Hyper-space drive,\" Verana whispered softly. She was fascinated by\nthe movement of the stars. For years, our scientists had sought a\nhyperspatial drive to conquer the stars.\nWe selected a comfortable chair facing the transparent wall, lit\ncigarettes and waited.\nA few minutes later, Marie entered the room.\nI noticed with some surprise that her face was calm. If she was\nexcited, her actions didn't betray it.\nShe sat next to Verana.\n\"What happened?\" my wife asked.\nMarie crossed her legs and began in a rambling manner as if discussing\na new recipe, \"That was really a surprise, wasn't it? I was scared\nsilly, at first. That room was dark and I didn't know what to expect.\nSomething touched my head and I heard a telepathic voice\u2014\"\n\"Telepathic?\" Verana interrupted.\n\"Yes. Well, this voice said not to worry and that it wasn't going to\nhurt me. It said it only wanted to learn something about us. It was\nthe\noddest\nfeeling! All the time, this voice kept talking to me in\na nice way and made me feel at ease ... and at the same time, I felt\nsomething\nsearch my mind and gather information. I could actually\nfeel\nit search my memories!\"\n\"What memories?\" I inquired.\nShe frowned with concentration. \"Memories of high school mostly. It\nseemed interested in English and history classes. And then it searched\nfor memories of our customs and lives in general....\"\nKane stalked into the room at that moment, his face red with anger.\n\"\nDo you know where we are?\n\" he demanded. \"When those damned aliens\ngot me in that room, they explained what this is all about. We're\nguinea pigs!\"\n\"Did they use telepathy to explain?\" Verana asked. I suddenly\nremembered that she was a member of a club that investigated\nextra-sensory perception with the hope of learning how it operated. She\nwas probably sorry she hadn't been contacted telepathically.\n\"Yeah,\" Kane replied. \"I saw all sorts of mental pictures and they\nexplained what they did to us. Those damned aliens want us for their\nzoo!\"\n\"Start at the beginning,\" I suggested.\nHe flashed an angry glance at me, but seemed to calm somewhat. \"This\nship was made by a race from another galaxy. Thousands of years ago,\nthey came to Earth in their spaceships when men were primitives living\nin caves. They wanted to know what our civilization would be like\nwhen we developed space flight. So they put this ship on the Moon as a\nsort of booby-trap. They put it there with the idea that when we made\nspaceships and went to the Moon, sooner or later, we'd find the ship\nand enter it\u2014\nlike rabbits in a snare!\n\"\n\"And now the booby-trap is on its way home,\" I guessed.\n\"Yeah, this ship is taking us to their planet and they're going to keep\nus there while they study us.\"\n\"How long will the trip take?\" I asked.\n\"Six months. We'll be bottled up in this crate for six whole damned\nmonths! And when we get there, we'll be prisoners!\"\nMarie's hypnotic spell was fading and once more her face showed the\nterror inside her.\n\"Don't feel so bad,\" I told Kane. \"It could be worse. It should be\ninteresting to see an alien race. We'll have our wives with us\u2014\"\n\"Maybe they'll dissect us!\" Marie gasped.\nVerana scoffed. \"A race intelligent enough to build a ship like this? A\nrace that was traveling between the stars when we were living in caves?\nDissection is primitive. They won't\nhave to\ndissect us in order to\nstudy us. They'll have more advanced methods.\"\n\"Maybe we can reach the ship's controls somehow,\" Kane said excitedly.\n\"We've got to try to change the ship's course and get back to the\nMoon!\"\n\"It's impossible. Don't waste your time.\" The voice had no visible\nsource and seemed to fill the room.\nVerana snapped her fingers. \"So that's why the aliens read Marie's\nmind! They wanted to learn our language so they could talk to us!\"\nKane whirled in a complete circle, glaring at each of the four walls.\n\"Where are you?\nWho\nare you?\"\n\"I'm located in a part of the ship you can't reach. I'm a machine.\"\n\"Is anyone else aboard besides ourselves?\"\n\"No. I control the ship.\" Although the voice spoke without stilted\nphrases, the tone was cold and mechanical.\n\"What are your\u2014your masters going to do with us?\" Marie asked\nanxiously.\n\"You won't be harmed. My masters merely wish to question and examine\nyou. Thousands of years ago, they wondered what your race would be like\nwhen it developed to the space-flight stage. They left this ship on\nyour Moon only because they were curious. My masters have no animosity\ntoward your race, only compassion and curiosity.\"\nI remembered the way antigravity rays had shoved Miller from the ship\nand asked the machine, \"Why didn't you let our fifth member board the\nship?\"\n\"The trip to my makers' planet will take six months. There are food,\noxygen and living facilities for four only of your race. I had to\nprevent the fifth from entering the ship.\"\n\"Come on,\" Kane ordered. \"We'll search this ship room by room and we'll\nfind some way to make it take us back to Earth.\"\n\"It's useless,\" the ship warned us.\nFor five hours, we minutely examined every room. We had no tools to\nforce our way through solid metal walls to the engine or control rooms.\nThe only things in the ship that could be lifted and carried about were\nthe containers of food and alien games. None were sufficiently heavy or\nhard enough to put even a scratch in the heavy metal.\nSix rooms were open to our use. The two rooms in which the Kanes had\nbeen imprisoned were locked and there were no controls or locks to work\non.\nThe rooms that we could enter were without doors, except the ones that\nopened into the corridor.\nAfter intensive searching, we realized there was\nno way\nto damage the\nship or reach any section other than our allotted space.\nWe gave up.\nThe women went to the sleeping compartments to rest and Kane I went to\nthe \"kitchen.\"\nAt random, we sampled the variously colored boxes and bottles and\ndiscussed our predicament.\n\"Trapped,\" Kane said angrily. \"Trapped in a steel prison.\" He slammed\nhis fist against the table top. \"But there must be a way to get out!\nEvery problem has a solution!\"\n\"You sure?\" I asked.\n\"What?\"\n\"\nDoes\nevery problem have a solution? I don't believe it. Some\nproblems are too great. Take the problem of a murderer in our\ncivilization: John Doe has killed someone and his problem is to escape.\nPrimarily, a murderer's problem is the same principle as ours. A\nmurderer has to outwit an entire civilization. We have to outwit an\nentire civilization that was hundreds of times more advanced than ours\nis now when we were clubbing animals and eating the meat raw. Damned\nfew criminals get away these days, even though they've got such crowds\nto lose themselves in. All we have is a ship that we can't control. I\ndon't think we have a chance.\"\nMy resignation annoyed him. Each of us had reacted differently: Kane's\nwife was frightened, Verana was calm because of an inner serenity that\nfew people have, I was resigned and Kane was angry.\nFor several minutes, we sampled the different foods. Every one had a\ndistinctive flavor, comparable to that of a fruit or vegetable on Earth.\nKane lifted a brown bottle to his lips, took a huge gulp and almost\nchoked.\n\"Whiskey!\"\n\"My masters realized your race would develop intoxicants and tried to\ncreate a comparable one,\" the machine explained.\nI selected a brown bottle and sampled the liquid. \"A little stronger\nthan our own,\" I informed the machine.\nWe drank until Kane was staggering about the room, shouting insults at\nthe alien race and the mechanical voice that seemed to be everywhere.\nHe beat his fist against a wall until blood trickled from bruised\nknuckles.\n\"Please don't hurt yourself,\" the machine pleaded.\n\"\nWhy?\n\" Kane screamed at the ceiling. \"Why should you care?\"\n\"My masters will be displeased with me if you arrive in a damaged\ncondition.\"\nKane banged his head against a bulkhead; an ugly bruise formed rapidly.\n\"Shtop me, then!\"\n\"I can't. My masters created no way for me to restrain or contact you\nother than use of your language.\"\nIt took fully fifteen minutes to drag Kane to his sleeping compartment.\nAfter I left Kane in his wife's care, I went to the adjoining room and\nstretched out on the soft floor beside Verana.\nI tried to think of some solution. We were locked in an alien ship at\nthe start of a six months' journey to a strange planet. We had no tools\nor weapons.\nSolution? I doubted if two dozen geniuses working steadily for years\ncould think of one!\nI wondered what the alien race was like. Intelligent, surely: They had\nforeseen our conquest of space flight when we hadn't even invented\nthe wheel. That thought awed me\u2014somehow they had analyzed our brains\nthousands of years ago and calculated what our future accomplishments\nwould be.\nThey had been able to predict our scientific development, but they\nhadn't been able to tell how our civilization would develop. They were\ncurious, so they had left an enormously elaborate piece of bait on the\nMoon.\nThe aliens were incredibly more advanced than ourselves. I couldn't\nhelp thinking,\nAnd to a rabbit in a snare, mankind must seem\nimpossibly clever\n.\nI decided to ask the machine about its makers in the \"morning.\"\nWhen I awoke, my head was throbbing painfully.\nI opened my eyes and blinked several times to make sure they were\nfunctioning properly. I wasn't in the compartment where I had fallen\nasleep a few hours before.\nI was tied to one of the chairs in the \"kitchen.\" Beside me, Verana was\nbound to a chair by strips of cloth from her skirt, and across from us,\nMarie was secured to another chair.\nKane staggered into the room. Although he was visibly drunk, he\nappeared more sober than the night before. His dark hair was rumpled\nand his face was flushed, but his eyes gleamed with a growing alertness.\n\"Awake, huh?\"\n\"What have you done, Harry?\" his wife screamed at him. Her eyes were\nred with tears and her lips twisted in an expression of shame when she\nlooked at him.\n\"Obvious, isn't it? While all of you were asleep, I conked each of you\non the head, dragged you in here and tied you up.\" He smiled crookedly.\n\"It's amazing the things a person can do when he's pickled. I'm sorry I\nhad to be so rough, but I have a plan and I knew you wouldn't agree or\ncooperate with me.\"\n\"What's your plan?\" I asked.\nHe grinned wryly and crinkled bloodshot eyes. \"I don't want to live in\na zoo on an alien planet. I want to go home and prove my theory that\nthis problem has a solution.\"\nI grunted my disgust.\n\"The solution is simple,\" he said. \"We're in a trap so strong that the\naliens didn't establish any means to control our actions. When men put\na lion in a strong cage, they don't worry about controlling the lion\nbecause the lion can't get out. We're in the same basic situation.\"\n\"So what?\" Verana queried in a sarcastic tone.\n\"The aliens want us transported to their planet so they can examine and\nquestion us. Right?\"\n\"Right.\"\n\"Ed, remember that remark the machine made last night?\"\n\"What remark?\"\n\"It said, '\nMy\nmasters will be displeased with\nme\nif you arrive in a\ndamaged condition.' What does that indicate to you?\"\nI assumed a baffled expression. I didn't have the slightest idea of\nwhat he was driving at and I told him so.\n\"Ed,\" he said, \"if you could build an electronic brain capable of\nmaking decisions, how would you build it?\"\n\"Hell, I don't know,\" I confessed.\n\"Well, if I could build an electronic brain like the one running this\nship, I'd build it with a\nconscience\nso it'd do its best at all\ntimes.\"\n\"Machines always do their best,\" I argued. \"Come on, untie us. I'm\ngetting a crick in my back!\" I didn't like the idea of being slugged\nwhile asleep. If Kane had been sober and if his wife hadn't been\npresent, I would have let him know exactly what I thought of him.\n\"\nOur\nmachines always do their best,\" he argued, \"because we punch\nbuttons and they respond in predetermined patterns. But the electronic\nbrain in this ship isn't automatic. It makes decisions and I'll bet it\neven has to decide how much energy and time to put into each process!\"\n\"So what?\"\nHe shrugged muscular shoulders. \"So this ship is operated by a\nthinking, conscientious machine. It's the first time I've encountered\nsuch a machine, but I think I know what will happen. I spent hours last\nnight figuring\u2014\"\n\"What are you talking about?\" I interrupted. \"Are you so drunk that you\ndon't know\u2014\"\n\"I'll show you, Ed.\"\nHe walked around the table and stood behind my chair. I felt his thick\nfingers around my throat and smelled the alcohol on his breath.\n\"Can you see me, machine?\" he asked the empty air.\n\"Yes,\" the electronic brain replied.\n\"Watch!\"\nKane tightened his fingers around my throat.\nVerana and Marie screamed shrilly.\nMy head seemed to swell like a balloon; my throat gurgled painfully.\n\"Please stop,\" the machine pleaded.\n\"What will your masters think of you if I kill all of us? You'll return\nto them with a cargo of dead people!\"\nThe machine didn't answer. I waited for the electronic brain to\ninterfere and, with a cold knot in my stomach, realized the machine had\nsaid it had no way to control our actions!\n\"Your purpose won't be fulfilled, will it?\" Kane demanded. \"Not if you\nreturn with dead specimens!\"\n\"No,\" the machine admitted.\n\"If you don't take us back to the Moon,\" Kane threatened, \"I'll kill\nall of us\n!\"\nThe alien electronic brain was silent.\nBy this time, I couldn't see and Kane's voice was a hollow, faraway\nthing that rang in my ears. I tugged at my bindings, but they only\ntightened as I struggled.\n\"If you take us back to the Moon, your masters will never know you\nfailed in your mission. They won't know you failed because you won't\nbring them proof of your failure.\"\nMy fading consciousness tried to envision the alien mechanical brain as\nit struggled with the problem.\n\"Look at it this way,\" Kane persisted. \"If you carry our corpses to\nyour masters, all your efforts will have been useless. If you return us\nto the Moon alive, you'll still have a chance to carry out your mission\nlater.\"\nA long silence followed. Verana and Marie screamed at Kane to let go.\nA soft darkness seemed to fill the room, blurring everything, drowning\neven their shrieks in strangling blackness.\n\"You win,\" the machine conceded. \"I'll return the ship to the Moon.\"\nKane released his grip on my throat.\n\"See?\" he asked. \"Didn't I tell you every problem has a solution?\"\nI didn't answer. I was too busy enjoying breathing again.\n", "summary": "The, a strange object that has been noticed before. The crew of a spaceship that is visiting the moon is led by Captain Jack Stone, and includes his wife, Helen, and their pilot, pilot, and engineer, Captain Briton. The ship is described as being a perfect sphere, with a smooth surface. The surface is covered in pumice and a cloud of dust. The moon is vast and the surface is filled with stars. The men are exploring the area in hopes of finding evidence of an alien race.  The crew is guided by the ship's radio and finds a perfect spherical shape. They are able to determine the exact location of the sphere by analyzing the radio frequency. They believe that the sphere is at least two miles in diameter. They begin to make their way back to the ship.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}

SMITH\nIllustrated by WEISS\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.]\nIt's easy to find a solution when there is one\u2014the trick is to do it\nif there is none!\nI glanced at the path we had made across the\nMare Serenitatis\n. The\nLatin translated as \"the Sea of Serenity.\" It was well named because,\nas far as the eye could see in every direction, there was a smooth\nlayer of pumice that resembled the surface of a calm sea. Scattered\nacross the quiet sea of virgin Moon dust were occasional islands\nof rock that jutted abruptly toward the infinity of stars above.\nConsidering everything, our surroundings conveyed a sense of serenity\nlike none I had ever felt.\nOur bounding path across the level expanse was clearly marked. Because\nof the light gravity, we had leaped high into the air with each step\nand every time we struck the ground, the impact had raised a cloud of\ndustlike pumice. Now the clouds of dust were slowly settling in the\nlight gravity.\nAbove us, the stars were cold, motionless and crystal-clear.\nIndifferently, they sprayed a faint light on our surroundings ... a\ndim glow that was hardly sufficient for normal vision and was too weak\nto be reflected toward Earth.\nWe turned our head-lamps on the strange object before us. Five beams\nof light illuminated the smooth shape that protruded from the Moon's\nsurface.\nThe incongruity was so awesome that for several minutes, we remained\nmotionless and quiet. Miller broke the silence with his quavering\nvoice, \"Strange someone didn't notice it before.\"\nStrange? The object rose a quarter of a mile above us, a huge, curving\nhulk of smooth metal. It was featureless and yet conveyed a sense\nof\nalienness\n. It was alien and yet it wasn't a natural formation.\nSomething had made the thing, whatever it was. But was it strange that\nit hadn't been noticed before? Men had lived on the Moon for over a\nyear, but the Moon was vast and the\nMare Serenitatis\ncovered three\nhundred and forty thousand square miles.\n\"What is it?\" Marie asked breathlessly.\nHer husband grunted his bafflement. \"Who knows? But see how it curves?\nIf it's a perfect sphere, it must be at least two miles in diameter!\"\n\"If it's a perfect sphere,\" Miller suggested, \"most of it must be\nbeneath the Moon's surface.\"\n\"Maybe it isn't a sphere,\" my wife said. \"Maybe this is all of it.\"\n\"Let's call Lunar City and tell the authorities about it.\" I reached\nfor the radio controls on my suit.\nKane grabbed my arm. \"No. Let's find out whatever we can by ourselves.\nIf we tell the authorities, they'll order us to leave it alone. If we\ndiscover something really important, we'll be famous!\"\nI lowered my arm. His outburst seemed faintly childish to me. And yet\nit carried a good measure of common sense. If we discovered proof of\nan alien race, we would indeed be famous. The more we discovered for\nourselves, the more famous we'd be. Fame was practically a synonym for\nprestige and wealth.\n\"All right,\" I conceded.\nMiller stepped forward, moving slowly in the bulk of his spacesuit.\nDeliberately, he removed a small torch from his side and pressed the\nbrilliant flame against the metal.\nA few minutes later, the elderly mineralogist gave his opinion: \"It's\nsteel ... made thousands of years ago.\"\nSomeone gasped over the intercom, \"Thousands of years! But wouldn't it\nbe in worse shape than this if it was that old?\"\nMiller pointed at the small cut his torch had made in the metal. The\nnotch was only a quarter of an inch deep. \"I say\nsteel\nbecause it's\nsimilar\nto steel. Actually, it's a much stronger alloy. Besides that,\non the Moon, there's been no water or atmosphere to rust it. Not even\na wind to disturb its surface. It's\nat least\nseveral thousand years\nold.\"\nWe slowly circled the alien structure. Several minutes later, Kane\nshouted, \"Look!\"\nA few feet above the ground, the structure's smooth surface was broken\nby a circular opening that yawned invitingly. Kane ran ahead and\nflashed his head-lamp into the dark recess.\n\"There's a small room inside,\" he told us, and climbed through the\nopening.\nWe waited outside and focused our lamps through the five-foot opening\nto give him as much light as possible.\n\"Come on in, Marie,\" he called to his wife. \"This is really something!\nIt\nmust\nbe an alien race. There's all kinds of weird drawings on the\nwalls and gadgets that look like controls for something....\"\nBriefly, my lamp flickered over Marie's pale face. Her features\nstruggled with two conflicting emotions: She was frightened by the\nalienness of the thing and yet she wanted to be with her husband. She\nhesitated momentarily, then climbed through the passage.\n\"You want to go in?\" my wife asked.\n\"Do you?\"\n\"Let's.\"\nI helped Verana through the opening, climbed through myself and turned\nto help Miller.\nMiller was sixty years old. He was an excellent mineralogist, alert\nmentally, but with a body that was almost feeble. I reached out to help\nhim as he stepped into the passageway.\nFor a brief second, he was framed in the opening, a dark silhouette\nagainst the star-studded sky.\nThe next second, he was thrown twenty yards into the air. He gasped\nwith pain when he struck the ground. \"\nSomething\npushed me!\"\n\"Are you all right?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nHe had fallen on a spot beyond our angle of vision. I started through\nthe passage....\n... and struck an invisible solid wall.\nMy eyes were on the circular opening. A metal panel emerged from a\nrecess on one side and slid across the passage. The room darkened with\nthe absence of starlight.\n\"\nWhat happened?\n\"\n\"The door to this damned place closed,\" I explained.\n\"\nWhat?\n\"\nBefore we could recover from the shock, the room filled with a\nbrilliant glare. We turned off our lamps.\nThe room was approximately twelve feet long and nine feet wide. The\nceiling was only a few inches above our heads and when I looked at the\nsmooth, hard metal, I felt as if I were trapped in some alien vault.\nThe walls of the room were covered with strange drawings and\ninstruments. Here and there, kaleidoscopic lights pulsed rhythmically.\nKane brushed past me and beat his gloved fists against the metal door\nthat had imprisoned us.\n\"Miller!\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"See if you can get this thing open from the outside.\"\nI knelt before the door and explored its surface with my fingers. There\nwere no visible recesses or controls.\nOver the intercom network, everyone's breath mingled and formed a\nrough, harsh sound. I could discern the women's quick, frightened\nbreaths that were almost sobs. Kane's breath was deep and strong;\nMiller's was faltering and weak.\n\"Miller, get help!\"\n\"I'll\u2014\" The sound of his breathing ceased. We listened intently.\n\"What happened to him?\"\n\"I'll phone Lunar City.\" My fingers fumbled at the radio controls and\ntrembled beneath the thick gloves.\nI turned the dials that would connect my radio with Lunar City....\nStatic grated against my ear drums.\nStatic!\nI listened to the harsh, erratic sound and my voice was weak by\ncomparison: \"Calling Lunar City.\"\n\"Static!\" Kane echoed my thoughts. His frown made deep clefts between\nhis eyebrows. \"There's no static between inter-lunar radio!\"\nVerana's voice was small and frightened. \"That sounds like the static\nwe hear over the bigger radios when we broadcast to Earth.\"\n\"It does,\" Marie agreed.\n\"But we wouldn't have that kind of static over\nour\nradio, unless\u2014\"\nVerana's eyes widened until the pupils were surrounded by circles of\nwhite\u2014\"unless we were in outer space!\"\nWe stared at the metal door that had imprisoned us, afraid even to\nspeak of our fantastic suspicion.\nI deactivated my radio.\nMarie screamed as an inner door opened to disclose a long, narrow\ncorridor beyond.\nSimultaneous with the opening of the second door, I felt air press\nagainst my spacesuit. Before, our suits had been puffed outward by the\npressure of air inside. Now our spacesuits were slack and dangling on\nour bodies.\nWe looked at each other and then at the inviting corridor beyond the\nopen door.\nWe went single file, first Kane, then his wife Marie. Verana followed\nnext and I was the last.\nWe walked slowly, examining the strange construction. The walls were\nfeatureless but still seemed alien. At various places on the walls were\nthe outlines of doors without handles or locks.\nKane pressed his shoulder against a door and shoved. The door was\nunyielding.\nI manipulated the air-vent controls of my spacesuit, allowed a small\namount of the corridor's air into my helmet and inhaled cautiously.\nIt smelled all right. I waited and nothing happened. Gradually, I\nincreased the intake, turned off the oxygenating machines and removed\nmy helmet.\n\"Shut off your oxy,\" I suggested. \"We might as well breathe the air in\nthis place and save our supply. We may need the oxygen in our suits\nlater.\"\nThey saw that I had removed my helmet and was still alive and one by\none removed their own helmets.\nAt the end of the corridor, Kane stopped before a blank wall. The sweat\non his face glistened dully; his chest rose and fell rapidly. Kane was\na pilot and one of the prerequisites for the job of guiding tons of\nmetal between Earth and the Moon was a good set of nerves. Kane excited\neasily, his temper was fiery, but his nerves were like steel.\n\"The end of the line,\" he grunted.\nAs though to disprove the statement, a door on his right side opened\nsoundlessly.\nHe went through the doorway as if shoved violently by an invisible hand.\nThe door closed behind him.\nMarie threw herself at the door and beat at the metal. \"Harry!\"\nVerana rushed to her side. Another door on the opposite side of the\ncorridor opened silently. The door was behind them; they didn't notice.\nBefore I could warn them, Marie floated across the corridor, through\nthe doorway.\nVerana and I stared at the darkness beyond the opening, our muscles\nfrozen by shock.\nThe door closed behind Marie's screaming, struggling form.\nVerana's face was white with fear. Apprehensively, she glanced at the\nother doors that lined the hall.\nI put my arms around her, held her close.\n\"Antigravity machines, force rays,\" I suggested worriedly.\nFor several minutes, we remained motionless and silent. I recalled the\npreceding events of the day, searched for a sense of normality in them.\nThe Kanes, Miller, Verana and I lived in Lunar City with hundreds of\nother people. Mankind had inhabited the Moon for over a year. Means\nof recreation were scarce. Many people explored the place to amuse\nthemselves. After supper, we had decided to take a walk. As simple as\nthat: a walk on the Moon.\nWe had expected only the familiar craters, chasms and weird rock\nformations. A twist of fate and here we were: imprisoned in an alien\nship.\nMy legs quivered with fatigue, my heart throbbed heavily, Verana's\nperfume dizzied me. No, it wasn't a dream. Despite our incredible\nsituation, there was no sensation of unreality.\nI took Verana's hand and led her down the long corridor, retracing our\nsteps.\nWe had walked not more than two yards when the rest of the doors\nopened soundlessly.\nVerana's hand flew to her mouth to stifle a gasp.\nSix doors were now open. The only two that remained closed were the\nones that the Kanes had unwillingly entered.\nThis time, no invisible hand thrust us into any of the rooms.\nI entered the nearest one. Verana followed hesitantly.\nThe walls of the large room were lined with shelves containing\nthousands of variously colored boxes and bottles. A table and four\nchairs were located in the center of the green, plasticlike floor. Each\nchair had no back, only a curving platform with a single supporting\ncolumn.\n\"Ed!\" I joined Verana on the other side of the room. She pointed a\ntrembling finger at some crude drawings. \"The things in this room are\nfood!\"\nThe drawings were so simple that anyone could have understood them.\nThe first drawing portrayed a naked man and woman removing boxes and\nbottles from the shelves. The second picture showed the couple opening\nthe containers. The third showed the man eating from one of the boxes\nand the woman drinking from a bottle.\n\"Let's see how it tastes,\" I said.\nI selected an orange-colored box. The lid dissolved at the touch of my\nfingers.\nThe only contents were small cubes of a soft orange substance.\nI tasted a small piece.\n\"Chocolate! Just like chocolate!\"\nVerana chose a nearby bottle and drank some of the bluish liquid.\n\"Milk!\" she exclaimed.\n\"Perhaps we'd better look at the other rooms,\" I told her.\nThe next room we examined was obviously for recreation. Containers were\nfilled with dozens of strange games and books of instructions in the\nform of simple drawings. The games were foreign, but designed in such a\nfashion that they would be interesting to Earthmen.\nTwo of the rooms were sleeping quarters. The floors were covered with a\nspongy substance and the lights were dim and soothing.\nAnother room contained a small bathing pool, running water,\nwaste-disposal units and yellow cakes of soap.\nThe last room was an observatory. The ceiling and an entire wall were\ntransparent. Outside, the stars shone clearly for a few seconds, then\ndisappeared for an equal time, only to reappear in a different position.\n\"Hyper-space drive,\" Verana whispered softly. She was fascinated by\nthe movement of the stars. For years, our scientists had sought a\nhyperspatial drive to conquer the stars.\nWe selected a comfortable chair facing the transparent wall, lit\ncigarettes and waited.\nA few minutes later, Marie entered the room.\nI noticed with some surprise that her face was calm. If she was\nexcited, her actions didn't betray it.\nShe sat next to Verana.\n\"What happened?\" my wife asked.\nMarie crossed her legs and began in a rambling manner as if discussing\na new recipe, \"That was really a surprise, wasn't it? I was scared\nsilly, at first. That room was dark and I didn't know what to expect.\nSomething touched my head and I heard a telepathic voice\u2014\"\n\"Telepathic?\" Verana interrupted.\n\"Yes. Well, this voice said not to worry and that it wasn't going to\nhurt me. It said it only wanted to learn something about us. It was\nthe\noddest\nfeeling! All the time, this voice kept talking to me in\na nice way and made me feel at ease ... and at the same time, I felt\nsomething\nsearch my mind and gather information. I could actually\nfeel\nit search my memories!\"\n\"What memories?\" I inquired.\nShe frowned with concentration. \"Memories of high school mostly. It\nseemed interested in English and history classes. And then it searched\nfor memories of our customs and lives in general....\"\nKane stalked into the room at that moment, his face red with anger.\n\"\nDo you know where we are?\n\" he demanded. \"When those damned aliens\ngot me in that room, they explained what this is all about. We're\nguinea pigs!\"\n\"Did they use telepathy to explain?\" Verana asked. I suddenly\nremembered that she was a member of a club that investigated\nextra-sensory perception with the hope of learning how it operated. She\nwas probably sorry she hadn't been contacted telepathically.\n\"Yeah,\" Kane replied. \"I saw all sorts of mental pictures and they\nexplained what they did to us. Those damned aliens want us for their\nzoo!\"\n\"Start at the beginning,\" I suggested.\nHe flashed an angry glance at me, but seemed to calm somewhat. \"This\nship was made by a race from another galaxy. Thousands of years ago,\nthey came to Earth in their spaceships when men were primitives living\nin caves. They wanted to know what our civilization would be like\nwhen we developed space flight. So they put this ship on the Moon as a\nsort of booby-trap. They put it there with the idea that when we made\nspaceships and went to the Moon, sooner or later, we'd find the ship\nand enter it\u2014\nlike rabbits in a snare!\n\"\n\"And now the booby-trap is on its way home,\" I guessed.\n\"Yeah, this ship is taking us to their planet and they're going to keep\nus there while they study us.\"\n\"How long will the trip take?\" I asked.\n\"Six months. We'll be bottled up in this crate for six whole damned\nmonths! And when we get there, we'll be prisoners!\"\nMarie's hypnotic spell was fading and once more her face showed the\nterror inside her.\n\"Don't feel so bad,\" I told Kane. \"It could be worse. It should be\ninteresting to see an alien race. We'll have our wives with us\u2014\"\n\"Maybe they'll dissect us!\" Marie gasped.\nVerana scoffed. \"A race intelligent enough to build a ship like this? A\nrace that was traveling between the stars when we were living in caves?\nDissection is primitive. They won't\nhave to\ndissect us in order to\nstudy us. They'll have more advanced methods.\"\n\"Maybe we can reach the ship's controls somehow,\" Kane said excitedly.\n\"We've got to try to change the ship's course and get back to the\nMoon!\"\n\"It's impossible. Don't waste your time.\" The voice had no visible\nsource and seemed to fill the room.\nVerana snapped her fingers. \"So that's why the aliens read Marie's\nmind! They wanted to learn our language so they could talk to us!\"\nKane whirled in a complete circle, glaring at each of the four walls.\n\"Where are you?\nWho\nare you?\"\n\"I'm located in a part of the ship you can't reach. I'm a machine.\"\n\"Is anyone else aboard besides ourselves?\"\n\"No. I control the ship.\" Although the voice spoke without stilted\nphrases, the tone was cold and mechanical.\n\"What are your\u2014your masters going to do with us?\" Marie asked\nanxiously.\n\"You won't be harmed. My masters merely wish to question and examine\nyou. Thousands of years ago, they wondered what your race would be like\nwhen it developed to the space-flight stage. They left this ship on\nyour Moon only because they were curious. My masters have no animosity\ntoward your race, only compassion and curiosity.\"\nI remembered the way antigravity rays had shoved Miller from the ship\nand asked the machine, \"Why didn't you let our fifth member board the\nship?\"\n\"The trip to my makers' planet will take six months. There are food,\noxygen and living facilities for four only of your race. I had to\nprevent the fifth from entering the ship.\"\n\"Come on,\" Kane ordered. \"We'll search this ship room by room and we'll\nfind some way to make it take us back to Earth.\"\n\"It's useless,\" the ship warned us.\nFor five hours, we minutely examined every room. We had no tools to\nforce our way through solid metal walls to the engine or control rooms.\nThe only things in the ship that could be lifted and carried about were\nthe containers of food and alien games. None were sufficiently heavy or\nhard enough to put even a scratch in the heavy metal.\nSix rooms were open to our use. The two rooms in which the Kanes had\nbeen imprisoned were locked and there were no controls or locks to work\non.\nThe rooms that we could enter were without doors, except the ones that\nopened into the corridor.\nAfter intensive searching, we realized there was\nno way\nto damage the\nship or reach any section other than our allotted space.\nWe gave up.\nThe women went to the sleeping compartments to rest and Kane I went to\nthe \"kitchen.\"\nAt random, we sampled the variously colored boxes and bottles and\ndiscussed our predicament.\n\"Trapped,\" Kane said angrily. \"Trapped in a steel prison.\" He slammed\nhis fist against the table top. \"But there must be a way to get out!\nEvery problem has a solution!\"\n\"You sure?\" I asked.\n\"What?\"\n\"\nDoes\nevery problem have a solution? I don't believe it. Some\nproblems are too great. Take the problem of a murderer in our\ncivilization: John Doe has killed someone and his problem is to escape.\nPrimarily, a murderer's problem is the same principle as ours. A\nmurderer has to outwit an entire civilization. We have to outwit an\nentire civilization that was hundreds of times more advanced than ours\nis now when we were clubbing animals and eating the meat raw. Damned\nfew criminals get away these days, even though they've got such crowds\nto lose themselves in. All we have is a ship that we can't control. I\ndon't think we have a chance.\"\nMy resignation annoyed him. Each of us had reacted differently: Kane's\nwife was frightened, Verana was calm because of an inner serenity that\nfew people have, I was resigned and Kane was angry.\nFor several minutes, we sampled the different foods. Every one had a\ndistinctive flavor, comparable to that of a fruit or vegetable on Earth.\nKane lifted a brown bottle to his lips, took a huge gulp and almost\nchoked.\n\"Whiskey!\"\n\"My masters realized your race would develop intoxicants and tried to\ncreate a comparable one,\" the machine explained.\nI selected a brown bottle and sampled the liquid. \"A little stronger\nthan our own,\" I informed the machine.\nWe drank until Kane was staggering about the room, shouting insults at\nthe alien race and the mechanical voice that seemed to be everywhere.\nHe beat his fist against a wall until blood trickled from bruised\nknuckles.\n\"Please don't hurt yourself,\" the machine pleaded.\n\"\nWhy?\n\" Kane screamed at the ceiling. \"Why should you care?\"\n\"My masters will be displeased with me if you arrive in a damaged\ncondition.\"\nKane banged his head against a bulkhead; an ugly bruise formed rapidly.\n\"Shtop me, then!\"\n\"I can't. My masters created no way for me to restrain or contact you\nother than use of your language.\"\nIt took fully fifteen minutes to drag Kane to his sleeping compartment.\nAfter I left Kane in his wife's care, I went to the adjoining room and\nstretched out on the soft floor beside Verana.\nI tried to think of some solution. We were locked in an alien ship at\nthe start of a six months' journey to a strange planet. We had no tools\nor weapons.\nSolution? I doubted if two dozen geniuses working steadily for years\ncould think of one!\nI wondered what the alien race was like. Intelligent, surely: They had\nforeseen our conquest of space flight when we hadn't even invented\nthe wheel. That thought awed me\u2014somehow they had analyzed our brains\nthousands of years ago and calculated what our future accomplishments\nwould be.\nThey had been able to predict our scientific development, but they\nhadn't been able to tell how our civilization would develop. They were\ncurious, so they had left an enormously elaborate piece of bait on the\nMoon.\nThe aliens were incredibly more advanced than ourselves. I couldn't\nhelp thinking,\nAnd to a rabbit in a snare, mankind must seem\nimpossibly clever\n.\nI decided to ask the machine about its makers in the \"morning.\"\nWhen I awoke, my head was throbbing painfully.\nI opened my eyes and blinked several times to make sure they were\nfunctioning properly. I wasn't in the compartment where I had fallen\nasleep a few hours before.\nI was tied to one of the chairs in the \"kitchen.\" Beside me, Verana was\nbound to a chair by strips of cloth from her skirt, and across from us,\nMarie was secured to another chair.\nKane staggered into the room. Although he was visibly drunk, he\nappeared more sober than the night before. His dark hair was rumpled\nand his face was flushed, but his eyes gleamed with a growing alertness.\n\"Awake, huh?\"\n\"What have you done, Harry?\" his wife screamed at him. Her eyes were\nred with tears and her lips twisted in an expression of shame when she\nlooked at him.\n\"Obvious, isn't it? While all of you were asleep, I conked each of you\non the head, dragged you in here and tied you up.\" He smiled crookedly.\n\"It's amazing the things a person can do when he's pickled. I'm sorry I\nhad to be so rough, but I have a plan and I knew you wouldn't agree or\ncooperate with me.\"\n\"What's your plan?\" I asked.\nHe grinned wryly and crinkled bloodshot eyes. \"I don't want to live in\na zoo on an alien planet. I want to go home and prove my theory that\nthis problem has a solution.\"\nI grunted my disgust.\n\"The solution is simple,\" he said. \"We're in a trap so strong that the\naliens didn't establish any means to control our actions. When men put\na lion in a strong cage, they don't worry about controlling the lion\nbecause the lion can't get out. We're in the same basic situation.\"\n\"So what?\" Verana queried in a sarcastic tone.\n\"The aliens want us transported to their planet so they can examine and\nquestion us. Right?\"\n\"Right.\"\n\"Ed, remember that remark the machine made last night?\"\n\"What remark?\"\n\"It said, '\nMy\nmasters will be displeased with\nme\nif you arrive in a\ndamaged condition.' What does that indicate to you?\"\nI assumed a baffled expression. I didn't have the slightest idea of\nwhat he was driving at and I told him so.\n\"Ed,\" he said, \"if you could build an electronic brain capable of\nmaking decisions, how would you build it?\"\n\"Hell, I don't know,\" I confessed.\n\"Well, if I could build an electronic brain like the one running this\nship, I'd build it with a\nconscience\nso it'd do its best at all\ntimes.\"\n\"Machines always do their best,\" I argued. \"Come on, untie us. I'm\ngetting a crick in my back!\" I didn't like the idea of being slugged\nwhile asleep. If Kane had been sober and if his wife hadn't been\npresent, I would have let him know exactly what I thought of him.\n\"\nOur\nmachines always do their best,\" he argued, \"because we punch\nbuttons and they respond in predetermined patterns. But the electronic\nbrain in this ship isn't automatic. It makes decisions and I'll bet it\neven has to decide how much energy and time to put into each process!\"\n\"So what?\"\nHe shrugged muscular shoulders. \"So this ship is operated by a\nthinking, conscientious machine. It's the first time I've encountered\nsuch a machine, but I think I know what will happen. I spent hours last\nnight figuring\u2014\"\n\"What are you talking about?\" I interrupted. \"Are you so drunk that you\ndon't know\u2014\"\n\"I'll show you, Ed.\"\nHe walked around the table and stood behind my chair. I felt his thick\nfingers around my throat and smelled the alcohol on his breath.\n\"Can you see me, machine?\" he asked the empty air.\n\"Yes,\" the electronic brain replied.\n\"Watch!\"\nKane tightened his fingers around my throat.\nVerana and Marie screamed shrilly.\nMy head seemed to swell like a balloon; my throat gurgled painfully.\n\"Please stop,\" the machine pleaded.\n\"What will your masters think of you if I kill all of us? You'll return\nto them with a cargo of dead people!\"\nThe machine didn't answer. I waited for the electronic brain to\ninterfere and, with a cold knot in my stomach, realized the machine had\nsaid it had no way to control our actions!\n\"Your purpose won't be fulfilled, will it?\" Kane demanded. \"Not if you\nreturn with dead specimens!\"\n\"No,\" the machine admitted.\n\"If you don't take us back to the Moon,\" Kane threatened, \"I'll kill\nall of us\n!\"\nThe alien electronic brain was silent.\nBy this time, I couldn't see and Kane's voice was a hollow, faraway\nthing that rang in my ears. I tugged at my bindings, but they only\ntightened as I struggled.\n\"If you take us back to the Moon, your masters will never know you\nfailed in your mission. They won't know you failed because you won't\nbring them proof of your failure.\"\nMy fading consciousness tried to envision the alien mechanical brain as\nit struggled with the problem.\n\"Look at it this way,\" Kane persisted. \"If you carry our corpses to\nyour masters, all your efforts will have been useless. If you return us\nto the Moon alive, you'll still have a chance to carry out your mission\nlater.\"\nA long silence followed. Verana and Marie screamed at Kane to let go.\nA soft darkness seemed to fill the room, blurring everything, drowning\neven their shrieks in strangling blackness.\n\"You win,\" the machine conceded. \"I'll return the ship to the Moon.\"\nKane released his grip on my throat.\n\"See?\" he asked. \"Didn't I tell you every problem has a solution?\"\nI didn't answer. I was too busy enjoying breathing again.\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nThe Snare\nBy RICHARD R. SMITH\nIllustrated by WEISS\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.]\nIt's easy to find a solution when there is one\u2014the trick is to do it\nif there is none!\nI glanced at the path we had made across the\nMare Serenitatis\n. The\nLatin translated as \"the Sea of Serenity.\" It was well named because,\nas far as the eye could see in every direction, there was a smooth\nlayer of pumice that resembled the surface of a calm sea. Scattered\nacross the quiet sea of virgin Moon dust were occasional islands\nof rock that jutted abruptly toward the infinity of stars above.\nConsidering everything, our surroundings conveyed a sense of serenity\nlike none I had ever felt.\nOur bounding path across the level expanse was clearly marked. Because\nof the light gravity, we had leaped high into the air with each step\nand every time we struck the ground, the impact had raised a cloud of\ndustlike pumice. Now the clouds of dust were slowly settling in the\nlight gravity.\nAbove us, the stars were cold, motionless and crystal-clear.\nIndifferently, they sprayed a faint light on our surroundings ... a\ndim glow that was hardly sufficient for normal vision and was too weak\nto be reflected toward Earth.\nWe turned our head-lamps on the strange object before us. Five beams\nof light illuminated the smooth shape that protruded from the Moon's\nsurface.\nThe incongruity was so awesome that for several minutes, we remained\nmotionless and quiet. Miller broke the silence with his quavering\nvoice, \"Strange someone didn't notice it before.\"\nStrange? The object rose a quarter of a mile above us, a huge, curving\nhulk of smooth metal. It was featureless and yet conveyed a sense\nof\nalienness\n. It was alien and yet it wasn't a natural formation.\nSomething had made the thing, whatever it was. But was it strange that\nit hadn't been noticed before? Men had lived on the Moon for over a\nyear, but the Moon was vast and the\nMare Serenitatis\ncovered three\nhundred and forty thousand square miles.\n\"What is it?\" Marie asked breathlessly.\nHer husband grunted his bafflement. \"Who knows? But see how it curves?\nIf it's a perfect sphere, it must be at least two miles in diameter!\"\n\"If it's a perfect sphere,\" Miller suggested, \"most of it must be\nbeneath the Moon's surface.\"\n\"Maybe it isn't a sphere,\" my wife said. \"Maybe this is all of it.\"\n\"Let's call Lunar City and tell the authorities about it.\" I reached\nfor the radio controls on my suit.\nKane grabbed my arm. \"No. Let's find out whatever we can by ourselves.\nIf we tell the authorities, they'll order us to leave it alone. If we\ndiscover something really important, we'll be famous!\"\nI lowered my arm. His outburst seemed faintly childish to me. And yet\nit carried a good measure of common sense. If we discovered proof of\nan alien race, we would indeed be famous. The more we discovered for\nourselves, the more famous we'd be. Fame was practically a synonym for\nprestige and wealth.\n\"All right,\" I conceded.\nMiller stepped forward, moving slowly in the bulk of his spacesuit.\nDeliberately, he removed a small torch from his side and pressed the\nbrilliant flame against the metal.\nA few minutes later, the elderly mineralogist gave his opinion: \"It's\nsteel ... made thousands of years ago.\"\nSomeone gasped over the intercom, \"Thousands of years! But wouldn't it\nbe in worse shape than this if it was that old?\"\nMiller pointed at the small cut his torch had made in the metal. The\nnotch was only a quarter of an inch deep. \"I say\nsteel\nbecause it's\nsimilar\nto steel. Actually, it's a much stronger alloy. Besides that,\non the Moon, there's been no water or atmosphere to rust it. Not even\na wind to disturb its surface. It's\nat least\nseveral thousand years\nold.\"\nWe slowly circled the alien structure. Several minutes later, Kane\nshouted, \"Look!\"\nA few feet above the ground, the structure's smooth surface was broken\nby a circular opening that yawned invitingly. Kane ran ahead and\nflashed his head-lamp into the dark recess.\n\"There's a small room inside,\" he told us, and climbed through the\nopening.\nWe waited outside and focused our lamps through the five-foot opening\nto give him as much light as possible.\n\"Come on in, Marie,\" he called to his wife. \"This is really something!\nIt\nmust\nbe an alien race. There's all kinds of weird drawings on the\nwalls and gadgets that look like controls for something....\"\nBriefly, my lamp flickered over Marie's pale face. Her features\nstruggled with two conflicting emotions: She was frightened by the\nalienness of the thing and yet she wanted to be with her husband. She\nhesitated momentarily, then climbed through the passage.\n\"You want to go in?\" my wife asked.\n\"Do you?\"\n\"Let's.\"\nI helped Verana through the opening, climbed through myself and turned\nto help Miller.\nMiller was sixty years old. He was an excellent mineralogist, alert\nmentally, but with a body that was almost feeble. I reached out to help\nhim as he stepped into the passageway.\nFor a brief second, he was framed in the opening, a dark silhouette\nagainst the star-studded sky.\nThe next second, he was thrown twenty yards into the air. He gasped\nwith pain when he struck the ground. \"\nSomething\npushed me!\"\n\"Are you all right?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nHe had fallen on a spot beyond our angle of vision. I started through\nthe passage....\n... and struck an invisible solid wall.\nMy eyes were on the circular opening. A metal panel emerged from a\nrecess on one side and slid across the passage. The room darkened with\nthe absence of starlight.\n\"\nWhat happened?\n\"\n\"The door to this damned place closed,\" I explained.\n\"\nWhat?\n\"\nBefore we could recover from the shock, the room filled with a\nbrilliant glare. We turned off our lamps.\nThe room was approximately twelve feet long and nine feet wide. The\nceiling was only a few inches above our heads and when I looked at the\nsmooth, hard metal, I felt as if I were trapped in some alien vault.\nThe walls of the room were covered with strange drawings and\ninstruments. Here and there, kaleidoscopic lights pulsed rhythmically.\nKane brushed past me and beat his gloved fists against the metal door\nthat had imprisoned us.\n\"Miller!\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"See if you can get this thing open from the outside.\"\nI knelt before the door and explored its surface with my fingers. There\nwere no visible recesses or controls.\nOver the intercom network, everyone's breath mingled and formed a\nrough, harsh sound. I could discern the women's quick, frightened\nbreaths that were almost sobs. Kane's breath was deep and strong;\nMiller's was faltering and weak.\n\"Miller, get help!\"\n\"I'll\u2014\" The sound of his breathing ceased. We listened intently.\n\"What happened to him?\"\n\"I'll phone Lunar City.\" My fingers fumbled at the radio controls and\ntrembled beneath the thick gloves.\nI turned the dials that would connect my radio with Lunar City....\nStatic grated against my ear drums.\nStatic!\nI listened to the harsh, erratic sound and my voice was weak by\ncomparison: \"Calling Lunar City.\"\n\"Static!\" Kane echoed my thoughts. His frown made deep clefts between\nhis eyebrows. \"There's no static between inter-lunar radio!\"\nVerana's voice was small and frightened. \"That sounds like the static\nwe hear over the bigger radios when we broadcast to Earth.\"\n\"It does,\" Marie agreed.\n\"But we wouldn't have that kind of static over\nour\nradio, unless\u2014\"\nVerana's eyes widened until the pupils were surrounded by circles of\nwhite\u2014\"unless we were in outer space!\"\nWe stared at the metal door that had imprisoned us, afraid even to\nspeak of our fantastic suspicion.\nI deactivated my radio.\nMarie screamed as an inner door opened to disclose a long, narrow\ncorridor beyond.\nSimultaneous with the opening of the second door, I felt air press\nagainst my spacesuit. Before, our suits had been puffed outward by the\npressure of air inside. Now our spacesuits were slack and dangling on\nour bodies.\nWe looked at each other and then at the inviting corridor beyond the\nopen door.\nWe went single file, first Kane, then his wife Marie. Verana followed\nnext and I was the last.\nWe walked slowly, examining the strange construction. The walls were\nfeatureless but still seemed alien. At various places on the walls were\nthe outlines of doors without handles or locks.\nKane pressed his shoulder against a door and shoved. The door was\nunyielding.\nI manipulated the air-vent controls of my spacesuit, allowed a small\namount of the corridor's air into my helmet and inhaled cautiously.\nIt smelled all right. I waited and nothing happened. Gradually, I\nincreased the intake, turned off the oxygenating machines and removed\nmy helmet.\n\"Shut off your oxy,\" I suggested. \"We might as well breathe the air in\nthis place and save our supply. We may need the oxygen in our suits\nlater.\"\nThey saw that I had removed my helmet and was still alive and one by\none removed their own helmets.\nAt the end of the corridor, Kane stopped before a blank wall. The sweat\non his face glistened dully; his chest rose and fell rapidly. Kane was\na pilot and one of the prerequisites for the job of guiding tons of\nmetal between Earth and the Moon was a good set of nerves. Kane excited\neasily, his temper was fiery, but his nerves were like steel.\n\"The end of the line,\" he grunted.\nAs though to disprove the statement, a door on his right side opened\nsoundlessly.\nHe went through the doorway as if shoved violently by an invisible hand.\nThe door closed behind him.\nMarie threw herself at the door and beat at the metal. \"Harry!\"\nVerana rushed to her side. Another door on the opposite side of the\ncorridor opened silently. The door was behind them; they didn't notice.\nBefore I could warn them, Marie floated across the corridor, through\nthe doorway.\nVerana and I stared at the darkness beyond the opening, our muscles\nfrozen by shock.\nThe door closed behind Marie's screaming, struggling form.\nVerana's face was white with fear. Apprehensively, she glanced at the\nother doors that lined the hall.\nI put my arms around her, held her close.\n\"Antigravity machines, force rays,\" I suggested worriedly.\nFor several minutes, we remained motionless and silent. I recalled the\npreceding events of the day, searched for a sense of normality in them.\nThe Kanes, Miller, Verana and I lived in Lunar City with hundreds of\nother people. Mankind had inhabited the Moon for over a year. Means\nof recreation were scarce. Many people explored the place to amuse\nthemselves. After supper, we had decided to take a walk. As simple as\nthat: a walk on the Moon.\nWe had expected only the familiar craters, chasms and weird rock\nformations. A twist of fate and here we were: imprisoned in an alien\nship.\nMy legs quivered with fatigue, my heart throbbed heavily, Verana's\nperfume dizzied me. No, it wasn't a dream. Despite our incredible\nsituation, there was no sensation of unreality.\nI took Verana's hand and led her down the long corridor, retracing our\nsteps.\nWe had walked not more than two yards when the rest of the doors\nopened soundlessly.\nVerana's hand flew to her mouth to stifle a gasp.\nSix doors were now open. The only two that remained closed were the\nones that the Kanes had unwillingly entered.\nThis time, no invisible hand thrust us into any of the rooms.\nI entered the nearest one. Verana followed hesitantly.\nThe walls of the large room were lined with shelves containing\nthousands of variously colored boxes and bottles. A table and four\nchairs were located in the center of the green, plasticlike floor. Each\nchair had no back, only a curving platform with a single supporting\ncolumn.\n\"Ed!\" I joined Verana on the other side of the room. She pointed a\ntrembling finger at some crude drawings. \"The things in this room are\nfood!\"\nThe drawings were so simple that anyone could have understood them.\nThe first drawing portrayed a naked man and woman removing boxes and\nbottles from the shelves. The second picture showed the couple opening\nthe containers. The third showed the man eating from one of the boxes\nand the woman drinking from a bottle.\n\"Let's see how it tastes,\" I said.\nI selected an orange-colored box. The lid dissolved at the touch of my\nfingers.\nThe only contents were small cubes of a soft orange substance.\nI tasted a small piece.\n\"Chocolate! Just like chocolate!\"\nVerana chose a nearby bottle and drank some of the bluish liquid.\n\"Milk!\" she exclaimed.\n\"Perhaps we'd better look at the other rooms,\" I told her.\nThe next room we examined was obviously for recreation. Containers were\nfilled with dozens of strange games and books of instructions in the\nform of simple drawings. The games were foreign, but designed in such a\nfashion that they would be interesting to Earthmen.\nTwo of the rooms were sleeping quarters. The floors were covered with a\nspongy substance and the lights were dim and soothing.\nAnother room contained a small bathing pool, running water,\nwaste-disposal units and yellow cakes of soap.\nThe last room was an observatory. The ceiling and an entire wall were\ntransparent. Outside, the stars shone clearly for a few seconds, then\ndisappeared for an equal time, only to reappear in a different position.\n\"Hyper-space drive,\" Verana whispered softly. She was fascinated by\nthe movement of the stars. For years, our scientists had sought a\nhyperspatial drive to conquer the stars.\nWe selected a comfortable chair facing the transparent wall, lit\ncigarettes and waited.\nA few minutes later, Marie entered the room.\nI noticed with some surprise that her face was calm. If she was\nexcited, her actions didn't betray it.\nShe sat next to Verana.\n\"What happened?\" my wife asked.\nMarie crossed her legs and began in a rambling manner as if discussing\na new recipe, \"That was really a surprise, wasn't it? I was scared\nsilly, at first. That room was dark and I didn't know what to expect.\nSomething touched my head and I heard a telepathic voice\u2014\"\n\"Telepathic?\" Verana interrupted.\n\"Yes. Well, this voice said not to worry and that it wasn't going to\nhurt me. It said it only wanted to learn something about us. It was\nthe\noddest\nfeeling! All the time, this voice kept talking to me in\na nice way and made me feel at ease ... and at the same time, I felt\nsomething\nsearch my mind and gather information. I could actually\nfeel\nit search my memories!\"\n\"What memories?\" I inquired.\nShe frowned with concentration. \"Memories of high school mostly. It\nseemed interested in English and history classes. And then it searched\nfor memories of our customs and lives in general....\"\nKane stalked into the room at that moment, his face red with anger.\n\"\nDo you know where we are?\n\" he demanded. \"When those damned aliens\ngot me in that room, they explained what this is all about. We're\nguinea pigs!\"\n\"Did they use telepathy to explain?\" Verana asked. I suddenly\nremembered that she was a member of a club that investigated\nextra-sensory perception with the hope of learning how it operated. She\nwas probably sorry she hadn't been contacted telepathically.\n\"Yeah,\" Kane replied. \"I saw all sorts of mental pictures and they\nexplained what they did to us. Those damned aliens want us for their\nzoo!\"\n\"Start at the beginning,\" I suggested.\nHe flashed an angry glance at me, but seemed to calm somewhat. \"This\nship was made by a race from another galaxy. Thousands of years ago,\nthey came to Earth in their spaceships when men were primitives living\nin caves. They wanted to know what our civilization would be like\nwhen we developed space flight. So they put this ship on the Moon as a\nsort of booby-trap. They put it there with the idea that when we made\nspaceships and went to the Moon, sooner or later, we'd find the ship\nand enter it\u2014\nlike rabbits in a snare!\n\"\n\"And now the booby-trap is on its way home,\" I guessed.\n\"Yeah, this ship is taking us to their planet and they're going to keep\nus there while they study us.\"\n\"How long will the trip take?\" I asked.\n\"Six months. We'll be bottled up in this crate for six whole damned\nmonths! And when we get there, we'll be prisoners!\"\nMarie's hypnotic spell was fading and once more her face showed the\nterror inside her.\n\"Don't feel so bad,\" I told Kane. \"It could be worse. It should be\ninteresting to see an alien race. We'll have our wives with us\u2014\"\n\"Maybe they'll dissect us!\" Marie gasped.\nVerana scoffed. \"A race intelligent enough to build a ship like this? A\nrace that was traveling between the stars when we were living in caves?\nDissection is primitive. They won't\nhave to\ndissect us in order to\nstudy us. They'll have more advanced methods.\"\n\"Maybe we can reach the ship's controls somehow,\" Kane said excitedly.\n\"We've got to try to change the ship's course and get back to the\nMoon!\"\n\"It's impossible. Don't waste your time.\" The voice had no visible\nsource and seemed to fill the room.\nVerana snapped her fingers. \"So that's why the aliens read Marie's\nmind! They wanted to learn our language so they could talk to us!\"\nKane whirled in a complete circle, glaring at each of the four walls.\n\"Where are you?\nWho\nare you?\"\n\"I'm located in a part of the ship you can't reach. I'm a machine.\"\n\"Is anyone else aboard besides ourselves?\"\n\"No. I control the ship.\" Although the voice spoke without stilted\nphrases, the tone was cold and mechanical.\n\"What are your\u2014your masters going to do with us?\" Marie asked\nanxiously.\n\"You won't be harmed. My masters merely wish to question and examine\nyou. Thousands of years ago, they wondered what your race would be like\nwhen it developed to the space-flight stage. They left this ship on\nyour Moon only because they were curious. My masters have no animosity\ntoward your race, only compassion and curiosity.\"\nI remembered the way antigravity rays had shoved Miller from the ship\nand asked the machine, \"Why didn't you let our fifth member board the\nship?\"\n\"The trip to my makers' planet will take six months. There are food,\noxygen and living facilities for four only of your race. I had to\nprevent the fifth from entering the ship.\"\n\"Come on,\" Kane ordered. \"We'll search this ship room by room and we'll\nfind some way to make it take us back to Earth.\"\n\"It's useless,\" the ship warned us.\nFor five hours, we minutely examined every room. We had no tools to\nforce our way through solid metal walls to the engine or control rooms.\nThe only things in the ship that could be lifted and carried about were\nthe containers of food and alien games. None were sufficiently heavy or\nhard enough to put even a scratch in the heavy metal.\nSix rooms were open to our use. The two rooms in which the Kanes had\nbeen imprisoned were locked and there were no controls or locks to work\non.\nThe rooms that we could enter were without doors, except the ones that\nopened into the corridor.\nAfter intensive searching, we realized there was\nno way\nto damage the\nship or reach any section other than our allotted space.\nWe gave up.\nThe women went to the sleeping compartments to rest and Kane I went to\nthe \"kitchen.\"\nAt random, we sampled the variously colored boxes and bottles and\ndiscussed our predicament.\n\"Trapped,\" Kane said angrily. \"Trapped in a steel prison.\" He slammed\nhis fist against the table top. \"But there must be a way to get out!\nEvery problem has a solution!\"\n\"You sure?\" I asked.\n\"What?\"\n\"\nDoes\nevery problem have a solution? I don't believe it. Some\nproblems are too great. Take the problem of a murderer in our\ncivilization: John Doe has killed someone and his problem is to escape.\nPrimarily, a murderer's problem is the same principle as ours. A\nmurderer has to outwit an entire civilization. We have to outwit an\nentire civilization that was hundreds of times more advanced than ours\nis now when we were clubbing animals and eating the meat raw. Damned\nfew criminals get away these days, even though they've got such crowds\nto lose themselves in. All we have is a ship that we can't control. I\ndon't think we have a chance.\"\nMy resignation annoyed him. Each of us had reacted differently: Kane's\nwife was frightened, Verana was calm because of an inner serenity that\nfew people have, I was resigned and Kane was angry.\nFor several minutes, we sampled the different foods. Every one had a\ndistinctive flavor, comparable to that of a fruit or vegetable on Earth.\nKane lifted a brown bottle to his lips, took a huge gulp and almost\nchoked.\n\"Whiskey!\"\n\"My masters realized your race would develop intoxicants and tried to\ncreate a comparable one,\" the machine explained.\nI selected a brown bottle and sampled the liquid. \"A little stronger\nthan our own,\" I informed the machine.\nWe drank until Kane was staggering about the room, shouting insults at\nthe alien race and the mechanical voice that seemed to be everywhere.\nHe beat his fist against a wall until blood trickled from bruised\nknuckles.\n\"Please don't hurt yourself,\" the machine pleaded.\n\"\nWhy?\n\" Kane screamed at the ceiling. \"Why should you care?\"\n\"My masters will be displeased with me if you arrive in a damaged\ncondition.\"\nKane banged his head against a bulkhead; an ugly bruise formed rapidly.\n\"Shtop me, then!\"\n\"I can't. My masters created no way for me to restrain or contact you\nother than use of your language.\"\nIt took fully fifteen minutes to drag Kane to his sleeping compartment.\nAfter I left Kane in his wife's care, I went to the adjoining room and\nstretched out on the soft floor beside Verana.\nI tried to think of some solution. We were locked in an alien ship at\nthe start of a six months' journey to a strange planet. We had no tools\nor weapons.\nSolution? I doubted if two dozen geniuses working steadily for years\ncould think of one!\nI wondered what the alien race was like. Intelligent, surely: They had\nforeseen our conquest of space flight when we hadn't even invented\nthe wheel. That thought awed me\u2014somehow they had analyzed our brains\nthousands of years ago and calculated what our future accomplishments\nwould be.\nThey had been able to predict our scientific development, but they\nhadn't been able to tell how our civilization would develop. They were\ncurious, so they had left an enormously elaborate piece of bait on the\nMoon.\nThe aliens were incredibly more advanced than ourselves. I couldn't\nhelp thinking,\nAnd to a rabbit in a snare, mankind must seem\nimpossibly clever\n.\nI decided to ask the machine about its makers in the \"morning.\"\nWhen I awoke, my head was throbbing painfully.\nI opened my eyes and blinked several times to make sure they were\nfunctioning properly. I wasn't in the compartment where I had fallen\nasleep a few hours before.\nI was tied to one of the chairs in the \"kitchen.\" Beside me, Verana was\nbound to a chair by strips of cloth from her skirt, and across from us,\nMarie was secured to another chair.\nKane staggered into the room. Although he was visibly drunk, he\nappeared more sober than the night before. His dark hair was rumpled\nand his face was flushed, but his eyes gleamed with a growing alertness.\n\"Awake, huh?\"\n\"What have you done, Harry?\" his wife screamed at him. Her eyes were\nred with tears and her lips twisted in an expression of shame when she\nlooked at him.\n\"Obvious, isn't it? While all of you were asleep, I conked each of you\non the head, dragged you in here and tied you up.\" He smiled crookedly.\n\"It's amazing the things a person can do when he's pickled. I'm sorry I\nhad to be so rough, but I have a plan and I knew you wouldn't agree or\ncooperate with me.\"\n\"What's your plan?\" I asked.\nHe grinned wryly and crinkled bloodshot eyes. \"I don't want to live in\na zoo on an alien planet. I want to go home and prove my theory that\nthis problem has a solution.\"\nI grunted my disgust.\n\"The solution is simple,\" he said. \"We're in a trap so strong that the\naliens didn't establish any means to control our actions. When men put\na lion in a strong cage, they don't worry about controlling the lion\nbecause the lion can't get out. We're in the same basic situation.\"\n\"So what?\" Verana queried in a sarcastic tone.\n\"The aliens want us transported to their planet so they can examine and\nquestion us. Right?\"\n\"Right.\"\n\"Ed, remember that remark the machine made last night?\"\n\"What remark?\"\n\"It said, '\nMy\nmasters will be displeased with\nme\nif you arrive in a\ndamaged condition.' What does that indicate to you?\"\nI assumed a baffled expression. I didn't have the slightest idea of\nwhat he was driving at and I told him so.\n\"Ed,\" he said, \"if you could build an electronic brain capable of\nmaking decisions, how would you build it?\"\n\"Hell, I don't know,\" I confessed.\n\"Well, if I could build an electronic brain like the one running this\nship, I'd build it with a\nconscience\nso it'd do its best at all\ntimes.\"\n\"Machines always do their best,\" I argued. \"Come on, untie us. I'm\ngetting a crick in my back!\" I didn't like the idea of being slugged\nwhile asleep. If Kane had been sober and if his wife hadn't been\npresent, I would have let him know exactly what I thought of him.\n\"\nOur\nmachines always do their best,\" he argued, \"because we punch\nbuttons and they respond in predetermined patterns. But the electronic\nbrain in this ship isn't automatic. It makes decisions and I'll bet it\neven has to decide how much energy and time to put into each process!\"\n\"So what?\"\nHe shrugged muscular shoulders. \"So this ship is operated by a\nthinking, conscientious machine. It's the first time I've encountered\nsuch a machine, but I think I know what will happen. I spent hours last\nnight figuring\u2014\"\n\"What are you talking about?\" I interrupted. \"Are you so drunk that you\ndon't know\u2014\"\n\"I'll show you, Ed.\"\nHe walked around the table and stood behind my chair. I felt his thick\nfingers around my throat and smelled the alcohol on his breath.\n\"Can you see me, machine?\" he asked the empty air.\n\"Yes,\" the electronic brain replied.\n\"Watch!\"\nKane tightened his fingers around my throat.\nVerana and Marie screamed shrilly.\nMy head seemed to swell like a balloon; my throat gurgled painfully.\n\"Please stop,\" the machine pleaded.\n\"What will your masters think of you if I kill all of us? You'll return\nto them with a cargo of dead people!\"\nThe machine didn't answer. I waited for the electronic brain to\ninterfere and, with a cold knot in my stomach, realized the machine had\nsaid it had no way to control our actions!\n\"Your purpose won't be fulfilled, will it?\" Kane demanded. \"Not if you\nreturn with dead specimens!\"\n\"No,\" the machine admitted.\n\"If you don't take us back to the Moon,\" Kane threatened, \"I'll kill\nall of us\n!\"\nThe alien electronic brain was silent.\nBy this time, I couldn't see and Kane's voice was a hollow, faraway\nthing that rang in my ears. I tugged at my bindings, but they only\ntightened as I struggled.\n\"If you take us back to the Moon, your masters will never know you\nfailed in your mission. They won't know you failed because you won't\nbring them proof of your failure.\"\nMy fading consciousness tried to envision the alien mechanical brain as\nit struggled with the problem.\n\"Look at it this way,\" Kane persisted. \"If you carry our corpses to\nyour masters, all your efforts will have been useless. If you return us\nto the Moon alive, you'll still have a chance to carry out your mission\nlater.\"\nA long silence followed. Verana and Marie screamed at Kane to let go.\nA soft darkness seemed to fill the room, blurring everything, drowning\neven their shrieks in strangling blackness.\n\"You win,\" the machine conceded. \"I'll return the ship to the Moon.\"\nKane released his grip on my throat.\n\"See?\" he asked. \"Didn't I tell you every problem has a solution?\"\nI didn't answer. I was too busy enjoying breathing again.\n", "summary": "The story begins with four humans, Kane, Verana, and Miller, on a ship headed to the Moon. The ship is made by a race from another galaxy, and they have put a ship on the moon as a sort of booby-trap to lure the humans to their planet. The humans have been trying to find a way to conquer the stars for years, and their scientists have been working on a hyperspatial drive that would allow them to cross the stars faster than the speed of light.

Then he\nsaw the glint of sun against the metallic skirt, and relaxed.\nHe chuckled to himself, wondering with amusement what a webfooted man\nwas doing in an old dead city so far from his people. Some facts were\nknown about the people of Alpha Centaurus II. They were not actually\nnatives, he recalled. They were a colony from the fifth planet of\nthe system. They were a curious people. Some were highly intelligent,\nthough uneducated.\nHe decided to ignore the man for the moment. He was far down the\nancient street, a mere speck against the sand. There would be plenty of\ntime to wonder about him.\nHe gazed out from his position at the complex variety of buildings\nbefore him. Some were small, obviously homes. Others were huge\nwith tall, frail spires standing against the pale blue sky. Square\nbuildings, ellipsoid, spheroid. Beautiful, dream-stuff bridges\nconnected tall, conical towers, bridges that still swung in the wind\nafter half a million years. Late afternoon sunlight shone against ebony\nsurfaces. The sands of many centuries had blown down the wide streets\nand filled the doorways. Desert plants grew from roofs of smaller\nbuildings.\nIgnoring the native, Mr. Michaelson poked about among the ruins\nhappily, exclaiming to himself about some particular artifact,\nmarveling at its state of preservation, holding it this way and that to\ncatch the late afternoon sun, smiling, clucking gleefully. He crawled\nover the rubble through old doorways half filled with the accumulation\nof ages. He dug experimentally in the sand with his hands, like a dog,\nunder a roof that had weathered half a million years of rain and sun.\nThen he crawled out again, covered with dust and cobwebs.\nThe native stood in the street less than a hundred feet away, waving\nhis arms madly. \"Mr. Earthgod,\" he cried. \"It is sacred ground where\nyou are trespassing!\"\nThe archeologist smiled, watching the man hurry closer. He was short,\neven for a native. Long gray hair hung to his shoulders, bobbing up\nand down as he walked. He wore no shoes. The toes of his webbed feet\ndragged in the sand, making a deep trail behind him. He was an old man.\n\"You never told us about this old dead city,\" Michaelson said,\nchidingly. \"Shame on you. But never mind. I've found it now. Isn't it\nbeautiful?\"\n\"Yes, beautiful. You will leave now.\"\n\"Leave?\" Michaelson asked, acting surprised as if the man were a\nchild. \"I just got here a few hours ago.\"\n\"You must go.\"\n\"Why? Who are you?\"\n\"I am keeper of the city.\"\n\"You?\" Michaelson laughed. Then, seeing how serious the native was,\nsaid, \"What makes you think a dead city needs a keeper?\"\n\"The spirits may return.\"\nMichaelson crawled out of the doorway and stood up. He brushed his\ntrousers. He pointed. \"See that wall? Built of some metal, I'd say,\nsome alloy impervious to rust and wear.\"\n\"The spirits are angry.\"\n\"Notice the inscriptions? Wind has blown sand against them for eons,\nand rain and sleet. But their story is there, once we decipher it.\"\n\"Leave!\"\nThe native's lined, weathered old face was working around the mouth in\nanger. Michaelson was almost sorry he had mocked him. He was deadly\nserious.\n\"Look,\" he said. \"No spirits are ever coming back here. Don't you know\nthat? And even if they did, spirits care nothing for old cities half\ncovered with sand and dirt.\"\nHe walked away from the old man, heading for another building. The\nsun had already gone below the horizon, coloring the high clouds. He\nglanced backward. The webfoot was following.\n\"Mr. Earthgod!\" the webfoot cried, so sharply that Michaelson stopped.\n\"You must not touch, not walk upon, not handle. Your step may destroy\nthe home of some ancient spirit. Your breath may cause one iota of\nchange and a spirit may lose his way in the darkness. Go quickly now,\nor be killed.\"\nHe turned and walked off, not looking back.\nMichaelson stood in the ancient street, tall, gaunt, feet planted wide,\nhands in pockets, watching the webfoot until he was out of sight beyond\na huge circular building. There was a man to watch. There was one of\nthe intelligent ones. One look into the alert old eyes had told him\nthat.\nMichaelson shook his head, and went about satisfying his curiosity.\nHe entered buildings without thought of roofs falling in, or decayed\nfloors dropping from under his weight. He began to collect small items,\nmaking a pile of them in the street. An ancient bowl, metal untouched\nby the ages. A statue of a man, one foot high, correct to the minutest\ndetail, showing how identical they had been to Earthmen. He found books\nstill standing on ancient shelves but was afraid to touch them without\ntools.\nDarkness came swiftly and he was forced out into the street.\nHe stood there alone feeling the age of the place. Even the smell\nof age was in the air. Silver moonlight from the two moons filtered\nthrough clear air down upon the ruins. The city lay now in darkness,\ndead and still, waiting for morning so it could lie dead and still in\nthe sun.\nThere was no hurry to be going home, although he was alone, although\nthis was Alpha Centaurus II with many unknowns, many dangers ...\nalthough home was a very great distance away. There was no one back\nthere to worry about him.\nHis wife had died many years ago back on Earth. No children. His\nfriends in the settlement would not look for him for another day at\nleast. Anyway, the tiny cylinder, buried in flesh behind his ear, a\nthing of mystery and immense power, could take him home instantly,\nwithout effort save a flicker of thought.\n\"You did not leave, as I asked you.\"\nMichaelson whirled around at the sound of the native's voice. Then he\nrelaxed. He said, \"You shouldn't sneak up on a man like that.\"\n\"You must leave, or I will be forced to kill you. I do not want to kill\nyou, but if I must....\" He made a clucking sound deep in the throat.\n\"The spirits are angry.\"\n\"Nonsense. Superstition! But never mind. You have been here longer\nthan I. Tell me, what are those instruments in the rooms? It looks like\na clock but I'm certain it had some other function.\"\n\"What rooms?\"\n\"Oh, come now. The small rooms back there. Look like they were\nbedrooms.\"\n\"I do not know.\" The webfoot drew closer. Michaelson decided he was\nsixty or seventy years old, at least.\n\"You've been here a long time. You are intelligent, and you must be\neducated, the way you talk. That gadget looks like a time-piece of some\nsort. What is it? What does it measure?\"\n\"I insist that you go.\" The webfoot held something in his hand.\n\"No.\" Michaelson looked off down the street, trying to ignore the\nnative, trying to feel the life of the city as it might have been.\n\"You are sensitive,\" the native said in his ear. \"It takes a sensitive\ngod to feel the spirits moving in the houses and walking in these old\nstreets.\"\n\"Say it any way you want to. This is the most fascinating thing\nI've ever seen. The Inca's treasure, the ruins of Pompeii, Egyptian\ntombs\u2014none can hold a candle to this.\"\n\"Mr. Earthgod....\"\n\"Don't call me that. I'm not a god, and you know it.\"\nThe old man shrugged. \"It is not an item worthy of dispute. Those names\nyou mention, are they the names of gods?\"\nHe chuckled. \"In a way, yes. What is your name?\"\n\"Maota.\"\n\"You must help me, Maota. These things must be preserved. We'll build\na museum, right here in the street. No, over there on the hill just\noutside the city. We'll collect all the old writings and perhaps we may\ndecipher them. Think of it, Maota! To read pages written so long ago\nand think their thoughts. We'll put everything under glass. Build and\nevacuate chambers to stop the decay. Catalogue, itemize....\"\nMichaelson was warming up to his subject, but Maota shook his head like\na waving palm frond and stamped his feet.\n\"You will leave now.\"\n\"Can't you see? Look at the decay. These things are priceless. They\nmust be preserved. Future generations will thank us.\"\n\"Do you mean,\" the old man asked, aghast, \"that you want others to come\nhere? You know the city abhors the sound of alien voices. Those who\nlived here may return one day! They must not find their city packaged\nand preserved and laid out on shelves for the curious to breathe their\nfoul breaths upon. You will leave. Now!\"\n\"No.\" Michaelson was adamant. The rock of Gibraltar.\nMaota hit him, quickly, passionately, and dropped the weapon beside his\nbody. He turned swiftly, making a swirling mark in the sand with his\nheel, and walked off toward the hills outside the city.\nThe weapon he had used was an ancient book. Its paper-thin pages\nrustled in the wind as if an unseen hand turned them, reading, while\nMichaelson's blood trickled out from the head wound upon the ancient\nstreet.\nWhen he regained consciousness the two moons, bright sentinel orbs in\nthe night sky, had moved to a new position down their sliding path. Old\nMaota's absence took some of the weirdness and fantasy away. It seemed\na more practical place now.\nThe gash in his head was painful, throbbing with quick, short\nhammer-blows synchronized with his heart beats. But there was a new\ndetermination in him. If it was a fight that the old webfooted fool\nwanted, a fight he would get. The cylinder flicked him, at his command,\nacross five hundred miles of desert and rocks to a small creek he\nremembered. Here he bathed his head in cool water until all the caked\nblood was dissolved from his hair. Feeling better, he went back.\nThe wind had turned cool. Michaelson shivered, wishing he had brought\na coat. The city was absolutely still except for small gusts of wind\nsighing through the frail spires. The ancient book still lay in the\nsand beside the dark spot of blood. He stooped over and picked it up.\nIt was light, much lighter than most Earth books. He ran a hand over\nthe binding. Smooth it was, untouched by time or climate. He squinted\nat the pages, tilting the book to catch the bright moonlight, but the\nwriting was alien. He touched the page, ran his forefinger over the\nwriting.\nSuddenly he sprang back. The book fell from his hands.\n\"God in heaven!\" he exclaimed.\nHe had heard a voice. He looked around at the old buildings, down the\nlength of the ancient street. Something strange about the voice. Not\nMaota. Not his tones. Not his words. Satisfied that no one was near, he\nstooped and picked up the book again.\n\"Good God!\" he said aloud. It was the book talking. His fingers had\ntouched the writing again. It was not a voice, exactly, but a stirring\nin his mind, like a strange language heard for the first time.\nA talking book. What other surprises were in the city? Tall,\nfragile buildings laughing at time and weather. A clock measuring\nGod-knows-what. If such wonders remained, what about those already\ndestroyed? One could only guess at the machines, the gadgets, the\nartistry already decayed and blown away to mix forever with the sand.\nI must preserve it, he thought, whether Maota likes it or not. They\nsay these people lived half a million years ago. A long time. Let's\nsee, now. A man lives one hundred years on the average. Five thousand\nlifetimes.\nAnd all you do is touch a book, and a voice jumps across all those\nyears!\nHe started off toward the tall building he had examined upon discovery\nof the city. His left eyelid began to twitch and he laid his forefinger\nagainst the eye, pressing until it stopped. Then he stooped and entered\nthe building. He laid the book down and tried to take the \"clock\"\noff the wall. It was dark in the building and his fingers felt along\nthe wall, looking for it. Then he touched it. His fingers moved over\nits smooth surface. Then suddenly he jerked his hand back with an\nexclamation of amazement. Fear ran up his spine.\nThe clock was warm.\nHe felt like running, like flicking back to the settlement where there\nwere people and familiar voices, for here was a thing that should not\nbe. Half a million years\u2014and here was warmth!\nHe touched it again, curiosity overwhelming his fear. It was warm. No\nmistake. And there was a faint vibration, a suggestion of power. He\nstood there in the darkness staring off into the darkness, trembling.\nFear built up in him until it was a monstrous thing, drowning reason.\nHe forgot the power of the cylinder behind his ear. He scrambled\nthrough the doorway. He got up and ran down the ancient sandy street\nuntil he came to the edge of the city. Here he stopped, gasping for\nair, feeling the pain throb in his head.\nCommon sense said that he should go home, that nothing worthwhile could\nbe accomplished at night, that he was tired, that he was weak from loss\nof blood and fright and running. But when Michaelson was on the trail\nof important discoveries he had no common sense.\nHe sat down in the darkness, meaning to rest a moment.\nWhen he awoke dawn was red against thin clouds in the east.\nOld Maota stood in the street with webbed feet planted far apart in\nthe sand, a weapon in the crook of his arm. It was a long tube affair,\nfamiliar to Michaelson.\nMichaelson asked, \"Did you sleep well?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"I'm sorry to hear that.\"\n\"How do you feel?\"\n\"Fine, but my head aches a little.\"\n\"Sorry,\" Maota said.\n\"For what?\"\n\"For hitting you. Pain is not for gods like you.\"\nMichaelson relaxed somewhat. \"What kind of man are you? First you try\nto break my skull, then you apologize.\"\n\"I abhor pain. I should have killed you outright.\"\nHe thought about that for a moment, eyeing the weapon.\nIt looked in good working order. Slim and shiny and innocent, it looked\nlike a glorified African blowgun. But he was not deceived by its\nappearance. It was a deadly weapon.\n\"Well,\" he said, \"before you kill me, tell me about the book.\" He held\nit up for Maota to see.\n\"What about the book?\"\n\"What kind of book is it?\"\n\"What does Mr. Earthgod mean, what\nkind\nof book? You have seen it. It\nis like any other book, except for the material and the fact that it\ntalks.\"\n\"No, no. I mean, what's in it?\"\n\"Poetry.\"\n\"Poetry? For God's sake, why poetry? Why not mathematics or history?\nWhy not tell how to make the metal of the book itself? Now there is a\nsubject worthy of a book.\"\nMaota shook his head. \"One does not study a dead culture to learn how\nthey made things, but how they thought. But we are wasting time. I must\nkill you now, so I can get some rest.\"\nThe old man raised the gun.\n\"Wait! You forget that I also have a weapon.\" He pointed to the spot\nbehind his ear where the cylinder was buried. \"I can move faster than\nyou can fire the gun.\"\nMaota nodded. \"I have heard how you travel. It does not matter. I will\nkill you anyway.\"\n\"I suggest we negotiate.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Why not?\"\nMaota looked off toward the hills, old eyes filmed from years of sand\nand wind, leather skin lined and pitted. The hills stood immobile,\nbrown-gray, already shimmering with heat, impotent.\n\"Why not?\" Michaelson repeated.\n\"Why not what?\" Maota dragged his eyes back.\n\"Negotiate.\"\n\"No.\" Maota's eyes grew hard as steel. They stood there in the sun, not\ntwenty feet apart, hating each other. The two moons, very pale and far\naway on the western horizon, stared like two bottomless eyes.\n\"All right, then. At least it's a quick death. I hear that thing just\ndisintegrates a man. Pfft! And that's that.\"\nMichaelson prepared himself to move if the old man's finger slid closer\ntoward the firing stud. The old man raised the gun.\n\"Wait!\"\n\"Now what?\"\n\"At least read some of the book to me before I die, then.\"\nThe gun wavered. \"I am not an unreasonable man,\" the webfoot said.\nMichaelson stepped forward, extending his arm with the book.\n\"No, stay where you are. Throw it.\"\n\"This book is priceless. You just don't go throwing such valuable items\naround.\"\n\"It won't break. Throw it.\"\nMichaelson threw the book. It landed at Maota's feet, spouting sand\nagainst his leg. He shifted the weapon, picked up the book and leafed\nthrough it, raising his head in a listening attitude, searching for\na suitable passage. Michaelson heard the thin, metallic pages rustle\nsoftly. He could have jumped and seized the weapon at that moment, but\nhis desire to hear the book was strong.\nOld Maota read, Michaelson listened. The cadence was different, the\nsyntax confusing. But the thoughts were there. It might have been\na professor back on Earth reading to his students. Keats, Shelley,\nBrowning. These people were human, with human thoughts and aspirations.\nThe old man stopped reading. He squatted slowly, keeping Michaelson in\nsight, and laid the book face up in the sand. Wind moved the pages.\n\"See?\" he said. \"The spirits read. They must have been great readers,\nthese people. They drink the book, as if it were an elixir. See how\ngentle! They lap at the pages like a new kitten tasting milk.\"\nMichaelson laughed. \"You certainly have an imagination.\"\n\"What difference does it make?\" Maota cried, suddenly angry. \"You want\nto close up all these things in boxes for a posterity who may have no\nslightest feeling or appreciation. I want to leave the city as it is,\nfor spirits whose existence I cannot prove.\"\nThe old man's eyes were furious now, deadly. The gun came down directly\nin line with the Earthman's chest. The gnarled finger moved.\nMichaelson, using the power of the cylinder behind his ear, jumped\nbehind the old webfoot. To Maota it seemed that he had flicked out of\nexistence like a match blown out. The next instant Michaelson spun\nhim around and hit him. It was an inexpert fist, belonging to an\narcheologist, not a fighter. But Maota was an old man.\nHe dropped in the sand, momentarily stunned. Michaelson bent over to\npick up the gun and the old man, feeling it slip from his fingers,\nhung on and was pulled to his feet.\nThey struggled for possession of the gun, silently, gasping, kicking\nsand. Faces grew red. Lips drew back over Michaelson's white teeth,\nover Maota's pink, toothless gums. The dead city's fragile spires threw\nimpersonal shadows down where they fought.\nThen quite suddenly a finger or hand\u2014neither knew whose finger or\nhand\u2014touched the firing stud.\nThere was a hollow, whooshing sound. Both stopped still, realizing the\ntotal destruction they might have caused.\n\"It only hit the ground,\" Michaelson said.\nA black, charred hole, two feet in diameter and\u2014they could not see how\ndeep\u2014stared at them.\nMaota let go and sprawled in the sand. \"The book!\" he cried. \"The book\nis gone!\"\n\"No! We probably covered it with sand while we fought.\"\nBoth men began scooping sand in their cupped hands, digging frantically\nfor the book. Saliva dripped from Maota's mouth, but he didn't know or\ncare.\nFinally they stopped, exhausted. They had covered a substantial area\naround the hole. They had covered the complete area where they had been.\n\"We killed it,\" the old man moaned.\n\"It was just a book. Not alive, you know.\"\n\"How do you know?\" The old man's pale eyes were filled with tears. \"It\ntalked and it sang. In a way, it had a soul. Sometimes on long nights I\nused to imagine it loved me, for taking care of it.\"\n\"There are other books. We'll get another.\"\nMaota shook his head. \"There are no more.\"\n\"But I've seen them. Down there in the square building.\"\n\"Not poetry. Books, yes, but not poetry. That was the only book with\nsongs.\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\"\nYou\nkilled it!\" Maota suddenly sprang for the weapon, lying\nforgotten in the sand. Michaelson put his foot on it and Maota was too\nweak to tear it loose. He could only weep out his rage.\nWhen he could talk again, Maota said, \"I am sorry, Mr. Earthgod. I've\ndisgraced myself.\"\n\"Don't be sorry.\" Michaelson helped him to his feet. \"We fight for some\nreasons, cry for others. A priceless book is a good reason for either.\"\n\"Not for that. For not winning. I should have killed you last night\nwhen I had the chance. The gods give us chances and if we don't take\nthem we lose forever.\"\n\"I told you before! We are on the same side. Negotiate. Have you never\nheard of negotiation?\"\n\"You are a god,\" Maota said. \"One does not negotiate with gods. One\neither loves them, or kills them.\"\n\"That's another thing. I am not a god. Can't you understand?\"\n\"Of course you are.\" Maota looked up, very sure. \"Mortals cannot step\nfrom star to star like crossing a shallow brook.\"\n\"No, no. I don't step from one star to another. An invention does that.\nJust an invention. I carry it with me. It's a tiny thing. No one would\never guess it has such power. So you see, I'm human, just like you. Hit\nme and I hurt. Cut me and I bleed. I love. I hate. I was born. Some day\nI'll die. See? I'm human. Just a human with a machine. No more than\nthat.\"\nMaota laughed, then sobered quickly. \"You lie.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"If I had this machine, could I travel as you?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Then I'll kill you and take yours.\"\n\"It would not work for you.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Each machine is tailored for each person.\"\nThe old man hung his head. He looked down into the black, charred\nhole. He walked all around the hole. He kicked at the sand, looking\nhalf-heartedly again for the book.\n\"Look,\" Michaelson said. \"I'm sure I've convinced you that I'm human.\nWhy not have a try at negotiating our differences?\"\nHe looked up. His expressive eyes, deep, resigned, studied Michaelson's\nface. Finally he shook his head sadly. \"When we first met I hoped we\ncould think the ancient thoughts together. But our paths diverge. We\nhave finished, you and I.\"\nHe turned and started off, shoulders slumped dejectedly.\nMichaelson caught up to him. \"Are you leaving the city?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\"Away. Far away.\" Maota looked off toward the hills, eyes distant.\n\"Don't be stupid, old man. How can you go far away and not leave the\ncity?\"\n\"There are many directions. You would not understand.\"\n\"East. West. North. South. Up. Down.\"\n\"No, no. There is another direction. Come, if you must see.\"\nMichaelson followed him far down the street. They came to a section of\nthe city he had not seen before. Buildings were smaller, spires dwarfed\nagainst larger structures. Here a path was packed in the sand, leading\nto a particular building.\nMichaelson said, \"This is where you live?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nMaota went inside. Michaelson stood in the entrance and looked around.\nThe room was clean, furnished with hand made chairs and a bed. Who is\nthis old man, he thought, far from his people, living alone, choosing\na life of solitude among ancient ruins but not touching them? Above\nthe bed a \"clock\" was fastened to the wall, Michaelson remembered his\nfright\u2014thinking of the warmth where warmth should not be.\nMaota pointed to it.\n\"You asked about this machine,\" he said. \"Now I will tell you.\" He laid\nhis hand against it. \"Here is power to follow another direction.\"\nMichaelson tested one of the chairs to see if it would hold his weight,\nthen sat down. His curiosity about the instrument was colossal, but he\nforced a short laugh. \"Maota, you\nare\ncomplex. Why not stop all this\nmystery nonsense and tell me about it? You know more about it than I.\"\n\"Of course.\" Maota smiled a toothless, superior smile. \"What do you\nsuppose happened to this race?\"\n\"You tell me.\"\n\"They took the unknown direction. The books speak of it. I don't know\nhow the instrument works, but one thing is certain. The race did not\ndie out, as a species becomes extinct.\"\nMichaelson was amused, but interested. \"Something like a fourth\ndimension?\"\n\"I don't know. I only know that with this instrument there is no death.\nI have read the books that speak of this race, this wonderful people\nwho conquered all disease, who explored all the mysteries of science,\nwho devised this machine to cheat death. See this button here on the\nface of the instrument? Press the button, and....\"\n\"And what?\"\n\"I don't know, exactly. But I have lived many years. I have walked the\nstreets of this city and wondered, and wanted to press the button. Now\nI will do so.\"\nQuickly the old man, still smiling, pressed the button. A high-pitched\nwhine filled the air, just within audio range. Steady for a moment, it\nthen rose in pitch passing beyond hearing quickly.\nThe old man's knees buckled. He sank down, fell over the bed, lay\nstill. Michaelson touched him cautiously, then examined him more\ncarefully. No question about it.\nThe old man was dead.\nFeeling depressed and alone, Michaelson found a desert knoll outside\nthe city overlooking the tall spires that shone in the sunlight and\ngleamed in the moonlight. He made a stretcher, rolled the old man's\nbody on to it and dragged it down the long ancient street and up the\nknoll.\nHere he buried him.\nBut it seemed a waste of time. Somehow he knew beyond any doubt that\nthe old native and his body were completely disassociated in some sense\nmore complete than death.\nIn the days that followed he gave much thought to the \"clock.\" He came\nto the city every day. He spent long hours in the huge square building\nwith the books. He learned the language by sheer bulldog determination.\nThen he searched the books for information about the instrument.\nFinally after many weeks, long after the winds had obliterated all\nevidence of Maota's grave on the knoll, Michaelson made a decision. He\nhad to know if the machine would work for him.\nAnd so one afternoon when the ancient spires threw long shadows\nover the sand he walked down the long street and entered the old\nman's house. He stood before the instrument, trembling, afraid, but\ndetermined. He pinched his eyes shut tight like a child and pressed the\nbutton.\nThe high-pitched whine started.\nComplete, utter silence. Void. Darkness. Awareness and memory, yes;\nnothing else. Then Maota's chuckle came. No sound, an impression only\nlike the voice from the ancient book. Where was he? There was no left\nor right, up or down. Maota was everywhere, nowhere.\n\"Look!\" Maota's thought was directed at him in this place of no\ndirection. \"Think of the city and you will see it.\"\nMichaelson did, and he saw the city beyond, as if he were looking\nthrough a window. And yet he was in the city looking at his own body.\nMaota's chuckle again. \"The city will remain as it is. You did not win\nafter all.\"\n\"Neither did you.\"\n\"But this existence has compensations,\" Maota said. \"You can be\nanywhere, see anywhere on this planet. Even on your Earth.\"\nMichaelson felt a great sadness, seeing his body lying across the\nold, home made bed. He looked closer. He sensed a vibration or life\nforce\u2014he didn't stop to define it\u2014in his body. Why was his dead body\ndifferent from Old Maota's? Could it be that there was some thread\nstretching from the reality of his body to his present state?\n\"I don't like your thoughts,\" Maota said. \"No one can go back. I tried.\nI have discussed it with many who are not presently in communication\nwith you. No one can go back.\"\nMichaelson decided he try.\n\"No!\" Maota's thought was prickled with fear and anger.\nMichaelson did not know how to try, but he remembered the cylinder and\ngathered all the force of his mind in spite of Maota's protests, and\ngave his most violent command.\nAt first he thought it didn't work. He got up and looked around, then\nit struck him.\nHe was standing up!\nThe cylinder. He knew it was the cylinder. That was the difference\nbetween himself and Maota. When he used the cylinder, that was where\nhe went, the place where Maota was now. It was a door of some kind,\nleading to a path of some kind where distance was non-existent.

Then he\nsaw the glint of sun against the metallic skirt, and relaxed.\nHe chuckled to himself, wondering with amusement what a webfooted man\nwas doing in an old dead city so far from his people. Some facts were\nknown about the people of Alpha Centaurus II. They were not actually\nnatives, he recalled. They were a colony from the fifth planet of\nthe system. They were a curious people. Some were highly intelligent,\nthough uneducated.\nHe decided to ignore the man for the moment. He was far down the\nancient street, a mere speck against the sand. There would be plenty of\ntime to wonder about him.\nHe gazed out from his position at the complex variety of buildings\nbefore him. Some were small, obviously homes. Others were huge\nwith tall, frail spires standing against the pale blue sky. Square\nbuildings, ellipsoid, spheroid. Beautiful, dream-stuff bridges\nconnected tall, conical towers, bridges that still swung in the wind\nafter half a million years. Late afternoon sunlight shone against ebony\nsurfaces. The sands of many centuries had blown down the wide streets\nand filled the doorways. Desert plants grew from roofs of smaller\nbuildings.\nIgnoring the native, Mr. Michaelson poked about among the ruins\nhappily, exclaiming to himself about some particular artifact,\nmarveling at its state of preservation, holding it this way and that to\ncatch the late afternoon sun, smiling, clucking gleefully. He crawled\nover the rubble through old doorways half filled with the accumulation\nof ages. He dug experimentally in the sand with his hands, like a dog,\nunder a roof that had weathered half a million years of rain and sun.\nThen he crawled out again, covered with dust and cobwebs.\nThe native stood in the street less than a hundred feet away, waving\nhis arms madly. \"Mr. Earthgod,\" he cried. \"It is sacred ground where\nyou are trespassing!\"\nThe archeologist smiled, watching the man hurry closer. He was short,\neven for a native. Long gray hair hung to his shoulders, bobbing up\nand down as he walked. He wore no shoes. The toes of his webbed feet\ndragged in the sand, making a deep trail behind him. He was an old man.\n\"You never told us about this old dead city,\" Michaelson said,\nchidingly. \"Shame on you. But never mind. I've found it now. Isn't it\nbeautiful?\"\n\"Yes, beautiful. You will leave now.\"\n\"Leave?\" Michaelson asked, acting surprised as if the man were a\nchild. \"I just got here a few hours ago.\"\n\"You must go.\"\n\"Why? Who are you?\"\n\"I am keeper of the city.\"\n\"You?\" Michaelson laughed. Then, seeing how serious the native was,\nsaid, \"What makes you think a dead city needs a keeper?\"\n\"The spirits may return.\"\nMichaelson crawled out of the doorway and stood up. He brushed his\ntrousers. He pointed. \"See that wall? Built of some metal, I'd say,\nsome alloy impervious to rust and wear.\"\n\"The spirits are angry.\"\n\"Notice the inscriptions? Wind has blown sand against them for eons,\nand rain and sleet. But their story is there, once we decipher it.\"\n\"Leave!\"\nThe native's lined, weathered old face was working around the mouth in\nanger. Michaelson was almost sorry he had mocked him. He was deadly\nserious.\n\"Look,\" he said. \"No spirits are ever coming back here. Don't you know\nthat? And even if they did, spirits care nothing for old cities half\ncovered with sand and dirt.\"\nHe walked away from the old man, heading for another building. The\nsun had already gone below the horizon, coloring the high clouds. He\nglanced backward. The webfoot was following.\n\"Mr. Earthgod!\" the webfoot cried, so sharply that Michaelson stopped.\n\"You must not touch, not walk upon, not handle. Your step may destroy\nthe home of some ancient spirit. Your breath may cause one iota of\nchange and a spirit may lose his way in the darkness. Go quickly now,\nor be killed.\"\nHe turned and walked off, not looking back.\nMichaelson stood in the ancient street, tall, gaunt, feet planted wide,\nhands in pockets, watching the webfoot until he was out of sight beyond\na huge circular building. There was a man to watch. There was one of\nthe intelligent ones. One look into the alert old eyes had told him\nthat.\nMichaelson shook his head, and went about satisfying his curiosity.\nHe entered buildings without thought of roofs falling in, or decayed\nfloors dropping from under his weight. He began to collect small items,\nmaking a pile of them in the street. An ancient bowl, metal untouched\nby the ages. A statue of a man, one foot high, correct to the minutest\ndetail, showing how identical they had been to Earthmen. He found books\nstill standing on ancient shelves but was afraid to touch them without\ntools.\nDarkness came swiftly and he was forced out into the street.\nHe stood there alone feeling the age of the place. Even the smell\nof age was in the air. Silver moonlight from the two moons filtered\nthrough clear air down upon the ruins. The city lay now in darkness,\ndead and still, waiting for morning so it could lie dead and still in\nthe sun.\nThere was no hurry to be going home, although he was alone, although\nthis was Alpha Centaurus II with many unknowns, many dangers ...\nalthough home was a very great distance away. There was no one back\nthere to worry about him.\nHis wife had died many years ago back on Earth. No children. His\nfriends in the settlement would not look for him for another day at\nleast. Anyway, the tiny cylinder, buried in flesh behind his ear, a\nthing of mystery and immense power, could take him home instantly,\nwithout effort save a flicker of thought.\n\"You did not leave, as I asked you.\"\nMichaelson whirled around at the sound of the native's voice. Then he\nrelaxed. He said, \"You shouldn't sneak up on a man like that.\"\n\"You must leave, or I will be forced to kill you. I do not want to kill\nyou, but if I must....\" He made a clucking sound deep in the throat.\n\"The spirits are angry.\"\n\"Nonsense. Superstition! But never mind. You have been here longer\nthan I. Tell me, what are those instruments in the rooms? It looks like\na clock but I'm certain it had some other function.\"\n\"What rooms?\"\n\"Oh, come now. The small rooms back there. Look like they were\nbedrooms.\"\n\"I do not know.\" The webfoot drew closer. Michaelson decided he was\nsixty or seventy years old, at least.\n\"You've been here a long time. You are intelligent, and you must be\neducated, the way you talk. That gadget looks like a time-piece of some\nsort. What is it? What does it measure?\"\n\"I insist that you go.\" The webfoot held something in his hand.\n\"No.\" Michaelson looked off down the street, trying to ignore the\nnative, trying to feel the life of the city as it might have been.\n\"You are sensitive,\" the native said in his ear. \"It takes a sensitive\ngod to feel the spirits moving in the houses and walking in these old\nstreets.\"\n\"Say it any way you want to. This is the most fascinating thing\nI've ever seen. The Inca's treasure, the ruins of Pompeii, Egyptian\ntombs\u2014none can hold a candle to this.\"\n\"Mr. Earthgod....\"\n\"Don't call me that. I'm not a god, and you know it.\"\nThe old man shrugged. \"It is not an item worthy of dispute. Those names\nyou mention, are they the names of gods?\"\nHe chuckled. \"In a way, yes. What is your name?\"\n\"Maota.\"\n\"You must help me, Maota. These things must be preserved. We'll build\na museum, right here in the street. No, over there on the hill just\noutside the city. We'll collect all the old writings and perhaps we may\ndecipher them. Think of it, Maota! To read pages written so long ago\nand think their thoughts. We'll put everything under glass. Build and\nevacuate chambers to stop the decay. Catalogue, itemize....\"\nMichaelson was warming up to his subject, but Maota shook his head like\na waving palm frond and stamped his feet.\n\"You will leave now.\"\n\"Can't you see? Look at the decay. These things are priceless. They\nmust be preserved. Future generations will thank us.\"\n\"Do you mean,\" the old man asked, aghast, \"that you want others to come\nhere? You know the city abhors the sound of alien voices. Those who\nlived here may return one day! They must not find their city packaged\nand preserved and laid out on shelves for the curious to breathe their\nfoul breaths upon. You will leave. Now!\"\n\"No.\" Michaelson was adamant. The rock of Gibraltar.\nMaota hit him, quickly, passionately, and dropped the weapon beside his\nbody. He turned swiftly, making a swirling mark in the sand with his\nheel, and walked off toward the hills outside the city.\nThe weapon he had used was an ancient book. Its paper-thin pages\nrustled in the wind as if an unseen hand turned them, reading, while\nMichaelson's blood trickled out from the head wound upon the ancient\nstreet.\nWhen he regained consciousness the two moons, bright sentinel orbs in\nthe night sky, had moved to a new position down their sliding path. Old\nMaota's absence took some of the weirdness and fantasy away. It seemed\na more practical place now.\nThe gash in his head was painful, throbbing with quick, short\nhammer-blows synchronized with his heart beats. But there was a new\ndetermination in him. If it was a fight that the old webfooted fool\nwanted, a fight he would get. The cylinder flicked him, at his command,\nacross five hundred miles of desert and rocks to a small creek he\nremembered. Here he bathed his head in cool water until all the caked\nblood was dissolved from his hair. Feeling better, he went back.\nThe wind had turned cool. Michaelson shivered, wishing he had brought\na coat. The city was absolutely still except for small gusts of wind\nsighing through the frail spires. The ancient book still lay in the\nsand beside the dark spot of blood. He stooped over and picked it up.\nIt was light, much lighter than most Earth books. He ran a hand over\nthe binding. Smooth it was, untouched by time or climate. He squinted\nat the pages, tilting the book to catch the bright moonlight, but the\nwriting was alien. He touched the page, ran his forefinger over the\nwriting.\nSuddenly he sprang back. The book fell from his hands.\n\"God in heaven!\" he exclaimed.\nHe had heard a voice. He looked around at the old buildings, down the\nlength of the ancient street. Something strange about the voice. Not\nMaota. Not his tones. Not his words. Satisfied that no one was near, he\nstooped and picked up the book again.\n\"Good God!\" he said aloud. It was the book talking. His fingers had\ntouched the writing again. It was not a voice, exactly, but a stirring\nin his mind, like a strange language heard for the first time.\nA talking book. What other surprises were in the city? Tall,\nfragile buildings laughing at time and weather. A clock measuring\nGod-knows-what. If such wonders remained, what about those already\ndestroyed? One could only guess at the machines, the gadgets, the\nartistry already decayed and blown away to mix forever with the sand.\nI must preserve it, he thought, whether Maota likes it or not. They\nsay these people lived half a million years ago. A long time. Let's\nsee, now. A man lives one hundred years on the average. Five thousand\nlifetimes.\nAnd all you do is touch a book, and a voice jumps across all those\nyears!\nHe started off toward the tall building he had examined upon discovery\nof the city. His left eyelid began to twitch and he laid his forefinger\nagainst the eye, pressing until it stopped. Then he stooped and entered\nthe building. He laid the book down and tried to take the \"clock\"\noff the wall. It was dark in the building and his fingers felt along\nthe wall, looking for it. Then he touched it. His fingers moved over\nits smooth surface. Then suddenly he jerked his hand back with an\nexclamation of amazement. Fear ran up his spine.\nThe clock was warm.\nHe felt like running, like flicking back to the settlement where there\nwere people and familiar voices, for here was a thing that should not\nbe. Half a million years\u2014and here was warmth!\nHe touched it again, curiosity overwhelming his fear. It was warm. No\nmistake. And there was a faint vibration, a suggestion of power. He\nstood there in the darkness staring off into the darkness, trembling.\nFear built up in him until it was a monstrous thing, drowning reason.\nHe forgot the power of the cylinder behind his ear. He scrambled\nthrough the doorway. He got up and ran down the ancient sandy street\nuntil he came to the edge of the city. Here he stopped, gasping for\nair, feeling the pain throb in his head.\nCommon sense said that he should go home, that nothing worthwhile could\nbe accomplished at night, that he was tired, that he was weak from loss\nof blood and fright and running. But when Michaelson was on the trail\nof important discoveries he had no common sense.\nHe sat down in the darkness, meaning to rest a moment.\nWhen he awoke dawn was red against thin clouds in the east.\nOld Maota stood in the street with webbed feet planted far apart in\nthe sand, a weapon in the crook of his arm. It was a long tube affair,\nfamiliar to Michaelson.\nMichaelson asked, \"Did you sleep well?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"I'm sorry to hear that.\"\n\"How do you feel?\"\n\"Fine, but my head aches a little.\"\n\"Sorry,\" Maota said.\n\"For what?\"\n\"For hitting you. Pain is not for gods like you.\"\nMichaelson relaxed somewhat. \"What kind of man are you? First you try\nto break my skull, then you apologize.\"\n\"I abhor pain. I should have killed you outright.\"\nHe thought about that for a moment, eyeing the weapon.\nIt looked in good working order. Slim and shiny and innocent, it looked\nlike a glorified African blowgun. But he was not deceived by its\nappearance. It was a deadly weapon.\n\"Well,\" he said, \"before you kill me, tell me about the book.\" He held\nit up for Maota to see.\n\"What about the book?\"\n\"What kind of book is it?\"\n\"What does Mr. Earthgod mean, what\nkind\nof book? You have seen it. It\nis like any other book, except for the material and the fact that it\ntalks.\"\n\"No, no. I mean, what's in it?\"\n\"Poetry.\"\n\"Poetry? For God's sake, why poetry? Why not mathematics or history?\nWhy not tell how to make the metal of the book itself? Now there is a\nsubject worthy of a book.\"\nMaota shook his head. \"One does not study a dead culture to learn how\nthey made things, but how they thought. But we are wasting time. I must\nkill you now, so I can get some rest.\"\nThe old man raised the gun.\n\"Wait! You forget that I also have a weapon.\" He pointed to the spot\nbehind his ear where the cylinder was buried. \"I can move faster than\nyou can fire the gun.\"\nMaota nodded. \"I have heard how you travel. It does not matter. I will\nkill you anyway.\"\n\"I suggest we negotiate.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Why not?\"\nMaota looked off toward the hills, old eyes filmed from years of sand\nand wind, leather skin lined and pitted. The hills stood immobile,\nbrown-gray, already shimmering with heat, impotent.\n\"Why not?\" Michaelson repeated.\n\"Why not what?\" Maota dragged his eyes back.\n\"Negotiate.\"\n\"No.\" Maota's eyes grew hard as steel. They stood there in the sun, not\ntwenty feet apart, hating each other. The two moons, very pale and far\naway on the western horizon, stared like two bottomless eyes.\n\"All right, then. At least it's a quick death. I hear that thing just\ndisintegrates a man. Pfft! And that's that.\"\nMichaelson prepared himself to move if the old man's finger slid closer\ntoward the firing stud. The old man raised the gun.\n\"Wait!\"\n\"Now what?\"\n\"At least read some of the book to me before I die, then.\"\nThe gun wavered. \"I am not an unreasonable man,\" the webfoot said.\nMichaelson stepped forward, extending his arm with the book.\n\"No, stay where you are. Throw it.\"\n\"This book is priceless. You just don't go throwing such valuable items\naround.\"\n\"It won't break. Throw it.\"\nMichaelson threw the book. It landed at Maota's feet, spouting sand\nagainst his leg. He shifted the weapon, picked up the book and leafed\nthrough it, raising his head in a listening attitude, searching for\na suitable passage. Michaelson heard the thin, metallic pages rustle\nsoftly. He could have jumped and seized the weapon at that moment, but\nhis desire to hear the book was strong.\nOld Maota read, Michaelson listened. The cadence was different, the\nsyntax confusing. But the thoughts were there. It might have been\na professor back on Earth reading to his students. Keats, Shelley,\nBrowning. These people were human, with human thoughts and aspirations.\nThe old man stopped reading. He squatted slowly, keeping Michaelson in\nsight, and laid the book face up in the sand. Wind moved the pages.\n\"See?\" he said. \"The spirits read. They must have been great readers,\nthese people. They drink the book, as if it were an elixir. See how\ngentle! They lap at the pages like a new kitten tasting milk.\"\nMichaelson laughed. \"You certainly have an imagination.\"\n\"What difference does it make?\" Maota cried, suddenly angry. \"You want\nto close up all these things in boxes for a posterity who may have no\nslightest feeling or appreciation. I want to leave the city as it is,\nfor spirits whose existence I cannot prove.\"\nThe old man's eyes were furious now, deadly. The gun came down directly\nin line with the Earthman's chest. The gnarled finger moved.\nMichaelson, using the power of the cylinder behind his ear, jumped\nbehind the old webfoot. To Maota it seemed that he had flicked out of\nexistence like a match blown out. The next instant Michaelson spun\nhim around and hit him. It was an inexpert fist, belonging to an\narcheologist, not a fighter. But Maota was an old man.\nHe dropped in the sand, momentarily stunned. Michaelson bent over to\npick up the gun and the old man, feeling it slip from his fingers,\nhung on and was pulled to his feet.\nThey struggled for possession of the gun, silently, gasping, kicking\nsand. Faces grew red. Lips drew back over Michaelson's white teeth,\nover Maota's pink, toothless gums. The dead city's fragile spires threw\nimpersonal shadows down where they fought.\nThen quite suddenly a finger or hand\u2014neither knew whose finger or\nhand\u2014touched the firing stud.\nThere was a hollow, whooshing sound. Both stopped still, realizing the\ntotal destruction they might have caused.\n\"It only hit the ground,\" Michaelson said.\nA black, charred hole, two feet in diameter and\u2014they could not see how\ndeep\u2014stared at them.\nMaota let go and sprawled in the sand. \"The book!\" he cried. \"The book\nis gone!\"\n\"No! We probably covered it with sand while we fought.\"\nBoth men began scooping sand in their cupped hands, digging frantically\nfor the book. Saliva dripped from Maota's mouth, but he didn't know or\ncare.\nFinally they stopped, exhausted. They had covered a substantial area\naround the hole. They had covered the complete area where they had been.\n\"We killed it,\" the old man moaned.\n\"It was just a book. Not alive, you know.\"\n\"How do you know?\" The old man's pale eyes were filled with tears. \"It\ntalked and it sang. In a way, it had a soul. Sometimes on long nights I\nused to imagine it loved me, for taking care of it.\"\n\"There are other books. We'll get another.\"\nMaota shook his head. \"There are no more.\"\n\"But I've seen them. Down there in the square building.\"\n\"Not poetry. Books, yes, but not poetry. That was the only book with\nsongs.\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\"\nYou\nkilled it!\" Maota suddenly sprang for the weapon, lying\nforgotten in the sand. Michaelson put his foot on it and Maota was too\nweak to tear it loose. He could only weep out his rage.\nWhen he could talk again, Maota said, \"I am sorry, Mr. Earthgod. I've\ndisgraced myself.\"\n\"Don't be sorry.\" Michaelson helped him to his feet. \"We fight for some\nreasons, cry for others. A priceless book is a good reason for either.\"\n\"Not for that. For not winning. I should have killed you last night\nwhen I had the chance. The gods give us chances and if we don't take\nthem we lose forever.\"\n\"I told you before! We are on the same side. Negotiate. Have you never\nheard of negotiation?\"\n\"You are a god,\" Maota said. \"One does not negotiate with gods. One\neither loves them, or kills them.\"\n\"That's another thing. I am not a god. Can't you understand?\"\n\"Of course you are.\" Maota looked up, very sure. \"Mortals cannot step\nfrom star to star like crossing a shallow brook.\"\n\"No, no. I don't step from one star to another. An invention does that.\nJust an invention. I carry it with me. It's a tiny thing. No one would\never guess it has such power. So you see, I'm human, just like you. Hit\nme and I hurt. Cut me and I bleed. I love. I hate. I was born. Some day\nI'll die. See? I'm human. Just a human with a machine. No more than\nthat.\"\nMaota laughed, then sobered quickly. \"You lie.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"If I had this machine, could I travel as you?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Then I'll kill you and take yours.\"\n\"It would not work for you.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Each machine is tailored for each person.\"\nThe old man hung his head. He looked down into the black, charred\nhole. He walked all around the hole. He kicked at the sand, looking\nhalf-heartedly again for the book.\n\"Look,\" Michaelson said. \"I'm sure I've convinced you that I'm human.\nWhy not have a try at negotiating our differences?\"\nHe looked up. His expressive eyes, deep, resigned, studied Michaelson's\nface. Finally he shook his head sadly. \"When we first met I hoped we\ncould think the ancient thoughts together. But our paths diverge. We\nhave finished, you and I.\"\nHe turned and started off, shoulders slumped dejectedly.\nMichaelson caught up to him. \"Are you leaving the city?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\"Away. Far away.\" Maota looked off toward the hills, eyes distant.\n\"Don't be stupid, old man. How can you go far away and not leave the\ncity?\"\n\"There are many directions. You would not understand.\"\n\"East. West. North. South. Up. Down.\"\n\"No, no. There is another direction. Come, if you must see.\"\nMichaelson followed him far down the street. They came to a section of\nthe city he had not seen before. Buildings were smaller, spires dwarfed\nagainst larger structures. Here a path was packed in the sand, leading\nto a particular building.\nMichaelson said, \"This is where you live?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nMaota went inside. Michaelson stood in the entrance and looked around.\nThe room was clean, furnished with hand made chairs and a bed. Who is\nthis old man, he thought, far from his people, living alone, choosing\na life of solitude among ancient ruins but not touching them? Above\nthe bed a \"clock\" was fastened to the wall, Michaelson remembered his\nfright\u2014thinking of the warmth where warmth should not be.\nMaota pointed to it.\n\"You asked about this machine,\" he said. \"Now I will tell you.\" He laid\nhis hand against it. \"Here is power to follow another direction.\"\nMichaelson tested one of the chairs to see if it would hold his weight,\nthen sat down. His curiosity about the instrument was colossal, but he\nforced a short laugh. \"Maota, you\nare\ncomplex. Why not stop all this\nmystery nonsense and tell me about it? You know more about it than I.\"\n\"Of course.\" Maota smiled a toothless, superior smile. \"What do you\nsuppose happened to this race?\"\n\"You tell me.\"\n\"They took the unknown direction. The books speak of it. I don't know\nhow the instrument works, but one thing is certain. The race did not\ndie out, as a species becomes extinct.\"\nMichaelson was amused, but interested. \"Something like a fourth\ndimension?\"\n\"I don't know. I only know that with this instrument there is no death.\nI have read the books that speak of this race, this wonderful people\nwho conquered all disease, who explored all the mysteries of science,\nwho devised this machine to cheat death. See this button here on the\nface of the instrument? Press the button, and....\"\n\"And what?\"\n\"I don't know, exactly. But I have lived many years. I have walked the\nstreets of this city and wondered, and wanted to press the button. Now\nI will do so.\"\nQuickly the old man, still smiling, pressed the button. A high-pitched\nwhine filled the air, just within audio range. Steady for a moment, it\nthen rose in pitch passing beyond hearing quickly.\nThe old man's knees buckled. He sank down, fell over the bed, lay\nstill. Michaelson touched him cautiously, then examined him more\ncarefully. No question about it.\nThe old man was dead.\nFeeling depressed and alone, Michaelson found a desert knoll outside\nthe city overlooking the tall spires that shone in the sunlight and\ngleamed in the moonlight. He made a stretcher, rolled the old man's\nbody on to it and dragged it down the long ancient street and up the\nknoll.\nHere he buried him.\nBut it seemed a waste of time. Somehow he knew beyond any doubt that\nthe old native and his body were completely disassociated in some sense\nmore complete than death.\nIn the days that followed he gave much thought to the \"clock.\" He came\nto the city every day. He spent long hours in the huge square building\nwith the books. He learned the language by sheer bulldog determination.\nThen he searched the books for information about the instrument.\nFinally after many weeks, long after the winds had obliterated all\nevidence of Maota's grave on the knoll, Michaelson made a decision. He\nhad to know if the machine would work for him.\nAnd so one afternoon when the ancient spires threw long shadows\nover the sand he walked down the long street and entered the old\nman's house. He stood before the instrument, trembling, afraid, but\ndetermined. He pinched his eyes shut tight like a child and pressed the\nbutton.\nThe high-pitched whine started.\nComplete, utter silence. Void. Darkness. Awareness and memory, yes;\nnothing else. Then Maota's chuckle came. No sound, an impression only\nlike the voice from the ancient book. Where was he? There was no left\nor right, up or down. Maota was everywhere, nowhere.\n\"Look!\" Maota's thought was directed at him in this place of no\ndirection. \"Think of the city and you will see it.\"\nMichaelson did, and he saw the city beyond, as if he were looking\nthrough a window. And yet he was in the city looking at his own body.\nMaota's chuckle again. \"The city will remain as it is. You did not win\nafter all.\"\n\"Neither did you.\"\n\"But this existence has compensations,\" Maota said. \"You can be\nanywhere, see anywhere on this planet. Even on your Earth.\"\nMichaelson felt a great sadness, seeing his body lying across the\nold, home made bed. He looked closer. He sensed a vibration or life\nforce\u2014he didn't stop to define it\u2014in his body. Why was his dead body\ndifferent from Old Maota's? Could it be that there was some thread\nstretching from the reality of his body to his present state?\n\"I don't like your thoughts,\" Maota said. \"No one can go back. I tried.\nI have discussed it with many who are not presently in communication\nwith you. No one can go back.\"\nMichaelson decided he try.\n\"No!\" Maota's thought was prickled with fear and anger.\nMichaelson did not know how to try, but he remembered the cylinder and\ngathered all the force of his mind in spite of Maota's protests, and\ngave his most violent command.\nAt first he thought it didn't work. He got up and looked around, then\nit struck him.\nHe was standing up!\nThe cylinder. He knew it was the cylinder. That was the difference\nbetween himself and Maota. When he used the cylinder, that was where\nhe went, the place where Maota was now. It was a door of some kind,\nleading to a path of some kind where distance was non-existent. But the\n\"clock\" was a mechanism to transport only the mind to that place.\nTo be certain of it, he pressed the button again, with the same result\nas before. He saw his own body fall down. He felt Maota's presence.\n\"You devil!\" Maota's thought-scream was a sword of hate and anger,\nirrational suddenly, like a person who knows his loss is irrevocable.\n\"I said you were a god. I said you were a god.\nI said you were a\ngod...!\n\"\n", "summary": "The story begins with an archeologist named Michaelson, who is the keeper of the city, exploring the ruins of a dead city. He is talking to a native named Don, who claims to have discovered the city before him. He describes the city as beautiful, filled with buildings that have weathered half a million years of rain and sun. He mentions that he has found a lot of interesting artifacts, including a set of spheroid towers, a set with a spheropod, and a set made of metal. He finds a metal door that is half filled with dust and cobwebs, and he uses it to crawl out of the rubble. He sees a man with webbed feet, who he assumes is the original owner of the ruins. He asks the man to leave, but the man refuses. He says that he is the only one who knows what the city is like, and that he will tell him if he ever returns. He then tells Michaelson that he must leave, because the city has been here for half a century. He tells him that the people of the old city are not actually native, and are not able to leave. He also tells him about the people who live there, and how they are not happy with the state of the planet. He explains that they are a people from the fifth planet of the system, and they have been here to gather information about the new planet that will be built on the planet of Alpha Centauri II. He shows the native the ruins, and tells him to leave the city. The native is angry, and says that the city was a perfect place for them to live. He wants to return to, but he is afraid of the unknown. He leaves the city and goes to the bar, where he meets a man named Karsh, who tells him he is a native. He informs him that he was the last man to see the city alive, and the man is a foreigner. He has been there for a long time, and has no idea why he is still alive. He tries to convince the man that he can help him, but Karsh refuses. The man tells him the city had a great amount of resources, and is not afraid to tell him about them. He offers to show him around, but Michaelson refuses.    The story then goes into flashback, where the narrator is a priest, and his people are called the \"People of Alpha Centaurus II\". They are a race of people from Earth, and their people are known to be curious about the planet and its environment. They are not native to the planet, and have been there a long while. They have a culture of curiosity, and believe that the planet is the home of the great fountain of all things, and it is the source of all good things.  A native named Kaller stands in the doorway, and asks Michaelson to leave because he is worried that the man who is visiting the city will kill him. The priest says that it is a shame that the native is not a native, but that he cannot leave because the man has been warned about the dangers of the area.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}

Then he\nsaw the glint of sun against the metallic skirt, and relaxed.\nHe chuckled to himself, wondering with amusement what a webfooted man\nwas doing in an old dead city so far from his people. Some facts were\nknown about the people of Alpha Centaurus II. They were not actually\nnatives, he recalled. They were a colony from the fifth planet of\nthe system. They were a curious people. Some were highly intelligent,\nthough uneducated.\nHe decided to ignore the man for the moment. He was far down the\nancient street, a mere speck against the sand. There would be plenty of\ntime to wonder about him.\nHe gazed out from his position at the complex variety of buildings\nbefore him. Some were small, obviously homes. Others were huge\nwith tall, frail spires standing against the pale blue sky. Square\nbuildings, ellipsoid, spheroid. Beautiful, dream-stuff bridges\nconnected tall, conical towers, bridges that still swung in the wind\nafter half a million years. Late afternoon sunlight shone against ebony\nsurfaces. The sands of many centuries had blown down the wide streets\nand filled the doorways. Desert plants grew from roofs of smaller\nbuildings.\nIgnoring the native, Mr. Michaelson poked about among the ruins\nhappily, exclaiming to himself about some particular artifact,\nmarveling at its state of preservation, holding it this way and that to\ncatch the late afternoon sun, smiling, clucking gleefully. He crawled\nover the rubble through old doorways half filled with the accumulation\nof ages. He dug experimentally in the sand with his hands, like a dog,\nunder a roof that had weathered half a million years of rain and sun.\nThen he crawled out again, covered with dust and cobwebs.\nThe native stood in the street less than a hundred feet away, waving\nhis arms madly. \"Mr. Earthgod,\" he cried. \"It is sacred ground where\nyou are trespassing!\"\nThe archeologist smiled, watching the man hurry closer. He was short,\neven for a native. Long gray hair hung to his shoulders, bobbing up\nand down as he walked. He wore no shoes. The toes of his webbed feet\ndragged in the sand, making a deep trail behind him. He was an old man.\n\"You never told us about this old dead city,\" Michaelson said,\nchidingly. \"Shame on you. But never mind. I've found it now. Isn't it\nbeautiful?\"\n\"Yes, beautiful. You will leave now.\"\n\"Leave?\" Michaelson asked, acting surprised as if the man were a\nchild. \"I just got here a few hours ago.\"\n\"You must go.\"\n\"Why? Who are you?\"\n\"I am keeper of the city.\"\n\"You?\" Michaelson laughed. Then, seeing how serious the native was,\nsaid, \"What makes you think a dead city needs a keeper?\"\n\"The spirits may return.\"\nMichaelson crawled out of the doorway and stood up. He brushed his\ntrousers. He pointed. \"See that wall? Built of some metal, I'd say,\nsome alloy impervious to rust and wear.\"\n\"The spirits are angry.\"\n\"Notice the inscriptions? Wind has blown sand against them for eons,\nand rain and sleet. But their story is there, once we decipher it.\"\n\"Leave!\"\nThe native's lined, weathered old face was working around the mouth in\nanger. Michaelson was almost sorry he had mocked him. He was deadly\nserious.\n\"Look,\" he said. \"No spirits are ever coming back here. Don't you know\nthat? And even if they did, spirits care nothing for old cities half\ncovered with sand and dirt.\"\nHe walked away from the old man, heading for another building. The\nsun had already gone below the horizon, coloring the high clouds. He\nglanced backward. The webfoot was following.\n\"Mr. Earthgod!\" the webfoot cried, so sharply that Michaelson stopped.\n\"You must not touch, not walk upon, not handle. Your step may destroy\nthe home of some ancient spirit. Your breath may cause one iota of\nchange and a spirit may lose his way in the darkness. Go quickly now,\nor be killed.\"\nHe turned and walked off, not looking back.\nMichaelson stood in the ancient street, tall, gaunt, feet planted wide,\nhands in pockets, watching the webfoot until he was out of sight beyond\na huge circular building. There was a man to watch. There was one of\nthe intelligent ones. One look into the alert old eyes had told him\nthat.\nMichaelson shook his head, and went about satisfying his curiosity.\nHe entered buildings without thought of roofs falling in, or decayed\nfloors dropping from under his weight. He began to collect small items,\nmaking a pile of them in the street. An ancient bowl, metal untouched\nby the ages. A statue of a man, one foot high, correct to the minutest\ndetail, showing how identical they had been to Earthmen. He found books\nstill standing on ancient shelves but was afraid to touch them without\ntools.\nDarkness came swiftly and he was forced out into the street.\nHe stood there alone feeling the age of the place. Even the smell\nof age was in the air. Silver moonlight from the two moons filtered\nthrough clear air down upon the ruins. The city lay now in darkness,\ndead and still, waiting for morning so it could lie dead and still in\nthe sun.\nThere was no hurry to be going home, although he was alone, although\nthis was Alpha Centaurus II with many unknowns, many dangers ...\nalthough home was a very great distance away. There was no one back\nthere to worry about him.\nHis wife had died many years ago back on Earth. No children. His\nfriends in the settlement would not look for him for another day at\nleast. Anyway, the tiny cylinder, buried in flesh behind his ear, a\nthing of mystery and immense power, could take him home instantly,\nwithout effort save a flicker of thought.\n\"You did not leave, as I asked you.\"\nMichaelson whirled around at the sound of the native's voice. Then he\nrelaxed. He said, \"You shouldn't sneak up on a man like that.\"\n\"You must leave, or I will be forced to kill you. I do not want to kill\nyou, but if I must....\" He made a clucking sound deep in the throat.\n\"The spirits are angry.\"\n\"Nonsense. Superstition! But never mind. You have been here longer\nthan I. Tell me, what are those instruments in the rooms? It looks like\na clock but I'm certain it had some other function.\"\n\"What rooms?\"\n\"Oh, come now. The small rooms back there. Look like they were\nbedrooms.\"\n\"I do not know.\" The webfoot drew closer. Michaelson decided he was\nsixty or seventy years old, at least.\n\"You've been here a long time. You are intelligent, and you must be\neducated, the way you talk. That gadget looks like a time-piece of some\nsort. What is it? What does it measure?\"\n\"I insist that you go.\" The webfoot held something in his hand.\n\"No.\" Michaelson looked off down the street, trying to ignore the\nnative, trying to feel the life of the city as it might have been.\n\"You are sensitive,\" the native said in his ear. \"It takes a sensitive\ngod to feel the spirits moving in the houses and walking in these old\nstreets.\"\n\"Say it any way you want to. This is the most fascinating thing\nI've ever seen. The Inca's treasure, the ruins of Pompeii, Egyptian\ntombs\u2014none can hold a candle to this.\"\n\"Mr. Earthgod....\"\n\"Don't call me that. I'm not a god, and you know it.\"\nThe old man shrugged. \"It is not an item worthy of dispute. Those names\nyou mention, are they the names of gods?\"\nHe chuckled. \"In a way, yes. What is your name?\"\n\"Maota.\"\n\"You must help me, Maota. These things must be preserved. We'll build\na museum, right here in the street. No, over there on the hill just\noutside the city. We'll collect all the old writings and perhaps we may\ndecipher them. Think of it, Maota! To read pages written so long ago\nand think their thoughts. We'll put everything under glass. Build and\nevacuate chambers to stop the decay. Catalogue, itemize....\"\nMichaelson was warming up to his subject, but Maota shook his head like\na waving palm frond and stamped his feet.\n\"You will leave now.\"\n\"Can't you see? Look at the decay. These things are priceless. They\nmust be preserved. Future generations will thank us.\"\n\"Do you mean,\" the old man asked, aghast, \"that you want others to come\nhere? You know the city abhors the sound of alien voices. Those who\nlived here may return one day! They must not find their city packaged\nand preserved and laid out on shelves for the curious to breathe their\nfoul breaths upon. You will leave. Now!\"\n\"No.\" Michaelson was adamant. The rock of Gibraltar.\nMaota hit him, quickly, passionately, and dropped the weapon beside his\nbody. He turned swiftly, making a swirling mark in the sand with his\nheel, and walked off toward the hills outside the city.\nThe weapon he had used was an ancient book. Its paper-thin pages\nrustled in the wind as if an unseen hand turned them, reading, while\nMichaelson's blood trickled out from the head wound upon the ancient\nstreet.\nWhen he regained consciousness the two moons, bright sentinel orbs in\nthe night sky, had moved to a new position down their sliding path. Old\nMaota's absence took some of the weirdness and fantasy away. It seemed\na more practical place now.\nThe gash in his head was painful, throbbing with quick, short\nhammer-blows synchronized with his heart beats. But there was a new\ndetermination in him. If it was a fight that the old webfooted fool\nwanted, a fight he would get. The cylinder flicked him, at his command,\nacross five hundred miles of desert and rocks to a small creek he\nremembered. Here he bathed his head in cool water until all the caked\nblood was dissolved from his hair. Feeling better, he went back.\nThe wind had turned cool. Michaelson shivered, wishing he had brought\na coat. The city was absolutely still except for small gusts of wind\nsighing through the frail spires. The ancient book still lay in the\nsand beside the dark spot of blood. He stooped over and picked it up.\nIt was light, much lighter than most Earth books. He ran a hand over\nthe binding. Smooth it was, untouched by time or climate. He squinted\nat the pages, tilting the book to catch the bright moonlight, but the\nwriting was alien. He touched the page, ran his forefinger over the\nwriting.\nSuddenly he sprang back. The book fell from his hands.\n\"God in heaven!\" he exclaimed.\nHe had heard a voice. He looked around at the old buildings, down the\nlength of the ancient street. Something strange about the voice. Not\nMaota. Not his tones. Not his words. Satisfied that no one was near, he\nstooped and picked up the book again.\n\"Good God!\" he said aloud. It was the book talking. His fingers had\ntouched the writing again. It was not a voice, exactly, but a stirring\nin his mind, like a strange language heard for the first time.\nA talking book. What other surprises were in the city? Tall,\nfragile buildings laughing at time and weather. A clock measuring\nGod-knows-what. If such wonders remained, what about those already\ndestroyed? One could only guess at the machines, the gadgets, the\nartistry already decayed and blown away to mix forever with the sand.\nI must preserve it, he thought, whether Maota likes it or not. They\nsay these people lived half a million years ago. A long time. Let's\nsee, now. A man lives one hundred years on the average. Five thousand\nlifetimes.\nAnd all you do is touch a book, and a voice jumps across all those\nyears!\nHe started off toward the tall building he had examined upon discovery\nof the city. His left eyelid began to twitch and he laid his forefinger\nagainst the eye, pressing until it stopped. Then he stooped and entered\nthe building. He laid the book down and tried to take the \"clock\"\noff the wall. It was dark in the building and his fingers felt along\nthe wall, looking for it. Then he touched it. His fingers moved over\nits smooth surface. Then suddenly he jerked his hand back with an\nexclamation of amazement. Fear ran up his spine.\nThe clock was warm.\nHe felt like running, like flicking back to the settlement where there\nwere people and familiar voices, for here was a thing that should not\nbe. Half a million years\u2014and here was warmth!\nHe touched it again, curiosity overwhelming his fear. It was warm. No\nmistake. And there was a faint vibration, a suggestion of power. He\nstood there in the darkness staring off into the darkness, trembling.\nFear built up in him until it was a monstrous thing, drowning reason.\nHe forgot the power of the cylinder behind his ear. He scrambled\nthrough the doorway. He got up and ran down the ancient sandy street\nuntil he came to the edge of the city. Here he stopped, gasping for\nair, feeling the pain throb in his head.\nCommon sense said that he should go home, that nothing worthwhile could\nbe accomplished at night, that he was tired, that he was weak from loss\nof blood and fright and running. But when Michaelson was on the trail\nof important discoveries he had no common sense.\nHe sat down in the darkness, meaning to rest a moment.\nWhen he awoke dawn was red against thin clouds in the east.\nOld Maota stood in the street with webbed feet planted far apart in\nthe sand, a weapon in the crook of his arm. It was a long tube affair,\nfamiliar to Michaelson.\nMichaelson asked, \"Did you sleep well?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"I'm sorry to hear that.\"\n\"How do you feel?\"\n\"Fine, but my head aches a little.\"\n\"Sorry,\" Maota said.\n\"For what?\"\n\"For hitting you. Pain is not for gods like you.\"\nMichaelson relaxed somewhat. \"What kind of man are you? First you try\nto break my skull, then you apologize.\"\n\"I abhor pain. I should have killed you outright.\"\nHe thought about that for a moment, eyeing the weapon.\nIt looked in good working order. Slim and shiny and innocent, it looked\nlike a glorified African blowgun. But he was not deceived by its\nappearance. It was a deadly weapon.\n\"Well,\" he said, \"before you kill me, tell me about the book.\" He held\nit up for Maota to see.\n\"What about the book?\"\n\"What kind of book is it?\"\n\"What does Mr. Earthgod mean, what\nkind\nof book? You have seen it. It\nis like any other book, except for the material and the fact that it\ntalks.\"\n\"No, no. I mean, what's in it?\"\n\"Poetry.\"\n\"Poetry? For God's sake, why poetry? Why not mathematics or history?\nWhy not tell how to make the metal of the book itself? Now there is a\nsubject worthy of a book.\"\nMaota shook his head. \"One does not study a dead culture to learn how\nthey made things, but how they thought. But we are wasting time. I must\nkill you now, so I can get some rest.\"\nThe old man raised the gun.\n\"Wait! You forget that I also have a weapon.\" He pointed to the spot\nbehind his ear where the cylinder was buried. \"I can move faster than\nyou can fire the gun.\"\nMaota nodded. \"I have heard how you travel. It does not matter. I will\nkill you anyway.\"\n\"I suggest we negotiate.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Why not?\"\nMaota looked off toward the hills, old eyes filmed from years of sand\nand wind, leather skin lined and pitted. The hills stood immobile,\nbrown-gray, already shimmering with heat, impotent.\n\"Why not?\" Michaelson repeated.\n\"Why not what?\" Maota dragged his eyes back.\n\"Negotiate.\"\n\"No.\" Maota's eyes grew hard as steel. They stood there in the sun, not\ntwenty feet apart, hating each other. The two moons, very pale and far\naway on the western horizon, stared like two bottomless eyes.\n\"All right, then. At least it's a quick death. I hear that thing just\ndisintegrates a man. Pfft! And that's that.\"\nMichaelson prepared himself to move if the old man's finger slid closer\ntoward the firing stud. The old man raised the gun.\n\"Wait!\"\n\"Now what?\"\n\"At least read some of the book to me before I die, then.\"\nThe gun wavered. \"I am not an unreasonable man,\" the webfoot said.\nMichaelson stepped forward, extending his arm with the book.\n\"No, stay where you are. Throw it.\"\n\"This book is priceless. You just don't go throwing such valuable items\naround.\"\n\"It won't break. Throw it.\"\nMichaelson threw the book. It landed at Maota's feet, spouting sand\nagainst his leg. He shifted the weapon, picked up the book and leafed\nthrough it, raising his head in a listening attitude, searching for\na suitable passage. Michaelson heard the thin, metallic pages rustle\nsoftly. He could have jumped and seized the weapon at that moment, but\nhis desire to hear the book was strong.\nOld Maota read, Michaelson listened. The cadence was different, the\nsyntax confusing. But the thoughts were there. It might have been\na professor back on Earth reading to his students. Keats, Shelley,\nBrowning. These people were human, with human thoughts and aspirations.\nThe old man stopped reading. He squatted slowly, keeping Michaelson in\nsight, and laid the book face up in the sand. Wind moved the pages.\n\"See?\" he said. \"The spirits read. They must have been great readers,\nthese people. They drink the book, as if it were an elixir. See how\ngentle! They lap at the pages like a new kitten tasting milk.\"\nMichaelson laughed. \"You certainly have an imagination.\"\n\"What difference does it make?\" Maota cried, suddenly angry. \"You want\nto close up all these things in boxes for a posterity who may have no\nslightest feeling or appreciation. I want to leave the city as it is,\nfor spirits whose existence I cannot prove.\"\nThe old man's eyes were furious now, deadly. The gun came down directly\nin line with the Earthman's chest. The gnarled finger moved.\nMichaelson, using the power of the cylinder behind his ear, jumped\nbehind the old webfoot. To Maota it seemed that he had flicked out of\nexistence like a match blown out. The next instant Michaelson spun\nhim around and hit him. It was an inexpert fist, belonging to an\narcheologist, not a fighter. But Maota was an old man.\nHe dropped in the sand, momentarily stunned. Michaelson bent over to\npick up the gun and the old man, feeling it slip from his fingers,\nhung on and was pulled to his feet.\nThey struggled for possession of the gun, silently, gasping, kicking\nsand. Faces grew red. Lips drew back over Michaelson's white teeth,\nover Maota's pink, toothless gums. The dead city's fragile spires threw\nimpersonal shadows down where they fought.\nThen quite suddenly a finger or hand\u2014neither knew whose finger or\nhand\u2014touched the firing stud.\nThere was a hollow, whooshing sound. Both stopped still, realizing the\ntotal destruction they might have caused.\n\"It only hit the ground,\" Michaelson said.\nA black, charred hole, two feet in diameter and\u2014they could not see how\ndeep\u2014stared at them.\nMaota let go and sprawled in the sand. \"The book!\" he cried. \"The book\nis gone!\"\n\"No! We probably covered it with sand while we fought.\"\nBoth men began scooping sand in their cupped hands, digging frantically\nfor the book. Saliva dripped from Maota's mouth, but he didn't know or\ncare.\nFinally they stopped, exhausted. They had covered a substantial area\naround the hole. They had covered the complete area where they had been.\n\"We killed it,\" the old man moaned.\n\"It was just a book. Not alive, you know.\"\n\"How do you know?\" The old man's pale eyes were filled with tears. \"It\ntalked and it sang. In a way, it had a soul. Sometimes on long nights I\nused to imagine it loved me, for taking care of it.\"\n\"There are other books. We'll get another.\"\nMaota shook his head. \"There are no more.\"\n\"But I've seen them. Down there in the square building.\"\n\"Not poetry. Books, yes, but not poetry. That was the only book with\nsongs.\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\"\nYou\nkilled it!\" Maota suddenly sprang for the weapon, lying\nforgotten in the sand. Michaelson put his foot on it and Maota was too\nweak to tear it loose. He could only weep out his rage.\nWhen he could talk again, Maota said, \"I am sorry, Mr. Earthgod. I've\ndisgraced myself.\"\n\"Don't be sorry.\" Michaelson helped him to his feet. \"We fight for some\nreasons, cry for others. A priceless book is a good reason for either.\"\n\"Not for that. For not winning. I should have killed you last night\nwhen I had the chance. The gods give us chances and if we don't take\nthem we lose forever.\"\n\"I told you before! We are on the same side. Negotiate. Have you never\nheard of negotiation?\"\n\"You are a god,\" Maota said. \"One does not negotiate with gods. One\neither loves them, or kills them.\"\n\"That's another thing. I am not a god. Can't you understand?\"\n\"Of course you are.\" Maota looked up, very sure. \"Mortals cannot step\nfrom star to star like crossing a shallow brook.\"\n\"No, no. I don't step from one star to another. An invention does that.\nJust an invention. I carry it with me. It's a tiny thing. No one would\never guess it has such power. So you see, I'm human, just like you. Hit\nme and I hurt. Cut me and I bleed. I love. I hate. I was born. Some day\nI'll die. See? I'm human. Just a human with a machine. No more than\nthat.\"\nMaota laughed, then sobered quickly. \"You lie.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"If I had this machine, could I travel as you?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Then I'll kill you and take yours.\"\n\"It would not work for you.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Each machine is tailored for each person.\"\nThe old man hung his head. He looked down into the black, charred\nhole. He walked all around the hole. He kicked at the sand, looking\nhalf-heartedly again for the book.\n\"Look,\" Michaelson said. \"I'm sure I've convinced you that I'm human.\nWhy not have a try at negotiating our differences?\"\nHe looked up. His expressive eyes, deep, resigned, studied Michaelson's\nface. Finally he shook his head sadly. \"When we first met I hoped we\ncould think the ancient thoughts together. But our paths diverge. We\nhave finished, you and I.\"\nHe turned and started off, shoulders slumped dejectedly.\nMichaelson caught up to him. \"Are you leaving the city?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\"Away. Far away.\" Maota looked off toward the hills, eyes distant.\n\"Don't be stupid, old man. How can you go far away and not leave the\ncity?\"\n\"There are many directions. You would not understand.\"\n\"East. West. North. South. Up. Down.\"\n\"No, no. There is another direction. Come, if you must see.\"\nMichaelson followed him far down the street. They came to a section of\nthe city he had not seen before. Buildings were smaller, spires dwarfed\nagainst larger structures. Here a path was packed in the sand, leading\nto a particular building.\nMichaelson said, \"This is where you live?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nMaota went inside. Michaelson stood in the entrance and looked around.\nThe room was clean, furnished with hand made chairs and a bed. Who is\nthis old man, he thought, far from his people, living alone, choosing\na life of solitude among ancient ruins but not touching them? Above\nthe bed a \"clock\" was fastened to the wall, Michaelson remembered his\nfright\u2014thinking of the warmth where warmth should not be.\nMaota pointed to it.\n\"You asked about this machine,\" he said. \"Now I will tell you.\" He laid\nhis hand against it. \"Here is power to follow another direction.\"\nMichaelson tested one of the chairs to see if it would hold his weight,\nthen sat down. His curiosity about the instrument was colossal, but he\nforced a short laugh. \"Maota, you\nare\ncomplex. Why not stop all this\nmystery nonsense and tell me about it? You know more about it than I.\"\n\"Of course.\" Maota smiled a toothless, superior smile. \"What do you\nsuppose happened to this race?\"\n\"You tell me.\"\n\"They took the unknown direction. The books speak of it. I don't know\nhow the instrument works, but one thing is certain. The race did not\ndie out, as a species becomes extinct.\"\nMichaelson was amused, but interested. \"Something like a fourth\ndimension?\"\n\"I don't know. I only know that with this instrument there is no death.\nI have read the books that speak of this race, this wonderful people\nwho conquered all disease, who explored all the mysteries of science,\nwho devised this machine to cheat death. See this button here on the\nface of the instrument? Press the button, and....\"\n\"And what?\"\n\"I don't know, exactly. But I have lived many years. I have walked the\nstreets of this city and wondered, and wanted to press the button. Now\nI will do so.\"\nQuickly the old man, still smiling, pressed the button. A high-pitched\nwhine filled the air, just within audio range. Steady for a moment, it\nthen rose in pitch passing beyond hearing quickly.\nThe old man's knees buckled. He sank down, fell over the bed, lay\nstill. Michaelson touched him cautiously, then examined him more\ncarefully. No question about it.\nThe old man was dead.\nFeeling depressed and alone, Michaelson found a desert knoll outside\nthe city overlooking the tall spires that shone in the sunlight and\ngleamed in the moonlight. He made a stretcher, rolled the old man's\nbody on to it and dragged it down the long ancient street and up the\nknoll.\nHere he buried him.\nBut it seemed a waste of time. Somehow he knew beyond any doubt that\nthe old native and his body were completely disassociated in some sense\nmore complete than death.\nIn the days that followed he gave much thought to the \"clock.\" He came\nto the city every day. He spent long hours in the huge square building\nwith the books. He learned the language by sheer bulldog determination.\nThen he searched the books for information about the instrument.\nFinally after many weeks, long after the winds had obliterated all\nevidence of Maota's grave on the knoll, Michaelson made a decision. He\nhad to know if the machine would work for him.\nAnd so one afternoon when the ancient spires threw long shadows\nover the sand he walked down the long street and entered the old\nman's house. He stood before the instrument, trembling, afraid, but\ndetermined. He pinched his eyes shut tight like a child and pressed the\nbutton.\nThe high-pitched whine started.\nComplete, utter silence. Void. Darkness. Awareness and memory, yes;\nnothing else. Then Maota's chuckle came. No sound, an impression only\nlike the voice from the ancient book. Where was he? There was no left\nor right, up or down. Maota was everywhere, nowhere.\n\"Look!\" Maota's thought was directed at him in this place of no\ndirection. \"Think of the city and you will see it.\"\nMichaelson did, and he saw the city beyond, as if he were looking\nthrough a window. And yet he was in the city looking at his own body.\nMaota's chuckle again. \"The city will remain as it is. You did not win\nafter all.\"\n\"Neither did you.\"\n\"But this existence has compensations,\" Maota said. \"You can be\nanywhere, see anywhere on this planet. Even on your Earth.\"\nMichaelson felt a great sadness, seeing his body lying across the\nold, home made bed. He looked closer. He sensed a vibration or life\nforce\u2014he didn't stop to define it\u2014in his body. Why was his dead body\ndifferent from Old Maota's? Could it be that there was some thread\nstretching from the reality of his body to his present state?\n\"I don't like your thoughts,\" Maota said. \"No one can go back. I tried.\nI have discussed it with many who are not presently in communication\nwith you. No one can go back.\"\nMichaelson decided he try.\n\"No!\" Maota's thought was prickled with fear and anger.\nMichaelson did not know how to try, but he remembered the cylinder and\ngathered all the force of his mind in spite of Maota's protests, and\ngave his most violent command.\nAt first he thought it didn't work. He got up and looked around, then\nit struck him.\nHe was standing up!\nThe cylinder. He knew it was the cylinder. That was the difference\nbetween himself and Maota. When he used the cylinder, that was where\nhe went, the place where Maota was now. It was a door of some kind,\nleading to a path of some kind where distance was non-existent. But the\n\"clock\" was a mechanism to transport only the mind to that place.\nTo be certain of it, he pressed the button again, with the same result\nas before. He saw his own body fall down. He felt Maota's presence.\n\"You devil!\" Maota's thought-scream was a sword of hate and anger,\nirrational suddenly, like a person who knows his loss is irrevocable.\n\"I said you were a god. I said you were a god.\nI said you were a\ngod...!\n\"\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nA CITY NEAR CENTAURUS\nBy BILL DOEDE\nIllustrated by WEST\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nGalaxy Magazine October 1962.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nThe city was sacred, but not to its gods.\nMichaelson was a god\u2014but far from sacred!\nCrouched in the ancient doorway like an animal peering out from his\nburrow, Mr. Michaelson saw the native.\nAt first he was startled, thinking it might be someone else from the\nEarth settlement who had discovered the old city before him. Then he\nsaw the glint of sun against the metallic skirt, and relaxed.\nHe chuckled to himself, wondering with amusement what a webfooted man\nwas doing in an old dead city so far from his people. Some facts were\nknown about the people of Alpha Centaurus II. They were not actually\nnatives, he recalled. They were a colony from the fifth planet of\nthe system. They were a curious people. Some were highly intelligent,\nthough uneducated.\nHe decided to ignore the man for the moment. He was far down the\nancient street, a mere speck against the sand. There would be plenty of\ntime to wonder about him.\nHe gazed out from his position at the complex variety of buildings\nbefore him. Some were small, obviously homes. Others were huge\nwith tall, frail spires standing against the pale blue sky. Square\nbuildings, ellipsoid, spheroid. Beautiful, dream-stuff bridges\nconnected tall, conical towers, bridges that still swung in the wind\nafter half a million years. Late afternoon sunlight shone against ebony\nsurfaces. The sands of many centuries had blown down the wide streets\nand filled the doorways. Desert plants grew from roofs of smaller\nbuildings.\nIgnoring the native, Mr. Michaelson poked about among the ruins\nhappily, exclaiming to himself about some particular artifact,\nmarveling at its state of preservation, holding it this way and that to\ncatch the late afternoon sun, smiling, clucking gleefully. He crawled\nover the rubble through old doorways half filled with the accumulation\nof ages. He dug experimentally in the sand with his hands, like a dog,\nunder a roof that had weathered half a million years of rain and sun.\nThen he crawled out again, covered with dust and cobwebs.\nThe native stood in the street less than a hundred feet away, waving\nhis arms madly. \"Mr. Earthgod,\" he cried. \"It is sacred ground where\nyou are trespassing!\"\nThe archeologist smiled, watching the man hurry closer. He was short,\neven for a native. Long gray hair hung to his shoulders, bobbing up\nand down as he walked. He wore no shoes. The toes of his webbed feet\ndragged in the sand, making a deep trail behind him. He was an old man.\n\"You never told us about this old dead city,\" Michaelson said,\nchidingly. \"Shame on you. But never mind. I've found it now. Isn't it\nbeautiful?\"\n\"Yes, beautiful. You will leave now.\"\n\"Leave?\" Michaelson asked, acting surprised as if the man were a\nchild. \"I just got here a few hours ago.\"\n\"You must go.\"\n\"Why? Who are you?\"\n\"I am keeper of the city.\"\n\"You?\" Michaelson laughed. Then, seeing how serious the native was,\nsaid, \"What makes you think a dead city needs a keeper?\"\n\"The spirits may return.\"\nMichaelson crawled out of the doorway and stood up. He brushed his\ntrousers. He pointed. \"See that wall? Built of some metal, I'd say,\nsome alloy impervious to rust and wear.\"\n\"The spirits are angry.\"\n\"Notice the inscriptions? Wind has blown sand against them for eons,\nand rain and sleet. But their story is there, once we decipher it.\"\n\"Leave!\"\nThe native's lined, weathered old face was working around the mouth in\nanger. Michaelson was almost sorry he had mocked him. He was deadly\nserious.\n\"Look,\" he said. \"No spirits are ever coming back here. Don't you know\nthat? And even if they did, spirits care nothing for old cities half\ncovered with sand and dirt.\"\nHe walked away from the old man, heading for another building. The\nsun had already gone below the horizon, coloring the high clouds. He\nglanced backward. The webfoot was following.\n\"Mr. Earthgod!\" the webfoot cried, so sharply that Michaelson stopped.\n\"You must not touch, not walk upon, not handle. Your step may destroy\nthe home of some ancient spirit. Your breath may cause one iota of\nchange and a spirit may lose his way in the darkness. Go quickly now,\nor be killed.\"\nHe turned and walked off, not looking back.\nMichaelson stood in the ancient street, tall, gaunt, feet planted wide,\nhands in pockets, watching the webfoot until he was out of sight beyond\na huge circular building. There was a man to watch. There was one of\nthe intelligent ones. One look into the alert old eyes had told him\nthat.\nMichaelson shook his head, and went about satisfying his curiosity.\nHe entered buildings without thought of roofs falling in, or decayed\nfloors dropping from under his weight. He began to collect small items,\nmaking a pile of them in the street. An ancient bowl, metal untouched\nby the ages. A statue of a man, one foot high, correct to the minutest\ndetail, showing how identical they had been to Earthmen. He found books\nstill standing on ancient shelves but was afraid to touch them without\ntools.\nDarkness came swiftly and he was forced out into the street.\nHe stood there alone feeling the age of the place. Even the smell\nof age was in the air. Silver moonlight from the two moons filtered\nthrough clear air down upon the ruins. The city lay now in darkness,\ndead and still, waiting for morning so it could lie dead and still in\nthe sun.\nThere was no hurry to be going home, although he was alone, although\nthis was Alpha Centaurus II with many unknowns, many dangers ...\nalthough home was a very great distance away. There was no one back\nthere to worry about him.\nHis wife had died many years ago back on Earth. No children. His\nfriends in the settlement would not look for him for another day at\nleast. Anyway, the tiny cylinder, buried in flesh behind his ear, a\nthing of mystery and immense power, could take him home instantly,\nwithout effort save a flicker of thought.\n\"You did not leave, as I asked you.\"\nMichaelson whirled around at the sound of the native's voice. Then he\nrelaxed. He said, \"You shouldn't sneak up on a man like that.\"\n\"You must leave, or I will be forced to kill you. I do not want to kill\nyou, but if I must....\" He made a clucking sound deep in the throat.\n\"The spirits are angry.\"\n\"Nonsense. Superstition! But never mind. You have been here longer\nthan I. Tell me, what are those instruments in the rooms? It looks like\na clock but I'm certain it had some other function.\"\n\"What rooms?\"\n\"Oh, come now. The small rooms back there. Look like they were\nbedrooms.\"\n\"I do not know.\" The webfoot drew closer. Michaelson decided he was\nsixty or seventy years old, at least.\n\"You've been here a long time. You are intelligent, and you must be\neducated, the way you talk. That gadget looks like a time-piece of some\nsort. What is it? What does it measure?\"\n\"I insist that you go.\" The webfoot held something in his hand.\n\"No.\" Michaelson looked off down the street, trying to ignore the\nnative, trying to feel the life of the city as it might have been.\n\"You are sensitive,\" the native said in his ear. \"It takes a sensitive\ngod to feel the spirits moving in the houses and walking in these old\nstreets.\"\n\"Say it any way you want to. This is the most fascinating thing\nI've ever seen. The Inca's treasure, the ruins of Pompeii, Egyptian\ntombs\u2014none can hold a candle to this.\"\n\"Mr. Earthgod....\"\n\"Don't call me that. I'm not a god, and you know it.\"\nThe old man shrugged. \"It is not an item worthy of dispute. Those names\nyou mention, are they the names of gods?\"\nHe chuckled. \"In a way, yes. What is your name?\"\n\"Maota.\"\n\"You must help me, Maota. These things must be preserved. We'll build\na museum, right here in the street. No, over there on the hill just\noutside the city. We'll collect all the old writings and perhaps we may\ndecipher them. Think of it, Maota! To read pages written so long ago\nand think their thoughts. We'll put everything under glass. Build and\nevacuate chambers to stop the decay. Catalogue, itemize....\"\nMichaelson was warming up to his subject, but Maota shook his head like\na waving palm frond and stamped his feet.\n\"You will leave now.\"\n\"Can't you see? Look at the decay. These things are priceless. They\nmust be preserved. Future generations will thank us.\"\n\"Do you mean,\" the old man asked, aghast, \"that you want others to come\nhere? You know the city abhors the sound of alien voices. Those who\nlived here may return one day! They must not find their city packaged\nand preserved and laid out on shelves for the curious to breathe their\nfoul breaths upon. You will leave. Now!\"\n\"No.\" Michaelson was adamant. The rock of Gibraltar.\nMaota hit him, quickly, passionately, and dropped the weapon beside his\nbody. He turned swiftly, making a swirling mark in the sand with his\nheel, and walked off toward the hills outside the city.\nThe weapon he had used was an ancient book. Its paper-thin pages\nrustled in the wind as if an unseen hand turned them, reading, while\nMichaelson's blood trickled out from the head wound upon the ancient\nstreet.\nWhen he regained consciousness the two moons, bright sentinel orbs in\nthe night sky, had moved to a new position down their sliding path. Old\nMaota's absence took some of the weirdness and fantasy away. It seemed\na more practical place now.\nThe gash in his head was painful, throbbing with quick, short\nhammer-blows synchronized with his heart beats. But there was a new\ndetermination in him. If it was a fight that the old webfooted fool\nwanted, a fight he would get. The cylinder flicked him, at his command,\nacross five hundred miles of desert and rocks to a small creek he\nremembered. Here he bathed his head in cool water until all the caked\nblood was dissolved from his hair. Feeling better, he went back.\nThe wind had turned cool. Michaelson shivered, wishing he had brought\na coat. The city was absolutely still except for small gusts of wind\nsighing through the frail spires. The ancient book still lay in the\nsand beside the dark spot of blood. He stooped over and picked it up.\nIt was light, much lighter than most Earth books. He ran a hand over\nthe binding. Smooth it was, untouched by time or climate. He squinted\nat the pages, tilting the book to catch the bright moonlight, but the\nwriting was alien. He touched the page, ran his forefinger over the\nwriting.\nSuddenly he sprang back. The book fell from his hands.\n\"God in heaven!\" he exclaimed.\nHe had heard a voice. He looked around at the old buildings, down the\nlength of the ancient street. Something strange about the voice. Not\nMaota. Not his tones. Not his words. Satisfied that no one was near, he\nstooped and picked up the book again.\n\"Good God!\" he said aloud. It was the book talking. His fingers had\ntouched the writing again. It was not a voice, exactly, but a stirring\nin his mind, like a strange language heard for the first time.\nA talking book. What other surprises were in the city? Tall,\nfragile buildings laughing at time and weather. A clock measuring\nGod-knows-what. If such wonders remained, what about those already\ndestroyed? One could only guess at the machines, the gadgets, the\nartistry already decayed and blown away to mix forever with the sand.\nI must preserve it, he thought, whether Maota likes it or not. They\nsay these people lived half a million years ago. A long time. Let's\nsee, now. A man lives one hundred years on the average. Five thousand\nlifetimes.\nAnd all you do is touch a book, and a voice jumps across all those\nyears!\nHe started off toward the tall building he had examined upon discovery\nof the city. His left eyelid began to twitch and he laid his forefinger\nagainst the eye, pressing until it stopped. Then he stooped and entered\nthe building. He laid the book down and tried to take the \"clock\"\noff the wall. It was dark in the building and his fingers felt along\nthe wall, looking for it. Then he touched it. His fingers moved over\nits smooth surface. Then suddenly he jerked his hand back with an\nexclamation of amazement. Fear ran up his spine.\nThe clock was warm.\nHe felt like running, like flicking back to the settlement where there\nwere people and familiar voices, for here was a thing that should not\nbe. Half a million years\u2014and here was warmth!\nHe touched it again, curiosity overwhelming his fear. It was warm. No\nmistake. And there was a faint vibration, a suggestion of power. He\nstood there in the darkness staring off into the darkness, trembling.\nFear built up in him until it was a monstrous thing, drowning reason.\nHe forgot the power of the cylinder behind his ear. He scrambled\nthrough the doorway. He got up and ran down the ancient sandy street\nuntil he came to the edge of the city. Here he stopped, gasping for\nair, feeling the pain throb in his head.\nCommon sense said that he should go home, that nothing worthwhile could\nbe accomplished at night, that he was tired, that he was weak from loss\nof blood and fright and running. But when Michaelson was on the trail\nof important discoveries he had no common sense.\nHe sat down in the darkness, meaning to rest a moment.\nWhen he awoke dawn was red against thin clouds in the east.\nOld Maota stood in the street with webbed feet planted far apart in\nthe sand, a weapon in the crook of his arm. It was a long tube affair,\nfamiliar to Michaelson.\nMichaelson asked, \"Did you sleep well?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"I'm sorry to hear that.\"\n\"How do you feel?\"\n\"Fine, but my head aches a little.\"\n\"Sorry,\" Maota said.\n\"For what?\"\n\"For hitting you. Pain is not for gods like you.\"\nMichaelson relaxed somewhat. \"What kind of man are you? First you try\nto break my skull, then you apologize.\"\n\"I abhor pain. I should have killed you outright.\"\nHe thought about that for a moment, eyeing the weapon.\nIt looked in good working order. Slim and shiny and innocent, it looked\nlike a glorified African blowgun. But he was not deceived by its\nappearance. It was a deadly weapon.\n\"Well,\" he said, \"before you kill me, tell me about the book.\" He held\nit up for Maota to see.\n\"What about the book?\"\n\"What kind of book is it?\"\n\"What does Mr. Earthgod mean, what\nkind\nof book? You have seen it. It\nis like any other book, except for the material and the fact that it\ntalks.\"\n\"No, no. I mean, what's in it?\"\n\"Poetry.\"\n\"Poetry? For God's sake, why poetry? Why not mathematics or history?\nWhy not tell how to make the metal of the book itself? Now there is a\nsubject worthy of a book.\"\nMaota shook his head. \"One does not study a dead culture to learn how\nthey made things, but how they thought. But we are wasting time. I must\nkill you now, so I can get some rest.\"\nThe old man raised the gun.\n\"Wait! You forget that I also have a weapon.\" He pointed to the spot\nbehind his ear where the cylinder was buried. \"I can move faster than\nyou can fire the gun.\"\nMaota nodded. \"I have heard how you travel. It does not matter. I will\nkill you anyway.\"\n\"I suggest we negotiate.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Why not?\"\nMaota looked off toward the hills, old eyes filmed from years of sand\nand wind, leather skin lined and pitted. The hills stood immobile,\nbrown-gray, already shimmering with heat, impotent.\n\"Why not?\" Michaelson repeated.\n\"Why not what?\" Maota dragged his eyes back.\n\"Negotiate.\"\n\"No.\" Maota's eyes grew hard as steel. They stood there in the sun, not\ntwenty feet apart, hating each other. The two moons, very pale and far\naway on the western horizon, stared like two bottomless eyes.\n\"All right, then. At least it's a quick death. I hear that thing just\ndisintegrates a man. Pfft! And that's that.\"\nMichaelson prepared himself to move if the old man's finger slid closer\ntoward the firing stud. The old man raised the gun.\n\"Wait!\"\n\"Now what?\"\n\"At least read some of the book to me before I die, then.\"\nThe gun wavered. \"I am not an unreasonable man,\" the webfoot said.\nMichaelson stepped forward, extending his arm with the book.\n\"No, stay where you are. Throw it.\"\n\"This book is priceless. You just don't go throwing such valuable items\naround.\"\n\"It won't break. Throw it.\"\nMichaelson threw the book. It landed at Maota's feet, spouting sand\nagainst his leg. He shifted the weapon, picked up the book and leafed\nthrough it, raising his head in a listening attitude, searching for\na suitable passage. Michaelson heard the thin, metallic pages rustle\nsoftly. He could have jumped and seized the weapon at that moment, but\nhis desire to hear the book was strong.\nOld Maota read, Michaelson listened. The cadence was different, the\nsyntax confusing. But the thoughts were there. It might have been\na professor back on Earth reading to his students. Keats, Shelley,\nBrowning. These people were human, with human thoughts and aspirations.\nThe old man stopped reading. He squatted slowly, keeping Michaelson in\nsight, and laid the book face up in the sand. Wind moved the pages.\n\"See?\" he said. \"The spirits read. They must have been great readers,\nthese people. They drink the book, as if it were an elixir. See how\ngentle! They lap at the pages like a new kitten tasting milk.\"\nMichaelson laughed. \"You certainly have an imagination.\"\n\"What difference does it make?\" Maota cried, suddenly angry. \"You want\nto close up all these things in boxes for a posterity who may have no\nslightest feeling or appreciation. I want to leave the city as it is,\nfor spirits whose existence I cannot prove.\"\nThe old man's eyes were furious now, deadly. The gun came down directly\nin line with the Earthman's chest. The gnarled finger moved.\nMichaelson, using the power of the cylinder behind his ear, jumped\nbehind the old webfoot. To Maota it seemed that he had flicked out of\nexistence like a match blown out. The next instant Michaelson spun\nhim around and hit him. It was an inexpert fist, belonging to an\narcheologist, not a fighter. But Maota was an old man.\nHe dropped in the sand, momentarily stunned. Michaelson bent over to\npick up the gun and the old man, feeling it slip from his fingers,\nhung on and was pulled to his feet.\nThey struggled for possession of the gun, silently, gasping, kicking\nsand. Faces grew red. Lips drew back over Michaelson's white teeth,\nover Maota's pink, toothless gums. The dead city's fragile spires threw\nimpersonal shadows down where they fought.\nThen quite suddenly a finger or hand\u2014neither knew whose finger or\nhand\u2014touched the firing stud.\nThere was a hollow, whooshing sound. Both stopped still, realizing the\ntotal destruction they might have caused.\n\"It only hit the ground,\" Michaelson said.\nA black, charred hole, two feet in diameter and\u2014they could not see how\ndeep\u2014stared at them.\nMaota let go and sprawled in the sand. \"The book!\" he cried. \"The book\nis gone!\"\n\"No! We probably covered it with sand while we fought.\"\nBoth men began scooping sand in their cupped hands, digging frantically\nfor the book. Saliva dripped from Maota's mouth, but he didn't know or\ncare.\nFinally they stopped, exhausted. They had covered a substantial area\naround the hole. They had covered the complete area where they had been.\n\"We killed it,\" the old man moaned.\n\"It was just a book. Not alive, you know.\"\n\"How do you know?\" The old man's pale eyes were filled with tears. \"It\ntalked and it sang. In a way, it had a soul. Sometimes on long nights I\nused to imagine it loved me, for taking care of it.\"\n\"There are other books. We'll get another.\"\nMaota shook his head. \"There are no more.\"\n\"But I've seen them. Down there in the square building.\"\n\"Not poetry. Books, yes, but not poetry. That was the only book with\nsongs.\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\"\nYou\nkilled it!\" Maota suddenly sprang for the weapon, lying\nforgotten in the sand. Michaelson put his foot on it and Maota was too\nweak to tear it loose. He could only weep out his rage.\nWhen he could talk again, Maota said, \"I am sorry, Mr. Earthgod. I've\ndisgraced myself.\"\n\"Don't be sorry.\" Michaelson helped him to his feet. \"We fight for some\nreasons, cry for others. A priceless book is a good reason for either.\"\n\"Not for that. For not winning. I should have killed you last night\nwhen I had the chance. The gods give us chances and if we don't take\nthem we lose forever.\"\n\"I told you before! We are on the same side. Negotiate. Have you never\nheard of negotiation?\"\n\"You are a god,\" Maota said. \"One does not negotiate with gods. One\neither loves them, or kills them.\"\n\"That's another thing. I am not a god. Can't you understand?\"\n\"Of course you are.\" Maota looked up, very sure. \"Mortals cannot step\nfrom star to star like crossing a shallow brook.\"\n\"No, no. I don't step from one star to another. An invention does that.\nJust an invention. I carry it with me. It's a tiny thing. No one would\never guess it has such power. So you see, I'm human, just like you. Hit\nme and I hurt. Cut me and I bleed. I love. I hate. I was born. Some day\nI'll die. See? I'm human. Just a human with a machine. No more than\nthat.\"\nMaota laughed, then sobered quickly. \"You lie.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"If I had this machine, could I travel as you?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Then I'll kill you and take yours.\"\n\"It would not work for you.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Each machine is tailored for each person.\"\nThe old man hung his head. He looked down into the black, charred\nhole. He walked all around the hole. He kicked at the sand, looking\nhalf-heartedly again for the book.\n\"Look,\" Michaelson said. \"I'm sure I've convinced you that I'm human.\nWhy not have a try at negotiating our differences?\"\nHe looked up. His expressive eyes, deep, resigned, studied Michaelson's\nface. Finally he shook his head sadly. \"When we first met I hoped we\ncould think the ancient thoughts together. But our paths diverge. We\nhave finished, you and I.\"\nHe turned and started off, shoulders slumped dejectedly.\nMichaelson caught up to him. \"Are you leaving the city?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\"Away. Far away.\" Maota looked off toward the hills, eyes distant.\n\"Don't be stupid, old man. How can you go far away and not leave the\ncity?\"\n\"There are many directions. You would not understand.\"\n\"East. West. North. South. Up. Down.\"\n\"No, no. There is another direction. Come, if you must see.\"\nMichaelson followed him far down the street. They came to a section of\nthe city he had not seen before. Buildings were smaller, spires dwarfed\nagainst larger structures. Here a path was packed in the sand, leading\nto a particular building.\nMichaelson said, \"This is where you live?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nMaota went inside. Michaelson stood in the entrance and looked around.\nThe room was clean, furnished with hand made chairs and a bed. Who is\nthis old man, he thought, far from his people, living alone, choosing\na life of solitude among ancient ruins but not touching them? Above\nthe bed a \"clock\" was fastened to the wall, Michaelson remembered his\nfright\u2014thinking of the warmth where warmth should not be.\nMaota pointed to it.\n\"You asked about this machine,\" he said. \"Now I will tell you.\" He laid\nhis hand against it. \"Here is power to follow another direction.\"\nMichaelson tested one of the chairs to see if it would hold his weight,\nthen sat down. His curiosity about the instrument was colossal, but he\nforced a short laugh. \"Maota, you\nare\ncomplex. Why not stop all this\nmystery nonsense and tell me about it? You know more about it than I.\"\n\"Of course.\" Maota smiled a toothless, superior smile. \"What do you\nsuppose happened to this race?\"\n\"You tell me.\"\n\"They took the unknown direction. The books speak of it. I don't know\nhow the instrument works, but one thing is certain. The race did not\ndie out, as a species becomes extinct.\"\nMichaelson was amused, but interested. \"Something like a fourth\ndimension?\"\n\"I don't know. I only know that with this instrument there is no death.\nI have read the books that speak of this race, this wonderful people\nwho conquered all disease, who explored all the mysteries of science,\nwho devised this machine to cheat death. See this button here on the\nface of the instrument? Press the button, and....\"\n\"And what?\"\n\"I don't know, exactly. But I have lived many years. I have walked the\nstreets of this city and wondered, and wanted to press the button. Now\nI will do so.\"\nQuickly the old man, still smiling, pressed the button. A high-pitched\nwhine filled the air, just within audio range. Steady for a moment, it\nthen rose in pitch passing beyond hearing quickly.\nThe old man's knees buckled. He sank down, fell over the bed, lay\nstill. Michaelson touched him cautiously, then examined him more\ncarefully. No question about it.\nThe old man was dead.\nFeeling depressed and alone, Michaelson found a desert knoll outside\nthe city overlooking the tall spires that shone in the sunlight and\ngleamed in the moonlight. He made a stretcher, rolled the old man's\nbody on to it and dragged it down the long ancient street and up the\nknoll.\nHere he buried him.\nBut it seemed a waste of time. Somehow he knew beyond any doubt that\nthe old native and his body were completely disassociated in some sense\nmore complete than death.\nIn the days that followed he gave much thought to the \"clock.\" He came\nto the city every day. He spent long hours in the huge square building\nwith the books. He learned the language by sheer bulldog determination.\nThen he searched the books for information about the instrument.\nFinally after many weeks, long after the winds had obliterated all\nevidence of Maota's grave on the knoll, Michaelson made a decision. He\nhad to know if the machine would work for him.\nAnd so one afternoon when the ancient spires threw long shadows\nover the sand he walked down the long street and entered the old\nman's house. He stood before the instrument, trembling, afraid, but\ndetermined. He pinched his eyes shut tight like a child and pressed the\nbutton.\nThe high-pitched whine started.\nComplete, utter silence. Void. Darkness. Awareness and memory, yes;\nnothing else. Then Maota's chuckle came. No sound, an impression only\nlike the voice from the ancient book. Where was he? There was no left\nor right, up or down. Maota was everywhere, nowhere.\n\"Look!\" Maota's thought was directed at him in this place of no\ndirection. \"Think of the city and you will see it.\"\nMichaelson did, and he saw the city beyond, as if he were looking\nthrough a window. And yet he was in the city looking at his own body.\nMaota's chuckle again. \"The city will remain as it is. You did not win\nafter all.\"\n\"Neither did you.\"\n\"But this existence has compensations,\" Maota said. \"You can be\nanywhere, see anywhere on this planet. Even on your Earth.\"\nMichaelson felt a great sadness, seeing his body lying across the\nold, home made bed. He looked closer. He sensed a vibration or life\nforce\u2014he didn't stop to define it\u2014in his body. Why was his dead body\ndifferent from Old Maota's? Could it be that there was some thread\nstretching from the reality of his body to his present state?\n\"I don't like your thoughts,\" Maota said. \"No one can go back. I tried.\nI have discussed it with many who are not presently in communication\nwith you. No one can go back.\"\nMichaelson decided he try.\n\"No!\" Maota's thought was prickled with fear and anger.\nMichaelson did not know how to try, but he remembered the cylinder and\ngathered all the force of his mind in spite of Maota's protests, and\ngave his most violent command.\nAt first he thought it didn't work.

His wife died many years ago back on Earth. He is tall, gaunt, and wears gray slacks and a gray sweater. He speaks in a deep, melodic voice, and he has a habit of speaking in code. When he sees an old man, he asks him if he has any idea what he is talking about. The old man tells him that he is an archeologist, not a fighter, and that he has never met a human being before. He also tells him about the instruments in the rooms that are similar to those on Earth, but they are not the same ones that are on the ship. He asks the old man about the book, and the man says that it is a kind of book. The book talks, and it talks for five thousand lifetimes.   The man tells the man that the book is like any other book, except for the fact that it talks. The man then asks the man to take the book back to the ship, but the man refuses. He says that he cannot leave the planet because he has been here for so long, and there is no way he could travel as long as the man has been there. The two men go back to their ship to look for the book. When they return, they find it buried in the sand, and they realize that it has been buried there for hundreds of thousands of years. They find the book again, and when they pick it up, it talks to them. They ask the man if he knows where it is from, but he says he does not know. He tells them that it cannot be found on Earth because there are no more than five thousand humans on the planet. The story ends with the two men discussing how they are going to kill the man and take his body back to Earth.", "faithfulness": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}

Finding\none worth living for is the genuine problem!\nIn the region of the Coal Sack Nebula, on the dead fourth planet of\na star called Tyban, Captain Steffens of the Mapping Command stood\ncounting buildings. Eleven. No, twelve. He wondered if there was any\nsignificance in the number. He had no idea.\n\"What do you make of it?\" he asked.\nLieutenant Ball, the executive officer of the ship, almost tried to\nscratch his head before he remembered that he was wearing a spacesuit.\n\"Looks like a temporary camp,\" Ball said. \"Very few buildings, and all\nbuilt out of native materials, the only stuff available. Castaways,\nmaybe?\"\nSteffens was silent as he walked up onto the rise. The flat weathered\nstone jutted out of the sand before him.\n\"No inscriptions,\" he pointed out.\n\"They would have been worn away. See the wind grooves? Anyway, there's\nnot another building on the whole damn planet. You wouldn't call it\nmuch of a civilization.\"\n\"You don't think these are native?\"\nBall said he didn't. Steffens nodded.\nStanding there and gazing at the stone, Steffens felt the awe of great\nage. He had a hunch, deep and intuitive, that this was old\u2014\ntoo\nold.\nHe reached out a gloved hand, ran it gently over the smooth stone\nridges of the wall. Although the atmosphere was very thin, he noticed\nthat the buildings had no airlocks.\nBall's voice sounded in his helmet: \"Want to set up shop, Skipper?\"\nSteffens paused. \"All right, if you think it will do any good.\"\n\"You never can tell. Excavation probably won't be much use. These\nthings are on a raised rock foundation, swept clean by the wind. And\nyou can see that the rock itself is native\u2014\" he indicated the ledge\nbeneath their feet\u2014\"and was cut out a long while back.\"\n\"How long?\"\nBall toed the sand uncomfortably. \"I wouldn't like to say off-hand.\"\n\"Make a rough estimate.\"\nBall looked at the captain, knowing what was in his mind. He smiled\nwryly and said: \"Five thousand years? Ten thousand? I don't know.\"\nSteffens whistled.\nBall pointed again at the wall. \"Look at the striations. You can tell\nfrom that alone. It would take even a brisk Earth wind\nat least\nseveral thousand years to cut that deep, and the wind here has only a\nfraction of that force.\"\nThe two men stood for a long moment in silence. Man had been in\ninterstellar space for three hundred years and this was the first\nuncovered evidence of an advanced, space-crossing, alien race. It was\nan historic moment, but neither of them was thinking about history.\nMan had been in space for only three hundred years. Whatever had built\nthese had been in space for thousands of years.\nWhich ought to give\nthem\n, thought Steffens uncomfortably, one hell of\na good head-start.\nWhile the excav crew worked steadily, turning up nothing, Steffens\nremained alone among the buildings. Ball came out to him, looked dryly\nat the walls.\n\"Well,\" he said, \"whoever they were, we haven't heard from them since.\"\n\"No? How can you be sure?\" Steffens grunted. \"A space-borne race was\nroaming this part of the Galaxy while men were still pitching spears\nat each other,\nthat\nlong ago. And this planet is only a parsec from\nVarius II, a civilization as old as Earth's. Did whoever built these\nget to Varius? Or did they get to Earth? How can you know?\"\nHe kicked at the sand distractedly. \"And most important, where are they\nnow? A race with several thousand years....\"\n\"Fifteen thousand,\" Ball said. When Steffens looked up, he added:\n\"That's what the geology boys say. Fifteen thousand, at the least.\"\nSteffens turned to stare unhappily at the buildings. When he realized\nnow how really old they were, a sudden thought struck him.\n\"But why buildings? Why did they have to build in stone, to last?\nThere's something wrong with that. They shouldn't have had a need\nto build, unless they were castaways. And castaways would have left\nsomething\nbehind. The only reason they would need a camp would be\u2014\"\n\"If the ship left and some of them stayed.\"\nSteffens nodded. \"But then the ship must have come back. Where did it\ngo?\" He ceased kicking at the sand and looked up into the blue-black\nmidday sky. \"We'll never know.\"\n\"How about the other planets?\" Ball asked.\n\"The report was negative. Inner too hot, outer too heavy and cold. The\nthird planet is the only one with a decent temperature range, but\nit\nhas a CO\n  2\n  atmosphere.\"\n\"How about moons?\"\nSteffens shrugged. \"We could try them and find out.\"\nThe third planet was a blank, gleaming ball until they were in close,\nand then the blankness resolved into folds and piling clouds and dimly,\nin places, the surface showed through. The ship went down through the\nclouds, falling the last few miles on her brakers. They came into the\nmisty gas below, leveled off and moved along the edge of the twilight\nzone.\nThe moons of this solar system had yielded nothing. The third planet, a\nhot, heavy world which had no free oxygen and from which the monitors\nhad detected nothing, was all that was left. Steffens expected nothing,\nbut he had to try.\nAt a height of several miles, the ship moved up the zone, scanning,\nmoving in the familiar slow spiral of the Mapping Command. Faint dark\noutlines of bare rocks and hills moved by below.\nSteffens turned the screen to full magnification and watched silently.\nAfter a while he saw a city.\nThe main screen being on, the whole crew saw it. Someone shouted and\nthey stopped to stare, and Steffens was about to call for altitude when\nhe saw that the city was dead.\nHe looked down on splintered walls that were like cloudy glass pieces\nrising above a plain, rising in a shattered circle. Near the center\nof the city, there was a huge, charred hole at least three miles in\ndiameter and very deep. In all the piled rubble, nothing moved.\nSteffens went down low to make sure, then brought the ship around and\nheaded out across the main continent into the bright area of the sun.\nThe rocks rolled by below, there was no vegetation at all, and then\nthere were more cities\u2014all with the black depression, the circular\nstamp that blotted away and fused the buildings into nothing.\nNo one on the ship had anything to say. None had ever seen a war, for\nthere had not been war on Earth or near it for more than three hundred\nyears.\nThe ship circled around to the dark side of the planet. When they were\ndown below a mile, the radiation counters began to react. It became\napparent, from the dials, that there could be nothing alive.\nAfter a while Ball said: \"Well, which do you figure? Did our friends\nfrom the fourth planet do this, or were they the same people as these?\"\nSteffens did not take his eyes from the screen. They were coming around\nto the daylight side.\n\"We'll go down and look for the answer,\" he said. \"Break out the\nradiation suits.\"\nHe paused, thinking. If the ones on the fourth planet were alien to\nthis world, they were from outer space, could not have come from one\nof the other planets here. They had starships and were warlike. Then,\nthousands of years ago. He began to realize how important it really was\nthat Ball's question be answered.\nWhen the ship had gone very low, looking for a landing site, Steffens\nwas still by the screen. It was Steffens, then, who saw the thing move.\nDown far below, it had been a still black shadow, and then it moved.\nSteffens froze. And he knew, even at that distance, that it was a robot.\nTiny and black, a mass of hanging arms and legs, the thing went gliding\ndown the slope of a hill. Steffens saw it clearly for a full second,\nsaw the dull ball of its head tilt upward as the ship came over, and\nthen the hill was past.\nQuickly Steffens called for height. The ship bucked beneath him and\nblasted straight up; some of the crew went crashing to the deck.\nSteffens remained by the screen, increasing the magnification as the\nship drew away. And he saw another, then two, then a black gliding\ngroup, all matched with bunches of hanging arms.\nNothing alive but robots, he thought,\nrobots\n. He adjusted to full\nclose up as quickly as he could and the picture focused on the screen.\nBehind him he heard a crewman grunt in amazement.\nA band of clear, plasticlike stuff ran round the head\u2014it would be the\neye, a band of eye that saw all ways. On the top of the head was a\nsingle round spot of the plastic, and the rest was black metal, joined,\nhe realized, with fantastic perfection. The angle of sight was now\nalmost perpendicular. He could see very little of the branching arms of\nthe trunk, but what had been on the screen was enough. They were the\nmost perfect robots he had ever seen.\nThe ship leveled off. Steffens had no idea what to do; the sudden sight\nof the moving things had unnerved him. He had already sounded the\nalert, flicked out the defense screens. Now he had nothing to do. He\ntried to concentrate on what the League Law would have him do.\nThe Law was no help. Contact with planet-bound races was forbidden\nunder any circumstances. But could a bunch of robots be called a race?\nThe Law said nothing about robots because Earthmen had none. The\nbuilding of imaginative robots was expressly forbidden. But at any\nrate, Steffens thought, he had made contact already.\nWhile Steffens stood by the screen, completely bewildered for the first\ntime in his space career, Lieutenant Ball came up, hobbling slightly.\nFrom the bright new bruise on his cheek, Steffens guessed that the\nsudden climb had caught him unaware. The exec was pale with surprise.\n\"What were they?\" he said blankly. \"Lord, they looked like robots!\"\n\"They were.\"\nBall stared confoundedly at the screen. The things were now a confusion\nof dots in the mist.\n\"Almost humanoid,\" Steffens said, \"but not quite.\"\nBall was slowly absorbing the situation. He turned to gaze inquiringly\nat Steffens.\n\"Well, what do we do now?\"\nSteffens shrugged. \"They saw us. We could leave now and let them quite\npossibly make a ... a legend out of our visit, or we could go down and\nsee if they tie in with the buildings on Tyban IV.\"\n\"\nCan\nwe go down?\"\n\"Legally? I don't know. If they are robots, yes, since robots cannot\nconstitute a race. But there's another possibility.\" He tapped his\nfingers on the screen confusedly. \"They don't have to be robots at all.\nThey could be the natives.\"\nBall gulped. \"I don't follow you.\"\n\"They could be the original inhabitants of this planet\u2014the brains of\nthem, at least, protected in radiation-proof metal. Anyway,\" he added,\n\"they're the most perfect mechanicals I've ever seen.\"\nBall shook his head, sat down abruptly. Steffens turned from the\nscreen, strode nervously across the Main Deck, thinking.\nThe Mapping Command, they called it. Theoretically, all he was supposed\nto do was make a closeup examination of unexplored systems, checking\nfor the presence of life-forms as well as for the possibilities of\nhuman colonization. Make a check and nothing else. But he knew very\nclearly that if he returned to Sirius base without investigating this\nrobot situation, he could very well be court-martialed one way or the\nother, either for breaking the Law of Contact or for dereliction of\nduty.\nAnd there was also the possibility, which abruptly occurred to him,\nthat the robots might well be prepared to blow his ship to hell and\ngone.\nHe stopped in the center of the deck. A whole new line of thought\nopened up. If the robots were armed and ready ... could this be an\noutpost?\nAn outpost!\nHe turned and raced for the bridge. If he went in and landed and was\nlost, then the League might never know in time. If he went in and\nstirred up trouble....\nThe thought in his mind was scattered suddenly, like a mist blown away.\nA voice was speaking in his mind, a deep calm voice that seemed to say:\n\"\nGreetings. Do not be alarmed. We do not wish you to be alarmed. Our\ndesire is only to serve....\n\"\n\"Greetings, it said! Greetings!\" Ball was mumbling incredulously\nthrough shocked lips.\nEveryone on the ship had heard the voice. When it spoke again, Steffens\nwas not sure whether it was just one voice or many voices.\n\"We await your coming,\" it said gravely, and repeated: \"Our desire is\nonly to serve.\"\nAnd then the robots sent a\npicture\n.\nAs perfect and as clear as a tridim movie, a rectangular plate took\nshape in Steffens' mind. On the face of the plate, standing alone\nagainst a background of red-brown, bare rocks, was one of the robots.\nWith slow, perfect movement, the robot carefully lifted one of the\nhanging arms of its side, of its\nright\nside, and extended it toward\nSteffens, a graciously offered hand.\nSteffens felt a peculiar, compelling urge to take the hand, realized\nright away that the urge to take the hand was not entirely his. The\nrobot mind had helped.\nWhen the picture vanished, he knew that the others had seen it. He\nwaited for a while; there was no further contact, but the feeling of\nthe robot's urging was still strong within him. He had an idea that, if\nthey wanted to, the robots could control his mind. So when nothing more\nhappened, he began to lose his fear.\nWhile the crew watched in fascination, Steffens tried to talk back.\nHe concentrated hard on what he was saying, said it aloud for good\nmeasure, then held his own hand extended in the robot manner of shaking\nhands.\n\"Greetings,\" he said, because it was what\nthey\nhad said, and\nexplained: \"We have come from the stars.\"\nIt was overly dramatic, but so was the whole situation. He wondered\nbaffledly if he should have let the Alien Contact crew handle it. Order\nsomeone to stand there, feeling like a fool, and\nthink\na message?\nNo, it was his responsibility; he had to go on:\n\"We request\u2014we respectfully request permission to land upon your\nplanet.\"\nSteffens had not realized that there were so many.\nThey had been gathering since his ship was first seen, and now there\nwere hundreds of them clustered upon the hill. Others were arriving\neven as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with\nfantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety.\nMost of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal.\nOthers threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none\ntouched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.\nOne of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now\nsaw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black\nthing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture.\nSteffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through\nthe glove of his suit.\n\"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now\nSteffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was\nless friendly now, less\u2014Steffens could not understand\u2014somehow less\ninterested\n, as if the robot had been\u2014expecting someone else.\n\"Thank you,\" Steffens said. \"We are deeply grateful for your permission\nto land.\"\n\"Our desire,\" the robot repeated mechanically, \"is only to serve.\"\nSuddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He\ntried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they\nshould\nseem inhuman. But....\n\"Will the others come down?\" asked the robot, still mechanically.\nSteffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above,\njets throbbing gently.\n\"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the\nrobot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his\nmind, there was no need to ask.\nFor a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense\nand uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was\nobviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men\nto come on out of the skiff.\nThey came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard\nthe one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.\n\"We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is\nour\u2014custom\u2014not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we\nobserved that you were in ignorance of our real\u2014nature\u2014and were about\nto leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you\nmight base your decision upon sufficient data.\"\nSteffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.\n\"We perceive,\" the robot went on, \"that you are unaware of our complete\naccess to your mind, and would perhaps be\u2014dismayed\u2014to learn that\nwe have been gathering information from you. We must\u2014apologize.\nOur only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only\nthat information was taken which is necessary for communication\nand\u2014understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your\nrequest.\"\nSteffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed\nas violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he\nretreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.\nThe robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way\ndifferent from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots\nwas immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens\nguessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake,\nbecause they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The\npicture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen,\nhad probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and\nthe others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary\nlapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed\nalmost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to\nexamine the first robot in detail.\nIt was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen.\nThe most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of\nthe head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the\nmetal chest. Symbols in row upon row\u2014numbers, perhaps\u2014were upon the\nchest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued\nin orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the\nbase of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was\na remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on\nthe nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude\nthat the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at\nthat, although the answer seemed illogical.\nIt wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the\nsymbols again. And only then did he realized what they were.\nAfter a while, convinced that there was no danger, Steffens had the\nship brought down. When the crew came out of the airlock, they were met\nby the robots, and each man found himself with a robot at his side,\nhumbly requesting to be of service. There were literally thousands of\nthe robots now, come from all over the barren horizon. The mass of them\nstood apart, immobile on a plain near the ship, glinting in the sun\nlike a vast, metallic field of black wheat.\nThe robots had obviously been built to serve. Steffens began to\nfeel\ntheir pleasure, to sense it in spite of the blank, expressionless\nfaces. They were almost like children in their eagerness, yet they were\nstill reserved. Whoever had built them, Steffens thought in wonder, had\nbuilt them well.\nBall came to join Steffens, staring at the robots through the clear\nplastic of his helmet with baffledly widened eyes. A robot moved out\nfrom the mass in the field, allied itself to him. The first to speak\nhad remained with Steffens.\nRealizing that the robot could hear every word he was saying, Ball\nwas for a while apprehensive. But the sheer unreality of standing and\ntalking with a multi-limbed, intelligent hunk of dead metal upon the\nbare rock of a dead, ancient world, the unreality of it slowly died.\nIt was impossible not to like the things. There was something in their\nvery lines which was pleasant and relaxing.\nTheir builders, Steffens thought, had probably thought of that, too.\n\"There's no harm in them,\" said Ball at last, openly, not minding if\nthe robots heard. \"They seem actually glad we're here. My God, whoever\nheard of a robot being glad?\"\nSteffens, embarrassed, spoke quickly to the nearest mechanical: \"I hope\nyou will forgive us our curiosity, but\u2014yours is a remarkable race. We\nhave never before made contact with a race like yours.\" It was said\nhaltingly, but it was the best he could do.\nThe robot made a singularly human nodding motion of its head.\n\"I perceive that the nature of our construction is unfamiliar to you.\nYour question is whether or not we are entirely 'mechanical.' I am\nnot exactly certain as to what the word 'mechanical' is intended to\nconvey\u2014I would have to examine your thought more fully\u2014but I believe\nthat there is fundamental similarity between our structures.\"\nThe robot paused. Steffens had a distinct impression that it was\ndisconcerted.\n\"I must tell you,\" the thing went on, \"that we ourselves are\u2014curious.\"\nIt stopped suddenly, struggling with a word it could not comprehend.\nSteffens waited, listening with absolute interest. It said at length:\n\"We know of only two types of living structure. Ours, which is largely\nmetallic, and that of the\nMakers\n, which would appear to be somewhat\nmore like yours. I am not a\u2014doctor\u2014and therefore cannot acquaint you\nwith the specific details of the Makers' composition, but if you are\ninterested I will have a doctor brought forward. It will be glad to be\nof assistance.\"\nIt was Steffens' turn to struggle, and the robot waited patiently while\nBall and the second robot looked on in silence. The Makers, obviously,\nwere whoever or whatever had built the robots, and the \"doctors,\"\nSteffens decided, were probably just that\u2014doctor-robots, designed\nspecifically to care for the apparently flesh-bodies of the Makers.\nThe efficiency of the things continued to amaze him, but the question\nhe had been waiting to ask came out now with a rush:\n\"Can you tell us where the Makers are?\"\nBoth robots stood motionless. It occurred to Steffens that he couldn't\nreally be sure which was speaking. The voice that came to him spoke\nwith difficulty.\n\"The Makers\u2014are not here.\"\nSteffens stared in puzzlement. The robot detected his confusion and\nwent on:\n\"The Makers have gone away. They have been gone for a very long time.\"\nCould that be\npain\nin its voice, Steffens wondered, and then the\nspectre of the ruined cities rose harsh in his mind.\nWar. The Makers had all been killed in that war. And these had not been\nkilled.\nHe tried to grasp it, but he couldn't. There were robots here in the\nmidst of a radiation so lethal that\nnothing\n,\nnothing\ncould live;\nrobots on a dead planet, living in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide.\nThe carbon dioxide brought him up sharp.\nIf there had been life here once, there would have been plant life as\nwell, and therefore oxygen. If the war had been so long ago that the\nfree oxygen had since gone out of the atmosphere\u2014good God, how old\nwere the robots? Steffens looked at Ball, then at the silent robots,\nthen out across the field to where the rest of them stood. The black\nwheat. Steffens felt a deep chill.\nWere they immortal?\n\"Would you like to see a doctor?\"\nSteffens jumped at the familiar words, then realized to what the robot\nwas referring.\n\"No, not yet,\" he said, \"thank you.\" He swallowed hard as the robots\ncontinued waiting patiently.\n\"Could you tell me,\" he said at last, \"how old you are? Individually?\"\n\"By your reckoning,\" said his robot, and paused to make the\ncalculation, \"I am forty-four years, seven months, and eighteen days of\nage, with ten years and approximately nine months yet to be alive.\"\nSteffens tried to understand that.\n\"It would perhaps simplify our conversations,\" said the robot, \"if\nyou were to refer to me by a name, as is your custom. Using the\nfirst\u2014letters\u2014of my designation, my name would translate as Elb.\"\n\"Glad to meet you,\" Steffens mumbled.\n\"You are called 'Stef,'\" said the robot obligingly. Then it added,\npointing an arm at the robot near Ball: \"The age of\u2014Peb\u2014is seventeen\nyears, one month and four days. Peb has therefore remaining some\nthirty-eight years.\"\nSteffens was trying to keep up. Then the life span was obviously about\nfifty-five years. But the cities, and the carbon dioxide? The robot,\nElb, had said that the Makers were similar to him, and therefore oxygen\nand plant life would have been needed. Unless\u2014\nHe remembered the buildings on Tyban IV.\nUnless the Makers had not come from this planet at all.\nHis mind helplessly began to revolve. It was Ball who restored order.\n\"Do you build yourselves?\" the exec asked.\nPeb answered quickly, that faint note of happiness again apparent, as\nif the robot was glad for the opportunity of answering.\n\"No, we do not build ourselves. We are made by the\u2014\" another pause for\na word\u2014\"by the\nFactory\n.\"\n\"The Factory?\"\n\"Yes. It was built by the Makers. Would you care to see it?\"\nBoth of the Earthmen nodded dumbly.\n\"Would you prefer to use your\u2014skiff? It is quite a long way from here.\"\nIt was indeed a long way, even by skiff. Some of the Aliencon crew went\nalong with them. And near the edge of the twilight zone, on the other\nside of the world, they saw the Factory outlined in the dim light of\ndusk. A huge, fantastic block, wrought of gray and cloudy metal, lay in\na valley between two worn mountains. Steffens went down low, circling\nin the skiff, stared in awe at the size of the building. Robots moved\noutside the thing, little black bugs in the distance\u2014moving around\ntheir birthplace.\nThe Earthmen remained for several weeks. During that time, Steffens was\nusually with Elb, talking now as often as he listened, and the Aliencon\nteam roamed the planet freely, investigating what was certainly the\nstrangest culture in history. There was still the mystery of those\nbuildings on Tyban IV; that, as well as the robots' origin, would have\nto be cleared up before they could leave.\nSurprisingly, Steffens did not think about the future. Whenever he came\nnear a robot, he sensed such a general, comfortable air of good feeling\nthat it warmed him, and he was so preoccupied with watching the robots\nthat he did little thinking.\nSomething he had not realized at the beginning was that he was as\nunusual to the robots as they were to him. It came to him with a great\nshock that not one of the robots had ever seen a living thing. Not a\nbug, a worm, a leaf. They did not know what flesh was. Only the doctors\nknew that, and none of them could readily understand what was meant by\nthe words \"organic matter.\" It had taken them some time to recognize\nthat the Earthmen wore suits which were not parts of their bodies, and\nit was even more difficult for them to understand why the suits were\nneeded.\nBut when they did understand, the robots did a surprising thing.\nAt first, because of the excessive radiation, none of the Earthmen\ncould remain outside the ship for long, even in radiation suits. And\none morning, when Steffens came out of the ship, it was to discover\nthat hundreds of the robots, working through the night, had effectively\ndecontaminated the entire area.\nIt was at this point that Steffens asked how many robots there were.\nHe learned to his amazement that there were more than nine million.\nThe great mass of them had politely remained a great distance from the\nship, spread out over the planet, since they were highly radioactive.\nSteffens, meanwhile, courteously allowed Elb to probe into his mind.\nThe robot extracted all the knowledge of matter that Steffens held,\npondered over the knowledge and tried to digest it, and passed it on to\nthe other robots. Steffens, in turn, had a difficult time picturing the\nmind of a thing that had never known life.\nHe had a vague idea of the robot's history\u2014more, perhaps, then they\nknew themselves\u2014but he refrained from forming an opinion until\nAliencon made its report. What fascinated him was Elb's amazing\nphilosophy, the only outlook, really, that the robot could have had.\n\"What do you\ndo\n?\" Steffens asked.\nElb replied quickly, with characteristic simplicity: \"We can do very\nlittle. A certain amount of physical knowledge was imparted to us at\nbirth by the Makers. We spend the main part of our time expanding that\nknowledge wherever possible. We have made some progress in the natural\nsciences, and some in mathematics. Our purpose in being, you see, is\nto serve the Makers. Any ability we can acquire will make us that much\nmore fit to serve when the Makers return.\"\n\"When they return?\" It had not occurred to Steffens until now that the\nrobots expected the Makers to do so.\nElb regarded him out of the band of the circling eye. \"I see you had\nsurmised that the Makers were not coming back.\"\nIf the robot could have laughed, Steffens thought it would have, then.\nBut it just stood there, motionless, its tone politely emphatic.\n\"It has always been our belief that the Makers would return. Why else\nwould we have been built?\"\nSteffens thought the robot would go on, but it didn't. The question, to\nElb, was no question at all.\nAlthough Steffens knew already what the robot could not possibly have\nknown\u2014that the Makers were gone and would never come back\u2014he was a\nlong time understanding. What he did was push this speculation into the\nback of his mind, to keep it from Elb. He had no desire to destroy a\nfaith.\nBut it created a problem in him. He had begun to picture for Elb the\nstructure of human society, and the robot\u2014a machine which did not eat\nor sleep\u2014listened gravely and tried to understand. One day Steffens\nmentioned God.\n\"God?\" the robot repeated without comprehension. \"What is God?\"\nSteffens explained briefly, and the robot answered:\n\"It is a matter which has troubled us. We thought at first that you\nwere the Makers returning\u2014\" Steffens remembered the brief lapse, the\nseeming disappointment he had sensed\u2014\"but then we probed your minds\nand found that you were not, that you were another kind of being,\nunlike either the Makers or ourselves. You were not even\u2014\" Elb caught\nhimself\u2014\"you did not happen to be telepaths. Therefore we troubled\nover who made you. We did detect the word 'Maker' in your theology,\nbut it seemed to have a peculiar\u2014\" Elb paused for a long while\u2014\"an\nuntouchable, intangible meaning which varies among you.\"\nSteffens understood. He nodded.\nThe Makers were the robots' God, were all the God they needed. The\nMakers had built them, the planet, the universe. If he were to ask them\nwho made the Makers, it would be like their asking him who made God.\nIt was an ironic parallel, and he smiled to himself.\nBut on that planet, it was the last time he smiled.\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nOrphans of the Void\nBy MICHAEL SHAARA\nIllustrated by EMSH\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nGalaxy Science Fiction June 1952.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nFinding a cause worth dying for is no\ngreat trick\u2014the Universe is full of them. Finding\none worth living for is the genuine problem!\nIn the region of the Coal Sack Nebula, on the dead fourth planet of\na star called Tyban, Captain Steffens of the Mapping Command stood\ncounting buildings. Eleven. No, twelve. He wondered if there was any\nsignificance in the number. He had no idea.\n\"What do you make of it?\" he asked.\nLieutenant Ball, the executive officer of the ship, almost tried to\nscratch his head before he remembered that he was wearing a spacesuit.\n\"Looks like a temporary camp,\" Ball said. \"Very few buildings, and all\nbuilt out of native materials, the only stuff available. Castaways,\nmaybe?\"\nSteffens was silent as he walked up onto the rise. The flat weathered\nstone jutted out of the sand before him.\n\"No inscriptions,\" he pointed out.\n\"They would have been worn away. See the wind grooves? Anyway, there's\nnot another building on the whole damn planet. You wouldn't call it\nmuch of a civilization.\"\n\"You don't think these are native?\"\nBall said he didn't. Steffens nodded.\nStanding there and gazing at the stone, Steffens felt the awe of great\nage. He had a hunch, deep and intuitive, that this was old\u2014\ntoo\nold.\nHe reached out a gloved hand, ran it gently over the smooth stone\nridges of the wall. Although the atmosphere was very thin, he noticed\nthat the buildings had no airlocks.\nBall's voice sounded in his helmet: \"Want to set up shop, Skipper?\"\nSteffens paused. \"All right, if you think it will do any good.\"\n\"You never can tell. Excavation probably won't be much use. These\nthings are on a raised rock foundation, swept clean by the wind. And\nyou can see that the rock itself is native\u2014\" he indicated the ledge\nbeneath their feet\u2014\"and was cut out a long while back.\"\n\"How long?\"\nBall toed the sand uncomfortably. \"I wouldn't like to say off-hand.\"\n\"Make a rough estimate.\"\nBall looked at the captain, knowing what was in his mind. He smiled\nwryly and said: \"Five thousand years? Ten thousand? I don't know.\"\nSteffens whistled.\nBall pointed again at the wall. \"Look at the striations. You can tell\nfrom that alone. It would take even a brisk Earth wind\nat least\nseveral thousand years to cut that deep, and the wind here has only a\nfraction of that force.\"\nThe two men stood for a long moment in silence. Man had been in\ninterstellar space for three hundred years and this was the first\nuncovered evidence of an advanced, space-crossing, alien race. It was\nan historic moment, but neither of them was thinking about history.\nMan had been in space for only three hundred years. Whatever had built\nthese had been in space for thousands of years.\nWhich ought to give\nthem\n, thought Steffens uncomfortably, one hell of\na good head-start.\nWhile the excav crew worked steadily, turning up nothing, Steffens\nremained alone among the buildings. Ball came out to him, looked dryly\nat the walls.\n\"Well,\" he said, \"whoever they were, we haven't heard from them since.\"\n\"No? How can you be sure?\" Steffens grunted. \"A space-borne race was\nroaming this part of the Galaxy while men were still pitching spears\nat each other,\nthat\nlong ago. And this planet is only a parsec from\nVarius II, a civilization as old as Earth's. Did whoever built these\nget to Varius? Or did they get to Earth? How can you know?\"\nHe kicked at the sand distractedly. \"And most important, where are they\nnow? A race with several thousand years....\"\n\"Fifteen thousand,\" Ball said. When Steffens looked up, he added:\n\"That's what the geology boys say. Fifteen thousand, at the least.\"\nSteffens turned to stare unhappily at the buildings. When he realized\nnow how really old they were, a sudden thought struck him.\n\"But why buildings? Why did they have to build in stone, to last?\nThere's something wrong with that. They shouldn't have had a need\nto build, unless they were castaways. And castaways would have left\nsomething\nbehind. The only reason they would need a camp would be\u2014\"\n\"If the ship left and some of them stayed.\"\nSteffens nodded. \"But then the ship must have come back. Where did it\ngo?\" He ceased kicking at the sand and looked up into the blue-black\nmidday sky. \"We'll never know.\"\n\"How about the other planets?\" Ball asked.\n\"The report was negative. Inner too hot, outer too heavy and cold. The\nthird planet is the only one with a decent temperature range, but\nit\nhas a CO\n  2\n  atmosphere.\"\n\"How about moons?\"\nSteffens shrugged. \"We could try them and find out.\"\nThe third planet was a blank, gleaming ball until they were in close,\nand then the blankness resolved into folds and piling clouds and dimly,\nin places, the surface showed through. The ship went down through the\nclouds, falling the last few miles on her brakers. They came into the\nmisty gas below, leveled off and moved along the edge of the twilight\nzone.\nThe moons of this solar system had yielded nothing. The third planet, a\nhot, heavy world which had no free oxygen and from which the monitors\nhad detected nothing, was all that was left. Steffens expected nothing,\nbut he had to try.\nAt a height of several miles, the ship moved up the zone, scanning,\nmoving in the familiar slow spiral of the Mapping Command. Faint dark\noutlines of bare rocks and hills moved by below.\nSteffens turned the screen to full magnification and watched silently.\nAfter a while he saw a city.\nThe main screen being on, the whole crew saw it. Someone shouted and\nthey stopped to stare, and Steffens was about to call for altitude when\nhe saw that the city was dead.\nHe looked down on splintered walls that were like cloudy glass pieces\nrising above a plain, rising in a shattered circle. Near the center\nof the city, there was a huge, charred hole at least three miles in\ndiameter and very deep. In all the piled rubble, nothing moved.\nSteffens went down low to make sure, then brought the ship around and\nheaded out across the main continent into the bright area of the sun.\nThe rocks rolled by below, there was no vegetation at all, and then\nthere were more cities\u2014all with the black depression, the circular\nstamp that blotted away and fused the buildings into nothing.\nNo one on the ship had anything to say. None had ever seen a war, for\nthere had not been war on Earth or near it for more than three hundred\nyears.\nThe ship circled around to the dark side of the planet. When they were\ndown below a mile, the radiation counters began to react. It became\napparent, from the dials, that there could be nothing alive.\nAfter a while Ball said: \"Well, which do you figure? Did our friends\nfrom the fourth planet do this, or were they the same people as these?\"\nSteffens did not take his eyes from the screen. They were coming around\nto the daylight side.\n\"We'll go down and look for the answer,\" he said. \"Break out the\nradiation suits.\"\nHe paused, thinking. If the ones on the fourth planet were alien to\nthis world, they were from outer space, could not have come from one\nof the other planets here. They had starships and were warlike. Then,\nthousands of years ago. He began to realize how important it really was\nthat Ball's question be answered.\nWhen the ship had gone very low, looking for a landing site, Steffens\nwas still by the screen. It was Steffens, then, who saw the thing move.\nDown far below, it had been a still black shadow, and then it moved.\nSteffens froze. And he knew, even at that distance, that it was a robot.\nTiny and black, a mass of hanging arms and legs, the thing went gliding\ndown the slope of a hill. Steffens saw it clearly for a full second,\nsaw the dull ball of its head tilt upward as the ship came over, and\nthen the hill was past.\nQuickly Steffens called for height. The ship bucked beneath him and\nblasted straight up; some of the crew went crashing to the deck.\nSteffens remained by the screen, increasing the magnification as the\nship drew away. And he saw another, then two, then a black gliding\ngroup, all matched with bunches of hanging arms.\nNothing alive but robots, he thought,\nrobots\n. He adjusted to full\nclose up as quickly as he could and the picture focused on the screen.\nBehind him he heard a crewman grunt in amazement.\nA band of clear, plasticlike stuff ran round the head\u2014it would be the\neye, a band of eye that saw all ways. On the top of the head was a\nsingle round spot of the plastic, and the rest was black metal, joined,\nhe realized, with fantastic perfection. The angle of sight was now\nalmost perpendicular. He could see very little of the branching arms of\nthe trunk, but what had been on the screen was enough. They were the\nmost perfect robots he had ever seen.\nThe ship leveled off. Steffens had no idea what to do; the sudden sight\nof the moving things had unnerved him. He had already sounded the\nalert, flicked out the defense screens. Now he had nothing to do. He\ntried to concentrate on what the League Law would have him do.\nThe Law was no help. Contact with planet-bound races was forbidden\nunder any circumstances. But could a bunch of robots be called a race?\nThe Law said nothing about robots because Earthmen had none. The\nbuilding of imaginative robots was expressly forbidden. But at any\nrate, Steffens thought, he had made contact already.\nWhile Steffens stood by the screen, completely bewildered for the first\ntime in his space career, Lieutenant Ball came up, hobbling slightly.\nFrom the bright new bruise on his cheek, Steffens guessed that the\nsudden climb had caught him unaware. The exec was pale with surprise.\n\"What were they?\" he said blankly. \"Lord, they looked like robots!\"\n\"They were.\"\nBall stared confoundedly at the screen. The things were now a confusion\nof dots in the mist.\n\"Almost humanoid,\" Steffens said, \"but not quite.\"\nBall was slowly absorbing the situation. He turned to gaze inquiringly\nat Steffens.\n\"Well, what do we do now?\"\nSteffens shrugged. \"They saw us. We could leave now and let them quite\npossibly make a ... a legend out of our visit, or we could go down and\nsee if they tie in with the buildings on Tyban IV.\"\n\"\nCan\nwe go down?\"\n\"Legally? I don't know. If they are robots, yes, since robots cannot\nconstitute a race. But there's another possibility.\" He tapped his\nfingers on the screen confusedly. \"They don't have to be robots at all.\nThey could be the natives.\"\nBall gulped. \"I don't follow you.\"\n\"They could be the original inhabitants of this planet\u2014the brains of\nthem, at least, protected in radiation-proof metal. Anyway,\" he added,\n\"they're the most perfect mechanicals I've ever seen.\"\nBall shook his head, sat down abruptly. Steffens turned from the\nscreen, strode nervously across the Main Deck, thinking.\nThe Mapping Command, they called it. Theoretically, all he was supposed\nto do was make a closeup examination of unexplored systems, checking\nfor the presence of life-forms as well as for the possibilities of\nhuman colonization. Make a check and nothing else. But he knew very\nclearly that if he returned to Sirius base without investigating this\nrobot situation, he could very well be court-martialed one way or the\nother, either for breaking the Law of Contact or for dereliction of\nduty.\nAnd there was also the possibility, which abruptly occurred to him,\nthat the robots might well be prepared to blow his ship to hell and\ngone.\nHe stopped in the center of the deck. A whole new line of thought\nopened up. If the robots were armed and ready ... could this be an\noutpost?\nAn outpost!\nHe turned and raced for the bridge. If he went in and landed and was\nlost, then the League might never know in time. If he went in and\nstirred up trouble....\nThe thought in his mind was scattered suddenly, like a mist blown away.\nA voice was speaking in his mind, a deep calm voice that seemed to say:\n\"\nGreetings. Do not be alarmed. We do not wish you to be alarmed. Our\ndesire is only to serve....\n\"\n\"Greetings, it said! Greetings!\" Ball was mumbling incredulously\nthrough shocked lips.\nEveryone on the ship had heard the voice. When it spoke again, Steffens\nwas not sure whether it was just one voice or many voices.\n\"We await your coming,\" it said gravely, and repeated: \"Our desire is\nonly to serve.\"\nAnd then the robots sent a\npicture\n.\nAs perfect and as clear as a tridim movie, a rectangular plate took\nshape in Steffens' mind. On the face of the plate, standing alone\nagainst a background of red-brown, bare rocks, was one of the robots.\nWith slow, perfect movement, the robot carefully lifted one of the\nhanging arms of its side, of its\nright\nside, and extended it toward\nSteffens, a graciously offered hand.\nSteffens felt a peculiar, compelling urge to take the hand, realized\nright away that the urge to take the hand was not entirely his. The\nrobot mind had helped.\nWhen the picture vanished, he knew that the others had seen it. He\nwaited for a while; there was no further contact, but the feeling of\nthe robot's urging was still strong within him. He had an idea that, if\nthey wanted to, the robots could control his mind. So when nothing more\nhappened, he began to lose his fear.\nWhile the crew watched in fascination, Steffens tried to talk back.\nHe concentrated hard on what he was saying, said it aloud for good\nmeasure, then held his own hand extended in the robot manner of shaking\nhands.\n\"Greetings,\" he said, because it was what\nthey\nhad said, and\nexplained: \"We have come from the stars.\"\nIt was overly dramatic, but so was the whole situation. He wondered\nbaffledly if he should have let the Alien Contact crew handle it. Order\nsomeone to stand there, feeling like a fool, and\nthink\na message?\nNo, it was his responsibility; he had to go on:\n\"We request\u2014we respectfully request permission to land upon your\nplanet.\"\nSteffens had not realized that there were so many.\nThey had been gathering since his ship was first seen, and now there\nwere hundreds of them clustered upon the hill. Others were arriving\neven as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with\nfantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety.\nMost of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal.\nOthers threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none\ntouched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.\nOne of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now\nsaw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black\nthing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture.\nSteffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through\nthe glove of his suit.\n\"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now\nSteffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was\nless friendly now, less\u2014Steffens could not understand\u2014somehow less\ninterested\n, as if the robot had been\u2014expecting someone else.\n\"Thank you,\" Steffens said. \"We are deeply grateful for your permission\nto land.\"\n\"Our desire,\" the robot repeated mechanically, \"is only to serve.\"\nSuddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He\ntried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they\nshould\nseem inhuman. But....\n\"Will the others come down?\" asked the robot, still mechanically.\nSteffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above,\njets throbbing gently.\n\"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the\nrobot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his\nmind, there was no need to ask.\nFor a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense\nand uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was\nobviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men\nto come on out of the skiff.\nThey came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard\nthe one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.\n\"We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is\nour\u2014custom\u2014not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we\nobserved that you were in ignorance of our real\u2014nature\u2014and were about\nto leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you\nmight base your decision upon sufficient data.\"\nSteffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.\n\"We perceive,\" the robot went on, \"that you are unaware of our complete\naccess to your mind, and would perhaps be\u2014dismayed\u2014to learn that\nwe have been gathering information from you. We must\u2014apologize.\nOur only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only\nthat information was taken which is necessary for communication\nand\u2014understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your\nrequest.\"\nSteffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed\nas violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he\nretreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.\nThe robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way\ndifferent from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots\nwas immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens\nguessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake,\nbecause they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The\npicture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen,\nhad probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and\nthe others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary\nlapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed\nalmost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to\nexamine the first robot in detail.\nIt was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen.\nThe most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of\nthe head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the\nmetal chest. Symbols in row upon row\u2014numbers, perhaps\u2014were upon the\nchest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued\nin orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the\nbase of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was\na remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on\nthe nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude\nthat the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at\nthat, although the answer seemed illogical.\nIt wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the\nsymbols again. And only then did he realized what they were.\nAfter a while, convinced that there was no danger, Steffens had the\nship brought down. When the crew came out of the airlock, they were met\nby the robots, and each man found himself with a robot at his side,\nhumbly requesting to be of service. There were literally thousands of\nthe robots now, come from all over the barren horizon. The mass of them\nstood apart, immobile on a plain near the ship, glinting in the sun\nlike a vast, metallic field of black wheat.\nThe robots had obviously been built to serve. Steffens began to\nfeel\ntheir pleasure, to sense it in spite of the blank, expressionless\nfaces. They were almost like children in their eagerness, yet they were\nstill reserved. Whoever had built them, Steffens thought in wonder, had\nbuilt them well.\nBall came to join Steffens, staring at the robots through the clear\nplastic of his helmet with baffledly widened eyes. A robot moved out\nfrom the mass in the field, allied itself to him. The first to speak\nhad remained with Steffens.\nRealizing that the robot could hear every word he was saying, Ball\nwas for a while apprehensive. But the sheer unreality of standing and\ntalking with a multi-limbed, intelligent hunk of dead metal upon the\nbare rock of a dead, ancient world, the unreality of it slowly died.\nIt was impossible not to like the things. There was something in their\nvery lines which was pleasant and relaxing.\nTheir builders, Steffens thought, had probably thought of that, too.\n\"There's no harm in them,\" said Ball at last, openly, not minding if\nthe robots heard. \"They seem actually glad we're here. My God, whoever\nheard of a robot being glad?\"\nSteffens, embarrassed, spoke quickly to the nearest mechanical: \"I hope\nyou will forgive us our curiosity, but\u2014yours is a remarkable race. We\nhave never before made contact with a race like yours.\" It was said\nhaltingly, but it was the best he could do.\nThe robot made a singularly human nodding motion of its head.\n\"I perceive that the nature of our construction is unfamiliar to you.\nYour question is whether or not we are entirely 'mechanical.' I am\nnot exactly certain as to what the word 'mechanical' is intended to\nconvey\u2014I would have to examine your thought more fully\u2014but I believe\nthat there is fundamental similarity between our structures.\"\nThe robot paused. Steffens had a distinct impression that it was\ndisconcerted.\n\"I must tell you,\" the thing went on, \"that we ourselves are\u2014curious.\"\nIt stopped suddenly, struggling with a word it could not comprehend.\nSteffens waited, listening with absolute interest. It said at length:\n\"We know of only two types of living structure. Ours, which is largely\nmetallic, and that of the\nMakers\n, which would appear to be somewhat\nmore like yours. I am not a\u2014doctor\u2014and therefore cannot acquaint you\nwith the specific details of the Makers' composition, but if you are\ninterested I will have a doctor brought forward. It will be glad to be\nof assistance.\"\nIt was Steffens' turn to struggle, and the robot waited patiently while\nBall and the second robot looked on in silence. The Makers, obviously,\nwere whoever or whatever had built the robots, and the \"doctors,\"\nSteffens decided, were probably just that\u2014doctor-robots, designed\nspecifically to care for the apparently flesh-bodies of the Makers.\nThe efficiency of the things continued to amaze him, but the question\nhe had been waiting to ask came out now with a rush:\n\"Can you tell us where the Makers are?\"\nBoth robots stood motionless. It occurred to Steffens that he couldn't\nreally be sure which was speaking. The voice that came to him spoke\nwith difficulty.\n\"The Makers\u2014are not here.\"\nSteffens stared in puzzlement. The robot detected his confusion and\nwent on:\n\"The Makers have gone away. They have been gone for a very long time.\"\nCould that be\npain\nin its voice, Steffens wondered, and then the\nspectre of the ruined cities rose harsh in his mind.\nWar. The Makers had all been killed in that war. And these had not been\nkilled.\nHe tried to grasp it, but he couldn't. There were robots here in the\nmidst of a radiation so lethal that\nnothing\n,\nnothing\ncould live;\nrobots on a dead planet, living in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide.\nThe carbon dioxide brought him up sharp.\nIf there had been life here once, there would have been plant life as\nwell, and therefore oxygen. If the war had been so long ago that the\nfree oxygen had since gone out of the atmosphere\u2014good God, how old\nwere the robots? Steffens looked at Ball, then at the silent robots,\nthen out across the field to where the rest of them stood. The black\nwheat. Steffens felt a deep chill.\nWere they immortal?\n\"Would you like to see a doctor?\"\nSteffens jumped at the familiar words, then realized to what the robot\nwas referring.\n\"No, not yet,\" he said, \"thank you.\" He swallowed hard as the robots\ncontinued waiting patiently.\n\"Could you tell me,\" he said at last, \"how old you are? Individually?\"\n\"By your reckoning,\" said his robot, and paused to make the\ncalculation, \"I am forty-four years, seven months, and eighteen days of\nage, with ten years and approximately nine months yet to be alive.\"\nSteffens tried to understand that.\n\"It would perhaps simplify our conversations,\" said the robot, \"if\nyou were to refer to me by a name, as is your custom. Using the\nfirst\u2014letters\u2014of my designation, my name would translate as Elb.\"\n\"Glad to meet you,\" Steffens mumbled.\n\"You are called 'Stef,'\" said the robot obligingly. Then it added,\npointing an arm at the robot near Ball: \"The age of\u2014Peb\u2014is seventeen\nyears, one month and four days. Peb has therefore remaining some\nthirty-eight years.\"\nSteffens was trying to keep up. Then the life span was obviously about\nfifty-five years. But the cities, and the carbon dioxide? The robot,\nElb, had said that the Makers were similar to him, and therefore oxygen\nand plant life would have been needed. Unless\u2014\nHe remembered the buildings on Tyban IV.\nUnless the Makers had not come from this planet at all.\nHis mind helplessly began to revolve. It was Ball who restored order.\n\"Do you build yourselves?\" the exec asked.\nPeb answered quickly, that faint note of happiness again apparent, as\nif the robot was glad for the opportunity of answering.\n\"No, we do not build ourselves. We are made by the\u2014\" another pause for\na word\u2014\"by the\nFactory\n.\"\n\"The Factory?\"\n\"Yes. It was built by the Makers. Would you care to see it?\"\nBoth of the Earthmen nodded dumbly.\n\"Would you prefer to use your\u2014skiff? It is quite a long way from here.\"\nIt was indeed a long way, even by skiff. Some of the Aliencon crew went\nalong with them. And near the edge of the twilight zone, on the other\nside of the world, they saw the Factory outlined in the dim light of\ndusk. A huge, fantastic block, wrought of gray and cloudy metal, lay in\na valley between two worn mountains. Steffens went down low, circling\nin the skiff, stared in awe at the size of the building. Robots moved\noutside the thing, little black bugs in the distance\u2014moving around\ntheir birthplace.\nThe Earthmen remained for several weeks. During that time, Steffens was\nusually with Elb, talking now as often as he listened, and the Aliencon\nteam roamed the planet freely, investigating what was certainly the\nstrangest culture in history. There was still the mystery of those\nbuildings on Tyban IV; that, as well as the robots' origin, would have\nto be cleared up before they could leave.\nSurprisingly, Steffens did not think about the future. Whenever he came\nnear a robot, he sensed such a general, comfortable air of good feeling\nthat it warmed him, and he was so preoccupied with watching the robots\nthat he did little thinking.\nSomething he had not realized at the beginning was that he was as\nunusual to the robots as they were to him. It came to him with a great\nshock that not one of the robots had ever seen a living thing. Not a\nbug, a worm, a leaf. They did not know what flesh was. Only the doctors\nknew that, and none of them could readily understand what was meant by\nthe words \"organic matter.\" It had taken them some time to recognize\nthat the Earthmen wore suits which were not parts of their bodies, and\nit was even more difficult for them to understand why the suits were\nneeded.\nBut when they did understand, the robots did a surprising thing.\nAt first, because of the excessive radiation, none of the Earthmen\ncould remain outside the ship for long, even in radiation suits. And\none morning, when Steffens came out of the ship, it was to discover\nthat hundreds of the robots, working through the night, had effectively\ndecontaminated the entire area.\nIt was at this point that Steffens asked how many robots there were.\nHe learned to his amazement that there were more than nine million.\nThe great mass of them had politely remained a great distance from the\nship, spread out over the planet, since they were highly radioactive.\nSteffens, meanwhile, courteously allowed Elb to probe into his mind.\nThe robot extracted all the knowledge of matter that Steffens held,\npondered over the knowledge and tried to digest it, and passed it on to\nthe other robots. Steffens, in turn, had a difficult time picturing the\nmind of a thing that had never known life.\nHe had a vague idea of the robot's history\u2014more, perhaps, then they\nknew themselves\u2014but he refrained from forming an opinion until\nAliencon made its report. What fascinated him was Elb's amazing\nphilosophy, the only outlook, really, that the robot could have had.\n\"What do you\ndo\n?\" Steffens asked.\nElb replied quickly, with characteristic simplicity: \"We can do very\nlittle. A certain amount of physical knowledge was imparted to us at\nbirth by the Makers. We spend the main part of our time expanding that\nknowledge wherever possible. We have made some progress in the natural\nsciences, and some in mathematics. Our purpose in being, you see, is\nto serve the Makers. Any ability we can acquire will make us that much\nmore fit to serve when the Makers return.\"\n\"When they return?\" It had not occurred to Steffens until now that the\nrobots expected the Makers to do so.\nElb regarded him out of the band of the circling eye. \"I see you had\nsurmised that the Makers were not coming back.\"\nIf the robot could have laughed, Steffens thought it would have, then.\nBut it just stood there, motionless, its tone politely emphatic.\n\"It has always been our belief that the Makers would return. Why else\nwould we have been built?\"\nSteffens thought the robot would go on, but it didn't. The question, to\nElb, was no question at all.\nAlthough Steffens knew already what the robot could not possibly have\nknown\u2014that the Makers were gone and would never come back\u2014he was a\nlong time understanding. What he did was push this speculation into the\nback of his mind, to keep it from Elb. He had no desire to destroy a\nfaith.\nBut it created a problem in him. He had begun to picture for Elb the\nstructure of human society, and the robot\u2014a machine which did not eat\nor sleep\u2014listened gravely and tried to understand. One day Steffens\nmentioned God.\n\"God?\" the robot repeated without comprehension. \"What is God?\"\nSteffens explained briefly, and the robot answered:\n\"It is a matter which has troubled us. We thought at first that you\nwere the Makers returning\u2014\" Steffens remembered the brief lapse, the\nseeming disappointment he had sensed\u2014\"but then we probed your minds\nand found that you were not, that you were another kind of being,\nunlike either the Makers or ourselves. You were not even\u2014\" Elb caught\nhimself\u2014\"you did not happen to be telepaths. Therefore we troubled\nover who made you. We did detect the word 'Maker' in your theology,\nbut it seemed to have a peculiar\u2014\" Elb paused for a long while\u2014\"an\nuntouchable, intangible meaning which varies among you.\"\nSteffens understood. He nodded.\nThe Makers were the robots' God, were all the God they needed. The\nMakers had built them, the planet, the universe. If he were to ask them\nwho made the Makers, it would be like their asking him who made God.\nIt was an ironic parallel, and he smiled to himself.\nBut on that planet, it was the last time he smiled.\n", "summary": "The story begins with the executive officer of the Mapping Command, Steffens, and his executive officer, Lieutenant Ball, discussing the history of the planet. They are discussing the fact that the planet is old, and that there are no buildings on it, only a few buildings. They discuss the fact of the wind-swept rock foundation, and the fact there is no airlocks. They also discuss the amount of time that has passed since the planet was last inhabited. They decide to set up camp, and they are going to dig a camp. They have no idea how long ago the planet has been inhabited, but they estimate that it has been at least ten thousand years. They begin digging, and are surprised to find that there is a lot of sand on the ground. They dig a path through the sand to reach the buildings, and when they reach the top of the hill, they see a group of people. They realize that they are the same people that built the buildings. The group is made up of people from different planets, and it is unclear how long they have been on the planet, but it is assumed that they have lived there for at least 10,000 years. The men are in a hurry to find a way to defend the planet from the hostile invaders, and Steffen and Ball decide to use the men as bait to lure the invaders to come in and capture them. They use the people as bait, and once they have captured the invaders, they will use them as bait. They take the men back to the ship, and use them to lure them to the planet to destroy it. They then return to the surface.   The story ends with the two men discussing their findings.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}

Finding\none worth living for is the genuine problem!\nIn the region of the Coal Sack Nebula, on the dead fourth planet of\na star called Tyban, Captain Steffens of the Mapping Command stood\ncounting buildings. Eleven. No, twelve. He wondered if there was any\nsignificance in the number. He had no idea.\n\"What do you make of it?\" he asked.\nLieutenant Ball, the executive officer of the ship, almost tried to\nscratch his head before he remembered that he was wearing a spacesuit.\n\"Looks like a temporary camp,\" Ball said. \"Very few buildings, and all\nbuilt out of native materials, the only stuff available. Castaways,\nmaybe?\"\nSteffens was silent as he walked up onto the rise. The flat weathered\nstone jutted out of the sand before him.\n\"No inscriptions,\" he pointed out.\n\"They would have been worn away. See the wind grooves? Anyway, there's\nnot another building on the whole damn planet. You wouldn't call it\nmuch of a civilization.\"\n\"You don't think these are native?\"\nBall said he didn't. Steffens nodded.\nStanding there and gazing at the stone, Steffens felt the awe of great\nage. He had a hunch, deep and intuitive, that this was old\u2014\ntoo\nold.\nHe reached out a gloved hand, ran it gently over the smooth stone\nridges of the wall. Although the atmosphere was very thin, he noticed\nthat the buildings had no airlocks.\nBall's voice sounded in his helmet: \"Want to set up shop, Skipper?\"\nSteffens paused. \"All right, if you think it will do any good.\"\n\"You never can tell. Excavation probably won't be much use. These\nthings are on a raised rock foundation, swept clean by the wind. And\nyou can see that the rock itself is native\u2014\" he indicated the ledge\nbeneath their feet\u2014\"and was cut out a long while back.\"\n\"How long?\"\nBall toed the sand uncomfortably. \"I wouldn't like to say off-hand.\"\n\"Make a rough estimate.\"\nBall looked at the captain, knowing what was in his mind. He smiled\nwryly and said: \"Five thousand years? Ten thousand? I don't know.\"\nSteffens whistled.\nBall pointed again at the wall. \"Look at the striations. You can tell\nfrom that alone. It would take even a brisk Earth wind\nat least\nseveral thousand years to cut that deep, and the wind here has only a\nfraction of that force.\"\nThe two men stood for a long moment in silence. Man had been in\ninterstellar space for three hundred years and this was the first\nuncovered evidence of an advanced, space-crossing, alien race. It was\nan historic moment, but neither of them was thinking about history.\nMan had been in space for only three hundred years. Whatever had built\nthese had been in space for thousands of years.\nWhich ought to give\nthem\n, thought Steffens uncomfortably, one hell of\na good head-start.\nWhile the excav crew worked steadily, turning up nothing, Steffens\nremained alone among the buildings. Ball came out to him, looked dryly\nat the walls.\n\"Well,\" he said, \"whoever they were, we haven't heard from them since.\"\n\"No? How can you be sure?\" Steffens grunted. \"A space-borne race was\nroaming this part of the Galaxy while men were still pitching spears\nat each other,\nthat\nlong ago. And this planet is only a parsec from\nVarius II, a civilization as old as Earth's. Did whoever built these\nget to Varius? Or did they get to Earth? How can you know?\"\nHe kicked at the sand distractedly. \"And most important, where are they\nnow? A race with several thousand years....\"\n\"Fifteen thousand,\" Ball said. When Steffens looked up, he added:\n\"That's what the geology boys say. Fifteen thousand, at the least.\"\nSteffens turned to stare unhappily at the buildings. When he realized\nnow how really old they were, a sudden thought struck him.\n\"But why buildings? Why did they have to build in stone, to last?\nThere's something wrong with that. They shouldn't have had a need\nto build, unless they were castaways. And castaways would have left\nsomething\nbehind. The only reason they would need a camp would be\u2014\"\n\"If the ship left and some of them stayed.\"\nSteffens nodded. \"But then the ship must have come back. Where did it\ngo?\" He ceased kicking at the sand and looked up into the blue-black\nmidday sky. \"We'll never know.\"\n\"How about the other planets?\" Ball asked.\n\"The report was negative. Inner too hot, outer too heavy and cold. The\nthird planet is the only one with a decent temperature range, but\nit\nhas a CO\n  2\n  atmosphere.\"\n\"How about moons?\"\nSteffens shrugged. \"We could try them and find out.\"\nThe third planet was a blank, gleaming ball until they were in close,\nand then the blankness resolved into folds and piling clouds and dimly,\nin places, the surface showed through. The ship went down through the\nclouds, falling the last few miles on her brakers. They came into the\nmisty gas below, leveled off and moved along the edge of the twilight\nzone.\nThe moons of this solar system had yielded nothing. The third planet, a\nhot, heavy world which had no free oxygen and from which the monitors\nhad detected nothing, was all that was left. Steffens expected nothing,\nbut he had to try.\nAt a height of several miles, the ship moved up the zone, scanning,\nmoving in the familiar slow spiral of the Mapping Command. Faint dark\noutlines of bare rocks and hills moved by below.\nSteffens turned the screen to full magnification and watched silently.\nAfter a while he saw a city.\nThe main screen being on, the whole crew saw it. Someone shouted and\nthey stopped to stare, and Steffens was about to call for altitude when\nhe saw that the city was dead.\nHe looked down on splintered walls that were like cloudy glass pieces\nrising above a plain, rising in a shattered circle. Near the center\nof the city, there was a huge, charred hole at least three miles in\ndiameter and very deep. In all the piled rubble, nothing moved.\nSteffens went down low to make sure, then brought the ship around and\nheaded out across the main continent into the bright area of the sun.\nThe rocks rolled by below, there was no vegetation at all, and then\nthere were more cities\u2014all with the black depression, the circular\nstamp that blotted away and fused the buildings into nothing.\nNo one on the ship had anything to say. None had ever seen a war, for\nthere had not been war on Earth or near it for more than three hundred\nyears.\nThe ship circled around to the dark side of the planet. When they were\ndown below a mile, the radiation counters began to react. It became\napparent, from the dials, that there could be nothing alive.\nAfter a while Ball said: \"Well, which do you figure? Did our friends\nfrom the fourth planet do this, or were they the same people as these?\"\nSteffens did not take his eyes from the screen. They were coming around\nto the daylight side.\n\"We'll go down and look for the answer,\" he said. \"Break out the\nradiation suits.\"\nHe paused, thinking. If the ones on the fourth planet were alien to\nthis world, they were from outer space, could not have come from one\nof the other planets here. They had starships and were warlike. Then,\nthousands of years ago. He began to realize how important it really was\nthat Ball's question be answered.\nWhen the ship had gone very low, looking for a landing site, Steffens\nwas still by the screen. It was Steffens, then, who saw the thing move.\nDown far below, it had been a still black shadow, and then it moved.\nSteffens froze. And he knew, even at that distance, that it was a robot.\nTiny and black, a mass of hanging arms and legs, the thing went gliding\ndown the slope of a hill. Steffens saw it clearly for a full second,\nsaw the dull ball of its head tilt upward as the ship came over, and\nthen the hill was past.\nQuickly Steffens called for height. The ship bucked beneath him and\nblasted straight up; some of the crew went crashing to the deck.\nSteffens remained by the screen, increasing the magnification as the\nship drew away. And he saw another, then two, then a black gliding\ngroup, all matched with bunches of hanging arms.\nNothing alive but robots, he thought,\nrobots\n. He adjusted to full\nclose up as quickly as he could and the picture focused on the screen.\nBehind him he heard a crewman grunt in amazement.\nA band of clear, plasticlike stuff ran round the head\u2014it would be the\neye, a band of eye that saw all ways. On the top of the head was a\nsingle round spot of the plastic, and the rest was black metal, joined,\nhe realized, with fantastic perfection. The angle of sight was now\nalmost perpendicular. He could see very little of the branching arms of\nthe trunk, but what had been on the screen was enough. They were the\nmost perfect robots he had ever seen.\nThe ship leveled off. Steffens had no idea what to do; the sudden sight\nof the moving things had unnerved him. He had already sounded the\nalert, flicked out the defense screens. Now he had nothing to do. He\ntried to concentrate on what the League Law would have him do.\nThe Law was no help. Contact with planet-bound races was forbidden\nunder any circumstances. But could a bunch of robots be called a race?\nThe Law said nothing about robots because Earthmen had none. The\nbuilding of imaginative robots was expressly forbidden. But at any\nrate, Steffens thought, he had made contact already.\nWhile Steffens stood by the screen, completely bewildered for the first\ntime in his space career, Lieutenant Ball came up, hobbling slightly.\nFrom the bright new bruise on his cheek, Steffens guessed that the\nsudden climb had caught him unaware. The exec was pale with surprise.\n\"What were they?\" he said blankly. \"Lord, they looked like robots!\"\n\"They were.\"\nBall stared confoundedly at the screen. The things were now a confusion\nof dots in the mist.\n\"Almost humanoid,\" Steffens said, \"but not quite.\"\nBall was slowly absorbing the situation. He turned to gaze inquiringly\nat Steffens.\n\"Well, what do we do now?\"\nSteffens shrugged. \"They saw us. We could leave now and let them quite\npossibly make a ... a legend out of our visit, or we could go down and\nsee if they tie in with the buildings on Tyban IV.\"\n\"\nCan\nwe go down?\"\n\"Legally? I don't know. If they are robots, yes, since robots cannot\nconstitute a race. But there's another possibility.\" He tapped his\nfingers on the screen confusedly. \"They don't have to be robots at all.\nThey could be the natives.\"\nBall gulped. \"I don't follow you.\"\n\"They could be the original inhabitants of this planet\u2014the brains of\nthem, at least, protected in radiation-proof metal. Anyway,\" he added,\n\"they're the most perfect mechanicals I've ever seen.\"\nBall shook his head, sat down abruptly. Steffens turned from the\nscreen, strode nervously across the Main Deck, thinking.\nThe Mapping Command, they called it. Theoretically, all he was supposed\nto do was make a closeup examination of unexplored systems, checking\nfor the presence of life-forms as well as for the possibilities of\nhuman colonization. Make a check and nothing else. But he knew very\nclearly that if he returned to Sirius base without investigating this\nrobot situation, he could very well be court-martialed one way or the\nother, either for breaking the Law of Contact or for dereliction of\nduty.\nAnd there was also the possibility, which abruptly occurred to him,\nthat the robots might well be prepared to blow his ship to hell and\ngone.\nHe stopped in the center of the deck. A whole new line of thought\nopened up. If the robots were armed and ready ... could this be an\noutpost?\nAn outpost!\nHe turned and raced for the bridge. If he went in and landed and was\nlost, then the League might never know in time. If he went in and\nstirred up trouble....\nThe thought in his mind was scattered suddenly, like a mist blown away.\nA voice was speaking in his mind, a deep calm voice that seemed to say:\n\"\nGreetings. Do not be alarmed. We do not wish you to be alarmed. Our\ndesire is only to serve....\n\"\n\"Greetings, it said! Greetings!\" Ball was mumbling incredulously\nthrough shocked lips.\nEveryone on the ship had heard the voice. When it spoke again, Steffens\nwas not sure whether it was just one voice or many voices.\n\"We await your coming,\" it said gravely, and repeated: \"Our desire is\nonly to serve.\"\nAnd then the robots sent a\npicture\n.\nAs perfect and as clear as a tridim movie, a rectangular plate took\nshape in Steffens' mind. On the face of the plate, standing alone\nagainst a background of red-brown, bare rocks, was one of the robots.\nWith slow, perfect movement, the robot carefully lifted one of the\nhanging arms of its side, of its\nright\nside, and extended it toward\nSteffens, a graciously offered hand.\nSteffens felt a peculiar, compelling urge to take the hand, realized\nright away that the urge to take the hand was not entirely his. The\nrobot mind had helped.\nWhen the picture vanished, he knew that the others had seen it. He\nwaited for a while; there was no further contact, but the feeling of\nthe robot's urging was still strong within him. He had an idea that, if\nthey wanted to, the robots could control his mind. So when nothing more\nhappened, he began to lose his fear.\nWhile the crew watched in fascination, Steffens tried to talk back.\nHe concentrated hard on what he was saying, said it aloud for good\nmeasure, then held his own hand extended in the robot manner of shaking\nhands.\n\"Greetings,\" he said, because it was what\nthey\nhad said, and\nexplained: \"We have come from the stars.\"\nIt was overly dramatic, but so was the whole situation. He wondered\nbaffledly if he should have let the Alien Contact crew handle it. Order\nsomeone to stand there, feeling like a fool, and\nthink\na message?\nNo, it was his responsibility; he had to go on:\n\"We request\u2014we respectfully request permission to land upon your\nplanet.\"\nSteffens had not realized that there were so many.\nThey had been gathering since his ship was first seen, and now there\nwere hundreds of them clustered upon the hill. Others were arriving\neven as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with\nfantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety.\nMost of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal.\nOthers threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none\ntouched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.\nOne of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now\nsaw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black\nthing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture.\nSteffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through\nthe glove of his suit.\n\"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now\nSteffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was\nless friendly now, less\u2014Steffens could not understand\u2014somehow less\ninterested\n, as if the robot had been\u2014expecting someone else.\n\"Thank you,\" Steffens said. \"We are deeply grateful for your permission\nto land.\"\n\"Our desire,\" the robot repeated mechanically, \"is only to serve.\"\nSuddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He\ntried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they\nshould\nseem inhuman. But....\n\"Will the others come down?\" asked the robot, still mechanically.\nSteffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above,\njets throbbing gently.\n\"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the\nrobot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his\nmind, there was no need to ask.\nFor a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense\nand uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was\nobviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men\nto come on out of the skiff.\nThey came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard\nthe one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.\n\"We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is\nour\u2014custom\u2014not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we\nobserved that you were in ignorance of our real\u2014nature\u2014and were about\nto leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you\nmight base your decision upon sufficient data.\"\nSteffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.\n\"We perceive,\" the robot went on, \"that you are unaware of our complete\naccess to your mind, and would perhaps be\u2014dismayed\u2014to learn that\nwe have been gathering information from you. We must\u2014apologize.\nOur only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only\nthat information was taken which is necessary for communication\nand\u2014understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your\nrequest.\"\nSteffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed\nas violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he\nretreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.\nThe robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way\ndifferent from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots\nwas immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens\nguessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake,\nbecause they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The\npicture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen,\nhad probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and\nthe others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary\nlapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed\nalmost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to\nexamine the first robot in detail.\nIt was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen.\nThe most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of\nthe head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the\nmetal chest. Symbols in row upon row\u2014numbers, perhaps\u2014were upon the\nchest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued\nin orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the\nbase of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was\na remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on\nthe nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude\nthat the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at\nthat, although the answer seemed illogical.\nIt wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the\nsymbols again. And only then did he realized what they were.\nAfter a while, convinced that there was no danger, Steffens had the\nship brought down. When the crew came out of the airlock, they were met\nby the robots, and each man found himself with a robot at his side,\nhumbly requesting to be of service. There were literally thousands of\nthe robots now, come from all over the barren horizon. The mass of them\nstood apart, immobile on a plain near the ship, glinting in the sun\nlike a vast, metallic field of black wheat.\nThe robots had obviously been built to serve. Steffens began to\nfeel\ntheir pleasure, to sense it in spite of the blank, expressionless\nfaces. They were almost like children in their eagerness, yet they were\nstill reserved. Whoever had built them, Steffens thought in wonder, had\nbuilt them well.\nBall came to join Steffens, staring at the robots through the clear\nplastic of his helmet with baffledly widened eyes. A robot moved out\nfrom the mass in the field, allied itself to him. The first to speak\nhad remained with Steffens.\nRealizing that the robot could hear every word he was saying, Ball\nwas for a while apprehensive. But the sheer unreality of standing and\ntalking with a multi-limbed, intelligent hunk of dead metal upon the\nbare rock of a dead, ancient world, the unreality of it slowly died.\nIt was impossible not to like the things. There was something in their\nvery lines which was pleasant and relaxing.\nTheir builders, Steffens thought, had probably thought of that, too.\n\"There's no harm in them,\" said Ball at last, openly, not minding if\nthe robots heard. \"They seem actually glad we're here. My God, whoever\nheard of a robot being glad?\"\nSteffens, embarrassed, spoke quickly to the nearest mechanical: \"I hope\nyou will forgive us our curiosity, but\u2014yours is a remarkable race. We\nhave never before made contact with a race like yours.\" It was said\nhaltingly, but it was the best he could do.\nThe robot made a singularly human nodding motion of its head.\n\"I perceive that the nature of our construction is unfamiliar to you.\nYour question is whether or not we are entirely 'mechanical.' I am\nnot exactly certain as to what the word 'mechanical' is intended to\nconvey\u2014I would have to examine your thought more fully\u2014but I believe\nthat there is fundamental similarity between our structures.\"\nThe robot paused. Steffens had a distinct impression that it was\ndisconcerted.\n\"I must tell you,\" the thing went on, \"that we ourselves are\u2014curious.\"\nIt stopped suddenly, struggling with a word it could not comprehend.\nSteffens waited, listening with absolute interest. It said at length:\n\"We know of only two types of living structure. Ours, which is largely\nmetallic, and that of the\nMakers\n, which would appear to be somewhat\nmore like yours. I am not a\u2014doctor\u2014and therefore cannot acquaint you\nwith the specific details of the Makers' composition, but if you are\ninterested I will have a doctor brought forward. It will be glad to be\nof assistance.\"\nIt was Steffens' turn to struggle, and the robot waited patiently while\nBall and the second robot looked on in silence. The Makers, obviously,\nwere whoever or whatever had built the robots, and the \"doctors,\"\nSteffens decided, were probably just that\u2014doctor-robots, designed\nspecifically to care for the apparently flesh-bodies of the Makers.\nThe efficiency of the things continued to amaze him, but the question\nhe had been waiting to ask came out now with a rush:\n\"Can you tell us where the Makers are?\"\nBoth robots stood motionless. It occurred to Steffens that he couldn't\nreally be sure which was speaking. The voice that came to him spoke\nwith difficulty.\n\"The Makers\u2014are not here.\"\nSteffens stared in puzzlement. The robot detected his confusion and\nwent on:\n\"The Makers have gone away. They have been gone for a very long time.\"\nCould that be\npain\nin its voice, Steffens wondered, and then the\nspectre of the ruined cities rose harsh in his mind.\nWar. The Makers had all been killed in that war. And these had not been\nkilled.\nHe tried to grasp it, but he couldn't. There were robots here in the\nmidst of a radiation so lethal that\nnothing\n,\nnothing\ncould live;\nrobots on a dead planet, living in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide.\nThe carbon dioxide brought him up sharp.\nIf there had been life here once, there would have been plant life as\nwell, and therefore oxygen. If the war had been so long ago that the\nfree oxygen had since gone out of the atmosphere\u2014good God, how old\nwere the robots? Steffens looked at Ball, then at the silent robots,\nthen out across the field to where the rest of them stood. The black\nwheat. Steffens felt a deep chill.\nWere they immortal?\n\"Would you like to see a doctor?\"\nSteffens jumped at the familiar words, then realized to what the robot\nwas referring.\n\"No, not yet,\" he said, \"thank you.\" He swallowed hard as the robots\ncontinued waiting patiently.\n\"Could you tell me,\" he said at last, \"how old you are? Individually?\"\n\"By your reckoning,\" said his robot, and paused to make the\ncalculation, \"I am forty-four years, seven months, and eighteen days of\nage, with ten years and approximately nine months yet to be alive.\"\nSteffens tried to understand that.\n\"It would perhaps simplify our conversations,\" said the robot, \"if\nyou were to refer to me by a name, as is your custom. Using the\nfirst\u2014letters\u2014of my designation, my name would translate as Elb.\"\n\"Glad to meet you,\" Steffens mumbled.\n\"You are called 'Stef,'\" said the robot obligingly. Then it added,\npointing an arm at the robot near Ball: \"The age of\u2014Peb\u2014is seventeen\nyears, one month and four days. Peb has therefore remaining some\nthirty-eight years.\"\nSteffens was trying to keep up. Then the life span was obviously about\nfifty-five years. But the cities, and the carbon dioxide? The robot,\nElb, had said that the Makers were similar to him, and therefore oxygen\nand plant life would have been needed. Unless\u2014\nHe remembered the buildings on Tyban IV.\nUnless the Makers had not come from this planet at all.\nHis mind helplessly began to revolve. It was Ball who restored order.\n\"Do you build yourselves?\" the exec asked.\nPeb answered quickly, that faint note of happiness again apparent, as\nif the robot was glad for the opportunity of answering.\n\"No, we do not build ourselves. We are made by the\u2014\" another pause for\na word\u2014\"by the\nFactory\n.\"\n\"The Factory?\"\n\"Yes. It was built by the Makers. Would you care to see it?\"\nBoth of the Earthmen nodded dumbly.\n\"Would you prefer to use your\u2014skiff? It is quite a long way from here.\"\nIt was indeed a long way, even by skiff. Some of the Aliencon crew went\nalong with them. And near the edge of the twilight zone, on the other\nside of the world, they saw the Factory outlined in the dim light of\ndusk. A huge, fantastic block, wrought of gray and cloudy metal, lay in\na valley between two worn mountains. Steffens went down low, circling\nin the skiff, stared in awe at the size of the building. Robots moved\noutside the thing, little black bugs in the distance\u2014moving around\ntheir birthplace.\nThe Earthmen remained for several weeks. During that time, Steffens was\nusually with Elb, talking now as often as he listened, and the Aliencon\nteam roamed the planet freely, investigating what was certainly the\nstrangest culture in history. There was still the mystery of those\nbuildings on Tyban IV; that, as well as the robots' origin, would have\nto be cleared up before they could leave.\nSurprisingly, Steffens did not think about the future. Whenever he came\nnear a robot, he sensed such a general, comfortable air of good feeling\nthat it warmed him, and he was so preoccupied with watching the robots\nthat he did little thinking.\nSomething he had not realized at the beginning was that he was as\nunusual to the robots as they were to him. It came to him with a great\nshock that not one of the robots had ever seen a living thing. Not a\nbug, a worm, a leaf. They did not know what flesh was. Only the doctors\nknew that, and none of them could readily understand what was meant by\nthe words \"organic matter.\" It had taken them some time to recognize\nthat the Earthmen wore suits which were not parts of their bodies, and\nit was even more difficult for them to understand why the suits were\nneeded.\nBut when they did understand, the robots did a surprising thing.\nAt first, because of the excessive radiation, none of the Earthmen\ncould remain outside the ship for long, even in radiation suits. And\none morning, when Steffens came out of the ship, it was to discover\nthat hundreds of the robots, working through the night, had effectively\ndecontaminated the entire area.\nIt was at this point that Steffens asked how many robots there were.\nHe learned to his amazement that there were more than nine million.\nThe great mass of them had politely remained a great distance from the\nship, spread out over the planet, since they were highly radioactive.\nSteffens, meanwhile, courteously allowed Elb to probe into his mind.\nThe robot extracted all the knowledge of matter that Steffens held,\npondered over the knowledge and tried to digest it, and passed it on to\nthe other robots. Steffens, in turn, had a difficult time picturing the\nmind of a thing that had never known life.\nHe had a vague idea of the robot's history\u2014more, perhaps, then they\nknew themselves\u2014but he refrained from forming an opinion until\nAliencon made its report. What fascinated him was Elb's amazing\nphilosophy, the only outlook, really, that the robot could have had.\n\"What do you\ndo\n?\" Steffens asked.\nElb replied quickly, with characteristic simplicity: \"We can do very\nlittle. A certain amount of physical knowledge was imparted to us at\nbirth by the Makers. We spend the main part of our time expanding that\nknowledge wherever possible. We have made some progress in the natural\nsciences, and some in mathematics. Our purpose in being, you see, is\nto serve the Makers. Any ability we can acquire will make us that much\nmore fit to serve when the Makers return.\"\n\"When they return?\" It had not occurred to Steffens until now that the\nrobots expected the Makers to do so.\nElb regarded him out of the band of the circling eye. \"I see you had\nsurmised that the Makers were not coming back.\"\nIf the robot could have laughed, Steffens thought it would have, then.\nBut it just stood there, motionless, its tone politely emphatic.\n\"It has always been our belief that the Makers would return. Why else\nwould we have been built?\"\nSteffens thought the robot would go on, but it didn't. The question, to\nElb, was no question at all.\nAlthough Steffens knew already what the robot could not possibly have\nknown\u2014that the Makers were gone and would never come back\u2014he was a\nlong time understanding. What he did was push this speculation into the\nback of his mind, to keep it from Elb. He had no desire to destroy a\nfaith.\nBut it created a problem in him. He had begun to picture for Elb the\nstructure of human society, and the robot\u2014a machine which did not eat\nor sleep\u2014listened gravely and tried to understand. One day Steffens\nmentioned God.\n\"God?\" the robot repeated without comprehension. \"What is God?\"\nSteffens explained briefly, and the robot answered:\n\"It is a matter which has troubled us. We thought at first that you\nwere the Makers returning\u2014\" Steffens remembered the brief lapse, the\nseeming disappointment he had sensed\u2014\"but then we probed your minds\nand found that you were not, that you were another kind of being,\nunlike either the Makers or ourselves. You were not even\u2014\" Elb caught\nhimself\u2014\"you did not happen to be telepaths. Therefore we troubled\nover who made you. We did detect the word 'Maker' in your theology,\nbut it seemed to have a peculiar\u2014\" Elb paused for a long while\u2014\"an\nuntouchable, intangible meaning which varies among you.\"\nSteffens understood. He nodded.\nThe Makers were the robots' God, were all the God they needed. The\nMakers had built them, the planet, the universe. If he were to ask them\nwho made the Makers, it would be like their asking him who made God.\nIt was an ironic parallel, and he smiled to himself.\nBut on that planet, it was the last time he smiled.\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nOrphans of the Void\nBy MICHAEL SHAARA\nIllustrated by EMSH\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nGalaxy Science Fiction June 1952.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nFinding a cause worth dying for is no\ngreat trick\u2014the Universe is full of them. Finding\none worth living for is the genuine problem!\nIn the region of the Coal Sack Nebula, on the dead fourth planet of\na star called Tyban, Captain Steffens of the Mapping Command stood\ncounting buildings. Eleven. No, twelve. He wondered if there was any\nsignificance in the number. He had no idea.\n\"What do you make of it?\" he asked.\nLieutenant Ball, the executive officer of the ship, almost tried to\nscratch his head before he remembered that he was wearing a spacesuit.\n\"Looks like a temporary camp,\" Ball said. \"Very few buildings, and all\nbuilt out of native materials, the only stuff available. Castaways,\nmaybe?\"\nSteffens was silent as he walked up onto the rise. The flat weathered\nstone jutted out of the sand before him.\n\"No inscriptions,\" he pointed out.\n\"They would have been worn away. See the wind grooves? Anyway, there's\nnot another building on the whole damn planet. You wouldn't call it\nmuch of a civilization.\"\n\"You don't think these are native?\"\nBall said he didn't. Steffens nodded.\nStanding there and gazing at the stone, Steffens felt the awe of great\nage. He had a hunch, deep and intuitive, that this was old\u2014\ntoo\nold.\nHe reached out a gloved hand, ran it gently over the smooth stone\nridges of the wall. Although the atmosphere was very thin, he noticed\nthat the buildings had no airlocks.\nBall's voice sounded in his helmet: \"Want to set up shop, Skipper?\"\nSteffens paused. \"All right, if you think it will do any good.\"\n\"You never can tell. Excavation probably won't be much use. These\nthings are on a raised rock foundation, swept clean by the wind. And\nyou can see that the rock itself is native\u2014\" he indicated the ledge\nbeneath their feet\u2014\"and was cut out a long while back.\"\n\"How long?\"\nBall toed the sand uncomfortably. \"I wouldn't like to say off-hand.\"\n\"Make a rough estimate.\"\nBall looked at the captain, knowing what was in his mind. He smiled\nwryly and said: \"Five thousand years? Ten thousand? I don't know.\"\nSteffens whistled.\nBall pointed again at the wall. \"Look at the striations. You can tell\nfrom that alone. It would take even a brisk Earth wind\nat least\nseveral thousand years to cut that deep, and the wind here has only a\nfraction of that force.\"\nThe two men stood for a long moment in silence. Man had been in\ninterstellar space for three hundred years and this was the first\nuncovered evidence of an advanced, space-crossing, alien race. It was\nan historic moment, but neither of them was thinking about history.\nMan had been in space for only three hundred years. Whatever had built\nthese had been in space for thousands of years.\nWhich ought to give\nthem\n, thought Steffens uncomfortably, one hell of\na good head-start.\nWhile the excav crew worked steadily, turning up nothing, Steffens\nremained alone among the buildings. Ball came out to him, looked dryly\nat the walls.\n\"Well,\" he said, \"whoever they were, we haven't heard from them since.\"\n\"No? How can you be sure?\" Steffens grunted. \"A space-borne race was\nroaming this part of the Galaxy while men were still pitching spears\nat each other,\nthat\nlong ago. And this planet is only a parsec from\nVarius II, a civilization as old as Earth's. Did whoever built these\nget to Varius? Or did they get to Earth? How can you know?\"\nHe kicked at the sand distractedly. \"And most important, where are they\nnow? A race with several thousand years....\"\n\"Fifteen thousand,\" Ball said. When Steffens looked up, he added:\n\"That's what the geology boys say. Fifteen thousand, at the least.\"\nSteffens turned to stare unhappily at the buildings. When he realized\nnow how really old they were, a sudden thought struck him.\n\"But why buildings? Why did they have to build in stone, to last?\nThere's something wrong with that. They shouldn't have had a need\nto build, unless they were castaways. And castaways would have left\nsomething\nbehind. The only reason they would need a camp would be\u2014\"\n\"If the ship left and some of them stayed.\"\nSteffens nodded. \"But then the ship must have come back. Where did it\ngo?\" He ceased kicking at the sand and looked up into the blue-black\nmidday sky. \"We'll never know.\"\n\"How about the other planets?\" Ball asked.\n\"The report was negative. Inner too hot, outer too heavy and cold. The\nthird planet is the only one with a decent temperature range, but\nit\nhas a CO\n  2\n  atmosphere.\"\n\"How about moons?\"\nSteffens shrugged. \"We could try them and find out.\"\nThe third planet was a blank, gleaming ball until they were in close,\nand then the blankness resolved into folds and piling clouds and dimly,\nin places, the surface showed through. The ship went down through the\nclouds, falling the last few miles on her brakers. They came into the\nmisty gas below, leveled off and moved along the edge of the twilight\nzone.\nThe moons of this solar system had yielded nothing. The third planet, a\nhot, heavy world which had no free oxygen and from which the monitors\nhad detected nothing, was all that was left. Steffens expected nothing,\nbut he had to try.\nAt a height of several miles, the ship moved up the zone, scanning,\nmoving in the familiar slow spiral of the Mapping Command. Faint dark\noutlines of bare rocks and hills moved by below.\nSteffens turned the screen to full magnification and watched silently.\nAfter a while he saw a city.\nThe main screen being on, the whole crew saw it. Someone shouted and\nthey stopped to stare, and Steffens was about to call for altitude when\nhe saw that the city was dead.\nHe looked down on splintered walls that were like cloudy glass pieces\nrising above a plain, rising in a shattered circle. Near the center\nof the city, there was a huge, charred hole at least three miles in\ndiameter and very deep. In all the piled rubble, nothing moved.\nSteffens went down low to make sure, then brought the ship around and\nheaded out across the main continent into the bright area of the sun.\nThe rocks rolled by below, there was no vegetation at all, and then\nthere were more cities\u2014all with the black depression, the circular\nstamp that blotted away and fused the buildings into nothing.\nNo one on the ship had anything to say. None had ever seen a war, for\nthere had not been war on Earth or near it for more than three hundred\nyears.\nThe ship circled around to the dark side of the planet. When they were\ndown below a mile, the radiation counters began to react. It became\napparent, from the dials, that there could be nothing alive.\nAfter a while Ball said: \"Well, which do you figure? Did our friends\nfrom the fourth planet do this, or were they the same people as these?\"\nSteffens did not take his eyes from the screen. They were coming around\nto the daylight side.\n\"We'll go down and look for the answer,\" he said. \"Break out the\nradiation suits.\"\nHe paused, thinking. If the ones on the fourth planet were alien to\nthis world, they were from outer space, could not have come from one\nof the other planets here. They had starships and were warlike. Then,\nthousands of years ago. He began to realize how important it really was\nthat Ball's question be answered.\nWhen the ship had gone very low, looking for a landing site, Steffens\nwas still by the screen. It was Steffens, then, who saw the thing move.\nDown far below, it had been a still black shadow, and then it moved.\nSteffens froze. And he knew, even at that distance, that it was a robot.\nTiny and black, a mass of hanging arms and legs, the thing went gliding\ndown the slope of a hill. Steffens saw it clearly for a full second,\nsaw the dull ball of its head tilt upward as the ship came over, and\nthen the hill was past.\nQuickly Steffens called for height. The ship bucked beneath him and\nblasted straight up; some of the crew went crashing to the deck.\nSteffens remained by the screen, increasing the magnification as the\nship drew away. And he saw another, then two, then a black gliding\ngroup, all matched with bunches of hanging arms.\nNothing alive but robots, he thought,\nrobots\n. He adjusted to full\nclose up as quickly as he could and the picture focused on the screen.\nBehind him he heard a crewman grunt in amazement.\nA band of clear, plasticlike stuff ran round the head\u2014it would be the\neye, a band of eye that saw all ways. On the top of the head was a\nsingle round spot of the plastic, and the rest was black metal, joined,\nhe realized, with fantastic perfection. The angle of sight was now\nalmost perpendicular. He could see very little of the branching arms of\nthe trunk, but what had been on the screen was enough. They were the\nmost perfect robots he had ever seen.\nThe ship leveled off. Steffens had no idea what to do; the sudden sight\nof the moving things had unnerved him. He had already sounded the\nalert, flicked out the defense screens. Now he had nothing to do. He\ntried to concentrate on what the League Law would have him do.\nThe Law was no help. Contact with planet-bound races was forbidden\nunder any circumstances. But could a bunch of robots be called a race?\nThe Law said nothing about robots because Earthmen had none. The\nbuilding of imaginative robots was expressly forbidden. But at any\nrate, Steffens thought, he had made contact already.\nWhile Steffens stood by the screen, completely bewildered for the first\ntime in his space career, Lieutenant Ball came up, hobbling slightly.\nFrom the bright new bruise on his cheek, Steffens guessed that the\nsudden climb had caught him unaware. The exec was pale with surprise.\n\"What were they?\" he said blankly. \"Lord, they looked like robots!\"\n\"They were.\"\nBall stared confoundedly at the screen. The things were now a confusion\nof dots in the mist.\n\"Almost humanoid,\" Steffens said, \"but not quite.\"\nBall was slowly absorbing the situation. He turned to gaze inquiringly\nat Steffens.\n\"Well, what do we do now?\"\nSteffens shrugged. \"They saw us. We could leave now and let them quite\npossibly make a ... a legend out of our visit, or we could go down and\nsee if they tie in with the buildings on Tyban IV.\"\n\"\nCan\nwe go down?\"\n\"Legally? I don't know. If they are robots, yes, since robots cannot\nconstitute a race. But there's another possibility.\" He tapped his\nfingers on the screen confusedly. \"They don't have to be robots at all.\nThey could be the natives.\"\nBall gulped. \"I don't follow you.\"\n\"They could be the original inhabitants of this planet\u2014the brains of\nthem, at least, protected in radiation-proof metal. Anyway,\" he added,\n\"they're the most perfect mechanicals I've ever seen.\"\nBall shook his head, sat down abruptly. Steffens turned from the\nscreen, strode nervously across the Main Deck, thinking.\nThe Mapping Command, they called it. Theoretically, all he was supposed\nto do was make a closeup examination of unexplored systems, checking\nfor the presence of life-forms as well as for the possibilities of\nhuman colonization. Make a check and nothing else. But he knew very\nclearly that if he returned to Sirius base without investigating this\nrobot situation, he could very well be court-martialed one way or the\nother, either for breaking the Law of Contact or for dereliction of\nduty.\nAnd there was also the possibility, which abruptly occurred to him,\nthat the robots might well be prepared to blow his ship to hell and\ngone.\nHe stopped in the center of the deck. A whole new line of thought\nopened up. If the robots were armed and ready ... could this be an\noutpost?\nAn outpost!\nHe turned and raced for the bridge. If he went in and landed and was\nlost, then the League might never know in time. If he went in and\nstirred up trouble....\nThe thought in his mind was scattered suddenly, like a mist blown away.\nA voice was speaking in his mind, a deep calm voice that seemed to say:\n\"\nGreetings. Do not be alarmed. We do not wish you to be alarmed. Our\ndesire is only to serve....\n\"\n\"Greetings, it said! Greetings!\" Ball was mumbling incredulously\nthrough shocked lips.\nEveryone on the ship had heard the voice. When it spoke again, Steffens\nwas not sure whether it was just one voice or many voices.\n\"We await your coming,\" it said gravely, and repeated: \"Our desire is\nonly to serve.\"\nAnd then the robots sent a\npicture\n.\nAs perfect and as clear as a tridim movie, a rectangular plate took\nshape in Steffens' mind. On the face of the plate, standing alone\nagainst a background of red-brown, bare rocks, was one of the robots.\nWith slow, perfect movement, the robot carefully lifted one of the\nhanging arms of its side, of its\nright\nside, and extended it toward\nSteffens, a graciously offered hand.\nSteffens felt a peculiar, compelling urge to take the hand, realized\nright away that the urge to take the hand was not entirely his. The\nrobot mind had helped.\nWhen the picture vanished, he knew that the others had seen it. He\nwaited for a while; there was no further contact, but the feeling of\nthe robot's urging was still strong within him. He had an idea that, if\nthey wanted to, the robots could control his mind. So when nothing more\nhappened, he began to lose his fear.\nWhile the crew watched in fascination, Steffens tried to talk back.\nHe concentrated hard on what he was saying, said it aloud for good\nmeasure, then held his own hand extended in the robot manner of shaking\nhands.\n\"Greetings,\" he said, because it was what\nthey\nhad said, and\nexplained: \"We have come from the stars.\"\nIt was overly dramatic, but so was the whole situation. He wondered\nbaffledly if he should have let the Alien Contact crew handle it. Order\nsomeone to stand there, feeling like a fool, and\nthink\na message?\nNo, it was his responsibility; he had to go on:\n\"We request\u2014we respectfully request permission to land upon your\nplanet.\"\nSteffens had not realized that there were so many.\nThey had been gathering since his ship was first seen, and now there\nwere hundreds of them clustered upon the hill. Others were arriving\neven as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with\nfantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety.\nMost of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal.\nOthers threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none\ntouched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.\nOne of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now\nsaw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black\nthing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture.\nSteffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through\nthe glove of his suit.\n\"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now\nSteffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was\nless friendly now, less\u2014Steffens could not understand\u2014somehow less\ninterested\n, as if the robot had been\u2014expecting someone else.\n\"Thank you,\" Steffens said. \"We are deeply grateful for your permission\nto land.\"\n\"Our desire,\" the robot repeated mechanically, \"is only to serve.\"\nSuddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He\ntried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they\nshould\nseem inhuman. But....\n\"Will the others come down?\" asked the robot, still mechanically.\nSteffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above,\njets throbbing gently.\n\"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the\nrobot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his\nmind, there was no need to ask.\nFor a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense\nand uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was\nobviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men\nto come on out of the skiff.\nThey came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard\nthe one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.\n\"We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is\nour\u2014custom\u2014not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we\nobserved that you were in ignorance of our real\u2014nature\u2014and were about\nto leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you\nmight base your decision upon sufficient data.\"\nSteffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.\n\"We perceive,\" the robot went on, \"that you are unaware of our complete\naccess to your mind, and would perhaps be\u2014dismayed\u2014to learn that\nwe have been gathering information from you. We must\u2014apologize.\nOur only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only\nthat information was taken which is necessary for communication\nand\u2014understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your\nrequest.\"\nSteffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed\nas violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he\nretreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.\nThe robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way\ndifferent from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots\nwas immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens\nguessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake,\nbecause they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The\npicture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen,\nhad probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and\nthe others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary\nlapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed\nalmost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to\nexamine the first robot in detail.\nIt was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen.\nThe most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of\nthe head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the\nmetal chest. Symbols in row upon row\u2014numbers, perhaps\u2014were upon the\nchest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued\nin orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the\nbase of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was\na remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on\nthe nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude\nthat the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at\nthat, although the answer seemed illogical.\nIt wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the\nsymbols again. And only then did he realized what they were.\nAfter a while, convinced that there was no danger, Steffens had the\nship brought down. When the crew came out of the airlock, they were met\nby the robots, and each man found himself with a robot at his side,\nhumbly requesting to be of service. There were literally thousands of\nthe robots now, come from all over the barren horizon. The mass of them\nstood apart, immobile on a plain near the ship, glinting in the sun\nlike a vast, metallic field of black wheat.\nThe robots had obviously been built to serve. Steffens began to\nfeel\ntheir pleasure, to sense it in spite of the blank, expressionless\nfaces. They were almost like children in their eagerness, yet they were\nstill reserved. Whoever had built them, Steffens thought in wonder, had\nbuilt them well.\nBall came to join Steffens, staring at the robots through the clear\nplastic of his helmet with baffledly widened eyes. A robot moved out\nfrom the mass in the field, allied itself to him. The first to speak\nhad remained with Steffens.\nRealizing that the robot could hear every word he was saying, Ball\nwas for a while apprehensive. But the sheer unreality of standing and\ntalking with a multi-limbed, intelligent hunk of dead metal upon the\nbare rock of a dead, ancient world, the unreality of it slowly died.\nIt was impossible not to like the things. There was something in their\nvery lines which was pleasant and relaxing.\nTheir builders, Steffens thought, had probably thought of that, too.\n\"There's no harm in them,\" said Ball at last, openly, not minding if\nthe robots heard. \"They seem actually glad we're here. My God, whoever\nheard of a robot being glad?\"\nSteffens, embarrassed, spoke quickly to the nearest mechanical: \"I hope\nyou will forgive us our curiosity, but\u2014yours is a remarkable race. We\nhave never before made contact with a race like yours.\" It was said\nhaltingly, but it was the best he could do.\nThe robot made a singularly human nodding motion of its head.\n\"I perceive that the nature of our construction is unfamiliar to you.\nYour question is whether or not we are entirely 'mechanical.' I am\nnot exactly certain as to what the word 'mechanical' is intended to\nconvey\u2014I would have to examine your thought more fully\u2014but I believe\nthat there is fundamental similarity between our structures.\"\nThe robot paused. Steffens had a distinct impression that it was\ndisconcerted.\n\"I must tell you,\" the thing went on, \"that we ourselves are\u2014curious.\"\nIt stopped suddenly, struggling with a word it could not comprehend.\nSteffens waited, listening with absolute interest. It said at length:\n\"We know of only two types of living structure. Ours, which is largely\nmetallic, and that of the\nMakers\n, which would appear to be somewhat\nmore like yours. I am not a\u2014doctor\u2014and therefore cannot acquaint you\nwith the specific details of the Makers' composition, but if you are\ninterested I will have a doctor brought forward. It will be glad to be\nof assistance.\"\nIt was Steffens' turn to struggle, and the robot waited patiently while\nBall and the second robot looked on in silence. The Makers, obviously,\nwere whoever or whatever had built the robots, and the \"doctors,\"\nSteffens decided, were probably just that\u2014doctor-robots, designed\nspecifically to care for the apparently flesh-bodies of the Makers.\nThe efficiency of the things continued to amaze him, but the question\nhe had been waiting to ask came out now with a rush:\n\"Can you tell us where the Makers are?\"\nBoth robots stood motionless. It occurred to Steffens that he couldn't\nreally be sure which was speaking. The voice that came to him spoke\nwith difficulty.\n\"The Makers\u2014are not here.\"\nSteffens stared in puzzlement. The robot detected his confusion and\nwent on:\n\"The Makers have gone away. They have been gone for a very long time.\"\nCould that be\npain\nin its voice, Steffens wondered, and then the\nspectre of the ruined cities rose harsh in his mind.\nWar. The Makers had all been killed in that war. And these had not been\nkilled.\nHe tried to grasp it, but he couldn't. There were robots here in the\nmidst of a radiation so lethal that\nnothing\n,\nnothing\ncould live;\nrobots on a dead planet, living in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide.\nThe carbon dioxide brought him up sharp.\nIf there had been life here once, there would have been plant life as\nwell, and therefore oxygen. If the war had been so long ago that the\nfree oxygen had since gone out of the atmosphere\u2014good God, how old\nwere the robots? Steffens looked at Ball, then at the silent robots,\nthen out across the field to where the rest of them stood. The black\nwheat. Steffens felt a deep chill.\nWere they immortal?\n\"Would you like to see a doctor?\"\nSteffens jumped at the familiar words, then realized to what the robot\nwas referring.\n\"No, not yet,\" he said, \"thank you.\" He swallowed hard as the robots\ncontinued waiting patiently.\n\"Could you tell me,\" he said at last, \"how old you are? Individually?\"\n\"By your reckoning,\" said his robot, and paused to make the\ncalculation, \"I am forty-four years, seven months, and eighteen days of\nage, with ten years and approximately nine months yet to be alive.\"\nSteffens tried to understand that.\n\"It would perhaps simplify our conversations,\" said the robot, \"if\nyou were to refer to me by a name, as is your custom. Using the\nfirst\u2014letters\u2014of my designation, my name would translate as Elb.\"\n\"Glad to meet you,\" Steffens mumbled.\n\"You are called 'Stef,'\" said the robot obligingly. Then it added,\npointing an arm at the robot near Ball: \"The age of\u2014Peb\u2014is seventeen\nyears, one month and four days. Peb has therefore remaining some\nthirty-eight years.\"\nSteffens was trying to keep up. Then the life span was obviously about\nfifty-five years. But the cities, and the carbon dioxide? The robot,\nElb, had said that the Makers were similar to him, and therefore oxygen\nand plant life would have been needed. Unless\u2014\nHe remembered the buildings on Tyban IV.\nUnless the Makers had not come from this planet at all.\nHis mind helplessly began to revolve. It was Ball who restored order.\n\"Do you build yourselves?\" the exec asked.\nPeb answered quickly, that faint note of happiness again apparent, as\nif the robot was glad for the opportunity of answering.\n\"No, we do not build ourselves. We are made by the\u2014\" another pause for\na word\u2014\"by the\nFactory\n.\"\n\"The Factory?\"\n\"Yes. It was built by the Makers. Would you care to see it?\"\nBoth of the Earthmen nodded dumbly.\n\"Would you prefer to use your\u2014skiff? It is quite a long way from here.\"\nIt was indeed a long way, even by skiff. Some of the Aliencon crew went\nalong with them. And near the edge of the twilight zone, on the other\nside of the world, they saw the Factory outlined in the dim light of\ndusk. A huge, fantastic block, wrought of gray and cloudy metal, lay in\na valley between two worn mountains. Steffens went down low, circling\nin the skiff, stared in awe at the size of the building. Robots moved\noutside the thing, little black bugs in the distance\u2014moving around\ntheir birthplace.\nThe Earthmen remained for several weeks. During that time, Steffens was\nusually with Elb, talking now as often as he listened, and the Aliencon\nteam roamed the planet freely, investigating what was certainly the\nstrangest culture in history. There was still the mystery of those\nbuildings on Tyban IV; that, as well as the robots' origin, would have\nto be cleared up before they could leave.\nSurprisingly, Steffens did not think about the future. Whenever he came\nnear a robot, he sensed such a general, comfortable air of good feeling\nthat it warmed him, and he was so preoccupied with watching the robots\nthat he did little thinking.\nSomething he had not realized at the beginning was that he was as\nunusual to the robots as they were to him. It came to him with a great\nshock that not one of the robots had ever seen a living thing. Not a\nbug, a worm, a leaf. They did not know what flesh was. Only the doctors\nknew that, and none of them could readily understand what was meant by\nthe words \"organic matter.\" It had taken them some time to recognize\nthat the Earthmen wore suits which were not parts of their bodies, and\nit was even more difficult for them to understand why the suits were\nneeded.\nBut when they did understand, the robots did a surprising thing.\nAt first, because of the excessive radiation, none of the Earthmen\ncould remain outside the ship for long, even in radiation suits. And\none morning, when Steffens came out of the ship, it was to discover\nthat hundreds of the robots, working through the night, had effectively\ndecontaminated the entire area.\nIt was at this point that Steffens asked how many robots there were.\nHe learned to his amazement that there were more than nine million.\nThe great mass of them had politely remained a great distance from the\nship, spread out over the planet, since they were highly radioactive.\nSteffens, meanwhile, courteously allowed Elb to probe into his mind.\nThe robot extracted all the knowledge of matter that Steffens held,\npondered over the knowledge and tried to digest it, and passed it on to\nthe other robots. Steffens, in turn, had a difficult time picturing the\nmind of a thing that had never known life.\nHe had a vague idea of the robot's history\u2014more, perhaps, then they\nknew themselves\u2014but he refrained from forming an opinion until\nAliencon made its report. What fascinated him was Elb's amazing\nphilosophy, the only outlook, really, that the robot could have had.\n\"What do you\ndo\n?\" Steffens asked.\nElb replied quickly, with characteristic simplicity: \"We can do very\nlittle. A certain amount of physical knowledge was imparted to us at\nbirth by the Makers. We spend the main part of our time expanding that\nknowledge wherever possible. We have made some progress in the natural\nsciences, and some in mathematics. Our purpose in being, you see, is\nto serve the Makers. Any ability we can acquire will make us that much\nmore fit to serve when the Makers return.\"\n\"When they return?\" It had not occurred to Steffens until now that the\nrobots expected the Makers to do so.\nElb regarded him out of the band of the circling eye. \"I see you had\nsurmised that the Makers were not coming back.\"\nIf the robot could have laughed, Steffens thought it would have, then.\nBut it just stood there, motionless, its tone politely emphatic.\n\"It has always been our belief that the Makers would return. Why else\nwould we have been built?\"\nSteffens thought the robot would go on, but it didn't. The question, to\nElb, was no question at all.\nAlthough Steffens knew already what the robot could not possibly have\nknown\u2014that the Makers were gone and would never come back\u2014he was a\nlong time understanding. What he did was push this speculation into the\nback of his mind, to keep it from Elb. He had no desire to destroy a\nfaith.\nBut it created a problem in him. He had begun to picture for Elb the\nstructure of human society, and the robot\u2014a machine which did not eat\nor sleep\u2014listened gravely and tried to understand. One day Steffens\nmentioned God.\n\"God?\" the robot repeated without comprehension. \"What is God?\"\nSteffens explained briefly, and the robot answered:\n\"It is a matter which has troubled us. We thought at first that you\nwere the Makers returning\u2014\" Steffens remembered the brief lapse, the\nseeming disappointment he had sensed\u2014\"but then we probed your minds\nand found that you were not, that you were another kind of being,\nunlike either the Makers or ourselves. You were not even\u2014\" Elb caught\nhimself\u2014\"you did not happen to be telepaths. Therefore we troubled\nover who made you. We did detect the word 'Maker' in your theology,\nbut it seemed to have a peculiar\u2014\" Elb paused for a long while\u2014\"an\nuntouchable, intangible meaning which varies among you.\"\nSteffens understood. He nodded.\nThe Makers were the robots' God, were all the God they needed. The\nMakers had built them, the planet, the universe. If he were to ask them\nwho made the Makers, it would be like their asking him who made God.\nIt was an ironic parallel, and he smiled to himself.\nBut on that planet, it was the last time he smiled.\n", "summary": "Steffens is on a mission to find the Makers, an advanced, space-crossing, alien race that has recently been spotted on a planet called Tyban IV. He has been tasked with mapping the planet and finding a way to colonize it in order to help save humanity from extinction. The mission is extremely important to him because he has been accused of breaking the Law of Contact, which prohibits humans from interacting with aliens outside of their own planets. The Makers are similar to the human race in that they are able to communicate with humans, but they are not able to do so in a way that humans can understand. Steffens\u2019s ship, the Mapping Command, has been sighted on the planet, and it is being followed by a ship piloted by a robot named Elb. The robot is described as being similar to a human, with arms, legs, and eyes, but it does not seem to be able to speak. It is unclear where it came from or how it got to the planet. The ship is being watched by two other ships, the one of which is the one that was sighted by the robot, and the other is the ship that is being observed by the humans.  The ship is approaching the planet that the robot is on, and a human named Ball asks the robot on the other side of the ship, Elb, if he knows anything about the robot. He is unable to answer, but the robot responds with a series of symbols that are not written in English, and he is able to translate the symbols into English. He tells the robot that he is not a doctor, but is a linguist, and that he does not want to be court-martialed one way or the other for breaking the law of contact.   Later, the ship is sighted again by another ship, this time by a man named Skaw. The man is a doctor who has been hired by the aliens to help them with their problem, and is concerned that the aliens are trying to take over the planet because they have not been able to successfully colonized by humans. The humans are worried that they will be killed if they do not find the right way to go about this mission.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}

WALLACE\nIllustrated by SIBLEY\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nGalaxy Science Fiction September 1952.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nAn unprovoked, meaningless night attack is\nterrifying enough on your own home planet, worse\non a world across the Galaxy. But the horror\nis the offer of help that cannot be accepted!\n\"Muscles tense,\" said Dimanche. \"Neural index 1.76, unusually high.\nAdrenalin squirting through his system. In effect, he's stalking you.\nIntent: probably assault with a deadly weapon.\"\n\"Not interested,\" said Cassal firmly, his subvocalization inaudible\nto anyone but Dimanche. \"I'm not the victim type. He was standing on\nthe walkway near the brink of the thoroughfare. I'm going back to the\nhabitat hotel and sit tight.\"\n\"First you have to get there,\" Dimanche pointed out. \"I mean, is it\nsafe for a stranger to walk through the city?\"\n\"Now that you mention it, no,\" answered Cassal. He looked around\napprehensively. \"Where is he?\"\n\"Behind you. At the moment he's pretending interest in a merchandise\ndisplay.\"\nA native stamped by, eyes brown and incurious. Apparently he was\naccustomed to the sight of an Earthman standing alone, Adam's apple\nbobbing up and down silently. It was a Godolphian axiom that all\ntravelers were crazy.\nCassal looked up. Not an air taxi in sight; Godolph shut down at dusk.\nIt would be pure luck if he found a taxi before morning. Of course he\ncould\nwalk back to the hotel, but was that such a good idea?\nA Godolphian city was peculiar. And, though not intended, it was\npeculiarly suited to certain kinds of violence. A human pedestrian was\nat a definite disadvantage.\n\"Correction,\" said Dimanche. \"Not simple assault. He has murder in\nmind.\"\n\"It still doesn't appeal to me,\" said Cassal. Striving to look\nunconcerned, he strolled toward the building side of the walkway and\nstared into the interior of a small cafe. Warm, bright and dry. Inside,\nhe might find safety for a time.\nDamn the man who was following him! It would be easy enough to elude\nhim in a normal city. On Godolph, nothing was normal. In an hour the\nstreets would be brightly lighted\u2014for native eyes. A human would\nconsider it dim.\n\"Why did he choose me?\" asked Cassal plaintively. \"There must be\nsomething he hopes to gain.\"\n\"I'm working on it,\" said Dimanche. \"But remember, I have limitations.\nAt short distances I can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret\nphysiological data. I can't read minds. The best I can do is report\nwhat a person says or subvocalizes. If you're really interested in\nfinding out why he wants to kill you, I suggest you turn the problem\nover to the godawful police.\"\n\"Godolph, not godawful,\" corrected Cassal absently.\nThat was advice he couldn't follow, good as it seemed. He could give\nthe police no evidence save through Dimanche. There were various\nreasons, many of them involving the law, for leaving the device called\nDimanche out of it. The police would act if they found a body. His own,\nsay, floating face-down on some quiet street. That didn't seem the\nproper approach, either.\n\"Weapons?\"\n\"The first thing I searched him for. Nothing very dangerous. A long\nknife, a hard striking object. Both concealed on his person.\"\nCassal strangled slightly. Dimanche needed a good stiff course in\nsemantics. A knife was still the most silent of weapons. A man could\ndie from it. His hand strayed toward his pocket. He had a measure of\nprotection himself.\n\"Report,\" said Dimanche. \"Not necessarily final. Based, perhaps, on\ntenuous evidence.\"\n\"Let's have it anyway.\"\n\"His motivation is connected somehow with your being marooned here. For\nsome reason you can't get off this planet.\"\nThat was startling information, though not strictly true. A thousand\nstar systems were waiting for him, and a ship to take him to each one.\nOf course, the one ship he wanted hadn't come in. Godolph was a\ntransfer point for stars nearer the center of the Galaxy. When he\nhad left Earth, he had known he would have to wait a few days here.\nHe hadn't expected a delay of nearly three weeks. Still, it wasn't\nunusual. Interstellar schedules over great distances were not as\nreliable as they might be.\nWas this man, whoever and whatever he might be, connected with\nthat delay? According to Dimanche, the man thought he was. He was\nself-deluded or did he have access to information that Cassal didn't?\nDenton Cassal, sales engineer, paused for a mental survey of himself.\nHe was a good engineer and, because he was exceptionally well matched\nto his instrument, the best salesman that Neuronics, Inc., had. On the\nbasis of these qualifications, he had been selected to make a long\njourney, the first part of which already lay behind him. He had to go\nto Tunney 21 to see a man. That man wasn't important to anyone save the\ncompany that employed him, and possibly not even to them.\nThe thug trailing him wouldn't be interested in Cassal himself, his\nmission, which was a commercial one, nor the man on Tunney. And money\nwasn't the objective, if Dimanche's analysis was right. What\ndid\nthe\nthug want?\nSecrets? Cassal had none, except, in a sense, Dimanche. And that was\ntoo well kept on Earth, where the instrument was invented and made, for\nanyone this far away to have learned about it.\nAnd yet the thug wanted to kill him. Wanted to? Regarded him as good as\ndead. It might pay him to investigate the matter further, if it didn't\ninvolve too much risk.\n\"Better start moving.\" That was Dimanche. \"He's getting suspicious.\"\nCassal went slowly along the narrow walkway that bordered each side of\nthat boulevard, the transport tide. It was raining again. It usually\nwas on Godolph, which was a weather-controlled planet where the natives\nlike rain.\nHe adjusted the controls of the weak force field that repelled the\nrain. He widened the angle of the field until water slanted through it\nunhindered. He narrowed it around him until it approached visibility\nand the drops bounced away. He swore at the miserable climate and the\nnear amphibians who created it.\nA few hundred feet away, a Godolphian girl waded out of the transport\ntide and climbed to the walkway. It was this sort of thing that made\nlife dangerous for a human\u2014Venice revised, brought up to date in a\nfaster-than-light age.\nWater. It was a perfect engineering material. Simple, cheap, infinitely\nflexible. With a minimum of mechanism and at break-neck speed, the\nribbon of the transport tide flowed at different levels throughout\nthe city. The Godolphian merely plunged in and was carried swiftly\nand noiselessly to his destination. Whereas a human\u2014Cassal shivered.\nIf he were found drowned, it would be considered an accident. No\ninvestigation would be made. The thug who was trailing him had\ncertainly picked the right place.\nThe Godolphian girl passed. She wore a sleek brown fur, her own. Cassal\nwas almost positive she muttered a polite \"Arf?\" as she sloshed by.\nWhat she meant by that, he didn't know and didn't intend to find out.\n\"Follow her,\" instructed Dimanche. \"We've got to investigate our man at\ncloser range.\"\nObediently, Cassal turned and began walking after the girl. Attractive\nin an anthropomorphic, seal-like way, even from behind. Not graceful\nout of her element, though.\nThe would-be assassin was still looking at merchandise as Cassal\nretraced his steps. A man, or at least man type. A big fellow,\nphysically quite capable of violence, if size had anything to do with\nit. The face, though, was out of character. Mild, almost meek. A\nscientist or scholar. It didn't fit with murder.\n\"Nothing,\" said Dimanche disgustedly. \"His mind froze when we got\nclose. I could feel his shoulderblades twitching as we passed.\nAnticipated guilt, of course. Projecting to you the action he plans.\nThat makes the knife definite.\"\nWell beyond the window at which the thug watched and waited, Cassal\nstopped. Shakily he produced a cigarette and fumbled for a lighter.\n\"Excellent thinking,\" commended Dimanche. \"He won't attempt anything\non this street. Too dangerous. Turn aside at the next deserted\nintersection and let him follow the glow of your cigarette.\"\nThe lighter flared in his hand. \"That's one way of finding out,\" said\nCassal. \"But wouldn't I be a lot safer if I just concentrated on\ngetting back to the hotel?\"\n\"I'm curious. Turn here.\"\n\"Go to hell,\" said Cassal nervously. Nevertheless, when he came to that\nintersection, he turned there.\nIt was a Godolphian equivalent of an alley, narrow and dark, oily\nslow-moving water gurgling at one side, high cavernous walls looming on\nthe other.\nHe would have to adjust the curiosity factor of Dimanche. It was all\nvery well to be interested in the man who trailed him, but there was\nalso the problem of coming out of this adventure alive. Dimanche, an\nelectronic instrument, naturally wouldn't consider that.\n\"Easy,\" warned Dimanche. \"He's at the entrance to the alley, walking\nfast. He's surprised and pleased that you took this route.\"\n\"I'm surprised, too,\" remarked Cassal. \"But I wouldn't say I'm pleased.\nNot just now.\"\n\"Careful. Even subvocalized conversation is distracting.\" The mechanism\nconcealed within his body was silent for an instant and then continued:\n\"His blood pressure is rising, breathing is faster. At a time like\nthis, he may be ready to verbalize why he wants to murder you. This is\ncritical.\"\n\"That's no lie,\" agreed Cassal bitterly. The lighter was in his hand.\nHe clutched it grimly. It was difficult not to look back. The darkness\nassumed an even more sinister quality.\n\"Quiet,\" said Dimanche. \"He's verbalizing about you.\"\n\"He's decided I'm a nice fellow after all. He's going to stop and ask\nme for a light.\"\n\"I don't think so,\" answered Dimanche. \"He's whispering: 'Poor devil. I\nhate to do it. But it's really his life or mine'.\"\n\"He's more right than he knows. Why all this violence, though? Isn't\nthere any clue?\"\n\"None at all,\" admitted Dimanche. \"He's very close. You'd better turn\naround.\"\nCassal turned, pressed the stud on the lighter. It should have made him\nfeel more secure, but it didn't. He could see very little.\nA dim shadow rushed at him. He jumped away from the water side of the\nalley, barely in time. He could feel the rush of air as the assailant\nshot by.\n\"Hey!\" shouted Cassal.\nEchoes answered; nothing else did. He had the uncomfortable feeling\nthat no one was going to come to his assistance.\n\"He wasn't expecting that reaction,\" explained Dimanche. \"That's why he\nmissed. He's turned around and is coming back.\"\n\"I'm armed!\" shouted Cassal.\n\"That won't stop him. He doesn't believe you.\"\nCassal grasped the lighter. That is, it had been a lighter a few\nseconds before. Now a needle-thin blade had snapped out and projected\nstiffly. Originally it had been designed as an emergency surgical\ninstrument. A little imagination and a few changes had altered its\nfunction, converting it into a compact, efficient stiletto.\n\"Twenty feet away,\" advised Dimanche. \"He knows you can't see him, but\nhe can see your silhouette by the light from the main thoroughfare.\nWhat he doesn't know is that I can detect every move he makes and keep\nyou posted below the level of his hearing.\"\n\"Stay on him,\" growled Cassal nervously. He flattened himself against\nthe wall.\n\"To the right,\" whispered Dimanche. \"Lunge forward. About five feet.\nLow.\"\nSickly, he did so. He didn't care to consider the possible effects of\na miscalculation. In the darkness, how far was five feet? Fortunately,\nhis estimate was correct. The rapier encountered yielding resistance,\nthe soggy kind: flesh. The tough blade bent, but did not break. His\nopponent gasped and broke away.\n\"Attack!\" howled Dimanche against the bone behind his ear. \"You've got\nhim. He can't imagine how you know where he is in the darkness. He's\nafraid.\"\nAttack he did, slicing about wildly. Some of the thrusts landed; some\ndidn't. The percentage was low, the total amount high. His opponent\nfell to the ground, gasped and was silent.\nCassal fumbled in his pockets and flipped on a light. The man lay near\nthe water side of the alley. One leg was crumpled under him. He didn't\nmove.\n\"Heartbeat slow,\" said Dimanche solemnly. \"Breathing barely\nperceptible.\"\n\"Then he's not dead,\" said Cassal in relief.\nFoam flecked from the still lips and ran down the chin. Blood oozed\nfrom cuts on the face.\n\"Respiration none, heartbeat absent,\" stated Dimanche.\nHorrified, Cassal gazed at the body. Self-defense, of course, but\nwould the police believe it? Assuming they did, they'd still have to\ninvestigate. The rapier was an illegal concealed weapon. And they would\nquestion him until they discovered Dimanche. Regrettable, but what\ncould he do about it?\nSuppose he were detained long enough to miss the ship bound for Tunney\n21?\nGrimly, he laid down the rapier. He might as well get to the bottom of\nthis. Why had the man attacked? What did he want?\n\"I don't know,\" replied Dimanche irritably. \"I can interpret body\ndata\u2014a live body. I can't work on a piece of meat.\"\nCassal searched the body thoroughly. Miscellaneous personal articles\nof no value in identifying the man. A clip with a startling amount\nof money in it. A small white card with something scribbled on it. A\npicture of a woman and a small child posed against a background which\nresembled no world Cassal had ever seen. That was all.\nCassal stood up in bewilderment. Dimanche to the contrary, there seemed\nto be no connection between this dead man and his own problem of\ngetting to Tunney 21.\nRight now, though, he had to dispose of the body. He glanced toward the\nboulevard. So far no one had been attracted by the violence.\nHe bent down to retrieve the lighter-rapier. Dimanche shouted at him.\nBefore he could react, someone landed on him. He fell forward, vainly\ntrying to grasp the weapon. Strong fingers felt for his throat as he\nwas forced to the ground.\nHe threw the attacker off and staggered to his feet. He heard footsteps\nrushing away. A slight splash followed. Whoever it was, he was escaping\nby way of water.\nWhoever it was. The man he had thought he had slain was no longer in\nsight.\n\"Interpret body data, do you?\" muttered Cassal. \"Liveliest dead man\nI've ever been strangled by.\"\n\"It's just possible there are some breeds of men who can control the\nbasic functions of their body,\" said Dimanche defensively. \"When I\nchecked him, he had no heartbeat.\"\n\"Remind me not to accept your next evaluation so completely,\" grunted\nCassal. Nevertheless, he was relieved, in a fashion. He hadn't\nwanted\nto kill the man. And now there was nothing he'd have to explain to the\npolice.\nHe needed the cigarette he stuck between his lips. For the second\ntime he attempted to pick up the rapier-lighter. This time he was\nsuccessful. Smoke swirled into his lungs and quieted his nerves. He\nsqueezed the weapon into the shape of a lighter and put it away.\nSomething, however, was missing\u2014his wallet.\nThe thug had relieved him of it in the second round of the scuffle.\nPersistent fellow. Damned persistent.\nIt really didn't matter. He fingered the clip he had taken from the\nsupposedly dead body. He had intended to turn it over to the police.\nNow he might as well keep it to reimburse him for his loss. It\ncontained more money than his wallet had.\nExcept for the identification tab he always carried in his wallet, it\nwas more than a fair exchange. The identification, a rectangular piece\nof plastic, was useful in establishing credit, but with the money he\nnow had, he wouldn't need credit. If he did, he could always send for\nanother tab.\nA white card fluttered from the clip. He caught it as it fell.\nCuriously he examined it. Blank except for one crudely printed word,\nSTAB. His unknown assailant certainly had tried.\nThe old man stared at the door, an obsolete visual projector wobbling\nprecariously on his head. He closed his eyes and the lettering on the\ndoor disappeared. Cassal was too far away to see what it had been. The\ntechnician opened his eyes and concentrated. Slowly a new sign formed\non the door.\nTRAVELERS AID BUREAU\nMurra Foray, First Counselor\nIt was a drab sign, but, then, it was a dismal, backward planet. The\nold technician passed on to the next door and closed his eyes again.\nWith a sinking feeling, Cassal walked toward the entrance. He needed\nhelp and he had to find it in this dingy rathole.\nInside, though, it wasn't dingy and it wasn't a rathole. More like a\nmaze, an approved scientific one. Efficient, though not comfortable.\nTravelers Aid was busier than he thought it would be. Eventually he\nmanaged to squeeze into one of the many small counseling rooms.\nA woman appeared on the screen, crisp and cool. \"Please answer\neverything the machine asks. When the tape is complete, I'll be\navailable for consultation.\"\nCassal wasn't sure he was going to like her. \"Is this necessary?\" he\nasked. \"It's merely a matter of information.\"\n\"We have certain regulations we abide by.\" The woman smiled frostily.\n\"I can't give you any information until you comply with them.\"\n\"Sometimes regulations are silly,\" said Cassal firmly. \"Let me speak to\nthe first counselor.\"\n\"You are speaking to her,\" she said. Her face disappeared from the\nscreen.\nCassal sighed. So far he hadn't made a good impression.\nTravelers Aid Bureau, in addition to regulations, was abundantly\nsupplied with official curiosity. When the machine finished with him,\nCassal had the feeling he could be recreated from the record it had of\nhim. His individuality had been capsuled into a series of questions and\nanswers. One thing he drew the line at\u2014why he wanted to go to Tunney\n21 was his own business.\nThe first counselor reappeared. Age, indeterminate. Not, he supposed,\nthat anyone would be curious about it. Slightly taller than average,\nrather on the slender side. Face was broad at the brow, narrow at the\nchin and her eyes were enigmatic. A dangerous woman.\nShe glanced down at the data. \"Denton Cassal, native of Earth.\nDestination, Tunney 21.\" She looked up at him. \"Occupation, sales\nengineer. Isn't that an odd combination?\" Her smile was quite superior.\n\"Not at all. Scientific training as an engineer. Special knowledge of\ncustomer relations.\"\n\"Special knowledge of a thousand races? How convenient.\" Her eyebrows\narched.\n\"I think so,\" he agreed blandly. \"Anything else you'd like to know?\"\n\"Sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.\"\nHe could believe that or not as he wished. He didn't.\n\"You refused to answer why you were going to Tunney 21. Perhaps I can\nguess. They're the best scientists in the Galaxy. You wish to study\nunder them.\"\nClose\u2014but wrong on two counts. They were good scientists, though not\nnecessarily the best. For instance, it was doubtful that they could\nbuild Dimanche, even if they had ever thought of it, which was even\nless likely.\nThere was, however, one relatively obscure research worker on Tunney 21\nthat Neuronics wanted on their staff. If the fragments of his studies\nthat had reached Earth across the vast distance meant anything, he\ncould help Neuronics perfect instantaneous radio. The company that\ncould build a radio to span the reaches of the Galaxy with no time lag\ncould set its own price, which could be control of all communications,\ntransport, trade\u2014a galactic monopoly. Cassal's share would be a cut of\nall that.\nHis part was simple, on the surface. He was to persuade that researcher\nto come to Earth,\nif he could\n. Literally, he had to guess the\nTunnesian's price before the Tunnesian himself knew it. In addition,\nthe reputation of Tunnesian scientists being exceeded only by their\narrogance, Cassal had to convince him that he wouldn't be working\nfor ignorant Earth savages. The existence of such an instrument as\nDimanche was a key factor.\nHer voice broke through his thoughts. \"Now, then, what's your problem?\"\n\"I was told on Earth I might have to wait a few days on Godolph. I've\nbeen here three weeks. I want information on the ship bound for Tunney\n21.\"\n\"Just a moment.\" She glanced at something below the angle of the\nscreen. She looked up and her eyes were grave. \"\nRickrock C\narrived\nyesterday. Departed for Tunney early this morning.\"\n\"Departed?\" He got up and sat down again, swallowing hard. \"When will\nthe next ship arrive?\"\n\"Do you know how many stars there are in the Galaxy?\" she asked.\nHe didn't answer.\n\"That's right,\" she said. \"Billions. Tunney, according to the notation,\nis near the center of the Galaxy, inside the third ring. You've\ncovered about a third of the distance to it. Local traffic, anything\nwithin a thousand light-years, is relatively easy to manage. At longer\ndistances, you take a chance. You've had yours and missed it. Frankly,\nCassal, I don't know when another ship bound for Tunney will show up on\nor near Godolph. Within the next five years\u2014maybe.\"\nHe blanched. \"How long would it take to get there using local\ntransportation, star-hopping?\"\n\"Take my advice: don't try it. Five years, if you're lucky.\"\n\"I don't need that kind of luck.\"\n\"I suppose not.\" She hesitated. \"You're determined to go on?\" At the\nemphatic nod, she sighed. \"If that's your decision, we'll try to help\nyou. To start things moving, we'll need a print of your identification\ntab.\"\n\"There's something funny about her,\" Dimanche decided. It was the usual\nspeaking voice of the instrument, no louder than the noise the blood\nmade in coursing through arteries and veins. Cassal could hear it\nplainly, because it was virtually inside his ear.\nCassal ignored his private voice. \"Identification tab? I don't have it\nwith me. In fact, I may have lost it.\"\nShe smiled in instant disbelief. \"We're not trying to pry into any\npart of your past you may wish concealed. However, it's much easier\nfor us to help you if you have your identification. Now if you can't\nremember\nyour real name and where you put your identification\u2014\" She\narose and left the screen. \"Just a moment.\"\nHe glared uneasily at the spot where the first counselor wasn't. His\nreal\nname!\n\"Relax,\" Dimanche suggested. \"She didn't mean it as a personal insult.\"\nPresently she returned.\n\"I have news for you, whoever you are.\"\n\"Cassal,\" he said firmly. \"Denton Cassal, sales engineer, Earth. If you\ndon't believe it, send back to\u2014\" He stopped. It had taken him four\nmonths to get to Godolph, non-stop, plus a six-month wait on Earth for\na ship to show up that was bound in the right direction. Over distances\nsuch as these, it just wasn't practical to send back to Earth for\nanything.\n\"I see you understand.\" She glanced at the card in her hand. \"The\nspaceport records indicate that when\nRickrock C\ntook off this\nmorning, there was a Denton Cassal on board, bound for Tunney 21.\"\n\"It wasn't I,\" he said dazedly. He knew who it was, though. The man who\nhad tried to kill him last night. The reason for the attack now became\nclear. The thug had wanted his identification tab. Worse, he had gotten\nit.\n\"No doubt it wasn't,\" she said wearily. \"Outsiders don't seem to\nunderstand what galactic travel entails.\"\nOutsiders? Evidently what she called those who lived beyond the second\ntransfer ring. Were those who lived at the edge of the Galaxy, beyond\nthe first ring, called Rimmers? Probably.\nShe was still speaking: \"Ten years to cross the Galaxy, without\nstopping. At present, no ship is capable of that. Real scheduling is\nimpossible. Populations shift and have to be supplied. A ship is taken\noff a run for repairs and is never put back on. It's more urgently\nneeded elsewhere. The man who depended on it is left waiting; years\npass before he learns it's never coming.\n\"If we had instantaneous radio, that would help. Confusion wouldn't\nvanish overnight, but it would diminish. We wouldn't have to depend\non ships for all the news. Reservations could be made ahead of time,\ncredit established, lost identification replaced\u2014\"\n\"I've traveled before,\" he interrupted stiffly. \"I've never had any\ntrouble.\"\nShe seemed to be exaggerating the difficulties. True, the center was\nmore congested. Taking each star as the starting point for a limited\nnumber of ships and using statistical probability as a guide\u2014why, no\nman would arrive at his predetermined destination.\nBut that wasn't the way it worked. Manifestly, you couldn't compare\ngalactic transportation to the erratic paths of air molecules in a\ngiant room. Or could you?\nFor the average man, anyone who didn't have his own inter-stellar ship,\nwas the comparison too apt? It might be.\n\"You've traveled outside, where there are still free planets waiting to\nbe settled. Where a man is welcome, if he's able to work.\" She paused.\n\"The center is different. Populations are excessive. Inside the third\nring, no man is allowed off a ship without an identification tab. They\ndon't encourage immigration.\"\nIn effect, that meant no ship bound for the center would take a\npassenger without identification. No ship owner would run the risk of\nhaving a permanent guest on board, someone who couldn't be rid of when\nhis money was gone.\nCassal held his head in his hands. Tunney 21 was inside the third ring.\n\"Next time,\" she said, \"don't let anyone take your identification.\"\n\"I won't,\" he promised grimly.\nThe woman looked directly at him. Her eyes were bright. He revised his\nestimate of her age drastically downward. She couldn't be as old as he.\nNothing outward had happened, but she no longer seemed dowdy. Not that\nhe was interested. Still, it might pay him to be friendly to the first\ncounselor.\n\"We're a philanthropic agency,\" said Murra Foray. \"Your case is\nspecial, though\u2014\"\n\"I understand,\" he said gruffly. \"You accept contributions.\"\nShe nodded. \"If the donor is able to give. We don't ask so much that\nyou'll have to compromise your standard of living.\" But she named a sum\nthat would force him to do just that if getting to Tunney 21 took any\nappreciable time.\nHe stared at her unhappily. \"I suppose it's worth it. I can always\nwork, if I have to.\"\n\"As a salesman?\" she asked. \"I'm afraid you'll find it difficult to do\nbusiness with Godolphians.\"\nIrony wasn't called for at a time like this, he thought reproachfully.\n\"Not just another salesman,\" he answered definitely. \"I have special\nknowledge of customer reactions. I can tell exactly\u2014\"\nHe stopped abruptly. Was she baiting him? For what reason? The\ninstrument he called Dimanche was not known to the Galaxy at large.\nFrom the business angle, it would be poor policy to hand out that\ninformation at random. Aside from that, he needed every advantage he\ncould get. Dimanche was his special advantage.\n\"Anyway,\" he finished lamely, \"I'm a first class engineer. I can\nalways find something in that line.\"\n\"A scientist, maybe,\" murmured Murra Foray. \"But in this part of the\nMilky Way, an engineer is regarded as merely a technician who hasn't\nyet gained practical experience.\" She shook her head. \"You'll do better\nas a salesman.\"\nHe got up, glowering. \"If that's all\u2014\"\n\"It is. We'll keep you informed. Drop your contribution in the slot\nprovided for that purpose as you leave.\"\nA door, which he hadn't noticed in entering the counselling cubicle,\nswung open. The agency was efficient.\n\"Remember,\" the counselor called out as he left, \"identification is\nhard to work with. Don't accept a crude forgery.\"\nHe didn't answer, but it was an idea worth considering. The agency was\nalso eminently practical.\nThe exit path guided him firmly to an inconspicuous and yet inescapable\ncontribution station. He began to doubt the philanthropic aspect of the\nbureau.\n\"I've got it,\" said Dimanche as Cassal gloomily counted out the sum the\nfirst counselor had named.\n\"Got what?\" asked Cassal. He rolled the currency into a neat bundle,\nattached his name, and dropped it into the chute.\n\"The woman, Murra Foray, the first counselor. She's a Huntner.\"\n\"What's a Huntner?\"\n\"A sub-race of men on the other side of the Galaxy. She was vocalizing\nabout her home planet when I managed to locate her.\"\n\"Any other information?\"\n\"None. Electronic guards were sliding into place as soon as I reached\nher. I got out as fast as I could.\"\n\"I see.\" The significance of that, if any, escaped him. Nevertheless,\nit sounded depressing.\n\"What I want to know is,\" said Dimanche, \"why such precautions as\nelectronic guards? What does Travelers Aid have that's so secret?\"\nCassal grunted and didn't answer. Dimanche could be annoyingly\ninquisitive at times.\nCassal had entered one side of a block-square building. He came out on\nthe other side. The agency was larger than he had thought. The old man\nwas staring at a door as Cassal came out. He had apparently changed\nevery sign in the building. His work finished, the technician was\nremoving the visual projector from his head as Cassal came up to him.\nHe turned and peered.\n\"You stuck here, too?\" he asked in the uneven voice of the aged.\n\"Stuck?\" repeated Cassal. \"I suppose you can call it that. I'm waiting\nfor my ship.\" He frowned. He was the one who wanted to ask questions.\n\"Why all the redecoration? I thought Travelers Aid was an old agency.\nWhy did you change so many signs? I could understand it if the agency\nwere new.\"\nThe old man chuckled. \"Re-organization. The previous first counselor\nresigned suddenly, in the middle of the night, they say. The new one\ndidn't like the name of the agency, so she ordered it changed.\"\nShe would do just that, thought Cassal. \"What about this Murra Foray?\"\nThe old man winked mysteriously. He opened his mouth and then seemed\novercome with senile fright. Hurriedly he shuffled away.\nCassal gazed after him, baffled. The old man was afraid for his job,\nafraid of the first counselor. Why he should be, Cassal didn't know. He\nshrugged and went on. The agency was now in motion in his behalf, but\nhe didn't intend to depend on that alone.\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nDELAY IN TRANSIT\nBy F. L. WALLACE\nIllustrated by SIBLEY\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nGalaxy Science Fiction September 1952.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nAn unprovoked, meaningless night attack is\nterrifying enough on your own home planet, worse\non a world across the Galaxy. But the horror\nis the offer of help that cannot be accepted!\n\"Muscles tense,\" said Dimanche. \"Neural index 1.76, unusually high.\nAdrenalin squirting through his system. In effect, he's stalking you.\nIntent: probably assault with a deadly weapon.\"\n\"Not interested,\" said Cassal firmly, his subvocalization inaudible\nto anyone but Dimanche. \"I'm not the victim type. He was standing on\nthe walkway near the brink of the thoroughfare. I'm going back to the\nhabitat hotel and sit tight.\"\n\"First you have to get there,\" Dimanche pointed out. \"I mean, is it\nsafe for a stranger to walk through the city?\"\n\"Now that you mention it, no,\" answered Cassal. He looked around\napprehensively. \"Where is he?\"\n\"Behind you. At the moment he's pretending interest in a merchandise\ndisplay.\"\nA native stamped by, eyes brown and incurious. Apparently he was\naccustomed to the sight of an Earthman standing alone, Adam's apple\nbobbing up and down silently. It was a Godolphian axiom that all\ntravelers were crazy.\nCassal looked up. Not an air taxi in sight; Godolph shut down at dusk.\nIt would be pure luck if he found a taxi before morning. Of course he\ncould\nwalk back to the hotel, but was that such a good idea?\nA Godolphian city was peculiar. And, though not intended, it was\npeculiarly suited to certain kinds of violence. A human pedestrian was\nat a definite disadvantage.\n\"Correction,\" said Dimanche. \"Not simple assault. He has murder in\nmind.\"\n\"It still doesn't appeal to me,\" said Cassal. Striving to look\nunconcerned, he strolled toward the building side of the walkway and\nstared into the interior of a small cafe. Warm, bright and dry. Inside,\nhe might find safety for a time.\nDamn the man who was following him! It would be easy enough to elude\nhim in a normal city. On Godolph, nothing was normal. In an hour the\nstreets would be brightly lighted\u2014for native eyes. A human would\nconsider it dim.\n\"Why did he choose me?\" asked Cassal plaintively. \"There must be\nsomething he hopes to gain.\"\n\"I'm working on it,\" said Dimanche. \"But remember, I have limitations.\nAt short distances I can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret\nphysiological data. I can't read minds. The best I can do is report\nwhat a person says or subvocalizes. If you're really interested in\nfinding out why he wants to kill you, I suggest you turn the problem\nover to the godawful police.\"\n\"Godolph, not godawful,\" corrected Cassal absently.\nThat was advice he couldn't follow, good as it seemed. He could give\nthe police no evidence save through Dimanche. There were various\nreasons, many of them involving the law, for leaving the device called\nDimanche out of it. The police would act if they found a body. His own,\nsay, floating face-down on some quiet street. That didn't seem the\nproper approach, either.\n\"Weapons?\"\n\"The first thing I searched him for. Nothing very dangerous. A long\nknife, a hard striking object. Both concealed on his person.\"\nCassal strangled slightly. Dimanche needed a good stiff course in\nsemantics. A knife was still the most silent of weapons. A man could\ndie from it. His hand strayed toward his pocket. He had a measure of\nprotection himself.\n\"Report,\" said Dimanche. \"Not necessarily final. Based, perhaps, on\ntenuous evidence.\"\n\"Let's have it anyway.\"\n\"His motivation is connected somehow with your being marooned here. For\nsome reason you can't get off this planet.\"\nThat was startling information, though not strictly true. A thousand\nstar systems were waiting for him, and a ship to take him to each one.\nOf course, the one ship he wanted hadn't come in. Godolph was a\ntransfer point for stars nearer the center of the Galaxy. When he\nhad left Earth, he had known he would have to wait a few days here.\nHe hadn't expected a delay of nearly three weeks. Still, it wasn't\nunusual. Interstellar schedules over great distances were not as\nreliable as they might be.\nWas this man, whoever and whatever he might be, connected with\nthat delay? According to Dimanche, the man thought he was. He was\nself-deluded or did he have access to information that Cassal didn't?\nDenton Cassal, sales engineer, paused for a mental survey of himself.\nHe was a good engineer and, because he was exceptionally well matched\nto his instrument, the best salesman that Neuronics, Inc., had. On the\nbasis of these qualifications, he had been selected to make a long\njourney, the first part of which already lay behind him. He had to go\nto Tunney 21 to see a man. That man wasn't important to anyone save the\ncompany that employed him, and possibly not even to them.\nThe thug trailing him wouldn't be interested in Cassal himself, his\nmission, which was a commercial one, nor the man on Tunney. And money\nwasn't the objective, if Dimanche's analysis was right. What\ndid\nthe\nthug want?\nSecrets? Cassal had none, except, in a sense, Dimanche. And that was\ntoo well kept on Earth, where the instrument was invented and made, for\nanyone this far away to have learned about it.\nAnd yet the thug wanted to kill him. Wanted to? Regarded him as good as\ndead. It might pay him to investigate the matter further, if it didn't\ninvolve too much risk.\n\"Better start moving.\" That was Dimanche. \"He's getting suspicious.\"\nCassal went slowly along the narrow walkway that bordered each side of\nthat boulevard, the transport tide. It was raining again. It usually\nwas on Godolph, which was a weather-controlled planet where the natives\nlike rain.\nHe adjusted the controls of the weak force field that repelled the\nrain. He widened the angle of the field until water slanted through it\nunhindered. He narrowed it around him until it approached visibility\nand the drops bounced away. He swore at the miserable climate and the\nnear amphibians who created it.\nA few hundred feet away, a Godolphian girl waded out of the transport\ntide and climbed to the walkway. It was this sort of thing that made\nlife dangerous for a human\u2014Venice revised, brought up to date in a\nfaster-than-light age.\nWater. It was a perfect engineering material. Simple, cheap, infinitely\nflexible. With a minimum of mechanism and at break-neck speed, the\nribbon of the transport tide flowed at different levels throughout\nthe city. The Godolphian merely plunged in and was carried swiftly\nand noiselessly to his destination. Whereas a human\u2014Cassal shivered.\nIf he were found drowned, it would be considered an accident. No\ninvestigation would be made. The thug who was trailing him had\ncertainly picked the right place.\nThe Godolphian girl passed. She wore a sleek brown fur, her own. Cassal\nwas almost positive she muttered a polite \"Arf?\" as she sloshed by.\nWhat she meant by that, he didn't know and didn't intend to find out.\n\"Follow her,\" instructed Dimanche. \"We've got to investigate our man at\ncloser range.\"\nObediently, Cassal turned and began walking after the girl. Attractive\nin an anthropomorphic, seal-like way, even from behind. Not graceful\nout of her element, though.\nThe would-be assassin was still looking at merchandise as Cassal\nretraced his steps. A man, or at least man type. A big fellow,\nphysically quite capable of violence, if size had anything to do with\nit. The face, though, was out of character. Mild, almost meek. A\nscientist or scholar. It didn't fit with murder.\n\"Nothing,\" said Dimanche disgustedly. \"His mind froze when we got\nclose. I could feel his shoulderblades twitching as we passed.\nAnticipated guilt, of course. Projecting to you the action he plans.\nThat makes the knife definite.\"\nWell beyond the window at which the thug watched and waited, Cassal\nstopped. Shakily he produced a cigarette and fumbled for a lighter.\n\"Excellent thinking,\" commended Dimanche. \"He won't attempt anything\non this street. Too dangerous. Turn aside at the next deserted\nintersection and let him follow the glow of your cigarette.\"\nThe lighter flared in his hand. \"That's one way of finding out,\" said\nCassal. \"But wouldn't I be a lot safer if I just concentrated on\ngetting back to the hotel?\"\n\"I'm curious. Turn here.\"\n\"Go to hell,\" said Cassal nervously. Nevertheless, when he came to that\nintersection, he turned there.\nIt was a Godolphian equivalent of an alley, narrow and dark, oily\nslow-moving water gurgling at one side, high cavernous walls looming on\nthe other.\nHe would have to adjust the curiosity factor of Dimanche. It was all\nvery well to be interested in the man who trailed him, but there was\nalso the problem of coming out of this adventure alive. Dimanche, an\nelectronic instrument, naturally wouldn't consider that.\n\"Easy,\" warned Dimanche. \"He's at the entrance to the alley, walking\nfast. He's surprised and pleased that you took this route.\"\n\"I'm surprised, too,\" remarked Cassal. \"But I wouldn't say I'm pleased.\nNot just now.\"\n\"Careful. Even subvocalized conversation is distracting.\" The mechanism\nconcealed within his body was silent for an instant and then continued:\n\"His blood pressure is rising, breathing is faster. At a time like\nthis, he may be ready to verbalize why he wants to murder you. This is\ncritical.\"\n\"That's no lie,\" agreed Cassal bitterly. The lighter was in his hand.\nHe clutched it grimly. It was difficult not to look back. The darkness\nassumed an even more sinister quality.\n\"Quiet,\" said Dimanche. \"He's verbalizing about you.\"\n\"He's decided I'm a nice fellow after all. He's going to stop and ask\nme for a light.\"\n\"I don't think so,\" answered Dimanche. \"He's whispering: 'Poor devil. I\nhate to do it. But it's really his life or mine'.\"\n\"He's more right than he knows. Why all this violence, though? Isn't\nthere any clue?\"\n\"None at all,\" admitted Dimanche. \"He's very close. You'd better turn\naround.\"\nCassal turned, pressed the stud on the lighter. It should have made him\nfeel more secure, but it didn't. He could see very little.\nA dim shadow rushed at him. He jumped away from the water side of the\nalley, barely in time. He could feel the rush of air as the assailant\nshot by.\n\"Hey!\" shouted Cassal.\nEchoes answered; nothing else did. He had the uncomfortable feeling\nthat no one was going to come to his assistance.\n\"He wasn't expecting that reaction,\" explained Dimanche. \"That's why he\nmissed. He's turned around and is coming back.\"\n\"I'm armed!\" shouted Cassal.\n\"That won't stop him. He doesn't believe you.\"\nCassal grasped the lighter. That is, it had been a lighter a few\nseconds before. Now a needle-thin blade had snapped out and projected\nstiffly. Originally it had been designed as an emergency surgical\ninstrument. A little imagination and a few changes had altered its\nfunction, converting it into a compact, efficient stiletto.\n\"Twenty feet away,\" advised Dimanche. \"He knows you can't see him, but\nhe can see your silhouette by the light from the main thoroughfare.\nWhat he doesn't know is that I can detect every move he makes and keep\nyou posted below the level of his hearing.\"\n\"Stay on him,\" growled Cassal nervously. He flattened himself against\nthe wall.\n\"To the right,\" whispered Dimanche. \"Lunge forward. About five feet.\nLow.\"\nSickly, he did so. He didn't care to consider the possible effects of\na miscalculation. In the darkness, how far was five feet? Fortunately,\nhis estimate was correct. The rapier encountered yielding resistance,\nthe soggy kind: flesh. The tough blade bent, but did not break. His\nopponent gasped and broke away.\n\"Attack!\" howled Dimanche against the bone behind his ear. \"You've got\nhim. He can't imagine how you know where he is in the darkness. He's\nafraid.\"\nAttack he did, slicing about wildly. Some of the thrusts landed; some\ndidn't. The percentage was low, the total amount high. His opponent\nfell to the ground, gasped and was silent.\nCassal fumbled in his pockets and flipped on a light. The man lay near\nthe water side of the alley. One leg was crumpled under him. He didn't\nmove.\n\"Heartbeat slow,\" said Dimanche solemnly. \"Breathing barely\nperceptible.\"\n\"Then he's not dead,\" said Cassal in relief.\nFoam flecked from the still lips and ran down the chin. Blood oozed\nfrom cuts on the face.\n\"Respiration none, heartbeat absent,\" stated Dimanche.\nHorrified, Cassal gazed at the body. Self-defense, of course, but\nwould the police believe it? Assuming they did, they'd still have to\ninvestigate. The rapier was an illegal concealed weapon. And they would\nquestion him until they discovered Dimanche. Regrettable, but what\ncould he do about it?\nSuppose he were detained long enough to miss the ship bound for Tunney\n21?\nGrimly, he laid down the rapier. He might as well get to the bottom of\nthis. Why had the man attacked? What did he want?\n\"I don't know,\" replied Dimanche irritably. \"I can interpret body\ndata\u2014a live body. I can't work on a piece of meat.\"\nCassal searched the body thoroughly. Miscellaneous personal articles\nof no value in identifying the man. A clip with a startling amount\nof money in it. A small white card with something scribbled on it. A\npicture of a woman and a small child posed against a background which\nresembled no world Cassal had ever seen. That was all.\nCassal stood up in bewilderment. Dimanche to the contrary, there seemed\nto be no connection between this dead man and his own problem of\ngetting to Tunney 21.\nRight now, though, he had to dispose of the body. He glanced toward the\nboulevard. So far no one had been attracted by the violence.\nHe bent down to retrieve the lighter-rapier. Dimanche shouted at him.\nBefore he could react, someone landed on him. He fell forward, vainly\ntrying to grasp the weapon. Strong fingers felt for his throat as he\nwas forced to the ground.\nHe threw the attacker off and staggered to his feet. He heard footsteps\nrushing away. A slight splash followed. Whoever it was, he was escaping\nby way of water.\nWhoever it was. The man he had thought he had slain was no longer in\nsight.\n\"Interpret body data, do you?\" muttered Cassal. \"Liveliest dead man\nI've ever been strangled by.\"\n\"It's just possible there are some breeds of men who can control the\nbasic functions of their body,\" said Dimanche defensively. \"When I\nchecked him, he had no heartbeat.\"\n\"Remind me not to accept your next evaluation so completely,\" grunted\nCassal. Nevertheless, he was relieved, in a fashion. He hadn't\nwanted\nto kill the man. And now there was nothing he'd have to explain to the\npolice.\nHe needed the cigarette he stuck between his lips. For the second\ntime he attempted to pick up the rapier-lighter. This time he was\nsuccessful. Smoke swirled into his lungs and quieted his nerves. He\nsqueezed the weapon into the shape of a lighter and put it away.\nSomething, however, was missing\u2014his wallet.\nThe thug had relieved him of it in the second round of the scuffle.\nPersistent fellow. Damned persistent.\nIt really didn't matter. He fingered the clip he had taken from the\nsupposedly dead body. He had intended to turn it over to the police.\nNow he might as well keep it to reimburse him for his loss. It\ncontained more money than his wallet had.\nExcept for the identification tab he always carried in his wallet, it\nwas more than a fair exchange. The identification, a rectangular piece\nof plastic, was useful in establishing credit, but with the money he\nnow had, he wouldn't need credit. If he did, he could always send for\nanother tab.\nA white card fluttered from the clip. He caught it as it fell.\nCuriously he examined it. Blank except for one crudely printed word,\nSTAB. His unknown assailant certainly had tried.\nThe old man stared at the door, an obsolete visual projector wobbling\nprecariously on his head. He closed his eyes and the lettering on the\ndoor disappeared. Cassal was too far away to see what it had been. The\ntechnician opened his eyes and concentrated. Slowly a new sign formed\non the door.\nTRAVELERS AID BUREAU\nMurra Foray, First Counselor\nIt was a drab sign, but, then, it was a dismal, backward planet. The\nold technician passed on to the next door and closed his eyes again.\nWith a sinking feeling, Cassal walked toward the entrance. He needed\nhelp and he had to find it in this dingy rathole.\nInside, though, it wasn't dingy and it wasn't a rathole. More like a\nmaze, an approved scientific one. Efficient, though not comfortable.\nTravelers Aid was busier than he thought it would be. Eventually he\nmanaged to squeeze into one of the many small counseling rooms.\nA woman appeared on the screen, crisp and cool. \"Please answer\neverything the machine asks. When the tape is complete, I'll be\navailable for consultation.\"\nCassal wasn't sure he was going to like her. \"Is this necessary?\" he\nasked. \"It's merely a matter of information.\"\n\"We have certain regulations we abide by.\" The woman smiled frostily.\n\"I can't give you any information until you comply with them.\"\n\"Sometimes regulations are silly,\" said Cassal firmly. \"Let me speak to\nthe first counselor.\"\n\"You are speaking to her,\" she said. Her face disappeared from the\nscreen.\nCassal sighed. So far he hadn't made a good impression.\nTravelers Aid Bureau, in addition to regulations, was abundantly\nsupplied with official curiosity. When the machine finished with him,\nCassal had the feeling he could be recreated from the record it had of\nhim. His individuality had been capsuled into a series of questions and\nanswers. One thing he drew the line at\u2014why he wanted to go to Tunney\n21 was his own business.\nThe first counselor reappeared. Age, indeterminate. Not, he supposed,\nthat anyone would be curious about it. Slightly taller than average,\nrather on the slender side. Face was broad at the brow, narrow at the\nchin and her eyes were enigmatic. A dangerous woman.\nShe glanced down at the data. \"Denton Cassal, native of Earth.\nDestination, Tunney 21.\" She looked up at him. \"Occupation, sales\nengineer. Isn't that an odd combination?\" Her smile was quite superior.\n\"Not at all. Scientific training as an engineer. Special knowledge of\ncustomer relations.\"\n\"Special knowledge of a thousand races? How convenient.\" Her eyebrows\narched.\n\"I think so,\" he agreed blandly. \"Anything else you'd like to know?\"\n\"Sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.\"\nHe could believe that or not as he wished. He didn't.\n\"You refused to answer why you were going to Tunney 21. Perhaps I can\nguess. They're the best scientists in the Galaxy. You wish to study\nunder them.\"\nClose\u2014but wrong on two counts. They were good scientists, though not\nnecessarily the best. For instance, it was doubtful that they could\nbuild Dimanche, even if they had ever thought of it, which was even\nless likely.\nThere was, however, one relatively obscure research worker on Tunney 21\nthat Neuronics wanted on their staff. If the fragments of his studies\nthat had reached Earth across the vast distance meant anything, he\ncould help Neuronics perfect instantaneous radio. The company that\ncould build a radio to span the reaches of the Galaxy with no time lag\ncould set its own price, which could be control of all communications,\ntransport, trade\u2014a galactic monopoly. Cassal's share would be a cut of\nall that.\nHis part was simple, on the surface. He was to persuade that researcher\nto come to Earth,\nif he could\n. Literally, he had to guess the\nTunnesian's price before the Tunnesian himself knew it. In addition,\nthe reputation of Tunnesian scientists being exceeded only by their\narrogance, Cassal had to convince him that he wouldn't be working\nfor ignorant Earth savages. The existence of such an instrument as\nDimanche was a key factor.\nHer voice broke through his thoughts. \"Now, then, what's your problem?\"\n\"I was told on Earth I might have to wait a few days on Godolph. I've\nbeen here three weeks. I want information on the ship bound for Tunney\n21.\"\n\"Just a moment.\" She glanced at something below the angle of the\nscreen. She looked up and her eyes were grave. \"\nRickrock C\narrived\nyesterday. Departed for Tunney early this morning.\"\n\"Departed?\" He got up and sat down again, swallowing hard. \"When will\nthe next ship arrive?\"\n\"Do you know how many stars there are in the Galaxy?\" she asked.\nHe didn't answer.\n\"That's right,\" she said. \"Billions. Tunney, according to the notation,\nis near the center of the Galaxy, inside the third ring. You've\ncovered about a third of the distance to it. Local traffic, anything\nwithin a thousand light-years, is relatively easy to manage. At longer\ndistances, you take a chance. You've had yours and missed it. Frankly,\nCassal, I don't know when another ship bound for Tunney will show up on\nor near Godolph. Within the next five years\u2014maybe.\"\nHe blanched. \"How long would it take to get there using local\ntransportation, star-hopping?\"\n\"Take my advice: don't try it. Five years, if you're lucky.\"\n\"I don't need that kind of luck.\"\n\"I suppose not.\" She hesitated. \"You're determined to go on?\" At the\nemphatic nod, she sighed. \"If that's your decision, we'll try to help\nyou. To start things moving, we'll need a print of your identification\ntab.\"\n\"There's something funny about her,\" Dimanche decided. It was the usual\nspeaking voice of the instrument, no louder than the noise the blood\nmade in coursing through arteries and veins. Cassal could hear it\nplainly, because it was virtually inside his ear.\nCassal ignored his private voice. \"Identification tab? I don't have it\nwith me. In fact, I may have lost it.\"\nShe smiled in instant disbelief. \"We're not trying to pry into any\npart of your past you may wish concealed. However, it's much easier\nfor us to help you if you have your identification. Now if you can't\nremember\nyour real name and where you put your identification\u2014\" She\narose and left the screen. \"Just a moment.\"\nHe glared uneasily at the spot where the first counselor wasn't. His\nreal\nname!\n\"Relax,\" Dimanche suggested. \"She didn't mean it as a personal insult.\"\nPresently she returned.\n\"I have news for you, whoever you are.\"\n\"Cassal,\" he said firmly. \"Denton Cassal, sales engineer, Earth. If you\ndon't believe it, send back to\u2014\" He stopped. It had taken him four\nmonths to get to Godolph, non-stop, plus a six-month wait on Earth for\na ship to show up that was bound in the right direction. Over distances\nsuch as these, it just wasn't practical to send back to Earth for\nanything.\n\"I see you understand.\" She glanced at the card in her hand. \"The\nspaceport records indicate that when\nRickrock C\ntook off this\nmorning, there was a Denton Cassal on board, bound for Tunney 21.\"\n\"It wasn't I,\" he said dazedly. He knew who it was, though. The man who\nhad tried to kill him last night. The reason for the attack now became\nclear. The thug had wanted his identification tab. Worse, he had gotten\nit.\n\"No doubt it wasn't,\" she said wearily. \"Outsiders don't seem to\nunderstand what galactic travel entails.\"\nOutsiders? Evidently what she called those who lived beyond the second\ntransfer ring. Were those who lived at the edge of the Galaxy, beyond\nthe first ring, called Rimmers? Probably.\nShe was still speaking: \"Ten years to cross the Galaxy, without\nstopping. At present, no ship is capable of that. Real scheduling is\nimpossible. Populations shift and have to be supplied. A ship is taken\noff a run for repairs and is never put back on. It's more urgently\nneeded elsewhere. The man who depended on it is left waiting; years\npass before he learns it's never coming.\n\"If we had instantaneous radio, that would help. Confusion wouldn't\nvanish overnight, but it would diminish. We wouldn't have to depend\non ships for all the news. Reservations could be made ahead of time,\ncredit established, lost identification replaced\u2014\"\n\"I've traveled before,\" he interrupted stiffly. \"I've never had any\ntrouble.\"\nShe seemed to be exaggerating the difficulties. True, the center was\nmore congested. Taking each star as the starting point for a limited\nnumber of ships and using statistical probability as a guide\u2014why, no\nman would arrive at his predetermined destination.\nBut that wasn't the way it worked. Manifestly, you couldn't compare\ngalactic transportation to the erratic paths of air molecules in a\ngiant room. Or could you?\nFor the average man, anyone who didn't have his own inter-stellar ship,\nwas the comparison too apt? It might be.\n\"You've traveled outside, where there are still free planets waiting to\nbe settled. Where a man is welcome, if he's able to work.\" She paused.\n\"The center is different. Populations are excessive. Inside the third\nring, no man is allowed off a ship without an identification tab. They\ndon't encourage immigration.\"\nIn effect, that meant no ship bound for the center would take a\npassenger without identification. No ship owner would run the risk of\nhaving a permanent guest on board, someone who couldn't be rid of when\nhis money was gone.\nCassal held his head in his hands. Tunney 21 was inside the third ring.\n\"Next time,\" she said, \"don't let anyone take your identification.\"\n\"I won't,\" he promised grimly.\nThe woman looked directly at him. Her eyes were bright. He revised his\nestimate of her age drastically downward. She couldn't be as old as he.\nNothing outward had happened, but she no longer seemed dowdy. Not that\nhe was interested. Still, it might pay him to be friendly to the first\ncounselor.\n\"We're a philanthropic agency,\" said Murra Foray. \"Your case is\nspecial, though\u2014\"\n\"I understand,\" he said gruffly. \"You accept contributions.\"\nShe nodded. \"If the donor is able to give. We don't ask so much that\nyou'll have to compromise your standard of living.\" But she named a sum\nthat would force him to do just that if getting to Tunney 21 took any\nappreciable time.\nHe stared at her unhappily. \"I suppose it's worth it. I can always\nwork, if I have to.\"\n\"As a salesman?\" she asked. \"I'm afraid you'll find it difficult to do\nbusiness with Godolphians.\"\nIrony wasn't called for at a time like this, he thought reproachfully.\n\"Not just another salesman,\" he answered definitely. \"I have special\nknowledge of customer reactions. I can tell exactly\u2014\"\nHe stopped abruptly. Was she baiting him? For what reason? The\ninstrument he called Dimanche was not known to the Galaxy at large.\nFrom the business angle, it would be poor policy to hand out that\ninformation at random. Aside from that, he needed every advantage he\ncould get. Dimanche was his special advantage.\n\"Anyway,\" he finished lamely, \"I'm a first class engineer. I can\nalways find something in that line.\"\n\"A scientist, maybe,\" murmured Murra Foray. \"But in this part of the\nMilky Way, an engineer is regarded as merely a technician who hasn't\nyet gained practical experience.\" She shook her head. \"You'll do better\nas a salesman.\"\nHe got up, glowering. \"If that's all\u2014\"\n\"It is. We'll keep you informed. Drop your contribution in the slot\nprovided for that purpose as you leave.\"\nA door, which he hadn't noticed in entering the counselling cubicle,\nswung open. The agency was efficient.\n\"Remember,\" the counselor called out as he left, \"identification is\nhard to work with. Don't accept a crude forgery.\"\nHe didn't answer, but it was an idea worth considering. The agency was\nalso eminently practical.\nThe exit path guided him firmly to an inconspicuous and yet inescapable\ncontribution station. He began to doubt the philanthropic aspect of the\nbureau.\n\"I've got it,\" said Dimanche as Cassal gloomily counted out the sum the\nfirst counselor had named.\n\"Got what?\" asked Cassal. He rolled the currency into a neat bundle,\nattached his name, and dropped it into the chute.\n\"The woman, Murra Foray, the first counselor. She's a Huntner.\"\n\"What's a Huntner?\"\n\"A sub-race of men on the other side of the Galaxy. She was vocalizing\nabout her home planet when I managed to locate her.\"\n\"Any other information?\"\n\"None. Electronic guards were sliding into place as soon as I reached\nher. I got out as fast as I could.\"\n\"I see.\" The significance of that, if any, escaped him. Nevertheless,\nit sounded depressing.\n\"What I want to know is,\" said Dimanche, \"why such precautions as\nelectronic guards? What does Travelers Aid have that's so secret?\"\nCassal grunted and didn't answer. Dimanche could be annoyingly\ninquisitive at times.\nCassal had entered one side of a block-square building. He came out on\nthe other side. The agency was larger than he had thought. The old man\nwas staring at a door as Cassal came out. He had apparently changed\nevery sign in the building. His work finished, the technician was\nremoving the visual projector from his head as Cassal came up to him.\nHe turned and peered.\n\"You stuck here, too?\" he asked in the uneven voice of the aged.\n\"Stuck?\" repeated Cassal. \"I suppose you can call it that. I'm waiting\nfor my ship.\" He frowned. He was the one who wanted to ask questions.\n\"Why all the redecoration? I thought Travelers Aid was an old agency.\nWhy did you change so many signs? I could understand it if the agency\nwere new.\"\nThe old man chuckled. \"Re-organization. The previous first counselor\nresigned suddenly, in the middle of the night, they say. The new one\ndidn't like the name of the agency, so she ordered it changed.\"\nShe would do just that, thought Cassal. \"What about this Murra Foray?\"\nThe old man winked mysteriously. He opened his mouth and then seemed\novercome with senile fright. Hurriedly he shuffled away.\nCassal gazed after him, baffled. The old man was afraid for his job,\nafraid of the first counselor. Why he should be, Cassal didn't know. He\nshrugged and went on. The agency was now in motion in his behalf, but\nhe didn't intend to depend on that alone.\n", "summary": "Dimanche is a human pedestrian on the streets of Godolph, a city in the universe. He is standing on the walkway near the brink of a busy thoroughfare when a man named Cassal approaches him. Dimanche is suspicious of the man, and is suspicious that he is following him. He tries to run away, but the man follows him and threatens him. The man follows Dimanche back to his hotel, and Dimanche decides to go to the police. He goes to the hotel, but is unable to find a taxi. He decides to walk back to the city, but he is followed by the man who is following. Dimanches is scared of the stranger, and he is unable for the first time to identify the man. He realizes that the man is the same man who tried to kill him, and the man has been following him for a while. Dimanch is scared because he has never seen the man before, and does not know his intentions. He does not want to report the man to the authorities, but decides to ask him to help him. When Dimanche refuses, the man offers to help Dimanche find a doctor. Dimache is shocked at the offer, but accepts it. He has been followed for a long time, and has never met the man in person before. He thinks that the stranger is a spy, and wants to kill Dimanche. He asks the man why he would want to kill someone, and when he has been warned about his intentions by the police about his actions. The stranger tells Dimanche that he has a secret plan to kill people. Dimange, and that he will do it himself. Dimaine, and then the man tells him that he wants to be caught with a knife. Dimanie, the stranger who is chasing him, is the one who is trying to kill the man and wants Dimanche to help. Dimane is shocked by this, and thinks that he must be crazy. He tells the man that he can help him, but that he cannot help him because he is a foreigner. The police are not allowed to help foreigners, and they have no interest in helping aliens. Dimanke is scared that the police will come and arrest him, so he decides to run. He runs back to Dimanche, and after he leaves the hotel he sees the man again. Dimaney is scared, and tries to hide his face, but it is revealed that the woman who is with him is actually the woman that tried to rape him. She is the woman he is protecting, and she is the wife of the police officer who tried and failed to kill his partner. Dimanne is scared to tell her that he knows that the knife was a fake, and it is the reason that he tried to run, but she refuses to believe him.   The woman offers to take Dimanche home, but Dimanche does not accept. He refuses, and goes to his room, where he is attacked by the woman. He screams, and her screams become more violent. He wakes up in a hospital, and a doctor comes to his bed, and tells him to get some rest. Dimagne is shocked that the girl is unconscious, and asks him to take her to the hospital. He leaves the hospital, but then goes to see the doctor. He sees the woman, and realizes that she is unconscious. He calls the police, and there is blood all over her. He rushes to her.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, null]}

WALLACE\nIllustrated by SIBLEY\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nGalaxy Science Fiction September 1952.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nAn unprovoked, meaningless night attack is\nterrifying enough on your own home planet, worse\non a world across the Galaxy. But the horror\nis the offer of help that cannot be accepted!\n\"Muscles tense,\" said Dimanche. \"Neural index 1.76, unusually high.\nAdrenalin squirting through his system. In effect, he's stalking you.\nIntent: probably assault with a deadly weapon.\"\n\"Not interested,\" said Cassal firmly, his subvocalization inaudible\nto anyone but Dimanche. \"I'm not the victim type. He was standing on\nthe walkway near the brink of the thoroughfare. I'm going back to the\nhabitat hotel and sit tight.\"\n\"First you have to get there,\" Dimanche pointed out. \"I mean, is it\nsafe for a stranger to walk through the city?\"\n\"Now that you mention it, no,\" answered Cassal. He looked around\napprehensively. \"Where is he?\"\n\"Behind you. At the moment he's pretending interest in a merchandise\ndisplay.\"\nA native stamped by, eyes brown and incurious. Apparently he was\naccustomed to the sight of an Earthman standing alone, Adam's apple\nbobbing up and down silently. It was a Godolphian axiom that all\ntravelers were crazy.\nCassal looked up. Not an air taxi in sight; Godolph shut down at dusk.\nIt would be pure luck if he found a taxi before morning. Of course he\ncould\nwalk back to the hotel, but was that such a good idea?\nA Godolphian city was peculiar. And, though not intended, it was\npeculiarly suited to certain kinds of violence. A human pedestrian was\nat a definite disadvantage.\n\"Correction,\" said Dimanche. \"Not simple assault. He has murder in\nmind.\"\n\"It still doesn't appeal to me,\" said Cassal. Striving to look\nunconcerned, he strolled toward the building side of the walkway and\nstared into the interior of a small cafe. Warm, bright and dry. Inside,\nhe might find safety for a time.\nDamn the man who was following him! It would be easy enough to elude\nhim in a normal city. On Godolph, nothing was normal. In an hour the\nstreets would be brightly lighted\u2014for native eyes. A human would\nconsider it dim.\n\"Why did he choose me?\" asked Cassal plaintively. \"There must be\nsomething he hopes to gain.\"\n\"I'm working on it,\" said Dimanche. \"But remember, I have limitations.\nAt short distances I can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret\nphysiological data. I can't read minds. The best I can do is report\nwhat a person says or subvocalizes. If you're really interested in\nfinding out why he wants to kill you, I suggest you turn the problem\nover to the godawful police.\"\n\"Godolph, not godawful,\" corrected Cassal absently.\nThat was advice he couldn't follow, good as it seemed. He could give\nthe police no evidence save through Dimanche. There were various\nreasons, many of them involving the law, for leaving the device called\nDimanche out of it. The police would act if they found a body. His own,\nsay, floating face-down on some quiet street. That didn't seem the\nproper approach, either.\n\"Weapons?\"\n\"The first thing I searched him for. Nothing very dangerous. A long\nknife, a hard striking object. Both concealed on his person.\"\nCassal strangled slightly. Dimanche needed a good stiff course in\nsemantics. A knife was still the most silent of weapons. A man could\ndie from it. His hand strayed toward his pocket. He had a measure of\nprotection himself.\n\"Report,\" said Dimanche. \"Not necessarily final. Based, perhaps, on\ntenuous evidence.\"\n\"Let's have it anyway.\"\n\"His motivation is connected somehow with your being marooned here. For\nsome reason you can't get off this planet.\"\nThat was startling information, though not strictly true. A thousand\nstar systems were waiting for him, and a ship to take him to each one.\nOf course, the one ship he wanted hadn't come in. Godolph was a\ntransfer point for stars nearer the center of the Galaxy. When he\nhad left Earth, he had known he would have to wait a few days here.\nHe hadn't expected a delay of nearly three weeks. Still, it wasn't\nunusual. Interstellar schedules over great distances were not as\nreliable as they might be.\nWas this man, whoever and whatever he might be, connected with\nthat delay? According to Dimanche, the man thought he was. He was\nself-deluded or did he have access to information that Cassal didn't?\nDenton Cassal, sales engineer, paused for a mental survey of himself.\nHe was a good engineer and, because he was exceptionally well matched\nto his instrument, the best salesman that Neuronics, Inc., had. On the\nbasis of these qualifications, he had been selected to make a long\njourney, the first part of which already lay behind him. He had to go\nto Tunney 21 to see a man. That man wasn't important to anyone save the\ncompany that employed him, and possibly not even to them.\nThe thug trailing him wouldn't be interested in Cassal himself, his\nmission, which was a commercial one, nor the man on Tunney. And money\nwasn't the objective, if Dimanche's analysis was right. What\ndid\nthe\nthug want?\nSecrets? Cassal had none, except, in a sense, Dimanche. And that was\ntoo well kept on Earth, where the instrument was invented and made, for\nanyone this far away to have learned about it.\nAnd yet the thug wanted to kill him. Wanted to? Regarded him as good as\ndead. It might pay him to investigate the matter further, if it didn't\ninvolve too much risk.\n\"Better start moving.\" That was Dimanche. \"He's getting suspicious.\"\nCassal went slowly along the narrow walkway that bordered each side of\nthat boulevard, the transport tide. It was raining again. It usually\nwas on Godolph, which was a weather-controlled planet where the natives\nlike rain.\nHe adjusted the controls of the weak force field that repelled the\nrain. He widened the angle of the field until water slanted through it\nunhindered. He narrowed it around him until it approached visibility\nand the drops bounced away. He swore at the miserable climate and the\nnear amphibians who created it.\nA few hundred feet away, a Godolphian girl waded out of the transport\ntide and climbed to the walkway. It was this sort of thing that made\nlife dangerous for a human\u2014Venice revised, brought up to date in a\nfaster-than-light age.\nWater. It was a perfect engineering material. Simple, cheap, infinitely\nflexible. With a minimum of mechanism and at break-neck speed, the\nribbon of the transport tide flowed at different levels throughout\nthe city. The Godolphian merely plunged in and was carried swiftly\nand noiselessly to his destination. Whereas a human\u2014Cassal shivered.\nIf he were found drowned, it would be considered an accident. No\ninvestigation would be made. The thug who was trailing him had\ncertainly picked the right place.\nThe Godolphian girl passed. She wore a sleek brown fur, her own. Cassal\nwas almost positive she muttered a polite \"Arf?\" as she sloshed by.\nWhat she meant by that, he didn't know and didn't intend to find out.\n\"Follow her,\" instructed Dimanche. \"We've got to investigate our man at\ncloser range.\"\nObediently, Cassal turned and began walking after the girl. Attractive\nin an anthropomorphic, seal-like way, even from behind. Not graceful\nout of her element, though.\nThe would-be assassin was still looking at merchandise as Cassal\nretraced his steps. A man, or at least man type. A big fellow,\nphysically quite capable of violence, if size had anything to do with\nit. The face, though, was out of character. Mild, almost meek. A\nscientist or scholar. It didn't fit with murder.\n\"Nothing,\" said Dimanche disgustedly. \"His mind froze when we got\nclose. I could feel his shoulderblades twitching as we passed.\nAnticipated guilt, of course. Projecting to you the action he plans.\nThat makes the knife definite.\"\nWell beyond the window at which the thug watched and waited, Cassal\nstopped. Shakily he produced a cigarette and fumbled for a lighter.\n\"Excellent thinking,\" commended Dimanche. \"He won't attempt anything\non this street. Too dangerous. Turn aside at the next deserted\nintersection and let him follow the glow of your cigarette.\"\nThe lighter flared in his hand. \"That's one way of finding out,\" said\nCassal. \"But wouldn't I be a lot safer if I just concentrated on\ngetting back to the hotel?\"\n\"I'm curious. Turn here.\"\n\"Go to hell,\" said Cassal nervously. Nevertheless, when he came to that\nintersection, he turned there.\nIt was a Godolphian equivalent of an alley, narrow and dark, oily\nslow-moving water gurgling at one side, high cavernous walls looming on\nthe other.\nHe would have to adjust the curiosity factor of Dimanche. It was all\nvery well to be interested in the man who trailed him, but there was\nalso the problem of coming out of this adventure alive. Dimanche, an\nelectronic instrument, naturally wouldn't consider that.\n\"Easy,\" warned Dimanche. \"He's at the entrance to the alley, walking\nfast. He's surprised and pleased that you took this route.\"\n\"I'm surprised, too,\" remarked Cassal. \"But I wouldn't say I'm pleased.\nNot just now.\"\n\"Careful. Even subvocalized conversation is distracting.\" The mechanism\nconcealed within his body was silent for an instant and then continued:\n\"His blood pressure is rising, breathing is faster. At a time like\nthis, he may be ready to verbalize why he wants to murder you. This is\ncritical.\"\n\"That's no lie,\" agreed Cassal bitterly. The lighter was in his hand.\nHe clutched it grimly. It was difficult not to look back. The darkness\nassumed an even more sinister quality.\n\"Quiet,\" said Dimanche. \"He's verbalizing about you.\"\n\"He's decided I'm a nice fellow after all. He's going to stop and ask\nme for a light.\"\n\"I don't think so,\" answered Dimanche. \"He's whispering: 'Poor devil. I\nhate to do it. But it's really his life or mine'.\"\n\"He's more right than he knows. Why all this violence, though? Isn't\nthere any clue?\"\n\"None at all,\" admitted Dimanche. \"He's very close. You'd better turn\naround.\"\nCassal turned, pressed the stud on the lighter. It should have made him\nfeel more secure, but it didn't. He could see very little.\nA dim shadow rushed at him. He jumped away from the water side of the\nalley, barely in time. He could feel the rush of air as the assailant\nshot by.\n\"Hey!\" shouted Cassal.\nEchoes answered; nothing else did. He had the uncomfortable feeling\nthat no one was going to come to his assistance.\n\"He wasn't expecting that reaction,\" explained Dimanche. \"That's why he\nmissed. He's turned around and is coming back.\"\n\"I'm armed!\" shouted Cassal.\n\"That won't stop him. He doesn't believe you.\"\nCassal grasped the lighter. That is, it had been a lighter a few\nseconds before. Now a needle-thin blade had snapped out and projected\nstiffly. Originally it had been designed as an emergency surgical\ninstrument. A little imagination and a few changes had altered its\nfunction, converting it into a compact, efficient stiletto.\n\"Twenty feet away,\" advised Dimanche. \"He knows you can't see him, but\nhe can see your silhouette by the light from the main thoroughfare.\nWhat he doesn't know is that I can detect every move he makes and keep\nyou posted below the level of his hearing.\"\n\"Stay on him,\" growled Cassal nervously. He flattened himself against\nthe wall.\n\"To the right,\" whispered Dimanche. \"Lunge forward. About five feet.\nLow.\"\nSickly, he did so. He didn't care to consider the possible effects of\na miscalculation. In the darkness, how far was five feet? Fortunately,\nhis estimate was correct. The rapier encountered yielding resistance,\nthe soggy kind: flesh. The tough blade bent, but did not break. His\nopponent gasped and broke away.\n\"Attack!\" howled Dimanche against the bone behind his ear. \"You've got\nhim. He can't imagine how you know where he is in the darkness. He's\nafraid.\"\nAttack he did, slicing about wildly. Some of the thrusts landed; some\ndidn't. The percentage was low, the total amount high. His opponent\nfell to the ground, gasped and was silent.\nCassal fumbled in his pockets and flipped on a light. The man lay near\nthe water side of the alley. One leg was crumpled under him. He didn't\nmove.\n\"Heartbeat slow,\" said Dimanche solemnly. \"Breathing barely\nperceptible.\"\n\"Then he's not dead,\" said Cassal in relief.\nFoam flecked from the still lips and ran down the chin. Blood oozed\nfrom cuts on the face.\n\"Respiration none, heartbeat absent,\" stated Dimanche.\nHorrified, Cassal gazed at the body. Self-defense, of course, but\nwould the police believe it? Assuming they did, they'd still have to\ninvestigate. The rapier was an illegal concealed weapon. And they would\nquestion him until they discovered Dimanche. Regrettable, but what\ncould he do about it?\nSuppose he were detained long enough to miss the ship bound for Tunney\n21?\nGrimly, he laid down the rapier. He might as well get to the bottom of\nthis. Why had the man attacked? What did he want?\n\"I don't know,\" replied Dimanche irritably. \"I can interpret body\ndata\u2014a live body. I can't work on a piece of meat.\"\nCassal searched the body thoroughly. Miscellaneous personal articles\nof no value in identifying the man. A clip with a startling amount\nof money in it. A small white card with something scribbled on it. A\npicture of a woman and a small child posed against a background which\nresembled no world Cassal had ever seen. That was all.\nCassal stood up in bewilderment. Dimanche to the contrary, there seemed\nto be no connection between this dead man and his own problem of\ngetting to Tunney 21.\nRight now, though, he had to dispose of the body. He glanced toward the\nboulevard. So far no one had been attracted by the violence.\nHe bent down to retrieve the lighter-rapier. Dimanche shouted at him.\nBefore he could react, someone landed on him. He fell forward, vainly\ntrying to grasp the weapon. Strong fingers felt for his throat as he\nwas forced to the ground.\nHe threw the attacker off and staggered to his feet. He heard footsteps\nrushing away. A slight splash followed. Whoever it was, he was escaping\nby way of water.\nWhoever it was. The man he had thought he had slain was no longer in\nsight.\n\"Interpret body data, do you?\" muttered Cassal. \"Liveliest dead man\nI've ever been strangled by.\"\n\"It's just possible there are some breeds of men who can control the\nbasic functions of their body,\" said Dimanche defensively. \"When I\nchecked him, he had no heartbeat.\"\n\"Remind me not to accept your next evaluation so completely,\" grunted\nCassal. Nevertheless, he was relieved, in a fashion. He hadn't\nwanted\nto kill the man. And now there was nothing he'd have to explain to the\npolice.\nHe needed the cigarette he stuck between his lips. For the second\ntime he attempted to pick up the rapier-lighter. This time he was\nsuccessful. Smoke swirled into his lungs and quieted his nerves. He\nsqueezed the weapon into the shape of a lighter and put it away.\nSomething, however, was missing\u2014his wallet.\nThe thug had relieved him of it in the second round of the scuffle.\nPersistent fellow. Damned persistent.\nIt really didn't matter. He fingered the clip he had taken from the\nsupposedly dead body. He had intended to turn it over to the police.\nNow he might as well keep it to reimburse him for his loss. It\ncontained more money than his wallet had.\nExcept for the identification tab he always carried in his wallet, it\nwas more than a fair exchange. The identification, a rectangular piece\nof plastic, was useful in establishing credit, but with the money he\nnow had, he wouldn't need credit. If he did, he could always send for\nanother tab.\nA white card fluttered from the clip. He caught it as it fell.\nCuriously he examined it. Blank except for one crudely printed word,\nSTAB. His unknown assailant certainly had tried.\nThe old man stared at the door, an obsolete visual projector wobbling\nprecariously on his head. He closed his eyes and the lettering on the\ndoor disappeared. Cassal was too far away to see what it had been. The\ntechnician opened his eyes and concentrated. Slowly a new sign formed\non the door.\nTRAVELERS AID BUREAU\nMurra Foray, First Counselor\nIt was a drab sign, but, then, it was a dismal, backward planet. The\nold technician passed on to the next door and closed his eyes again.\nWith a sinking feeling, Cassal walked toward the entrance. He needed\nhelp and he had to find it in this dingy rathole.\nInside, though, it wasn't dingy and it wasn't a rathole. More like a\nmaze, an approved scientific one. Efficient, though not comfortable.\nTravelers Aid was busier than he thought it would be. Eventually he\nmanaged to squeeze into one of the many small counseling rooms.\nA woman appeared on the screen, crisp and cool. \"Please answer\neverything the machine asks. When the tape is complete, I'll be\navailable for consultation.\"\nCassal wasn't sure he was going to like her. \"Is this necessary?\" he\nasked. \"It's merely a matter of information.\"\n\"We have certain regulations we abide by.\" The woman smiled frostily.\n\"I can't give you any information until you comply with them.\"\n\"Sometimes regulations are silly,\" said Cassal firmly. \"Let me speak to\nthe first counselor.\"\n\"You are speaking to her,\" she said. Her face disappeared from the\nscreen.\nCassal sighed. So far he hadn't made a good impression.\nTravelers Aid Bureau, in addition to regulations, was abundantly\nsupplied with official curiosity. When the machine finished with him,\nCassal had the feeling he could be recreated from the record it had of\nhim. His individuality had been capsuled into a series of questions and\nanswers. One thing he drew the line at\u2014why he wanted to go to Tunney\n21 was his own business.\nThe first counselor reappeared. Age, indeterminate. Not, he supposed,\nthat anyone would be curious about it. Slightly taller than average,\nrather on the slender side. Face was broad at the brow, narrow at the\nchin and her eyes were enigmatic. A dangerous woman.\nShe glanced down at the data. \"Denton Cassal, native of Earth.\nDestination, Tunney 21.\" She looked up at him. \"Occupation, sales\nengineer. Isn't that an odd combination?\" Her smile was quite superior.\n\"Not at all. Scientific training as an engineer. Special knowledge of\ncustomer relations.\"\n\"Special knowledge of a thousand races? How convenient.\" Her eyebrows\narched.\n\"I think so,\" he agreed blandly. \"Anything else you'd like to know?\"\n\"Sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.\"\nHe could believe that or not as he wished. He didn't.\n\"You refused to answer why you were going to Tunney 21. Perhaps I can\nguess. They're the best scientists in the Galaxy. You wish to study\nunder them.\"\nClose\u2014but wrong on two counts. They were good scientists, though not\nnecessarily the best. For instance, it was doubtful that they could\nbuild Dimanche, even if they had ever thought of it, which was even\nless likely.\nThere was, however, one relatively obscure research worker on Tunney 21\nthat Neuronics wanted on their staff. If the fragments of his studies\nthat had reached Earth across the vast distance meant anything, he\ncould help Neuronics perfect instantaneous radio. The company that\ncould build a radio to span the reaches of the Galaxy with no time lag\ncould set its own price, which could be control of all communications,\ntransport, trade\u2014a galactic monopoly. Cassal's share would be a cut of\nall that.\nHis part was simple, on the surface. He was to persuade that researcher\nto come to Earth,\nif he could\n. Literally, he had to guess the\nTunnesian's price before the Tunnesian himself knew it. In addition,\nthe reputation of Tunnesian scientists being exceeded only by their\narrogance, Cassal had to convince him that he wouldn't be working\nfor ignorant Earth savages. The existence of such an instrument as\nDimanche was a key factor.\nHer voice broke through his thoughts. \"Now, then, what's your problem?\"\n\"I was told on Earth I might have to wait a few days on Godolph. I've\nbeen here three weeks. I want information on the ship bound for Tunney\n21.\"\n\"Just a moment.\" She glanced at something below the angle of the\nscreen. She looked up and her eyes were grave. \"\nRickrock C\narrived\nyesterday. Departed for Tunney early this morning.\"\n\"Departed?\" He got up and sat down again, swallowing hard. \"When will\nthe next ship arrive?\"\n\"Do you know how many stars there are in the Galaxy?\" she asked.\nHe didn't answer.\n\"That's right,\" she said. \"Billions. Tunney, according to the notation,\nis near the center of the Galaxy, inside the third ring. You've\ncovered about a third of the distance to it. Local traffic, anything\nwithin a thousand light-years, is relatively easy to manage. At longer\ndistances, you take a chance. You've had yours and missed it. Frankly,\nCassal, I don't know when another ship bound for Tunney will show up on\nor near Godolph. Within the next five years\u2014maybe.\"\nHe blanched. \"How long would it take to get there using local\ntransportation, star-hopping?\"\n\"Take my advice: don't try it. Five years, if you're lucky.\"\n\"I don't need that kind of luck.\"\n\"I suppose not.\" She hesitated. \"You're determined to go on?\" At the\nemphatic nod, she sighed. \"If that's your decision, we'll try to help\nyou. To start things moving, we'll need a print of your identification\ntab.\"\n\"There's something funny about her,\" Dimanche decided. It was the usual\nspeaking voice of the instrument, no louder than the noise the blood\nmade in coursing through arteries and veins. Cassal could hear it\nplainly, because it was virtually inside his ear.\nCassal ignored his private voice. \"Identification tab? I don't have it\nwith me. In fact, I may have lost it.\"\nShe smiled in instant disbelief. \"We're not trying to pry into any\npart of your past you may wish concealed. However, it's much easier\nfor us to help you if you have your identification. Now if you can't\nremember\nyour real name and where you put your identification\u2014\" She\narose and left the screen. \"Just a moment.\"\nHe glared uneasily at the spot where the first counselor wasn't. His\nreal\nname!\n\"Relax,\" Dimanche suggested. \"She didn't mean it as a personal insult.\"\nPresently she returned.\n\"I have news for you, whoever you are.\"\n\"Cassal,\" he said firmly. \"Denton Cassal, sales engineer, Earth. If you\ndon't believe it, send back to\u2014\" He stopped. It had taken him four\nmonths to get to Godolph, non-stop, plus a six-month wait on Earth for\na ship to show up that was bound in the right direction. Over distances\nsuch as these, it just wasn't practical to send back to Earth for\nanything.\n\"I see you understand.\" She glanced at the card in her hand. \"The\nspaceport records indicate that when\nRickrock C\ntook off this\nmorning, there was a Denton Cassal on board, bound for Tunney 21.\"\n\"It wasn't I,\" he said dazedly. He knew who it was, though. The man who\nhad tried to kill him last night. The reason for the attack now became\nclear. The thug had wanted his identification tab. Worse, he had gotten\nit.\n\"No doubt it wasn't,\" she said wearily. \"Outsiders don't seem to\nunderstand what galactic travel entails.\"\nOutsiders? Evidently what she called those who lived beyond the second\ntransfer ring. Were those who lived at the edge of the Galaxy, beyond\nthe first ring, called Rimmers? Probably.\nShe was still speaking: \"Ten years to cross the Galaxy, without\nstopping. At present, no ship is capable of that. Real scheduling is\nimpossible. Populations shift and have to be supplied. A ship is taken\noff a run for repairs and is never put back on. It's more urgently\nneeded elsewhere. The man who depended on it is left waiting; years\npass before he learns it's never coming.\n\"If we had instantaneous radio, that would help. Confusion wouldn't\nvanish overnight, but it would diminish. We wouldn't have to depend\non ships for all the news. Reservations could be made ahead of time,\ncredit established, lost identification replaced\u2014\"\n\"I've traveled before,\" he interrupted stiffly. \"I've never had any\ntrouble.\"\nShe seemed to be exaggerating the difficulties. True, the center was\nmore congested. Taking each star as the starting point for a limited\nnumber of ships and using statistical probability as a guide\u2014why, no\nman would arrive at his predetermined destination.\nBut that wasn't the way it worked. Manifestly, you couldn't compare\ngalactic transportation to the erratic paths of air molecules in a\ngiant room. Or could you?\nFor the average man, anyone who didn't have his own inter-stellar ship,\nwas the comparison too apt? It might be.\n\"You've traveled outside, where there are still free planets waiting to\nbe settled. Where a man is welcome, if he's able to work.\" She paused.\n\"The center is different. Populations are excessive. Inside the third\nring, no man is allowed off a ship without an identification tab. They\ndon't encourage immigration.\"\nIn effect, that meant no ship bound for the center would take a\npassenger without identification. No ship owner would run the risk of\nhaving a permanent guest on board, someone who couldn't be rid of when\nhis money was gone.\nCassal held his head in his hands. Tunney 21 was inside the third ring.\n\"Next time,\" she said, \"don't let anyone take your identification.\"\n\"I won't,\" he promised grimly.\nThe woman looked directly at him. Her eyes were bright. He revised his\nestimate of her age drastically downward. She couldn't be as old as he.\nNothing outward had happened, but she no longer seemed dowdy. Not that\nhe was interested. Still, it might pay him to be friendly to the first\ncounselor.\n\"We're a philanthropic agency,\" said Murra Foray. \"Your case is\nspecial, though\u2014\"\n\"I understand,\" he said gruffly. \"You accept contributions.\"\nShe nodded. \"If the donor is able to give. We don't ask so much that\nyou'll have to compromise your standard of living.\" But she named a sum\nthat would force him to do just that if getting to Tunney 21 took any\nappreciable time.\nHe stared at her unhappily. \"I suppose it's worth it. I can always\nwork, if I have to.\"\n\"As a salesman?\" she asked. \"I'm afraid you'll find it difficult to do\nbusiness with Godolphians.\"\nIrony wasn't called for at a time like this, he thought reproachfully.\n\"Not just another salesman,\" he answered definitely. \"I have special\nknowledge of customer reactions. I can tell exactly\u2014\"\nHe stopped abruptly. Was she baiting him? For what reason? The\ninstrument he called Dimanche was not known to the Galaxy at large.\nFrom the business angle, it would be poor policy to hand out that\ninformation at random. Aside from that, he needed every advantage he\ncould get. Dimanche was his special advantage.\n\"Anyway,\" he finished lamely, \"I'm a first class engineer. I can\nalways find something in that line.\"\n\"A scientist, maybe,\" murmured Murra Foray. \"But in this part of the\nMilky Way, an engineer is regarded as merely a technician who hasn't\nyet gained practical experience.\" She shook her head. \"You'll do better\nas a salesman.\"\nHe got up, glowering. \"If that's all\u2014\"\n\"It is. We'll keep you informed. Drop your contribution in the slot\nprovided for that purpose as you leave.\"\nA door, which he hadn't noticed in entering the counselling cubicle,\nswung open. The agency was efficient.\n\"Remember,\" the counselor called out as he left, \"identification is\nhard to work with. Don't accept a crude forgery.\"\nHe didn't answer, but it was an idea worth considering. The agency was\nalso eminently practical.\nThe exit path guided him firmly to an inconspicuous and yet inescapable\ncontribution station. He began to doubt the philanthropic aspect of the\nbureau.\n\"I've got it,\" said Dimanche as Cassal gloomily counted out the sum the\nfirst counselor had named.\n\"Got what?\" asked Cassal. He rolled the currency into a neat bundle,\nattached his name, and dropped it into the chute.\n\"The woman, Murra Foray, the first counselor. She's a Huntner.\"\n\"What's a Huntner?\"\n\"A sub-race of men on the other side of the Galaxy. She was vocalizing\nabout her home planet when I managed to locate her.\"\n\"Any other information?\"\n\"None. Electronic guards were sliding into place as soon as I reached\nher. I got out as fast as I could.\"\n\"I see.\" The significance of that, if any, escaped him. Nevertheless,\nit sounded depressing.\n\"What I want to know is,\" said Dimanche, \"why such precautions as\nelectronic guards? What does Travelers Aid have that's so secret?\"\nCassal grunted and didn't answer. Dimanche could be annoyingly\ninquisitive at times.\nCassal had entered one side of a block-square building. He came out on\nthe other side. The agency was larger than he had thought. The old man\nwas staring at a door as Cassal came out. He had apparently changed\nevery sign in the building. His work finished, the technician was\nremoving the visual projector from his head as Cassal came up to him.\nHe turned and peered.\n\"You stuck here, too?\" he asked in the uneven voice of the aged.\n\"Stuck?\" repeated Cassal. \"I suppose you can call it that. I'm waiting\nfor my ship.\" He frowned. He was the one who wanted to ask questions.\n\"Why all the redecoration? I thought Travelers Aid was an old agency.\nWhy did you change so many signs? I could understand it if the agency\nwere new.\"\nThe old man chuckled. \"Re-organization. The previous first counselor\nresigned suddenly, in the middle of the night, they say. The new one\ndidn't like the name of the agency, so she ordered it changed.\"\nShe would do just that, thought Cassal. \"What about this Murra Foray?\"\nThe old man winked mysteriously. He opened his mouth and then seemed\novercome with senile fright. Hurriedly he shuffled away.\nCassal gazed after him, baffled. The old man was afraid for his job,\nafraid of the first counselor. Why he should be, Cassal didn't know. He\nshrugged and went on. The agency was now in motion in his behalf, but\nhe didn't intend to depend on that alone.\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nDELAY IN TRANSIT\nBy F. L. WALLACE\nIllustrated by SIBLEY\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nGalaxy Science Fiction September 1952.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nAn unprovoked, meaningless night attack is\nterrifying enough on your own home planet, worse\non a world across the Galaxy. But the horror\nis the offer of help that cannot be accepted!\n\"Muscles tense,\" said Dimanche. \"Neural index 1.76, unusually high.\nAdrenalin squirting through his system. In effect, he's stalking you.\nIntent: probably assault with a deadly weapon.\"\n\"Not interested,\" said Cassal firmly, his subvocalization inaudible\nto anyone but Dimanche. \"I'm not the victim type. He was standing on\nthe walkway near the brink of the thoroughfare. I'm going back to the\nhabitat hotel and sit tight.\"\n\"First you have to get there,\" Dimanche pointed out. \"I mean, is it\nsafe for a stranger to walk through the city?\"\n\"Now that you mention it, no,\" answered Cassal. He looked around\napprehensively. \"Where is he?\"\n\"Behind you. At the moment he's pretending interest in a merchandise\ndisplay.\"\nA native stamped by, eyes brown and incurious. Apparently he was\naccustomed to the sight of an Earthman standing alone, Adam's apple\nbobbing up and down silently. It was a Godolphian axiom that all\ntravelers were crazy.\nCassal looked up. Not an air taxi in sight; Godolph shut down at dusk.\nIt would be pure luck if he found a taxi before morning. Of course he\ncould\nwalk back to the hotel, but was that such a good idea?\nA Godolphian city was peculiar. And, though not intended, it was\npeculiarly suited to certain kinds of violence. A human pedestrian was\nat a definite disadvantage.\n\"Correction,\" said Dimanche. \"Not simple assault. He has murder in\nmind.\"\n\"It still doesn't appeal to me,\" said Cassal. Striving to look\nunconcerned, he strolled toward the building side of the walkway and\nstared into the interior of a small cafe. Warm, bright and dry. Inside,\nhe might find safety for a time.\nDamn the man who was following him! It would be easy enough to elude\nhim in a normal city. On Godolph, nothing was normal. In an hour the\nstreets would be brightly lighted\u2014for native eyes. A human would\nconsider it dim.\n\"Why did he choose me?\" asked Cassal plaintively. \"There must be\nsomething he hopes to gain.\"\n\"I'm working on it,\" said Dimanche. \"But remember, I have limitations.\nAt short distances I can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret\nphysiological data. I can't read minds. The best I can do is report\nwhat a person says or subvocalizes. If you're really interested in\nfinding out why he wants to kill you, I suggest you turn the problem\nover to the godawful police.\"\n\"Godolph, not godawful,\" corrected Cassal absently.\nThat was advice he couldn't follow, good as it seemed. He could give\nthe police no evidence save through Dimanche. There were various\nreasons, many of them involving the law, for leaving the device called\nDimanche out of it. The police would act if they found a body. His own,\nsay, floating face-down on some quiet street. That didn't seem the\nproper approach, either.\n\"Weapons?\"\n\"The first thing I searched him for. Nothing very dangerous. A long\nknife, a hard striking object. Both concealed on his person.\"\nCassal strangled slightly. Dimanche needed a good stiff course in\nsemantics. A knife was still the most silent of weapons. A man could\ndie from it. His hand strayed toward his pocket. He had a measure of\nprotection himself.\n\"Report,\" said Dimanche. \"Not necessarily final. Based, perhaps, on\ntenuous evidence.\"\n\"Let's have it anyway.\"\n\"His motivation is connected somehow with your being marooned here. For\nsome reason you can't get off this planet.\"\nThat was startling information, though not strictly true. A thousand\nstar systems were waiting for him, and a ship to take him to each one.\nOf course, the one ship he wanted hadn't come in. Godolph was a\ntransfer point for stars nearer the center of the Galaxy. When he\nhad left Earth, he had known he would have to wait a few days here.\nHe hadn't expected a delay of nearly three weeks. Still, it wasn't\nunusual. Interstellar schedules over great distances were not as\nreliable as they might be.\nWas this man, whoever and whatever he might be, connected with\nthat delay? According to Dimanche, the man thought he was. He was\nself-deluded or did he have access to information that Cassal didn't?\nDenton Cassal, sales engineer, paused for a mental survey of himself.\nHe was a good engineer and, because he was exceptionally well matched\nto his instrument, the best salesman that Neuronics, Inc., had. On the\nbasis of these qualifications, he had been selected to make a long\njourney, the first part of which already lay behind him. He had to go\nto Tunney 21 to see a man. That man wasn't important to anyone save the\ncompany that employed him, and possibly not even to them.\nThe thug trailing him wouldn't be interested in Cassal himself, his\nmission, which was a commercial one, nor the man on Tunney. And money\nwasn't the objective, if Dimanche's analysis was right. What\ndid\nthe\nthug want?\nSecrets? Cassal had none, except, in a sense, Dimanche. And that was\ntoo well kept on Earth, where the instrument was invented and made, for\nanyone this far away to have learned about it.\nAnd yet the thug wanted to kill him. Wanted to? Regarded him as good as\ndead. It might pay him to investigate the matter further, if it didn't\ninvolve too much risk.\n\"Better start moving.\" That was Dimanche. \"He's getting suspicious.\"\nCassal went slowly along the narrow walkway that bordered each side of\nthat boulevard, the transport tide. It was raining again. It usually\nwas on Godolph, which was a weather-controlled planet where the natives\nlike rain.\nHe adjusted the controls of the weak force field that repelled the\nrain. He widened the angle of the field until water slanted through it\nunhindered. He narrowed it around him until it approached visibility\nand the drops bounced away. He swore at the miserable climate and the\nnear amphibians who created it.\nA few hundred feet away, a Godolphian girl waded out of the transport\ntide and climbed to the walkway. It was this sort of thing that made\nlife dangerous for a human\u2014Venice revised, brought up to date in a\nfaster-than-light age.\nWater. It was a perfect engineering material. Simple, cheap, infinitely\nflexible. With a minimum of mechanism and at break-neck speed, the\nribbon of the transport tide flowed at different levels throughout\nthe city. The Godolphian merely plunged in and was carried swiftly\nand noiselessly to his destination. Whereas a human\u2014Cassal shivered.\nIf he were found drowned, it would be considered an accident. No\ninvestigation would be made. The thug who was trailing him had\ncertainly picked the right place.\nThe Godolphian girl passed. She wore a sleek brown fur, her own. Cassal\nwas almost positive she muttered a polite \"Arf?\" as she sloshed by.\nWhat she meant by that, he didn't know and didn't intend to find out.\n\"Follow her,\" instructed Dimanche. \"We've got to investigate our man at\ncloser range.\"\nObediently, Cassal turned and began walking after the girl. Attractive\nin an anthropomorphic, seal-like way, even from behind. Not graceful\nout of her element, though.\nThe would-be assassin was still looking at merchandise as Cassal\nretraced his steps. A man, or at least man type. A big fellow,\nphysically quite capable of violence, if size had anything to do with\nit. The face, though, was out of character. Mild, almost meek. A\nscientist or scholar. It didn't fit with murder.\n\"Nothing,\" said Dimanche disgustedly. \"His mind froze when we got\nclose. I could feel his shoulderblades twitching as we passed.\nAnticipated guilt, of course. Projecting to you the action he plans.\nThat makes the knife definite.\"\nWell beyond the window at which the thug watched and waited, Cassal\nstopped. Shakily he produced a cigarette and fumbled for a lighter.\n\"Excellent thinking,\" commended Dimanche. \"He won't attempt anything\non this street. Too dangerous. Turn aside at the next deserted\nintersection and let him follow the glow of your cigarette.\"\nThe lighter flared in his hand. \"That's one way of finding out,\" said\nCassal. \"But wouldn't I be a lot safer if I just concentrated on\ngetting back to the hotel?\"\n\"I'm curious. Turn here.\"\n\"Go to hell,\" said Cassal nervously. Nevertheless, when he came to that\nintersection, he turned there.\nIt was a Godolphian equivalent of an alley, narrow and dark, oily\nslow-moving water gurgling at one side, high cavernous walls looming on\nthe other.\nHe would have to adjust the curiosity factor of Dimanche. It was all\nvery well to be interested in the man who trailed him, but there was\nalso the problem of coming out of this adventure alive. Dimanche, an\nelectronic instrument, naturally wouldn't consider that.\n\"Easy,\" warned Dimanche. \"He's at the entrance to the alley, walking\nfast. He's surprised and pleased that you took this route.\"\n\"I'm surprised, too,\" remarked Cassal. \"But I wouldn't say I'm pleased.\nNot just now.\"\n\"Careful. Even subvocalized conversation is distracting.\" The mechanism\nconcealed within his body was silent for an instant and then continued:\n\"His blood pressure is rising, breathing is faster. At a time like\nthis, he may be ready to verbalize why he wants to murder you. This is\ncritical.\"\n\"That's no lie,\" agreed Cassal bitterly. The lighter was in his hand.\nHe clutched it grimly. It was difficult not to look back. The darkness\nassumed an even more sinister quality.\n\"Quiet,\" said Dimanche. \"He's verbalizing about you.\"\n\"He's decided I'm a nice fellow after all. He's going to stop and ask\nme for a light.\"\n\"I don't think so,\" answered Dimanche. \"He's whispering: 'Poor devil. I\nhate to do it. But it's really his life or mine'.\"\n\"He's more right than he knows. Why all this violence, though? Isn't\nthere any clue?\"\n\"None at all,\" admitted Dimanche. \"He's very close. You'd better turn\naround.\"\nCassal turned, pressed the stud on the lighter. It should have made him\nfeel more secure, but it didn't. He could see very little.\nA dim shadow rushed at him. He jumped away from the water side of the\nalley, barely in time. He could feel the rush of air as the assailant\nshot by.\n\"Hey!\" shouted Cassal.\nEchoes answered; nothing else did. He had the uncomfortable feeling\nthat no one was going to come to his assistance.\n\"He wasn't expecting that reaction,\" explained Dimanche. \"That's why he\nmissed. He's turned around and is coming back.\"\n\"I'm armed!\" shouted Cassal.\n\"That won't stop him. He doesn't believe you.\"\nCassal grasped the lighter. That is, it had been a lighter a few\nseconds before. Now a needle-thin blade had snapped out and projected\nstiffly. Originally it had been designed as an emergency surgical\ninstrument. A little imagination and a few changes had altered its\nfunction, converting it into a compact, efficient stiletto.\n\"Twenty feet away,\" advised Dimanche. \"He knows you can't see him, but\nhe can see your silhouette by the light from the main thoroughfare.\nWhat he doesn't know is that I can detect every move he makes and keep\nyou posted below the level of his hearing.\"\n\"Stay on him,\" growled Cassal nervously. He flattened himself against\nthe wall.\n\"To the right,\" whispered Dimanche. \"Lunge forward. About five feet.\nLow.\"\nSickly, he did so. He didn't care to consider the possible effects of\na miscalculation. In the darkness, how far was five feet? Fortunately,\nhis estimate was correct. The rapier encountered yielding resistance,\nthe soggy kind: flesh. The tough blade bent, but did not break. His\nopponent gasped and broke away.\n\"Attack!\" howled Dimanche against the bone behind his ear. \"You've got\nhim. He can't imagine how you know where he is in the darkness. He's\nafraid.\"\nAttack he did, slicing about wildly. Some of the thrusts landed; some\ndidn't. The percentage was low, the total amount high. His opponent\nfell to the ground, gasped and was silent.\nCassal fumbled in his pockets and flipped on a light. The man lay near\nthe water side of the alley. One leg was crumpled under him. He didn't\nmove.\n\"Heartbeat slow,\" said Dimanche solemnly. \"Breathing barely\nperceptible.\"\n\"Then he's not dead,\" said Cassal in relief.\nFoam flecked from the still lips and ran down the chin. Blood oozed\nfrom cuts on the face.\n\"Respiration none, heartbeat absent,\" stated Dimanche.\nHorrified, Cassal gazed at the body. Self-defense, of course, but\nwould the police believe it? Assuming they did, they'd still have to\ninvestigate. The rapier was an illegal concealed weapon. And they would\nquestion him until they discovered Dimanche. Regrettable, but what\ncould he do about it?\nSuppose he were detained long enough to miss the ship bound for Tunney\n21?\nGrimly, he laid down the rapier. He might as well get to the bottom of\nthis. Why had the man attacked? What did he want?\n\"I don't know,\" replied Dimanche irritably. \"I can interpret body\ndata\u2014a live body. I can't work on a piece of meat.\"\nCassal searched the body thoroughly. Miscellaneous personal articles\nof no value in identifying the man. A clip with a startling amount\nof money in it. A small white card with something scribbled on it. A\npicture of a woman and a small child posed against a background which\nresembled no world Cassal had ever seen. That was all.\nCassal stood up in bewilderment. Dimanche to the contrary, there seemed\nto be no connection between this dead man and his own problem of\ngetting to Tunney 21.\nRight now, though, he had to dispose of the body. He glanced toward the\nboulevard. So far no one had been attracted by the violence.\nHe bent down to retrieve the lighter-rapier. Dimanche shouted at him.\nBefore he could react, someone landed on him. He fell forward, vainly\ntrying to grasp the weapon. Strong fingers felt for his throat as he\nwas forced to the ground.\nHe threw the attacker off and staggered to his feet. He heard footsteps\nrushing away. A slight splash followed. Whoever it was, he was escaping\nby way of water.\nWhoever it was. The man he had thought he had slain was no longer in\nsight.\n\"Interpret body data, do you?\" muttered Cassal. \"Liveliest dead man\nI've ever been strangled by.\"\n\"It's just possible there are some breeds of men who can control the\nbasic functions of their body,\" said Dimanche defensively. \"When I\nchecked him, he had no heartbeat.\"\n\"Remind me not to accept your next evaluation so completely,\" grunted\nCassal. Nevertheless, he was relieved, in a fashion. He hadn't\nwanted\nto kill the man. And now there was nothing he'd have to explain to the\npolice.\nHe needed the cigarette he stuck between his lips. For the second\ntime he attempted to pick up the rapier-lighter. This time he was\nsuccessful. Smoke swirled into his lungs and quieted his nerves. He\nsqueezed the weapon into the shape of a lighter and put it away.\nSomething, however, was missing\u2014his wallet.\nThe thug had relieved him of it in the second round of the scuffle.\nPersistent fellow. Damned persistent.\nIt really didn't matter. He fingered the clip he had taken from the\nsupposedly dead body. He had intended to turn it over to the police.\nNow he might as well keep it to reimburse him for his loss. It\ncontained more money than his wallet had.\nExcept for the identification tab he always carried in his wallet, it\nwas more than a fair exchange. The identification, a rectangular piece\nof plastic, was useful in establishing credit, but with the money he\nnow had, he wouldn't need credit. If he did, he could always send for\nanother tab.\nA white card fluttered from the clip. He caught it as it fell.\nCuriously he examined it. Blank except for one crudely printed word,\nSTAB. His unknown assailant certainly had tried.\nThe old man stared at the door, an obsolete visual projector wobbling\nprecariously on his head. He closed his eyes and the lettering on the\ndoor disappeared. Cassal was too far away to see what it had been. The\ntechnician opened his eyes and concentrated. Slowly a new sign formed\non the door.\nTRAVELERS AID BUREAU\nMurra Foray, First Counselor\nIt was a drab sign, but, then, it was a dismal, backward planet. The\nold technician passed on to the next door and closed his eyes again.\nWith a sinking feeling, Cassal walked toward the entrance. He needed\nhelp and he had to find it in this dingy rathole.\nInside, though, it wasn't dingy and it wasn't a rathole. More like a\nmaze, an approved scientific one. Efficient, though not comfortable.\nTravelers Aid was busier than he thought it would be. Eventually he\nmanaged to squeeze into one of the many small counseling rooms.\nA woman appeared on the screen, crisp and cool. \"Please answer\neverything the machine asks. When the tape is complete, I'll be\navailable for consultation.\"\nCassal wasn't sure he was going to like her. \"Is this necessary?\" he\nasked. \"It's merely a matter of information.\"\n\"We have certain regulations we abide by.\" The woman smiled frostily.\n\"I can't give you any information until you comply with them.\"\n\"Sometimes regulations are silly,\" said Cassal firmly. \"Let me speak to\nthe first counselor.\"\n\"You are speaking to her,\" she said. Her face disappeared from the\nscreen.\nCassal sighed. So far he hadn't made a good impression.\nTravelers Aid Bureau, in addition to regulations, was abundantly\nsupplied with official curiosity. When the machine finished with him,\nCassal had the feeling he could be recreated from the record it had of\nhim. His individuality had been capsuled into a series of questions and\nanswers. One thing he drew the line at\u2014why he wanted to go to Tunney\n21 was his own business.\nThe first counselor reappeared. Age, indeterminate. Not, he supposed,\nthat anyone would be curious about it. Slightly taller than average,\nrather on the slender side. Face was broad at the brow, narrow at the\nchin and her eyes were enigmatic. A dangerous woman.\nShe glanced down at the data. \"Denton Cassal, native of Earth.\nDestination, Tunney 21.\" She looked up at him. \"Occupation, sales\nengineer. Isn't that an odd combination?\" Her smile was quite superior.\n\"Not at all. Scientific training as an engineer. Special knowledge of\ncustomer relations.\"\n\"Special knowledge of a thousand races? How convenient.\" Her eyebrows\narched.\n\"I think so,\" he agreed blandly. \"Anything else you'd like to know?\"\n\"Sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.\"\nHe could believe that or not as he wished. He didn't.\n\"You refused to answer why you were going to Tunney 21. Perhaps I can\nguess. They're the best scientists in the Galaxy. You wish to study\nunder them.\"\nClose\u2014but wrong on two counts. They were good scientists, though not\nnecessarily the best. For instance, it was doubtful that they could\nbuild Dimanche, even if they had ever thought of it, which was even\nless likely.\nThere was, however, one relatively obscure research worker on Tunney 21\nthat Neuronics wanted on their staff. If the fragments of his studies\nthat had reached Earth across the vast distance meant anything, he\ncould help Neuronics perfect instantaneous radio. The company that\ncould build a radio to span the reaches of the Galaxy with no time lag\ncould set its own price, which could be control of all communications,\ntransport, trade\u2014a galactic monopoly. Cassal's share would be a cut of\nall that.\nHis part was simple, on the surface. He was to persuade that researcher\nto come to Earth,\nif he could\n. Literally, he had to guess the\nTunnesian's price before the Tunnesian himself knew it. In addition,\nthe reputation of Tunnesian scientists being exceeded only by their\narrogance, Cassal had to convince him that he wouldn't be working\nfor ignorant Earth savages. The existence of such an instrument as\nDimanche was a key factor.\nHer voice broke through his thoughts. \"Now, then, what's your problem?\"\n\"I was told on Earth I might have to wait a few days on Godolph. I've\nbeen here three weeks. I want information on the ship bound for Tunney\n21.\"\n\"Just a moment.\" She glanced at something below the angle of the\nscreen. She looked up and her eyes were grave. \"\nRickrock C\narrived\nyesterday. Departed for Tunney early this morning.\"\n\"Departed?\" He got up and sat down again, swallowing hard. \"When will\nthe next ship arrive?\"\n\"Do you know how many stars there are in the Galaxy?\" she asked.\nHe didn't answer.\n\"That's right,\" she said. \"Billions. Tunney, according to the notation,\nis near the center of the Galaxy, inside the third ring. You've\ncovered about a third of the distance to it. Local traffic, anything\nwithin a thousand light-years, is relatively easy to manage. At longer\ndistances, you take a chance. You've had yours and missed it. Frankly,\nCassal, I don't know when another ship bound for Tunney will show up on\nor near Godolph. Within the next five years\u2014maybe.\"\nHe blanched. \"How long would it take to get there using local\ntransportation, star-hopping?\"\n\"Take my advice: don't try it. Five years, if you're lucky.\"\n\"I don't need that kind of luck.\"\n\"I suppose not.\" She hesitated. \"You're determined to go on?\" At the\nemphatic nod, she sighed. \"If that's your decision, we'll try to help\nyou. To start things moving, we'll need a print of your identification\ntab.\"\n\"There's something funny about her,\" Dimanche decided. It was the usual\nspeaking voice of the instrument, no louder than the noise the blood\nmade in coursing through arteries and veins. Cassal could hear it\nplainly, because it was virtually inside his ear.\nCassal ignored his private voice. \"Identification tab? I don't have it\nwith me. In fact, I may have lost it.\"\nShe smiled in instant disbelief. \"We're not trying to pry into any\npart of your past you may wish concealed. However, it's much easier\nfor us to help you if you have your identification. Now if you can't\nremember\nyour real name and where you put your identification\u2014\" She\narose and left the screen. \"Just a moment.\"\nHe glared uneasily at the spot where the first counselor wasn't. His\nreal\nname!\n\"Relax,\" Dimanche suggested. \"She didn't mean it as a personal insult.\"\nPresently she returned.\n\"I have news for you, whoever you are.\"\n\"Cassal,\" he said firmly. \"Denton Cassal, sales engineer, Earth. If you\ndon't believe it, send back to\u2014\" He stopped. It had taken him four\nmonths to get to Godolph, non-stop, plus a six-month wait on Earth for\na ship to show up that was bound in the right direction. Over distances\nsuch as these, it just wasn't practical to send back to Earth for\nanything.\n\"I see you understand.\" She glanced at the card in her hand. \"The\nspaceport records indicate that when\nRickrock C\ntook off this\nmorning, there was a Denton Cassal on board, bound for Tunney 21.\"\n\"It wasn't I,\" he said dazedly. He knew who it was, though. The man who\nhad tried to kill him last night. The reason for the attack now became\nclear. The thug had wanted his identification tab. Worse, he had gotten\nit.\n\"No doubt it wasn't,\" she said wearily. \"Outsiders don't seem to\nunderstand what galactic travel entails.\"\nOutsiders? Evidently what she called those who lived beyond the second\ntransfer ring. Were those who lived at the edge of the Galaxy, beyond\nthe first ring, called Rimmers? Probably.\nShe was still speaking: \"Ten years to cross the Galaxy, without\nstopping. At present, no ship is capable of that. Real scheduling is\nimpossible. Populations shift and have to be supplied. A ship is taken\noff a run for repairs and is never put back on. It's more urgently\nneeded elsewhere. The man who depended on it is left waiting; years\npass before he learns it's never coming.\n\"If we had instantaneous radio, that would help. Confusion wouldn't\nvanish overnight, but it would diminish. We wouldn't have to depend\non ships for all the news. Reservations could be made ahead of time,\ncredit established, lost identification replaced\u2014\"\n\"I've traveled before,\" he interrupted stiffly. \"I've never had any\ntrouble.\"\nShe seemed to be exaggerating the difficulties. True, the center was\nmore congested. Taking each star as the starting point for a limited\nnumber of ships and using statistical probability as a guide\u2014why, no\nman would arrive at his predetermined destination.\nBut that wasn't the way it worked. Manifestly, you couldn't compare\ngalactic transportation to the erratic paths of air molecules in a\ngiant room. Or could you?\nFor the average man, anyone who didn't have his own inter-stellar ship,\nwas the comparison too apt? It might be.\n\"You've traveled outside, where there are still free planets waiting to\nbe settled. Where a man is welcome, if he's able to work.\" She paused.\n\"The center is different. Populations are excessive. Inside the third\nring, no man is allowed off a ship without an identification tab. They\ndon't encourage immigration.\"\nIn effect, that meant no ship bound for the center would take a\npassenger without identification. No ship owner would run the risk of\nhaving a permanent guest on board, someone who couldn't be rid of when\nhis money was gone.\nCassal held his head in his hands. Tunney 21 was inside the third ring.\n\"Next time,\" she said, \"don't let anyone take your identification.\"\n\"I won't,\" he promised grimly.\nThe woman looked directly at him. Her eyes were bright. He revised his\nestimate of her age drastically downward. She couldn't be as old as he.\nNothing outward had happened, but she no longer seemed dowdy. Not that\nhe was interested. Still, it might pay him to be friendly to the first\ncounselor.\n\"We're a philanthropic agency,\" said Murra Foray. \"Your case is\nspecial, though\u2014\"\n\"I understand,\" he said gruffly. \"You accept contributions.\"\nShe nodded. \"If the donor is able to give. We don't ask so much that\nyou'll have to compromise your standard of living.\" But she named a sum\nthat would force him to do just that if getting to Tunney 21 took any\nappreciable time.\nHe stared at her unhappily. \"I suppose it's worth it. I can always\nwork, if I have to.\"\n\"As a salesman?\" she asked. \"I'm afraid you'll find it difficult to do\nbusiness with Godolphians.\"\nIrony wasn't called for at a time like this, he thought reproachfully.\n\"Not just another salesman,\" he answered definitely. \"I have special\nknowledge of customer reactions. I can tell exactly\u2014\"\nHe stopped abruptly. Was she baiting him? For what reason? The\ninstrument he called Dimanche was not known to the Galaxy at large.\nFrom the business angle, it would be poor policy to hand out that\ninformation at random. Aside from that, he needed every advantage he\ncould get. Dimanche was his special advantage.\n\"Anyway,\" he finished lamely, \"I'm a first class engineer. I can\nalways find something in that line.\"\n\"A scientist, maybe,\" murmured Murra Foray. \"But in this part of the\nMilky Way, an engineer is regarded as merely a technician who hasn't\nyet gained practical experience.\" She shook her head. \"You'll do better\nas a salesman.\"\nHe got up, glowering. \"If that's all\u2014\"\n\"It is. We'll keep you informed. Drop your contribution in the slot\nprovided for that purpose as you leave.\"\nA door, which he hadn't noticed in entering the counselling cubicle,\nswung open. The agency was efficient.\n\"Remember,\" the counselor called out as he left, \"identification is\nhard to work with. Don't accept a crude forgery.\"\nHe didn't answer, but it was an idea worth considering. The agency was\nalso eminently practical.\nThe exit path guided him firmly to an inconspicuous and yet inescapable\ncontribution station. He began to doubt the philanthropic aspect of the\nbureau.\n\"I've got it,\" said Dimanche as Cassal gloomily counted out the sum the\nfirst counselor had named.\n\"Got what?\" asked Cassal. He rolled the currency into a neat bundle,\nattached his name, and dropped it into the chute.\n\"The woman, Murra Foray, the first counselor. She's a Huntner.\"\n\"What's a Huntner?\"\n\"A sub-race of men on the other side of the Galaxy. She was vocalizing\nabout her home planet when I managed to locate her.\"\n\"Any other information?\"\n\"None. Electronic guards were sliding into place as soon as I reached\nher. I got out as fast as I could.\"\n\"I see.\" The significance of that, if any, escaped him. Nevertheless,\nit sounded depressing.\n\"What I want to know is,\" said Dimanche, \"why such precautions as\nelectronic guards? What does Travelers Aid have that's so secret?\"\nCassal grunted and didn't answer. Dimanche could be annoyingly\ninquisitive at times.\nCassal had entered one side of a block-square building. He came out on\nthe other side. The agency was larger than he had thought. The old man\nwas staring at a door as Cassal came out. He had apparently changed\nevery sign in the building. His work finished, the technician was\nremoving the visual projector from his head as Cassal came up to him.\nHe turned and peered.\n\"You stuck here, too?\" he asked in the uneven voice of the aged.\n\"Stuck?\" repeated Cassal. \"I suppose you can call it that. I'm waiting\nfor my ship.\" He frowned. He was the one who wanted to ask questions.\n\"Why all the redecoration? I thought Travelers Aid was an old agency.\nWhy did you change so many signs? I could understand it if the agency\nwere new.\"\nThe old man chuckled. \"Re-organization. The previous first counselor\nresigned suddenly, in the middle of the night, they say. The new one\ndidn't like the name of the agency, so she ordered it changed.\"\nShe would do just that, thought Cassal. \"What about this Murra Foray?\"\nThe old man winked mysteriously. He opened his mouth and then seemed\novercome with senile fright. Hurriedly he shuffled away.\nCassal gazed after him, baffled. The old man was afraid for his job,\nafraid of the first counselor. Why he should be, Cassal didn't know. He\nshrugged and went on. The agency was now in motion in his behalf, but\nhe didn't intend to depend on that alone.\n", "summary": "Dimanche is an instrument that can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret physiological data, and make predictions about the future. He has been selected to go on a long journey across the galaxy to find a radio that can cross the reaches of the Galaxy with no time lag. Dimanche has been working on this project for a long time, and has developed a machine that can recreate himself from the record he has of himself. When Dimanche is attacked by a man, he uses the machine to recreate himself as if he is himself. He is able to successfully impersonate the man and make him believe that he is the same person as he is on Earth. He then uses the same method to make the man\u2019s body react the same way. After Dimanche returns to his ship, he informs the ship that he has found a ship that will take him to Godolph, a planet near the center of the galaxy. The ship is bound for the planet Tunney, but it has been delayed by an unknown amount of time due to a transmission problem. He waits for a ship to show up, but there is no one to pick him up. After a while, he is attacked again by the same man, but this time he manages to escape. He finds himself in a dark alleyway with a woman and a small child. He tries to run away, but is caught by Dimanche, who uses a knife to cut through his clothes. The woman tells him that she will kill him if he doesn\u2019t give up the information he has on him. She tells him to leave the city immediately, but he refuses. After he leaves the alleyway, he finds himself on the planet of Godolph. The city is described as dark and smoky, with high cavernous walls and narrow, low-slung alleys. There is a water fountain and a walkway that leads to the city. The air is cool and clean, and there is a fountain that is clean and fresh. There are plants that produce fresh fruit that are used for growing. The water is salty and clean. The buildings are tall and have tile floors. The building has an elevator and a stairway leading to the control room. The control room has a screen that allows Dimanche to see the person he is impersonating on the other side of the call.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}

Without comment, they pointed a cosmic finger at\nthe tarnished brass plaque commemorating the martyrdom of the Three\nPhysicists after the dropping of the Hell Bomb. They tenderly touched\nthe rosy skin and strawberry bruises on the naked shoulders of a\ngirl sleeping off a drunk on the furry and radiantly heated floor of\na nearby roof garden. They struck green magic from the glassy blot\nthat was Old Washington. Twelve hours before, they had revealed things\nas eerily beautiful, and as ravaged, in Asia and Russia. They pinked\nthe white walls of the Colonial dwelling of Morton Opperly near the\nInstitute for Advanced Studies; upstairs they slanted impartially\nacross the Pharoahlike and open-eyed face of the elderly physicist and\nthe ugly, sleep-surly one of young Willard Farquar in the next room.\nAnd in nearby New Washington they made of the spire of the Thinkers'\nFoundation a blue and optimistic glory that outshone White House, Jr.\nIt was America approaching the end of the Twentieth Century. America\nof juke-box burlesque and your local radiation hospital. America\nof the mask-fad for women and Mystic Christianity. America of the\noff-the-bosom dress and the New Blue Laws. America of the Endless War\nand the loyalty detector. America of marvelous Maizie and the monthly\nrocket to Mars. America of the Thinkers and (a few remembered) the\nInstitute. \"Knock on titanium,\" \"Whadya do for black-outs,\" \"Please,\nlover, don't think when I'm around,\" America, as combat-shocked and\ncrippled as the rest of the bomb-shattered planet.\nNot one impudent photon of the sunlight penetrated the triple-paned,\npolarizing windows of Jorj Helmuth's bedroom in the Thinker's\nFoundation, yet the clock in his brain awakened him to the minute,\nor almost. Switching off the Educational Sandman in the midst of the\nphrase, \"... applying tensor calculus to the nucleus,\" he took a\ndeep, even breath and cast his mind to the limits of the world and\nhis knowledge. It was a somewhat shadowy vision, but, he noted with\nimpartial approval, definitely less shadowy than yesterday morning.\nEmploying a rapid mental scanning technique, he next cleared his memory\nchains of false associations, including those acquired while asleep.\nThese chores completed, he held his finger on a bedside button, which\nrotated the polarizing window panes until the room slowly filled with a\nmuted daylight. Then, still flat on his back, he turned his head until\nhe could look at the remarkably beautiful blonde girl asleep beside him.\nRemembering last night, he felt a pang of exasperation, which he\ninstantly quelled by taking his mind to a higher and dispassionate\nlevel from which he could look down on the girl and even himself as\nquaint, clumsy animals. Still, he grumbled silently, Caddy might have\nhad enough consideration to clear out before he awoke. He wondered\nif he shouldn't have used his hypnotic control of the girl to smooth\ntheir relationship last night, and for a moment the word that would\nsend her into deep trance trembled on the tip of his tongue. But no,\nthat special power of his over her was reserved for far more important\npurposes.\nPumping dynamic tension into his 20-year-old muscles and confidence\ninto his 60-year-old mind, the 40-year-old Thinker rose from bed.\nNo covers had to be thrown off; the nuclear heating unit made them\nunnecessary. He stepped into his clothing\u2014the severe tunic, tights and\nsockassins of the modern business man. Next he glanced at the message\ntape beside his phone, washed down with ginger ale a vita-amino-enzyme\ntablet, and walked to the window. There, gazing along the rows of newly\nplanted mutant oaks lining Decontamination Avenue, his smooth face\nbroke into a smile.\nIt had come to him, the next big move in the intricate game making\nup his life\u2014and mankind's. Come to him during sleep, as so many of\nhis best decisions did, because he regularly employed the time-saving\ntechnique of somno-thought, which could function at the same time as\nsomno-learning.\nHe set his who?-where? robot for \"Rocket Physicist\" and \"Genius Class.\"\nWhile it worked, he dictated to his steno-robot the following brief\nmessage:\nDear Fellow Scientist:\nA project is contemplated that will have a crucial bearing on man's\nfuture in deep space. Ample non-military Government funds are\navailable. There was a time when professional men scoffed at the\nThinkers. Then there was a time when the Thinkers perforce neglected\nthe professional men. Now both times are past. May they never return!\nI would like to consult you this afternoon, three o'clock sharp,\nThinkers' Foundation I.\nJorj Helmuth\nMeanwhile the who?-where? had tossed out a dozen cards. He glanced\nthrough them, hesitated at the name \"Willard Farquar,\" looked at the\nsleeping girl, then quickly tossed them all into the addresso-robot and\nplugged in the steno-robot.\nThe buzz-light blinked green and he switched the phone to audio.\n\"The President is waiting to see Maizie, sir,\" a clear feminine voice\nannounced. \"He has the general staff with him.\"\n\"Martian peace to him,\" Jorj Helmuth said. \"Tell him I'll be down in a\nfew minutes.\"\nHuge as a primitive nuclear reactor, the great electronic brain loomed\nabove the knot of hush-voiced men. It almost filled a two-story room in\nthe Thinkers' Foundation. Its front was an orderly expanse of controls,\nindicators, telltales, and terminals, the upper ones reached by a chair\non a boom.\nAlthough, as far as anyone knew, it could sense only the information\nand questions fed into it on a tape, the human visitors could not\nresist the impulse to talk in whispers and glance uneasily at the great\ncryptic cube. After all, it had lately taken to moving some of its\nown controls\u2014the permissible ones\u2014and could doubtless improvise a\nhearing apparatus if it wanted to.\nFor this was the thinking machine beside which the Marks and Eniacs and\nManiacs and Maddidas and Minervas and Mimirs were less than Morons.\nThis was the machine with a million times as many synapses as the human\nbrain, the machine that remembered by cutting delicate notches in the\nrims of molecules (instead of kindergarten paper-punching or the Coney\nIsland shimmying of columns of mercury). This was the machine that had\ngiven instructions on building the last three-quarters of itself. This\nwas the goal, perhaps, toward which fallible human reasoning and biased\nhuman judgment and feeble human ambition had evolved.\nThis was the machine that really thought\u2014a million-plus!\nThis was the machine that the timid cyberneticists and stuffy\nprofessional scientists had said could not be built. Yet this was the\nmachine that the Thinkers, with characteristic Yankee push,\nhad\nbuilt. And nicknamed, with characteristic Yankee irreverence and\ngirl-fondness, \"Maizie.\"\nGazing up at it, the President of the United States felt a chord\nplucked within him that hadn't been sounded for decades, the dark and\nshivery organ chord of his Baptist childhood. Here, in a strange sense,\nalthough his reason rejected it, he felt he stood face to face with\nthe living God: infinitely stern with the sternness of reality, yet\ninfinitely just. No tiniest error or wilful misstep could ever escape\nthe scrutiny of this vast mentality. He shivered.\nThe grizzled general\u2014there was also one who was gray\u2014was thinking\nthat this was a very odd link in the chain of command. Some shadowy and\nusually well-controlled memories from World War II faintly stirred his\nire. Here he was giving orders to a being immeasurably more intelligent\nthan himself. And always orders of the \"Tell me how to kill that man\"\nrather than the \"Kill that man\" sort. The distinction bothered him\nobscurely. It relieved him to know that Maizie had built-in controls\nwhich made her always the servant of humanity, or of humanity's\nright-minded leaders\u2014even the Thinkers weren't certain which.\nThe gray general was thinking uneasily, and, like the President, at a\nmore turbid level, of the resemblance between Papal infallibility and\nthe dictates of the machine. Suddenly his bony wrists began to tremble.\nHe asked himself: Was this the Second Coming? Mightn't an incarnation\nbe in metal rather than flesh?\nThe austere Secretary of State was remembering what he'd taken such\npains to make everyone forget: his youthful flirtation at Lake Success\nwith Buddhism. Sitting before his\nguru\n, his teacher, feeling the\nOccidental's awe at the wisdom of the East, or its pretense, he had\nfelt a little like this.\nThe burly Secretary of Space, who had come up through United Rockets,\nwas thanking his stars that at any rate the professional scientists\nweren't responsible for this job. Like the grizzled general, he'd\nalways felt suspicious of men who kept telling you how to do things,\nrather than doing them themselves. In World War III he'd had his fill\nof the professional physicists, with their eternal taint of a misty\nsort of radicalism and free-thinking. The Thinkers were better\u2014more\ndisciplined, more human. They'd called their brain-machine Maizie,\nwhich helped take the curse off her. Somewhat.\nThe President's Secretary, a paunchy veteran of party caucuses, was\nalso glad that it was the Thinkers who had created the machine, though\nhe trembled at the power that it gave them over the Administration.\nStill, you could do business with the Thinkers. And nobody (not even\nthe Thinkers) could do business (that sort of business) with Maizie!\nBefore that great square face with its thousands of tiny metal\nfeatures, only Jorj Helmuth seemed at ease, busily entering on the\ntape the complex Questions of the Day that the high officials had\nhanded him: logistics for the Endless War in Pakistan, optimum size for\nnext year's sugar-corn crop, current thought trends in average Soviet\nminds\u2014profound questions, yet many of them phrased with surprising\nsimplicity. For figures, technical jargon, and layman's language were\nalike to Maizie; there was no need to translate into mathematical\nshorthand, as with the lesser brain-machines.\nThe click of the taper went on until the Secretary of State had twice\nnervously fired a cigaret with his ultrasonic lighter and twice quickly\nput it away. No one spoke.\nJorj looked up at the Secretary of Space. \"Section Five, Question\nFour\u2014whom would that come from?\"\nThe burly man frowned. \"That would be the physics boys, Opperly's\ngroup. Is anything wrong?\"\nJorj did not answer. A bit later he quit taping and began to adjust\ncontrols, going up on the boom-chair to reach some of them. Eventually\nhe came down and touched a few more, then stood waiting.\nFrom the great cube came a profound, steady purring. Involuntarily the\nsix officials backed off a bit. Somehow it was impossible for a man to\nget used to the sound of Maizie starting to think.\nJorj turned, smiling. \"And now, gentlemen, while we wait for Maizie\nto celebrate, there should be just enough time for us to watch the\ntakeoff of the Mars rocket.\" He switched on a giant television screen.\nThe others made a quarter turn, and there before them glowed the rich\nochres and blues of a New Mexico sunrise and, in the middle distance, a\nsilvery mighty spindle.\nLike the generals, the Secretary of Space suppressed a scowl. Here\nwas something that ought to be spang in the center of his official\nterritory, and the Thinkers had locked him completely out of it. That\nrocket there\u2014just an ordinary Earth satellite vehicle commandeered\nfrom the Army, but equipped by the Thinkers with Maizie-designed\nnuclear motors capable of the Mars journey and more. The first\nspaceship\u2014and the Secretary of Space was not in on it!\nStill, he told himself, Maizie had decreed it that way. And when\nhe remembered what the Thinkers had done for him in rescuing him\nfrom breakdown with their mental science, in rescuing the whole\nAdministration from collapse he realized he had to be satisfied. And\nthat was without taking into consideration the amazing additional\nmental discoveries that the Thinkers were bringing down from Mars.\n\"Lord,\" the President said to Jorj as if voicing the Secretary's\nfeeling, \"I wish you people could bring a couple of those wise little\ndevils back with you this trip. Be a good thing for the country.\"\nJorj looked at him a bit coldly. \"It's quite unthinkable,\" he said.\n\"The telepathic abilities of the Martians make them extremely\nsensitive. The conflicts of ordinary Earth minds would impinge on them\npsychotically, even fatally. As you know, the Thinkers were able to\ncontact them only because of our degree of learned mental poise and\nerrorless memory-chains. So for the present it must be our task alone\nto glean from the Martians their astounding mental skills. Of course,\nsome day in the future, when we have discovered how to armor the minds\nof the Martians\u2014\"\n\"Sure, I know,\" the President said hastily. \"Shouldn't have mentioned\nit, Jorj.\"\nConversation ceased. They waited with growing tension for the great\nviolet flames to bloom from the base of the silvery shaft.\nMeanwhile the question tape, like a New Year's streamer tossed out\na high window into the night, sped on its dark way along spinning\nrollers. Curling with an intricate aimlessness curiously like that\nof such a streamer, it tantalized the silvery fingers of a thousand\nrelays, saucily evaded the glances of ten thousand electric eyes,\nimpishly darted down a narrow black alleyway of memory banks, and,\nreaching the center of the cube, suddenly emerged into a small room\nwhere a suave fat man in shorts sat drinking beer.\nHe flipped the tape over to him with practiced finger, eyeing it as\na stockbroker might have studied a ticker tape. He read the first\nquestion, closed his eyes and frowned for five seconds. Then with the\nstaccato self-confidence of a hack writer, he began to tape out the\nanswer.\nFor many minutes the only sounds were the rustle of the paper ribbon\nand the click of the taper, except for the seconds the fat man took to\nclose his eyes, or to drink or pour beer. Once, too, he lifted a phone,\nasked a concise question, waited half a minute, listened to an answer,\nthen went back to the grind.\nUntil he came to Section Five, Question Four. That time he did his\nthinking with his eyes open.\nThe question was: \"Does Maizie stand for Maelzel?\"\nHe sat for a while slowly scratching his thigh. His loose, persuasive\nlips tightened, without closing, into the shape of a snarl.\nSuddenly he began to tape again.\n\"Maizie does not stand for Maelzel. Maizie stands for amazing,\nhumorously given the form of a girl's name. Section Six, Answer One:\nThe mid-term election viewcasts should be spaced as follows....\"\nBut his lips didn't lose the shape of a snarl.\nFive hundred miles above the ionosphere, the Mars rocket cut off\nits fuel and slumped gratefully into an orbit that would carry it\neffortlessly around the world at that altitude. The pilot unstrapped\nhimself and stretched, but he didn't look out the viewport at the\ndried-mud disc that was Earth, cloaked in its haze of blue sky. He knew\nhe had two maddening months ahead of him in which to do little more\nthan that. Instead, he unstrapped Sappho.\nUsed to free fall from two previous experiences, and loving it, the\nfluffy little cat was soon bounding about the cabin in curves and\ngyrations that would have made her the envy of all back-alley and\nparlor felines on the planet below. A miracle cat in the dream world of\nfree fall. For a long time she played with a string that the man would\ntoss out lazily. Sometimes she caught the string on the fly, sometimes\nshe swam for it frantically.\nAfter a while the man grew bored with the game. He unlocked a drawer\nand began to study the details of the wisdom he would discover on\nMars this trip\u2014priceless spiritual insights that would be balm to\nwar-battered mankind.\nThe cat carefully selected a spot three feet off the floor, curled up\non the air, and went to sleep.\nJorj Helmuth snipped the emerging answer tape into sections and handed\neach to the appropriate man. Most of them carefully tucked theirs away\nwith little more than a glance, but the Secretary of Space puzzled over\nhis.\n\"Who the devil would Maelzel be?\" he asked.\nA remote look came into the eyes of the Secretary of State. \"Edgar\nAllen Poe,\" he said frowningly, with eyes half-closed.\nThe grizzled general snapped his fingers. \"Sure! Maelzel's Chess\nplayer. Read it when I was a kid. About an automaton that was supposed\nto play chess. Poe proved it hid a man inside it.\"\nThe Secretary of Space frowned. \"Now what's the point in a fool\nquestion like that?\"\n\"You said it came from Opperly's group?\" Jorj asked sharply.\nThe Secretary of Space nodded. The others looked at the two men\npuzzledly.\n\"Who would that be?\" Jorj pressed. \"The group, I mean.\"\nThe Secretary of Space shrugged. \"Oh, the usual little bunch over at\nthe Institute. Hindeman, Gregory, Opperly himself. Oh, yes, and young\nFarquar.\"\n\"Sounds like Opperly's getting senile,\" Jorj commented coldly. \"I'd\ninvestigate.\"\nThe Secretary of Space nodded. He suddenly looked tough. \"I will. Right\naway.\"\nSunlight striking through French windows spotlighted a ballet of dust\nmotes untroubled by air-conditioning. Morton Opperly's living room was\nwell-kept but worn and quite behind the times. Instead of reading tapes\nthere were books; instead of steno-robots, pen and ink; while in place\nof a four by six TV screen, a Picasso hung on the wall. Only Opperly\nknew that the painting was still faintly radioactive, that it had been\nriskily so when he'd smuggled it out of his bomb-singed apartment in\nNew York City.\nThe two physicists fronted each other across a coffee table. The face\nof the elder was cadaverous, large-eyed, and tender\u2014fined down by\na long life of abstract thought. That of the younger was forceful,\nsensuous, bulky as his body, and exceptionally ugly. He looked rather\nlike a bear.\nOpperly was saying, \"So when he asked who was responsible for the\nMaelzel question, I said I didn't remember.\" He smiled. \"They still\nallow me my absent-mindedness, since it nourishes their contempt.\nAlmost my sole remaining privilege.\" The smile faded. \"Why do you keep\non teasing the zoo animals, Willard?\" he asked without rancor. \"I've\nmaintained many times that we shouldn't truckle to them by yielding\nto their demand that we ask Maizie questions. You and the rest have\noverruled me. But then to use those questions to convey veiled insults\nisn't reasonable. Apparently the Secretary of Space was bothered enough\nabout this last one to pay me a 'copter call within twenty minutes of\nthis morning's meeting at the Foundation. Why do you do it, Willard?\"\nThe features of the other convulsed unpleasantly. \"Because the\nThinkers are charlatans who must be exposed,\" he rapped out. \"We know\ntheir Maizie is no more than a tealeaf-reading fake. We've traced their\nMars rockets and found they go nowhere. We know their Martian mental\nscience is bunk.\"\n\"But we've already exposed the Thinkers very thoroughly,\" Opperly\ninterposed quietly. \"You know the good it did.\"\nFarquar hunched his Japanese-wrestler shoulders. \"Then it's got to be\ndone until it takes.\"\nOpperly studied the bowl of mutated flowers by the coffee pot. \"I think\nyou just want to tease the animals, for some personal reason of which\nyou probably aren't aware.\"\nFarquar scowled. \"We're the ones in the cages.\"\nOpperly continued his inspection of the flowers' bells. \"All the more\nreason not to poke sticks through the bars at the lions and tigers\nstrolling outside. No, Willard, I'm not counseling appeasement. But\nconsider the age in which we live. It wants magicians.\" His voice grew\nespecially tranquil. \"A scientist tells people the truth. When times\nare good\u2014that is, when the truth offers no threat\u2014people don't mind.\nBut when times are very, very bad....\" A shadow darkened his eyes.\n\"Well, we all know what happened to\u2014\" And he mentioned three names\nthat had been household words in the middle of the century. They\nwere the names on the brass plaque dedicated to the martyred three\nphysicists.\nHe went on, \"A magician, on the other hand, tells people what they\nwish were true\u2014that perpetual motion works, that cancer can be cured\nby colored lights, that a psychosis is no worse than a head cold, that\nthey'll live forever. In good times magicians are laughed at. They're a\nluxury of the spoiled wealthy few. But in bad times people sell their\nsouls for magic cures, and buy perpetual motion machines to power their\nwar rockets.\"\nFarquar clenched his fist. \"All the more reason to keep chipping away\nat the Thinkers. Are we supposed to beg off from a job because it's\ndifficult and dangerous?\"\nOpperly shook his head. \"We're to keep clear of the infection of\nviolence. In my day, Willard, I was one of the Frightened Men. Later I\nwas one of the Angry Men and then one of the Minds of Despair. Now I'm\nconvinced that all my reactions were futile.\"\n\"Exactly!\" Farquar agreed harshly. \"You reacted. You didn't act. If\nyou men who discovered atomic energy had only formed a secret league,\nif you'd only had the foresight and the guts to use your tremendous\nbargaining position to demand the power to shape mankind's future....\"\n\"By the time you were born, Willard,\" Opperly interrupted dreamily,\n\"Hitler was merely a name in the history books. We scientists weren't\nthe stuff out of which cloak-and-dagger men are made. Can you imagine\nOppenheimer wearing a mask or Einstein sneaking into the Old White\nHouse with a bomb in his briefcase?\" He smiled. \"Besides, that's not\nthe way power is seized. New ideas aren't useful to the man bargaining\nfor power\u2014only established facts or lies are.\"\n\"Just the same, it would have been a good thing if you'd had a little\nviolence in you.\"\n\"No,\" Opperly said.\n\"I've got violence in me,\" Farquar announced, shoving himself to his\nfeet.\nOpperly looked up from the flowers. \"I think you have,\" he agreed.\n\"But what are we to do?\" Farquar demanded. \"Surrender the world to\ncharlatans without a struggle?\"\nOpperly mused for a while. \"I don't know what the world needs now.\nEveryone knows Newton as the great scientist. Few remember that\nhe spent half his life muddling with alchemy, looking for the\nphilosopher's stone. Which Newton did the world need then?\"\n\"Now you are justifying the Thinkers!\"\n\"No, I leave that to history.\"\n\"And history consists of the actions of men,\" Farquar concluded. \"I\nintend to act. The Thinkers are vulnerable, their power fantastically\nprecarious. What's it based on? A few lucky guesses. Faith-healing.\nSome science hocus-pocus, on the level of those juke-box burlesque acts\nbetween the strips. Dubious mental comfort given to a few nerve-torn\nneurotics in the Inner Cabinet\u2014and their wives. The fact that the\nThinkers' clever stage-managing won the President a doubtful election.\nThe erroneous belief that the Soviets pulled out of Iraq and Iran\nbecause of the Thinkers' Mind Bomb threat. A brain-machine that's just\na cover for Jan Tregarron's guesswork. Oh, yes, and that hogwash of\n'Martian wisdom.' All of it mere bluff! A few pushes at the right times\nand points are all that are needed\u2014and the Thinkers know it! I'll bet\nthey're terrified already, and will be more so when they find that\nwe're gunning for them. Eventually they'll be making overtures to us,\nturning to us for help. You wait and see.\"\n\"I am thinking again of Hitler,\" Opperly interposed quietly. \"On his\nfirst half dozen big steps, he had nothing but bluff. His generals\nwere against him. They knew they were in a cardboard fort. Yet he won\nevery battle, until the last. Moreover,\" he pressed on, cutting Farquar\nshort, \"the power of the Thinkers isn't based on what they've got, but\non what the world hasn't got\u2014peace, honor, a good conscience....\"\nThe front-door knocker clanked. Farquar answered it. A skinny old man\nwith a radiation scar twisting across his temple handed him a tiny\ncylinder. \"Radiogram for you, Willard.\" He grinned across the hall at\nOpperly. \"When are you going to get a phone put in, Mr. Opperly?\"\nThe physicist waved to him. \"Next year, perhaps, Mr. Berry.\"\nThe old man snorted with good-humored incredulity and trudged off.\n\"What did I tell you about the Thinkers making overtures?\" Farquar\nchortled suddenly. \"It's come sooner than I expected. Look at this.\"\nHe held out the radiogram, but the older man didn't take it. Instead he\nasked, \"Who's it from? Tregarron?\"\n\"No, from Helmuth. There's a lot of sugar corn about man's future in\ndeep space, but the real reason is clear. They know that they're going\nto have to produce an actual nuclear rocket pretty soon, and for that\nthey'll need our help.\"\n\"An invitation?\"\nFarquar nodded. \"For this afternoon.\" He noticed Opperly's anxious\nthough distant frown. \"What's the matter?\" he asked. \"Are you bothered\nabout my going? Are you thinking it might be a trap\u2014that after the\nMaelzel question they may figure I'm better rubbed out?\"\nThe older man shook his head. \"I'm not afraid for your life, Willard.\nThat's yours to risk as you choose. No, I'm worried about other things\nthey might do to you.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" Farquar asked.\nOpperly looked at him with a gentle appraisal. \"You're a strong and\nvital man, Willard, with a strong man's prides and desires.\" His voice\ntrailed off for a bit. Then, \"Excuse me, Willard, but wasn't there a\ngirl once? A Miss Arkady?\"\nFarquar's ungainly figure froze. He nodded curtly, face averted.\n\"And didn't she go off with a Thinker?\"\n\"If girls find me ugly, that's their business,\" Farquar said harshly,\nstill not looking at Opperly. \"What's that got to do with this\ninvitation?\"\nOpperly didn't answer the question. His eyes got more distant. Finally\nhe said, \"In my day we had it a lot easier. A scientist was an\nacademician, cushioned by tradition.\"\nWillard snorted. \"Science had already entered the era of the police\ninspectors, with laboratory directors and political appointees stifling\nenterprise.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" Opperly agreed. \"Still, the scientist lived the safe,\nrestricted, highly respectable life of a university man. He wasn't\nexposed to the temptations of the world.\"\nFarquar turned on him. \"Are you implying that the Thinkers will somehow\nbe able to buy me off?\"\n\"Not exactly.\"\n\"You think I'll be persuaded to change my aims?\" Farquar demanded\nangrily.\nOpperly shrugged his helplessness. \"No, I don't think you'll change\nyour aims.\"\nClouds encroaching from the west blotted the parallelogram of sunlight\nbetween the two men.\nAs the slideway whisked him gently along the corridor toward his\napartment, Jorj was thinking of his spaceship. For a moment the\nsilver-winged vision crowded everything else out of his mind.\nJust think, a spaceship with sails! He smiled a bit, marveling at the\nparadox.\nDirect atomic power. Direct utilization of the force of the flying\nneutrons. No more ridiculous business of using a reactor to drive a\nsteam engine, or boil off something for a jet exhaust\u2014processes that\nwere as primitive and wasteful as burning gunpowder to keep yourself\nwarm.\nChemical jets would carry his spaceship above the atmosphere. Then\nwould come the thrilling order, \"Set sail for Mars!\" The vast umbrella\nwould unfold and open out around the stern, its rear or Earthward side\na gleaming expanse of radioactive ribbon perhaps only an atom thick\nand backed with a material that would reflect neutrons. Atoms in the\nribbon would split, blasting neutrons astern at fantastic velocities.\nReaction would send the spaceship hurtling forward.\nIn airless space, the expanse of sails would naturally not retard the\nship. More radioactive ribbon, manufactured as needed in the ship\nitself, would feed out onto the sail as that already there became\nexhausted.\nA spaceship with direct nuclear drive\u2014and he, a Thinker, had\nconceived it completely except for the technical details! Having\nstrengthened his mind by hard years of somno-learning, mind-casting,\nmemory-straightening, and sensory training, he had assured himself\nof the executive power to control the technicians and direct their\nspecialized abilities. Together they would build the true Mars rocket.\nBut that would only be a beginning. They would build the true Mind\nBomb. They would build the true Selective Microbe Slayer. They would\ndiscover the true laws of ESP and the inner life. They would even\u2014his\nimagination hesitated a moment, then strode boldly forward\u2014build the\ntrue Maizie!\nAnd then ... then the Thinkers would be on even terms with the\nscientists. Rather, they'd be far ahead. No more deception.\nHe was so exalted by this thought that he almost let the slideway carry\nhim past his door. He stepped inside and called, \"Caddy!\" He waited a\nmoment, then walked through the apartment, but she wasn't there.\nConfound the girl, he couldn't help thinking. This morning, when she\nshould have made herself scarce, she'd sprawled about sleeping. Now,\nwhen he felt like seeing her, when her presence would have added a\npleasant final touch to his glowing mood, she chose to be absent. He\nreally should use his hypnotic control on her, he decided, and again\nthere sprang into his mind the word\u2014a pet form of her name\u2014that would\nsend her into obedient trance.\nNo, he told himself again, that was to be reserved for some moment\nof crisis or desperate danger, when he would need someone to strike\nsuddenly and unquestioningly for himself and mankind. Caddy was merely\na wilful and rather silly girl, incapable at present of understanding\nthe tremendous tensions under which he operated. When he had time for\nit, he would train her up to be a fitting companion without hypnosis.\nYet the fact of her absence had a subtly disquieting effect. It shook\nhis perfect self-confidence just a fraction. He asked himself if\nhe'd been wise in summoning the rocket physicists without consulting\nTregarron.\nBut this mood, too, he conquered quickly. Tregarron wasn't his\nboss, but just the Thinker's most clever salesman, an expert in the\nmumbo-jumbo so necessary for social control in this chaotic era. He\nhimself, Jorj Helmuth, was the real leader in theoretics and all-over\nstrategy, the mind behind the mind behind Maizie.\nHe stretched himself on the bed, almost instantly achieved maximum\nrelaxation, turned on the somno-learner, and began the two hour rest he\nknew would be desirable before the big conference.\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nAppointment in Tomorrow\nBY FRITZ LEIBER\nIllustrated by ED ALEXANDER\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nGalaxy Science Fiction July 1951.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nIs it possible to have a world without moral values?\nOr does lack of morality become a moral value, also?\nThe first angry rays of the sun\u2014which, startlingly enough, still rose\nin the east at 24 hour intervals\u2014pierced the lacy tops of Atlantic\ncombers and touched thousands of sleeping Americans with unconscious\nfear, because of their unpleasant similarity to the rays from World War\nIII's atomic bombs.\nThey turned to blood the witch-circle of rusty steel skeletons around\nInferno in Manhattan. Without comment, they pointed a cosmic finger at\nthe tarnished brass plaque commemorating the martyrdom of the Three\nPhysicists after the dropping of the Hell Bomb. They tenderly touched\nthe rosy skin and strawberry bruises on the naked shoulders of a\ngirl sleeping off a drunk on the furry and radiantly heated floor of\na nearby roof garden. They struck green magic from the glassy blot\nthat was Old Washington. Twelve hours before, they had revealed things\nas eerily beautiful, and as ravaged, in Asia and Russia. They pinked\nthe white walls of the Colonial dwelling of Morton Opperly near the\nInstitute for Advanced Studies; upstairs they slanted impartially\nacross the Pharoahlike and open-eyed face of the elderly physicist and\nthe ugly, sleep-surly one of young Willard Farquar in the next room.\nAnd in nearby New Washington they made of the spire of the Thinkers'\nFoundation a blue and optimistic glory that outshone White House, Jr.\nIt was America approaching the end of the Twentieth Century. America\nof juke-box burlesque and your local radiation hospital. America\nof the mask-fad for women and Mystic Christianity. America of the\noff-the-bosom dress and the New Blue Laws. America of the Endless War\nand the loyalty detector. America of marvelous Maizie and the monthly\nrocket to Mars. America of the Thinkers and (a few remembered) the\nInstitute. \"Knock on titanium,\" \"Whadya do for black-outs,\" \"Please,\nlover, don't think when I'm around,\" America, as combat-shocked and\ncrippled as the rest of the bomb-shattered planet.\nNot one impudent photon of the sunlight penetrated the triple-paned,\npolarizing windows of Jorj Helmuth's bedroom in the Thinker's\nFoundation, yet the clock in his brain awakened him to the minute,\nor almost. Switching off the Educational Sandman in the midst of the\nphrase, \"... applying tensor calculus to the nucleus,\" he took a\ndeep, even breath and cast his mind to the limits of the world and\nhis knowledge. It was a somewhat shadowy vision, but, he noted with\nimpartial approval, definitely less shadowy than yesterday morning.\nEmploying a rapid mental scanning technique, he next cleared his memory\nchains of false associations, including those acquired while asleep.\nThese chores completed, he held his finger on a bedside button, which\nrotated the polarizing window panes until the room slowly filled with a\nmuted daylight. Then, still flat on his back, he turned his head until\nhe could look at the remarkably beautiful blonde girl asleep beside him.\nRemembering last night, he felt a pang of exasperation, which he\ninstantly quelled by taking his mind to a higher and dispassionate\nlevel from which he could look down on the girl and even himself as\nquaint, clumsy animals. Still, he grumbled silently, Caddy might have\nhad enough consideration to clear out before he awoke. He wondered\nif he shouldn't have used his hypnotic control of the girl to smooth\ntheir relationship last night, and for a moment the word that would\nsend her into deep trance trembled on the tip of his tongue. But no,\nthat special power of his over her was reserved for far more important\npurposes.\nPumping dynamic tension into his 20-year-old muscles and confidence\ninto his 60-year-old mind, the 40-year-old Thinker rose from bed.\nNo covers had to be thrown off; the nuclear heating unit made them\nunnecessary. He stepped into his clothing\u2014the severe tunic, tights and\nsockassins of the modern business man. Next he glanced at the message\ntape beside his phone, washed down with ginger ale a vita-amino-enzyme\ntablet, and walked to the window. There, gazing along the rows of newly\nplanted mutant oaks lining Decontamination Avenue, his smooth face\nbroke into a smile.\nIt had come to him, the next big move in the intricate game making\nup his life\u2014and mankind's. Come to him during sleep, as so many of\nhis best decisions did, because he regularly employed the time-saving\ntechnique of somno-thought, which could function at the same time as\nsomno-learning.\nHe set his who?-where? robot for \"Rocket Physicist\" and \"Genius Class.\"\nWhile it worked, he dictated to his steno-robot the following brief\nmessage:\nDear Fellow Scientist:\nA project is contemplated that will have a crucial bearing on man's\nfuture in deep space. Ample non-military Government funds are\navailable. There was a time when professional men scoffed at the\nThinkers. Then there was a time when the Thinkers perforce neglected\nthe professional men. Now both times are past. May they never return!\nI would like to consult you this afternoon, three o'clock sharp,\nThinkers' Foundation I.\nJorj Helmuth\nMeanwhile the who?-where? had tossed out a dozen cards. He glanced\nthrough them, hesitated at the name \"Willard Farquar,\" looked at the\nsleeping girl, then quickly tossed them all into the addresso-robot and\nplugged in the steno-robot.\nThe buzz-light blinked green and he switched the phone to audio.\n\"The President is waiting to see Maizie, sir,\" a clear feminine voice\nannounced. \"He has the general staff with him.\"\n\"Martian peace to him,\" Jorj Helmuth said. \"Tell him I'll be down in a\nfew minutes.\"\nHuge as a primitive nuclear reactor, the great electronic brain loomed\nabove the knot of hush-voiced men. It almost filled a two-story room in\nthe Thinkers' Foundation. Its front was an orderly expanse of controls,\nindicators, telltales, and terminals, the upper ones reached by a chair\non a boom.\nAlthough, as far as anyone knew, it could sense only the information\nand questions fed into it on a tape, the human visitors could not\nresist the impulse to talk in whispers and glance uneasily at the great\ncryptic cube. After all, it had lately taken to moving some of its\nown controls\u2014the permissible ones\u2014and could doubtless improvise a\nhearing apparatus if it wanted to.\nFor this was the thinking machine beside which the Marks and Eniacs and\nManiacs and Maddidas and Minervas and Mimirs were less than Morons.\nThis was the machine with a million times as many synapses as the human\nbrain, the machine that remembered by cutting delicate notches in the\nrims of molecules (instead of kindergarten paper-punching or the Coney\nIsland shimmying of columns of mercury). This was the machine that had\ngiven instructions on building the last three-quarters of itself. This\nwas the goal, perhaps, toward which fallible human reasoning and biased\nhuman judgment and feeble human ambition had evolved.\nThis was the machine that really thought\u2014a million-plus!\nThis was the machine that the timid cyberneticists and stuffy\nprofessional scientists had said could not be built. Yet this was the\nmachine that the Thinkers, with characteristic Yankee push,\nhad\nbuilt. And nicknamed, with characteristic Yankee irreverence and\ngirl-fondness, \"Maizie.\"\nGazing up at it, the President of the United States felt a chord\nplucked within him that hadn't been sounded for decades, the dark and\nshivery organ chord of his Baptist childhood. Here, in a strange sense,\nalthough his reason rejected it, he felt he stood face to face with\nthe living God: infinitely stern with the sternness of reality, yet\ninfinitely just. No tiniest error or wilful misstep could ever escape\nthe scrutiny of this vast mentality. He shivered.\nThe grizzled general\u2014there was also one who was gray\u2014was thinking\nthat this was a very odd link in the chain of command. Some shadowy and\nusually well-controlled memories from World War II faintly stirred his\nire. Here he was giving orders to a being immeasurably more intelligent\nthan himself. And always orders of the \"Tell me how to kill that man\"\nrather than the \"Kill that man\" sort. The distinction bothered him\nobscurely. It relieved him to know that Maizie had built-in controls\nwhich made her always the servant of humanity, or of humanity's\nright-minded leaders\u2014even the Thinkers weren't certain which.\nThe gray general was thinking uneasily, and, like the President, at a\nmore turbid level, of the resemblance between Papal infallibility and\nthe dictates of the machine. Suddenly his bony wrists began to tremble.\nHe asked himself: Was this the Second Coming? Mightn't an incarnation\nbe in metal rather than flesh?\nThe austere Secretary of State was remembering what he'd taken such\npains to make everyone forget: his youthful flirtation at Lake Success\nwith Buddhism. Sitting before his\nguru\n, his teacher, feeling the\nOccidental's awe at the wisdom of the East, or its pretense, he had\nfelt a little like this.\nThe burly Secretary of Space, who had come up through United Rockets,\nwas thanking his stars that at any rate the professional scientists\nweren't responsible for this job. Like the grizzled general, he'd\nalways felt suspicious of men who kept telling you how to do things,\nrather than doing them themselves. In World War III he'd had his fill\nof the professional physicists, with their eternal taint of a misty\nsort of radicalism and free-thinking. The Thinkers were better\u2014more\ndisciplined, more human. They'd called their brain-machine Maizie,\nwhich helped take the curse off her. Somewhat.\nThe President's Secretary, a paunchy veteran of party caucuses, was\nalso glad that it was the Thinkers who had created the machine, though\nhe trembled at the power that it gave them over the Administration.\nStill, you could do business with the Thinkers. And nobody (not even\nthe Thinkers) could do business (that sort of business) with Maizie!\nBefore that great square face with its thousands of tiny metal\nfeatures, only Jorj Helmuth seemed at ease, busily entering on the\ntape the complex Questions of the Day that the high officials had\nhanded him: logistics for the Endless War in Pakistan, optimum size for\nnext year's sugar-corn crop, current thought trends in average Soviet\nminds\u2014profound questions, yet many of them phrased with surprising\nsimplicity. For figures, technical jargon, and layman's language were\nalike to Maizie; there was no need to translate into mathematical\nshorthand, as with the lesser brain-machines.\nThe click of the taper went on until the Secretary of State had twice\nnervously fired a cigaret with his ultrasonic lighter and twice quickly\nput it away. No one spoke.\nJorj looked up at the Secretary of Space. \"Section Five, Question\nFour\u2014whom would that come from?\"\nThe burly man frowned. \"That would be the physics boys, Opperly's\ngroup. Is anything wrong?\"\nJorj did not answer. A bit later he quit taping and began to adjust\ncontrols, going up on the boom-chair to reach some of them. Eventually\nhe came down and touched a few more, then stood waiting.\nFrom the great cube came a profound, steady purring. Involuntarily the\nsix officials backed off a bit. Somehow it was impossible for a man to\nget used to the sound of Maizie starting to think.\nJorj turned, smiling. \"And now, gentlemen, while we wait for Maizie\nto celebrate, there should be just enough time for us to watch the\ntakeoff of the Mars rocket.\" He switched on a giant television screen.\nThe others made a quarter turn, and there before them glowed the rich\nochres and blues of a New Mexico sunrise and, in the middle distance, a\nsilvery mighty spindle.\nLike the generals, the Secretary of Space suppressed a scowl. Here\nwas something that ought to be spang in the center of his official\nterritory, and the Thinkers had locked him completely out of it. That\nrocket there\u2014just an ordinary Earth satellite vehicle commandeered\nfrom the Army, but equipped by the Thinkers with Maizie-designed\nnuclear motors capable of the Mars journey and more. The first\nspaceship\u2014and the Secretary of Space was not in on it!\nStill, he told himself, Maizie had decreed it that way. And when\nhe remembered what the Thinkers had done for him in rescuing him\nfrom breakdown with their mental science, in rescuing the whole\nAdministration from collapse he realized he had to be satisfied. And\nthat was without taking into consideration the amazing additional\nmental discoveries that the Thinkers were bringing down from Mars.\n\"Lord,\" the President said to Jorj as if voicing the Secretary's\nfeeling, \"I wish you people could bring a couple of those wise little\ndevils back with you this trip. Be a good thing for the country.\"\nJorj looked at him a bit coldly. \"It's quite unthinkable,\" he said.\n\"The telepathic abilities of the Martians make them extremely\nsensitive. The conflicts of ordinary Earth minds would impinge on them\npsychotically, even fatally. As you know, the Thinkers were able to\ncontact them only because of our degree of learned mental poise and\nerrorless memory-chains. So for the present it must be our task alone\nto glean from the Martians their astounding mental skills. Of course,\nsome day in the future, when we have discovered how to armor the minds\nof the Martians\u2014\"\n\"Sure, I know,\" the President said hastily. \"Shouldn't have mentioned\nit, Jorj.\"\nConversation ceased. They waited with growing tension for the great\nviolet flames to bloom from the base of the silvery shaft.\nMeanwhile the question tape, like a New Year's streamer tossed out\na high window into the night, sped on its dark way along spinning\nrollers. Curling with an intricate aimlessness curiously like that\nof such a streamer, it tantalized the silvery fingers of a thousand\nrelays, saucily evaded the glances of ten thousand electric eyes,\nimpishly darted down a narrow black alleyway of memory banks, and,\nreaching the center of the cube, suddenly emerged into a small room\nwhere a suave fat man in shorts sat drinking beer.\nHe flipped the tape over to him with practiced finger, eyeing it as\na stockbroker might have studied a ticker tape. He read the first\nquestion, closed his eyes and frowned for five seconds. Then with the\nstaccato self-confidence of a hack writer, he began to tape out the\nanswer.\nFor many minutes the only sounds were the rustle of the paper ribbon\nand the click of the taper, except for the seconds the fat man took to\nclose his eyes, or to drink or pour beer. Once, too, he lifted a phone,\nasked a concise question, waited half a minute, listened to an answer,\nthen went back to the grind.\nUntil he came to Section Five, Question Four. That time he did his\nthinking with his eyes open.\nThe question was: \"Does Maizie stand for Maelzel?\"\nHe sat for a while slowly scratching his thigh. His loose, persuasive\nlips tightened, without closing, into the shape of a snarl.\nSuddenly he began to tape again.\n\"Maizie does not stand for Maelzel. Maizie stands for amazing,\nhumorously given the form of a girl's name. Section Six, Answer One:\nThe mid-term election viewcasts should be spaced as follows....\"\nBut his lips didn't lose the shape of a snarl.\nFive hundred miles above the ionosphere, the Mars rocket cut off\nits fuel and slumped gratefully into an orbit that would carry it\neffortlessly around the world at that altitude. The pilot unstrapped\nhimself and stretched, but he didn't look out the viewport at the\ndried-mud disc that was Earth, cloaked in its haze of blue sky. He knew\nhe had two maddening months ahead of him in which to do little more\nthan that. Instead, he unstrapped Sappho.\nUsed to free fall from two previous experiences, and loving it, the\nfluffy little cat was soon bounding about the cabin in curves and\ngyrations that would have made her the envy of all back-alley and\nparlor felines on the planet below. A miracle cat in the dream world of\nfree fall. For a long time she played with a string that the man would\ntoss out lazily. Sometimes she caught the string on the fly, sometimes\nshe swam for it frantically.\nAfter a while the man grew bored with the game. He unlocked a drawer\nand began to study the details of the wisdom he would discover on\nMars this trip\u2014priceless spiritual insights that would be balm to\nwar-battered mankind.\nThe cat carefully selected a spot three feet off the floor, curled up\non the air, and went to sleep.\nJorj Helmuth snipped the emerging answer tape into sections and handed\neach to the appropriate man. Most of them carefully tucked theirs away\nwith little more than a glance, but the Secretary of Space puzzled over\nhis.\n\"Who the devil would Maelzel be?\" he asked.\nA remote look came into the eyes of the Secretary of State. \"Edgar\nAllen Poe,\" he said frowningly, with eyes half-closed.\nThe grizzled general snapped his fingers. \"Sure! Maelzel's Chess\nplayer. Read it when I was a kid. About an automaton that was supposed\nto play chess. Poe proved it hid a man inside it.\"\nThe Secretary of Space frowned. \"Now what's the point in a fool\nquestion like that?\"\n\"You said it came from Opperly's group?\" Jorj asked sharply.\nThe Secretary of Space nodded. The others looked at the two men\npuzzledly.\n\"Who would that be?\" Jorj pressed. \"The group, I mean.\"\nThe Secretary of Space shrugged. \"Oh, the usual little bunch over at\nthe Institute. Hindeman, Gregory, Opperly himself. Oh, yes, and young\nFarquar.\"\n\"Sounds like Opperly's getting senile,\" Jorj commented coldly. \"I'd\ninvestigate.\"\nThe Secretary of Space nodded. He suddenly looked tough. \"I will. Right\naway.\"\nSunlight striking through French windows spotlighted a ballet of dust\nmotes untroubled by air-conditioning. Morton Opperly's living room was\nwell-kept but worn and quite behind the times. Instead of reading tapes\nthere were books; instead of steno-robots, pen and ink; while in place\nof a four by six TV screen, a Picasso hung on the wall. Only Opperly\nknew that the painting was still faintly radioactive, that it had been\nriskily so when he'd smuggled it out of his bomb-singed apartment in\nNew York City.\nThe two physicists fronted each other across a coffee table. The face\nof the elder was cadaverous, large-eyed, and tender\u2014fined down by\na long life of abstract thought. That of the younger was forceful,\nsensuous, bulky as his body, and exceptionally ugly. He looked rather\nlike a bear.\nOpperly was saying, \"So when he asked who was responsible for the\nMaelzel question, I said I didn't remember.\" He smiled. \"They still\nallow me my absent-mindedness, since it nourishes their contempt.\nAlmost my sole remaining privilege.\" The smile faded. \"Why do you keep\non teasing the zoo animals, Willard?\" he asked without rancor. \"I've\nmaintained many times that we shouldn't truckle to them by yielding\nto their demand that we ask Maizie questions. You and the rest have\noverruled me. But then to use those questions to convey veiled insults\nisn't reasonable. Apparently the Secretary of Space was bothered enough\nabout this last one to pay me a 'copter call within twenty minutes of\nthis morning's meeting at the Foundation. Why do you do it, Willard?\"\nThe features of the other convulsed unpleasantly. \"Because the\nThinkers are charlatans who must be exposed,\" he rapped out. \"We know\ntheir Maizie is no more than a tealeaf-reading fake. We've traced their\nMars rockets and found they go nowhere. We know their Martian mental\nscience is bunk.\"\n\"But we've already exposed the Thinkers very thoroughly,\" Opperly\ninterposed quietly. \"You know the good it did.\"\nFarquar hunched his Japanese-wrestler shoulders. \"Then it's got to be\ndone until it takes.\"\nOpperly studied the bowl of mutated flowers by the coffee pot. \"I think\nyou just want to tease the animals, for some personal reason of which\nyou probably aren't aware.\"\nFarquar scowled. \"We're the ones in the cages.\"\nOpperly continued his inspection of the flowers' bells. \"All the more\nreason not to poke sticks through the bars at the lions and tigers\nstrolling outside. No, Willard, I'm not counseling appeasement. But\nconsider the age in which we live. It wants magicians.\" His voice grew\nespecially tranquil. \"A scientist tells people the truth. When times\nare good\u2014that is, when the truth offers no threat\u2014people don't mind.\nBut when times are very, very bad....\" A shadow darkened his eyes.\n\"Well, we all know what happened to\u2014\" And he mentioned three names\nthat had been household words in the middle of the century. They\nwere the names on the brass plaque dedicated to the martyred three\nphysicists.\nHe went on, \"A magician, on the other hand, tells people what they\nwish were true\u2014that perpetual motion works, that cancer can be cured\nby colored lights, that a psychosis is no worse than a head cold, that\nthey'll live forever. In good times magicians are laughed at. They're a\nluxury of the spoiled wealthy few. But in bad times people sell their\nsouls for magic cures, and buy perpetual motion machines to power their\nwar rockets.\"\nFarquar clenched his fist. \"All the more reason to keep chipping away\nat the Thinkers. Are we supposed to beg off from a job because it's\ndifficult and dangerous?\"\nOpperly shook his head. \"We're to keep clear of the infection of\nviolence. In my day, Willard, I was one of the Frightened Men. Later I\nwas one of the Angry Men and then one of the Minds of Despair. Now I'm\nconvinced that all my reactions were futile.\"\n\"Exactly!\" Farquar agreed harshly. \"You reacted. You didn't act. If\nyou men who discovered atomic energy had only formed a secret league,\nif you'd only had the foresight and the guts to use your tremendous\nbargaining position to demand the power to shape mankind's future....\"\n\"By the time you were born, Willard,\" Opperly interrupted dreamily,\n\"Hitler was merely a name in the history books. We scientists weren't\nthe stuff out of which cloak-and-dagger men are made. Can you imagine\nOppenheimer wearing a mask or Einstein sneaking into the Old White\nHouse with a bomb in his briefcase?\" He smiled. \"Besides, that's not\nthe way power is seized. New ideas aren't useful to the man bargaining\nfor power\u2014only established facts or lies are.\"\n\"Just the same, it would have been a good thing if you'd had a little\nviolence in you.\"\n\"No,\" Opperly said.\n\"I've got violence in me,\" Farquar announced, shoving himself to his\nfeet.\nOpperly looked up from the flowers. \"I think you have,\" he agreed.\n\"But what are we to do?\" Farquar demanded. \"Surrender the world to\ncharlatans without a struggle?\"\nOpperly mused for a while. \"I don't know what the world needs now.\nEveryone knows Newton as the great scientist. Few remember that\nhe spent half his life muddling with alchemy, looking for the\nphilosopher's stone. Which Newton did the world need then?\"\n\"Now you are justifying the Thinkers!\"\n\"No, I leave that to history.\"\n\"And history consists of the actions of men,\" Farquar concluded. \"I\nintend to act. The Thinkers are vulnerable, their power fantastically\nprecarious. What's it based on? A few lucky guesses. Faith-healing.\nSome science hocus-pocus, on the level of those juke-box burlesque acts\nbetween the strips. Dubious mental comfort given to a few nerve-torn\nneurotics in the Inner Cabinet\u2014and their wives. The fact that the\nThinkers' clever stage-managing won the President a doubtful election.\nThe erroneous belief that the Soviets pulled out of Iraq and Iran\nbecause of the Thinkers' Mind Bomb threat. A brain-machine that's just\na cover for Jan Tregarron's guesswork. Oh, yes, and that hogwash of\n'Martian wisdom.' All of it mere bluff! A few pushes at the right times\nand points are all that are needed\u2014and the Thinkers know it! I'll bet\nthey're terrified already, and will be more so when they find that\nwe're gunning for them. Eventually they'll be making overtures to us,\nturning to us for help. You wait and see.\"\n\"I am thinking again of Hitler,\" Opperly interposed quietly. \"On his\nfirst half dozen big steps, he had nothing but bluff. His generals\nwere against him. They knew they were in a cardboard fort. Yet he won\nevery battle, until the last. Moreover,\" he pressed on, cutting Farquar\nshort, \"the power of the Thinkers isn't based on what they've got, but\non what the world hasn't got\u2014peace, honor, a good conscience....\"\nThe front-door knocker clanked. Farquar answered it. A skinny old man\nwith a radiation scar twisting across his temple handed him a tiny\ncylinder. \"Radiogram for you, Willard.\" He grinned across the hall at\nOpperly. \"When are you going to get a phone put in, Mr. Opperly?\"\nThe physicist waved to him. \"Next year, perhaps, Mr. Berry.\"\nThe old man snorted with good-humored incredulity and trudged off.\n\"What did I tell you about the Thinkers making overtures?\" Farquar\nchortled suddenly. \"It's come sooner than I expected. Look at this.\"\nHe held out the radiogram, but the older man didn't take it. Instead he\nasked, \"Who's it from? Tregarron?\"\n\"No, from Helmuth. There's a lot of sugar corn about man's future in\ndeep space, but the real reason is clear. They know that they're going\nto have to produce an actual nuclear rocket pretty soon, and for that\nthey'll need our help.\"\n\"An invitation?\"\nFarquar nodded. \"For this afternoon.\" He noticed Opperly's anxious\nthough distant frown. \"What's the matter?\" he asked. \"Are you bothered\nabout my going? Are you thinking it might be a trap\u2014that after the\nMaelzel question they may figure I'm better rubbed out?\"\nThe older man shook his head. \"I'm not afraid for your life, Willard.\nThat's yours to risk as you choose. No, I'm worried about other things\nthey might do to you.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" Farquar asked.\nOpperly looked at him with a gentle appraisal. \"You're a strong and\nvital man, Willard, with a strong man's prides and desires.\" His voice\ntrailed off for a bit. Then, \"Excuse me, Willard, but wasn't there a\ngirl once? A Miss Arkady?\"\nFarquar's ungainly figure froze. He nodded curtly, face averted.\n\"And didn't she go off with a Thinker?\"\n\"If girls find me ugly, that's their business,\" Farquar said harshly,\nstill not looking at Opperly. \"What's that got to do with this\ninvitation?\"\nOpperly didn't answer the question. His eyes got more distant. Finally\nhe said, \"In my day we had it a lot easier. A scientist was an\nacademician, cushioned by tradition.\"\nWillard snorted. \"Science had already entered the era of the police\ninspectors, with laboratory directors and political appointees stifling\nenterprise.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" Opperly agreed. \"Still, the scientist lived the safe,\nrestricted, highly respectable life of a university man. He wasn't\nexposed to the temptations of the world.\"\nFarquar turned on him. \"Are you implying that the Thinkers will somehow\nbe able to buy me off?\"\n\"Not exactly.\"\n\"You think I'll be persuaded to change my aims?\" Farquar demanded\nangrily.\nOpperly shrugged his helplessness. \"No, I don't think you'll change\nyour aims.\"\nClouds encroaching from the west blotted the parallelogram of sunlight\nbetween the two men.\nAs the slideway whisked him gently along the corridor toward his\napartment, Jorj was thinking of his spaceship. For a moment the\nsilver-winged vision crowded everything else out of his mind.\nJust think, a spaceship with sails! He smiled a bit, marveling at the\nparadox.\nDirect atomic power. Direct utilization of the force of the flying\nneutrons. No more ridiculous business of using a reactor to drive a\nsteam engine, or boil off something for a jet exhaust\u2014processes that\nwere as primitive and wasteful as burning gunpowder to keep yourself\nwarm.\nChemical jets would carry his spaceship above the atmosphere. Then\nwould come the thrilling order, \"Set sail for Mars!\" The vast umbrella\nwould unfold and open out around the stern, its rear or Earthward side\na gleaming expanse of radioactive ribbon perhaps only an atom thick\nand backed with a material that would reflect neutrons. Atoms in the\nribbon would split, blasting neutrons astern at fantastic velocities.\nReaction would send the spaceship hurtling forward.\nIn airless space, the expanse of sails would naturally not retard the\nship. More radioactive ribbon, manufactured as needed in the ship\nitself, would feed out onto the sail as that already there became\nexhausted.\nA spaceship with direct nuclear drive\u2014and he, a Thinker, had\nconceived it completely except for the technical details! Having\nstrengthened his mind by hard years of somno-learning, mind-casting,\nmemory-straightening, and sensory training, he had assured himself\nof the executive power to control the technicians and direct their\nspecialized abilities. Together they would build the true Mars rocket.\nBut that would only be a beginning. They would build the true Mind\nBomb. They would build the true Selective Microbe Slayer. They would\ndiscover the true laws of ESP and the inner life. They would even\u2014his\nimagination hesitated a moment, then strode boldly forward\u2014build the\ntrue Maizie!\nAnd then ... then the Thinkers would be on even terms with the\nscientists. Rather, they'd be far ahead. No more deception.\nHe was so exalted by this thought that he almost let the slideway carry\nhim past his door. He stepped inside and called, \"Caddy!\" He waited a\nmoment, then walked through the apartment, but she wasn't there.\nConfound the girl, he couldn't help thinking. This morning, when she\nshould have made herself scarce, she'd sprawled about sleeping. Now,\nwhen he felt like seeing her, when her presence would have added a\npleasant final touch to his glowing mood, she chose to be absent. He\nreally should use his hypnotic control on her, he decided, and again\nthere sprang into his mind the word\u2014a pet form of her name\u2014that would\nsend her into obedient trance.\nNo, he told himself again, that was to be reserved for some moment\nof crisis or desperate danger, when he would need someone to strike\nsuddenly and unquestioningly for himself and mankind. Caddy was merely\na wilful and rather silly girl, incapable at present of understanding\nthe tremendous tensions under which he operated. When he had time for\nit, he would train her up to be a fitting companion without hypnosis.\nYet the fact of her absence had a subtly disquieting effect. It shook\nhis perfect self-confidence just a fraction. He asked himself if\nhe'd been wise in summoning the rocket physicists without consulting\nTregarron.\nBut this mood, too, he conquered quickly. Tregarron wasn't his\nboss, but just the Thinker's most clever salesman, an expert in the\nmumbo-jumbo so necessary for social control in this chaotic era. He\nhimself, Jorj Helmuth, was the real leader in theoretics and all-over\nstrategy, the mind behind the mind behind Maizie.\nHe stretched himself on the bed, almost instantly achieved maximum\nrelaxation, turned on the somno-learner, and began the two hour rest he\nknew would be desirable before the big conference.\n", "summary": "Jorj Helmuth is a scientist in his late-middle-aged years. He is in his bedroom, reflecting on the events of the past twelve hours. He has been working on a project at the Thinker's Foundation, and is tired of the endless repetition of mathematical calculations. He dreams of a beautiful blonde girl, and he thinks of her as a beautiful, innocent girl. He thinks of the importance of her in his life, and of the loneliness he feels when he is not with her. He wonders if it is possible to have a world without morals, and if it would be possible to live a happy, healthy life. He goes to bed, and suddenly the sun starts to shine on him. He feels a pang of pain, and realizes that he is losing consciousness. He tries to call the Institute for Advanced Studies, but the phone is busy. He hears a woman's voice, and turns on the light. She is a beautiful girl, but she is drunk and looks down on him, and seems to be in pain. He realizes that she is the one who is in distress, and the rays from the sun are hurting her. She tells him that she has to go to the doctor, and that she will be fine. He asks her to stay with him, but he is unable to leave. He tells her that he will be back in a few days, and she says that she should go to bed. He leaves, and goes to the subway. He wakes up in a hospital, and when he sees the news that the World War III has been declared over, he is shocked. He calls the Institute and is told that the Institute has been closed. He decides to go home, but is unable. He sees a woman, and after checking his balance on his balance sheet, he realizes that it is the same woman. He knows that she must be the same person he saw last night, and it is her. The woman tells him she is afraid of the rays, and asks him to leave, but Jorj refuses. He then goes to see the doctor and is informed that the rays are from the atomic bomb. He begins to feel sick, and then the woman, who is named Maizie, comes to his rescue. She explains that she was in a coma for a long time, and has been in a trance for the last 10 years. She asks him why he is so upset, and Jorji tells her he has to take care of her. Jorja tells her about the atomic bombs, and her father, the director of the Institute, tells her they are the reason for the lack of morals. She then tells him to go back to bed and that he has a headache. Jorrj goes to her, and they kiss. He kisses her, but then he feels a sharp pain in his shoulder. He turns around, and there is a group of men with spears and guns. He screams, and one of them shoots him. The men run away, and a group comes to help him. Jorg is taken to the hospital, where he is treated for his injuries. He awakes in a cell, and his wife is there with him.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, null, 0, 0, 0, 0, null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}

Without comment, they pointed a cosmic finger at\nthe tarnished brass plaque commemorating the martyrdom of the Three\nPhysicists after the dropping of the Hell Bomb. They tenderly touched\nthe rosy skin and strawberry bruises on the naked shoulders of a\ngirl sleeping off a drunk on the furry and radiantly heated floor of\na nearby roof garden. They struck green magic from the glassy blot\nthat was Old Washington. Twelve hours before, they had revealed things\nas eerily beautiful, and as ravaged, in Asia and Russia. They pinked\nthe white walls of the Colonial dwelling of Morton Opperly near the\nInstitute for Advanced Studies; upstairs they slanted impartially\nacross the Pharoahlike and open-eyed face of the elderly physicist and\nthe ugly, sleep-surly one of young Willard Farquar in the next room.\nAnd in nearby New Washington they made of the spire of the Thinkers'\nFoundation a blue and optimistic glory that outshone White House, Jr.\nIt was America approaching the end of the Twentieth Century. America\nof juke-box burlesque and your local radiation hospital. America\nof the mask-fad for women and Mystic Christianity. America of the\noff-the-bosom dress and the New Blue Laws. America of the Endless War\nand the loyalty detector. America of marvelous Maizie and the monthly\nrocket to Mars. America of the Thinkers and (a few remembered) the\nInstitute. \"Knock on titanium,\" \"Whadya do for black-outs,\" \"Please,\nlover, don't think when I'm around,\" America, as combat-shocked and\ncrippled as the rest of the bomb-shattered planet.\nNot one impudent photon of the sunlight penetrated the triple-paned,\npolarizing windows of Jorj Helmuth's bedroom in the Thinker's\nFoundation, yet the clock in his brain awakened him to the minute,\nor almost. Switching off the Educational Sandman in the midst of the\nphrase, \"... applying tensor calculus to the nucleus,\" he took a\ndeep, even breath and cast his mind to the limits of the world and\nhis knowledge. It was a somewhat shadowy vision, but, he noted with\nimpartial approval, definitely less shadowy than yesterday morning.\nEmploying a rapid mental scanning technique, he next cleared his memory\nchains of false associations, including those acquired while asleep.\nThese chores completed, he held his finger on a bedside button, which\nrotated the polarizing window panes until the room slowly filled with a\nmuted daylight. Then, still flat on his back, he turned his head until\nhe could look at the remarkably beautiful blonde girl asleep beside him.\nRemembering last night, he felt a pang of exasperation, which he\ninstantly quelled by taking his mind to a higher and dispassionate\nlevel from which he could look down on the girl and even himself as\nquaint, clumsy animals. Still, he grumbled silently, Caddy might have\nhad enough consideration to clear out before he awoke. He wondered\nif he shouldn't have used his hypnotic control of the girl to smooth\ntheir relationship last night, and for a moment the word that would\nsend her into deep trance trembled on the tip of his tongue. But no,\nthat special power of his over her was reserved for far more important\npurposes.\nPumping dynamic tension into his 20-year-old muscles and confidence\ninto his 60-year-old mind, the 40-year-old Thinker rose from bed.\nNo covers had to be thrown off; the nuclear heating unit made them\nunnecessary. He stepped into his clothing\u2014the severe tunic, tights and\nsockassins of the modern business man. Next he glanced at the message\ntape beside his phone, washed down with ginger ale a vita-amino-enzyme\ntablet, and walked to the window. There, gazing along the rows of newly\nplanted mutant oaks lining Decontamination Avenue, his smooth face\nbroke into a smile.\nIt had come to him, the next big move in the intricate game making\nup his life\u2014and mankind's. Come to him during sleep, as so many of\nhis best decisions did, because he regularly employed the time-saving\ntechnique of somno-thought, which could function at the same time as\nsomno-learning.\nHe set his who?-where? robot for \"Rocket Physicist\" and \"Genius Class.\"\nWhile it worked, he dictated to his steno-robot the following brief\nmessage:\nDear Fellow Scientist:\nA project is contemplated that will have a crucial bearing on man's\nfuture in deep space. Ample non-military Government funds are\navailable. There was a time when professional men scoffed at the\nThinkers. Then there was a time when the Thinkers perforce neglected\nthe professional men. Now both times are past. May they never return!\nI would like to consult you this afternoon, three o'clock sharp,\nThinkers' Foundation I.\nJorj Helmuth\nMeanwhile the who?-where? had tossed out a dozen cards. He glanced\nthrough them, hesitated at the name \"Willard Farquar,\" looked at the\nsleeping girl, then quickly tossed them all into the addresso-robot and\nplugged in the steno-robot.\nThe buzz-light blinked green and he switched the phone to audio.\n\"The President is waiting to see Maizie, sir,\" a clear feminine voice\nannounced. \"He has the general staff with him.\"\n\"Martian peace to him,\" Jorj Helmuth said. \"Tell him I'll be down in a\nfew minutes.\"\nHuge as a primitive nuclear reactor, the great electronic brain loomed\nabove the knot of hush-voiced men. It almost filled a two-story room in\nthe Thinkers' Foundation. Its front was an orderly expanse of controls,\nindicators, telltales, and terminals, the upper ones reached by a chair\non a boom.\nAlthough, as far as anyone knew, it could sense only the information\nand questions fed into it on a tape, the human visitors could not\nresist the impulse to talk in whispers and glance uneasily at the great\ncryptic cube. After all, it had lately taken to moving some of its\nown controls\u2014the permissible ones\u2014and could doubtless improvise a\nhearing apparatus if it wanted to.\nFor this was the thinking machine beside which the Marks and Eniacs and\nManiacs and Maddidas and Minervas and Mimirs were less than Morons.\nThis was the machine with a million times as many synapses as the human\nbrain, the machine that remembered by cutting delicate notches in the\nrims of molecules (instead of kindergarten paper-punching or the Coney\nIsland shimmying of columns of mercury). This was the machine that had\ngiven instructions on building the last three-quarters of itself. This\nwas the goal, perhaps, toward which fallible human reasoning and biased\nhuman judgment and feeble human ambition had evolved.\nThis was the machine that really thought\u2014a million-plus!\nThis was the machine that the timid cyberneticists and stuffy\nprofessional scientists had said could not be built. Yet this was the\nmachine that the Thinkers, with characteristic Yankee push,\nhad\nbuilt. And nicknamed, with characteristic Yankee irreverence and\ngirl-fondness, \"Maizie.\"\nGazing up at it, the President of the United States felt a chord\nplucked within him that hadn't been sounded for decades, the dark and\nshivery organ chord of his Baptist childhood. Here, in a strange sense,\nalthough his reason rejected it, he felt he stood face to face with\nthe living God: infinitely stern with the sternness of reality, yet\ninfinitely just. No tiniest error or wilful misstep could ever escape\nthe scrutiny of this vast mentality. He shivered.\nThe grizzled general\u2014there was also one who was gray\u2014was thinking\nthat this was a very odd link in the chain of command. Some shadowy and\nusually well-controlled memories from World War II faintly stirred his\nire. Here he was giving orders to a being immeasurably more intelligent\nthan himself. And always orders of the \"Tell me how to kill that man\"\nrather than the \"Kill that man\" sort. The distinction bothered him\nobscurely. It relieved him to know that Maizie had built-in controls\nwhich made her always the servant of humanity, or of humanity's\nright-minded leaders\u2014even the Thinkers weren't certain which.\nThe gray general was thinking uneasily, and, like the President, at a\nmore turbid level, of the resemblance between Papal infallibility and\nthe dictates of the machine. Suddenly his bony wrists began to tremble.\nHe asked himself: Was this the Second Coming? Mightn't an incarnation\nbe in metal rather than flesh?\nThe austere Secretary of State was remembering what he'd taken such\npains to make everyone forget: his youthful flirtation at Lake Success\nwith Buddhism. Sitting before his\nguru\n, his teacher, feeling the\nOccidental's awe at the wisdom of the East, or its pretense, he had\nfelt a little like this.\nThe burly Secretary of Space, who had come up through United Rockets,\nwas thanking his stars that at any rate the professional scientists\nweren't responsible for this job. Like the grizzled general, he'd\nalways felt suspicious of men who kept telling you how to do things,\nrather than doing them themselves. In World War III he'd had his fill\nof the professional physicists, with their eternal taint of a misty\nsort of radicalism and free-thinking. The Thinkers were better\u2014more\ndisciplined, more human. They'd called their brain-machine Maizie,\nwhich helped take the curse off her. Somewhat.\nThe President's Secretary, a paunchy veteran of party caucuses, was\nalso glad that it was the Thinkers who had created the machine, though\nhe trembled at the power that it gave them over the Administration.\nStill, you could do business with the Thinkers. And nobody (not even\nthe Thinkers) could do business (that sort of business) with Maizie!\nBefore that great square face with its thousands of tiny metal\nfeatures, only Jorj Helmuth seemed at ease, busily entering on the\ntape the complex Questions of the Day that the high officials had\nhanded him: logistics for the Endless War in Pakistan, optimum size for\nnext year's sugar-corn crop, current thought trends in average Soviet\nminds\u2014profound questions, yet many of them phrased with surprising\nsimplicity. For figures, technical jargon, and layman's language were\nalike to Maizie; there was no need to translate into mathematical\nshorthand, as with the lesser brain-machines.\nThe click of the taper went on until the Secretary of State had twice\nnervously fired a cigaret with his ultrasonic lighter and twice quickly\nput it away. No one spoke.\nJorj looked up at the Secretary of Space. \"Section Five, Question\nFour\u2014whom would that come from?\"\nThe burly man frowned. \"That would be the physics boys, Opperly's\ngroup. Is anything wrong?\"\nJorj did not answer. A bit later he quit taping and began to adjust\ncontrols, going up on the boom-chair to reach some of them. Eventually\nhe came down and touched a few more, then stood waiting.\nFrom the great cube came a profound, steady purring. Involuntarily the\nsix officials backed off a bit. Somehow it was impossible for a man to\nget used to the sound of Maizie starting to think.\nJorj turned, smiling. \"And now, gentlemen, while we wait for Maizie\nto celebrate, there should be just enough time for us to watch the\ntakeoff of the Mars rocket.\" He switched on a giant television screen.\nThe others made a quarter turn, and there before them glowed the rich\nochres and blues of a New Mexico sunrise and, in the middle distance, a\nsilvery mighty spindle.\nLike the generals, the Secretary of Space suppressed a scowl. Here\nwas something that ought to be spang in the center of his official\nterritory, and the Thinkers had locked him completely out of it. That\nrocket there\u2014just an ordinary Earth satellite vehicle commandeered\nfrom the Army, but equipped by the Thinkers with Maizie-designed\nnuclear motors capable of the Mars journey and more. The first\nspaceship\u2014and the Secretary of Space was not in on it!\nStill, he told himself, Maizie had decreed it that way. And when\nhe remembered what the Thinkers had done for him in rescuing him\nfrom breakdown with their mental science, in rescuing the whole\nAdministration from collapse he realized he had to be satisfied. And\nthat was without taking into consideration the amazing additional\nmental discoveries that the Thinkers were bringing down from Mars.\n\"Lord,\" the President said to Jorj as if voicing the Secretary's\nfeeling, \"I wish you people could bring a couple of those wise little\ndevils back with you this trip. Be a good thing for the country.\"\nJorj looked at him a bit coldly. \"It's quite unthinkable,\" he said.\n\"The telepathic abilities of the Martians make them extremely\nsensitive. The conflicts of ordinary Earth minds would impinge on them\npsychotically, even fatally. As you know, the Thinkers were able to\ncontact them only because of our degree of learned mental poise and\nerrorless memory-chains. So for the present it must be our task alone\nto glean from the Martians their astounding mental skills. Of course,\nsome day in the future, when we have discovered how to armor the minds\nof the Martians\u2014\"\n\"Sure, I know,\" the President said hastily. \"Shouldn't have mentioned\nit, Jorj.\"\nConversation ceased. They waited with growing tension for the great\nviolet flames to bloom from the base of the silvery shaft.\nMeanwhile the question tape, like a New Year's streamer tossed out\na high window into the night, sped on its dark way along spinning\nrollers. Curling with an intricate aimlessness curiously like that\nof such a streamer, it tantalized the silvery fingers of a thousand\nrelays, saucily evaded the glances of ten thousand electric eyes,\nimpishly darted down a narrow black alleyway of memory banks, and,\nreaching the center of the cube, suddenly emerged into a small room\nwhere a suave fat man in shorts sat drinking beer.\nHe flipped the tape over to him with practiced finger, eyeing it as\na stockbroker might have studied a ticker tape. He read the first\nquestion, closed his eyes and frowned for five seconds. Then with the\nstaccato self-confidence of a hack writer, he began to tape out the\nanswer.\nFor many minutes the only sounds were the rustle of the paper ribbon\nand the click of the taper, except for the seconds the fat man took to\nclose his eyes, or to drink or pour beer. Once, too, he lifted a phone,\nasked a concise question, waited half a minute, listened to an answer,\nthen went back to the grind.\nUntil he came to Section Five, Question Four. That time he did his\nthinking with his eyes open.\nThe question was: \"Does Maizie stand for Maelzel?\"\nHe sat for a while slowly scratching his thigh. His loose, persuasive\nlips tightened, without closing, into the shape of a snarl.\nSuddenly he began to tape again.\n\"Maizie does not stand for Maelzel. Maizie stands for amazing,\nhumorously given the form of a girl's name. Section Six, Answer One:\nThe mid-term election viewcasts should be spaced as follows....\"\nBut his lips didn't lose the shape of a snarl.\nFive hundred miles above the ionosphere, the Mars rocket cut off\nits fuel and slumped gratefully into an orbit that would carry it\neffortlessly around the world at that altitude. The pilot unstrapped\nhimself and stretched, but he didn't look out the viewport at the\ndried-mud disc that was Earth, cloaked in its haze of blue sky. He knew\nhe had two maddening months ahead of him in which to do little more\nthan that. Instead, he unstrapped Sappho.\nUsed to free fall from two previous experiences, and loving it, the\nfluffy little cat was soon bounding about the cabin in curves and\ngyrations that would have made her the envy of all back-alley and\nparlor felines on the planet below. A miracle cat in the dream world of\nfree fall. For a long time she played with a string that the man would\ntoss out lazily. Sometimes she caught the string on the fly, sometimes\nshe swam for it frantically.\nAfter a while the man grew bored with the game. He unlocked a drawer\nand began to study the details of the wisdom he would discover on\nMars this trip\u2014priceless spiritual insights that would be balm to\nwar-battered mankind.\nThe cat carefully selected a spot three feet off the floor, curled up\non the air, and went to sleep.\nJorj Helmuth snipped the emerging answer tape into sections and handed\neach to the appropriate man. Most of them carefully tucked theirs away\nwith little more than a glance, but the Secretary of Space puzzled over\nhis.\n\"Who the devil would Maelzel be?\" he asked.\nA remote look came into the eyes of the Secretary of State. \"Edgar\nAllen Poe,\" he said frowningly, with eyes half-closed.\nThe grizzled general snapped his fingers. \"Sure! Maelzel's Chess\nplayer. Read it when I was a kid. About an automaton that was supposed\nto play chess. Poe proved it hid a man inside it.\"\nThe Secretary of Space frowned. \"Now what's the point in a fool\nquestion like that?\"\n\"You said it came from Opperly's group?\" Jorj asked sharply.\nThe Secretary of Space nodded. The others looked at the two men\npuzzledly.\n\"Who would that be?\" Jorj pressed. \"The group, I mean.\"\nThe Secretary of Space shrugged. \"Oh, the usual little bunch over at\nthe Institute. Hindeman, Gregory, Opperly himself. Oh, yes, and young\nFarquar.\"\n\"Sounds like Opperly's getting senile,\" Jorj commented coldly. \"I'd\ninvestigate.\"\nThe Secretary of Space nodded. He suddenly looked tough. \"I will. Right\naway.\"\nSunlight striking through French windows spotlighted a ballet of dust\nmotes untroubled by air-conditioning. Morton Opperly's living room was\nwell-kept but worn and quite behind the times. Instead of reading tapes\nthere were books; instead of steno-robots, pen and ink; while in place\nof a four by six TV screen, a Picasso hung on the wall. Only Opperly\nknew that the painting was still faintly radioactive, that it had been\nriskily so when he'd smuggled it out of his bomb-singed apartment in\nNew York City.\nThe two physicists fronted each other across a coffee table. The face\nof the elder was cadaverous, large-eyed, and tender\u2014fined down by\na long life of abstract thought. That of the younger was forceful,\nsensuous, bulky as his body, and exceptionally ugly. He looked rather\nlike a bear.\nOpperly was saying, \"So when he asked who was responsible for the\nMaelzel question, I said I didn't remember.\" He smiled. \"They still\nallow me my absent-mindedness, since it nourishes their contempt.\nAlmost my sole remaining privilege.\" The smile faded. \"Why do you keep\non teasing the zoo animals, Willard?\" he asked without rancor. \"I've\nmaintained many times that we shouldn't truckle to them by yielding\nto their demand that we ask Maizie questions. You and the rest have\noverruled me. But then to use those questions to convey veiled insults\nisn't reasonable. Apparently the Secretary of Space was bothered enough\nabout this last one to pay me a 'copter call within twenty minutes of\nthis morning's meeting at the Foundation. Why do you do it, Willard?\"\nThe features of the other convulsed unpleasantly. \"Because the\nThinkers are charlatans who must be exposed,\" he rapped out. \"We know\ntheir Maizie is no more than a tealeaf-reading fake. We've traced their\nMars rockets and found they go nowhere. We know their Martian mental\nscience is bunk.\"\n\"But we've already exposed the Thinkers very thoroughly,\" Opperly\ninterposed quietly. \"You know the good it did.\"\nFarquar hunched his Japanese-wrestler shoulders. \"Then it's got to be\ndone until it takes.\"\nOpperly studied the bowl of mutated flowers by the coffee pot. \"I think\nyou just want to tease the animals, for some personal reason of which\nyou probably aren't aware.\"\nFarquar scowled. \"We're the ones in the cages.\"\nOpperly continued his inspection of the flowers' bells. \"All the more\nreason not to poke sticks through the bars at the lions and tigers\nstrolling outside. No, Willard, I'm not counseling appeasement. But\nconsider the age in which we live. It wants magicians.\" His voice grew\nespecially tranquil. \"A scientist tells people the truth. When times\nare good\u2014that is, when the truth offers no threat\u2014people don't mind.\nBut when times are very, very bad....\" A shadow darkened his eyes.\n\"Well, we all know what happened to\u2014\" And he mentioned three names\nthat had been household words in the middle of the century. They\nwere the names on the brass plaque dedicated to the martyred three\nphysicists.\nHe went on, \"A magician, on the other hand, tells people what they\nwish were true\u2014that perpetual motion works, that cancer can be cured\nby colored lights, that a psychosis is no worse than a head cold, that\nthey'll live forever. In good times magicians are laughed at. They're a\nluxury of the spoiled wealthy few. But in bad times people sell their\nsouls for magic cures, and buy perpetual motion machines to power their\nwar rockets.\"\nFarquar clenched his fist. \"All the more reason to keep chipping away\nat the Thinkers. Are we supposed to beg off from a job because it's\ndifficult and dangerous?\"\nOpperly shook his head. \"We're to keep clear of the infection of\nviolence. In my day, Willard, I was one of the Frightened Men. Later I\nwas one of the Angry Men and then one of the Minds of Despair. Now I'm\nconvinced that all my reactions were futile.\"\n\"Exactly!\" Farquar agreed harshly. \"You reacted. You didn't act. If\nyou men who discovered atomic energy had only formed a secret league,\nif you'd only had the foresight and the guts to use your tremendous\nbargaining position to demand the power to shape mankind's future....\"\n\"By the time you were born, Willard,\" Opperly interrupted dreamily,\n\"Hitler was merely a name in the history books. We scientists weren't\nthe stuff out of which cloak-and-dagger men are made. Can you imagine\nOppenheimer wearing a mask or Einstein sneaking into the Old White\nHouse with a bomb in his briefcase?\" He smiled. \"Besides, that's not\nthe way power is seized. New ideas aren't useful to the man bargaining\nfor power\u2014only established facts or lies are.\"\n\"Just the same, it would have been a good thing if you'd had a little\nviolence in you.\"\n\"No,\" Opperly said.\n\"I've got violence in me,\" Farquar announced, shoving himself to his\nfeet.\nOpperly looked up from the flowers. \"I think you have,\" he agreed.\n\"But what are we to do?\" Farquar demanded. \"Surrender the world to\ncharlatans without a struggle?\"\nOpperly mused for a while. \"I don't know what the world needs now.\nEveryone knows Newton as the great scientist. Few remember that\nhe spent half his life muddling with alchemy, looking for the\nphilosopher's stone. Which Newton did the world need then?\"\n\"Now you are justifying the Thinkers!\"\n\"No, I leave that to history.\"\n\"And history consists of the actions of men,\" Farquar concluded. \"I\nintend to act. The Thinkers are vulnerable, their power fantastically\nprecarious. What's it based on? A few lucky guesses. Faith-healing.\nSome science hocus-pocus, on the level of those juke-box burlesque acts\nbetween the strips. Dubious mental comfort given to a few nerve-torn\nneurotics in the Inner Cabinet\u2014and their wives. The fact that the\nThinkers' clever stage-managing won the President a doubtful election.\nThe erroneous belief that the Soviets pulled out of Iraq and Iran\nbecause of the Thinkers' Mind Bomb threat. A brain-machine that's just\na cover for Jan Tregarron's guesswork. Oh, yes, and that hogwash of\n'Martian wisdom.' All of it mere bluff! A few pushes at the right times\nand points are all that are needed\u2014and the Thinkers know it! I'll bet\nthey're terrified already, and will be more so when they find that\nwe're gunning for them. Eventually they'll be making overtures to us,\nturning to us for help. You wait and see.\"\n\"I am thinking again of Hitler,\" Opperly interposed quietly. \"On his\nfirst half dozen big steps, he had nothing but bluff. His generals\nwere against him. They knew they were in a cardboard fort. Yet he won\nevery battle, until the last. Moreover,\" he pressed on, cutting Farquar\nshort, \"the power of the Thinkers isn't based on what they've got, but\non what the world hasn't got\u2014peace, honor, a good conscience....\"\nThe front-door knocker clanked. Farquar answered it. A skinny old man\nwith a radiation scar twisting across his temple handed him a tiny\ncylinder. \"Radiogram for you, Willard.\" He grinned across the hall at\nOpperly. \"When are you going to get a phone put in, Mr. Opperly?\"\nThe physicist waved to him. \"Next year, perhaps, Mr. Berry.\"\nThe old man snorted with good-humored incredulity and trudged off.\n\"What did I tell you about the Thinkers making overtures?\" Farquar\nchortled suddenly. \"It's come sooner than I expected. Look at this.\"\nHe held out the radiogram, but the older man didn't take it. Instead he\nasked, \"Who's it from? Tregarron?\"\n\"No, from Helmuth. There's a lot of sugar corn about man's future in\ndeep space, but the real reason is clear. They know that they're going\nto have to produce an actual nuclear rocket pretty soon, and for that\nthey'll need our help.\"\n\"An invitation?\"\nFarquar nodded. \"For this afternoon.\" He noticed Opperly's anxious\nthough distant frown. \"What's the matter?\" he asked. \"Are you bothered\nabout my going? Are you thinking it might be a trap\u2014that after the\nMaelzel question they may figure I'm better rubbed out?\"\nThe older man shook his head. \"I'm not afraid for your life, Willard.\nThat's yours to risk as you choose. No, I'm worried about other things\nthey might do to you.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" Farquar asked.\nOpperly looked at him with a gentle appraisal. \"You're a strong and\nvital man, Willard, with a strong man's prides and desires.\" His voice\ntrailed off for a bit. Then, \"Excuse me, Willard, but wasn't there a\ngirl once? A Miss Arkady?\"\nFarquar's ungainly figure froze. He nodded curtly, face averted.\n\"And didn't she go off with a Thinker?\"\n\"If girls find me ugly, that's their business,\" Farquar said harshly,\nstill not looking at Opperly. \"What's that got to do with this\ninvitation?\"\nOpperly didn't answer the question. His eyes got more distant. Finally\nhe said, \"In my day we had it a lot easier. A scientist was an\nacademician, cushioned by tradition.\"\nWillard snorted. \"Science had already entered the era of the police\ninspectors, with laboratory directors and political appointees stifling\nenterprise.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" Opperly agreed. \"Still, the scientist lived the safe,\nrestricted, highly respectable life of a university man. He wasn't\nexposed to the temptations of the world.\"\nFarquar turned on him. \"Are you implying that the Thinkers will somehow\nbe able to buy me off?\"\n\"Not exactly.\"\n\"You think I'll be persuaded to change my aims?\" Farquar demanded\nangrily.\nOpperly shrugged his helplessness. \"No, I don't think you'll change\nyour aims.\"\nClouds encroaching from the west blotted the parallelogram of sunlight\nbetween the two men.\nAs the slideway whisked him gently along the corridor toward his\napartment, Jorj was thinking of his spaceship. For a moment the\nsilver-winged vision crowded everything else out of his mind.\nJust think, a spaceship with sails! He smiled a bit, marveling at the\nparadox.\nDirect atomic power. Direct utilization of the force of the flying\nneutrons. No more ridiculous business of using a reactor to drive a\nsteam engine, or boil off something for a jet exhaust\u2014processes that\nwere as primitive and wasteful as burning gunpowder to keep yourself\nwarm.\nChemical jets would carry his spaceship above the atmosphere. Then\nwould come the thrilling order, \"Set sail for Mars!\" The vast umbrella\nwould unfold and open out around the stern, its rear or Earthward side\na gleaming expanse of radioactive ribbon perhaps only an atom thick\nand backed with a material that would reflect neutrons. Atoms in the\nribbon would split, blasting neutrons astern at fantastic velocities.\nReaction would send the spaceship hurtling forward.\nIn airless space, the expanse of sails would naturally not retard the\nship. More radioactive ribbon, manufactured as needed in the ship\nitself, would feed out onto the sail as that already there became\nexhausted.\nA spaceship with direct nuclear drive\u2014and he, a Thinker, had\nconceived it completely except for the technical details! Having\nstrengthened his mind by hard years of somno-learning, mind-casting,\nmemory-straightening, and sensory training, he had assured himself\nof the executive power to control the technicians and direct their\nspecialized abilities. Together they would build the true Mars rocket.\nBut that would only be a beginning. They would build the true Mind\nBomb. They would build the true Selective Microbe Slayer. They would\ndiscover the true laws of ESP and the inner life. They would even\u2014his\nimagination hesitated a moment, then strode boldly forward\u2014build the\ntrue Maizie!\nAnd then ... then the Thinkers would be on even terms with the\nscientists. Rather, they'd be far ahead. No more deception.\nHe was so exalted by this thought that he almost let the slideway carry\nhim past his door. He stepped inside and called, \"Caddy!\" He waited a\nmoment, then walked through the apartment, but she wasn't there.\nConfound the girl, he couldn't help thinking. This morning, when she\nshould have made herself scarce, she'd sprawled about sleeping. Now,\nwhen he felt like seeing her, when her presence would have added a\npleasant final touch to his glowing mood, she chose to be absent. He\nreally should use his hypnotic control on her, he decided, and again\nthere sprang into his mind the word\u2014a pet form of her name\u2014that would\nsend her into obedient trance.\nNo, he told himself again, that was to be reserved for some moment\nof crisis or desperate danger, when he would need someone to strike\nsuddenly and unquestioningly for himself and mankind. Caddy was merely\na wilful and rather silly girl, incapable at present of understanding\nthe tremendous tensions under which he operated. When he had time for\nit, he would train her up to be a fitting companion without hypnosis.\nYet the fact of her absence had a subtly disquieting effect. It shook\nhis perfect self-confidence just a fraction. He asked himself if\nhe'd been wise in summoning the rocket physicists without consulting\nTregarron.\nBut this mood, too, he conquered quickly. Tregarron wasn't his\nboss, but just the Thinker's most clever salesman, an expert in the\nmumbo-jumbo so necessary for social control in this chaotic era. He\nhimself, Jorj Helmuth, was the real leader in theoretics and all-over\nstrategy, the mind behind the mind behind Maizie.\nHe stretched himself on the bed, almost instantly achieved maximum\nrelaxation, turned on the somno-learner, and began the two hour rest he\nknew would be desirable before the big conference.\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nAppointment in Tomorrow\nBY FRITZ LEIBER\nIllustrated by ED ALEXANDER\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nGalaxy Science Fiction July 1951.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nIs it possible to have a world without moral values?\nOr does lack of morality become a moral value, also?\nThe first angry rays of the sun\u2014which, startlingly enough, still rose\nin the east at 24 hour intervals\u2014pierced the lacy tops of Atlantic\ncombers and touched thousands of sleeping Americans with unconscious\nfear, because of their unpleasant similarity to the rays from World War\nIII's atomic bombs.\nThey turned to blood the witch-circle of rusty steel skeletons around\nInferno in Manhattan. Without comment, they pointed a cosmic finger at\nthe tarnished brass plaque commemorating the martyrdom of the Three\nPhysicists after the dropping of the Hell Bomb. They tenderly touched\nthe rosy skin and strawberry bruises on the naked shoulders of a\ngirl sleeping off a drunk on the furry and radiantly heated floor of\na nearby roof garden. They struck green magic from the glassy blot\nthat was Old Washington. Twelve hours before, they had revealed things\nas eerily beautiful, and as ravaged, in Asia and Russia. They pinked\nthe white walls of the Colonial dwelling of Morton Opperly near the\nInstitute for Advanced Studies; upstairs they slanted impartially\nacross the Pharoahlike and open-eyed face of the elderly physicist and\nthe ugly, sleep-surly one of young Willard Farquar in the next room.\nAnd in nearby New Washington they made of the spire of the Thinkers'\nFoundation a blue and optimistic glory that outshone White House, Jr.\nIt was America approaching the end of the Twentieth Century. America\nof juke-box burlesque and your local radiation hospital. America\nof the mask-fad for women and Mystic Christianity. America of the\noff-the-bosom dress and the New Blue Laws. America of the Endless War\nand the loyalty detector. America of marvelous Maizie and the monthly\nrocket to Mars. America of the Thinkers and (a few remembered) the\nInstitute. \"Knock on titanium,\" \"Whadya do for black-outs,\" \"Please,\nlover, don't think when I'm around,\" America, as combat-shocked and\ncrippled as the rest of the bomb-shattered planet.\nNot one impudent photon of the sunlight penetrated the triple-paned,\npolarizing windows of Jorj Helmuth's bedroom in the Thinker's\nFoundation, yet the clock in his brain awakened him to the minute,\nor almost. Switching off the Educational Sandman in the midst of the\nphrase, \"... applying tensor calculus to the nucleus,\" he took a\ndeep, even breath and cast his mind to the limits of the world and\nhis knowledge. It was a somewhat shadowy vision, but, he noted with\nimpartial approval, definitely less shadowy than yesterday morning.\nEmploying a rapid mental scanning technique, he next cleared his memory\nchains of false associations, including those acquired while asleep.\nThese chores completed, he held his finger on a bedside button, which\nrotated the polarizing window panes until the room slowly filled with a\nmuted daylight. Then, still flat on his back, he turned his head until\nhe could look at the remarkably beautiful blonde girl asleep beside him.\nRemembering last night, he felt a pang of exasperation, which he\ninstantly quelled by taking his mind to a higher and dispassionate\nlevel from which he could look down on the girl and even himself as\nquaint, clumsy animals. Still, he grumbled silently, Caddy might have\nhad enough consideration to clear out before he awoke. He wondered\nif he shouldn't have used his hypnotic control of the girl to smooth\ntheir relationship last night, and for a moment the word that would\nsend her into deep trance trembled on the tip of his tongue. But no,\nthat special power of his over her was reserved for far more important\npurposes.\nPumping dynamic tension into his 20-year-old muscles and confidence\ninto his 60-year-old mind, the 40-year-old Thinker rose from bed.\nNo covers had to be thrown off; the nuclear heating unit made them\nunnecessary. He stepped into his clothing\u2014the severe tunic, tights and\nsockassins of the modern business man. Next he glanced at the message\ntape beside his phone, washed down with ginger ale a vita-amino-enzyme\ntablet, and walked to the window. There, gazing along the rows of newly\nplanted mutant oaks lining Decontamination Avenue, his smooth face\nbroke into a smile.\nIt had come to him, the next big move in the intricate game making\nup his life\u2014and mankind's. Come to him during sleep, as so many of\nhis best decisions did, because he regularly employed the time-saving\ntechnique of somno-thought, which could function at the same time as\nsomno-learning.\nHe set his who?-where? robot for \"Rocket Physicist\" and \"Genius Class.\"\nWhile it worked, he dictated to his steno-robot the following brief\nmessage:\nDear Fellow Scientist:\nA project is contemplated that will have a crucial bearing on man's\nfuture in deep space. Ample non-military Government funds are\navailable. There was a time when professional men scoffed at the\nThinkers. Then there was a time when the Thinkers perforce neglected\nthe professional men. Now both times are past. May they never return!\nI would like to consult you this afternoon, three o'clock sharp,\nThinkers' Foundation I.\nJorj Helmuth\nMeanwhile the who?-where? had tossed out a dozen cards. He glanced\nthrough them, hesitated at the name \"Willard Farquar,\" looked at the\nsleeping girl, then quickly tossed them all into the addresso-robot and\nplugged in the steno-robot.\nThe buzz-light blinked green and he switched the phone to audio.\n\"The President is waiting to see Maizie, sir,\" a clear feminine voice\nannounced. \"He has the general staff with him.\"\n\"Martian peace to him,\" Jorj Helmuth said. \"Tell him I'll be down in a\nfew minutes.\"\nHuge as a primitive nuclear reactor, the great electronic brain loomed\nabove the knot of hush-voiced men. It almost filled a two-story room in\nthe Thinkers' Foundation. Its front was an orderly expanse of controls,\nindicators, telltales, and terminals, the upper ones reached by a chair\non a boom.\nAlthough, as far as anyone knew, it could sense only the information\nand questions fed into it on a tape, the human visitors could not\nresist the impulse to talk in whispers and glance uneasily at the great\ncryptic cube. After all, it had lately taken to moving some of its\nown controls\u2014the permissible ones\u2014and could doubtless improvise a\nhearing apparatus if it wanted to.\nFor this was the thinking machine beside which the Marks and Eniacs and\nManiacs and Maddidas and Minervas and Mimirs were less than Morons.\nThis was the machine with a million times as many synapses as the human\nbrain, the machine that remembered by cutting delicate notches in the\nrims of molecules (instead of kindergarten paper-punching or the Coney\nIsland shimmying of columns of mercury). This was the machine that had\ngiven instructions on building the last three-quarters of itself. This\nwas the goal, perhaps, toward which fallible human reasoning and biased\nhuman judgment and feeble human ambition had evolved.\nThis was the machine that really thought\u2014a million-plus!\nThis was the machine that the timid cyberneticists and stuffy\nprofessional scientists had said could not be built. Yet this was the\nmachine that the Thinkers, with characteristic Yankee push,\nhad\nbuilt. And nicknamed, with characteristic Yankee irreverence and\ngirl-fondness, \"Maizie.\"\nGazing up at it, the President of the United States felt a chord\nplucked within him that hadn't been sounded for decades, the dark and\nshivery organ chord of his Baptist childhood. Here, in a strange sense,\nalthough his reason rejected it, he felt he stood face to face with\nthe living God: infinitely stern with the sternness of reality, yet\ninfinitely just. No tiniest error or wilful misstep could ever escape\nthe scrutiny of this vast mentality. He shivered.\nThe grizzled general\u2014there was also one who was gray\u2014was thinking\nthat this was a very odd link in the chain of command. Some shadowy and\nusually well-controlled memories from World War II faintly stirred his\nire. Here he was giving orders to a being immeasurably more intelligent\nthan himself. And always orders of the \"Tell me how to kill that man\"\nrather than the \"Kill that man\" sort. The distinction bothered him\nobscurely. It relieved him to know that Maizie had built-in controls\nwhich made her always the servant of humanity, or of humanity's\nright-minded leaders\u2014even the Thinkers weren't certain which.\nThe gray general was thinking uneasily, and, like the President, at a\nmore turbid level, of the resemblance between Papal infallibility and\nthe dictates of the machine. Suddenly his bony wrists began to tremble.\nHe asked himself: Was this the Second Coming? Mightn't an incarnation\nbe in metal rather than flesh?\nThe austere Secretary of State was remembering what he'd taken such\npains to make everyone forget: his youthful flirtation at Lake Success\nwith Buddhism. Sitting before his\nguru\n, his teacher, feeling the\nOccidental's awe at the wisdom of the East, or its pretense, he had\nfelt a little like this.\nThe burly Secretary of Space, who had come up through United Rockets,\nwas thanking his stars that at any rate the professional scientists\nweren't responsible for this job. Like the grizzled general, he'd\nalways felt suspicious of men who kept telling you how to do things,\nrather than doing them themselves. In World War III he'd had his fill\nof the professional physicists, with their eternal taint of a misty\nsort of radicalism and free-thinking. The Thinkers were better\u2014more\ndisciplined, more human. They'd called their brain-machine Maizie,\nwhich helped take the curse off her. Somewhat.\nThe President's Secretary, a paunchy veteran of party caucuses, was\nalso glad that it was the Thinkers who had created the machine, though\nhe trembled at the power that it gave them over the Administration.\nStill, you could do business with the Thinkers. And nobody (not even\nthe Thinkers) could do business (that sort of business) with Maizie!\nBefore that great square face with its thousands of tiny metal\nfeatures, only Jorj Helmuth seemed at ease, busily entering on the\ntape the complex Questions of the Day that the high officials had\nhanded him: logistics for the Endless War in Pakistan, optimum size for\nnext year's sugar-corn crop, current thought trends in average Soviet\nminds\u2014profound questions, yet many of them phrased with surprising\nsimplicity. For figures, technical jargon, and layman's language were\nalike to Maizie; there was no need to translate into mathematical\nshorthand, as with the lesser brain-machines.\nThe click of the taper went on until the Secretary of State had twice\nnervously fired a cigaret with his ultrasonic lighter and twice quickly\nput it away. No one spoke.\nJorj looked up at the Secretary of Space. \"Section Five, Question\nFour\u2014whom would that come from?\"\nThe burly man frowned. \"That would be the physics boys, Opperly's\ngroup. Is anything wrong?\"\nJorj did not answer. A bit later he quit taping and began to adjust\ncontrols, going up on the boom-chair to reach some of them. Eventually\nhe came down and touched a few more, then stood waiting.\nFrom the great cube came a profound, steady purring. Involuntarily the\nsix officials backed off a bit. Somehow it was impossible for a man to\nget used to the sound of Maizie starting to think.\nJorj turned, smiling. \"And now, gentlemen, while we wait for Maizie\nto celebrate, there should be just enough time for us to watch the\ntakeoff of the Mars rocket.\" He switched on a giant television screen.\nThe others made a quarter turn, and there before them glowed the rich\nochres and blues of a New Mexico sunrise and, in the middle distance, a\nsilvery mighty spindle.\nLike the generals, the Secretary of Space suppressed a scowl. Here\nwas something that ought to be spang in the center of his official\nterritory, and the Thinkers had locked him completely out of it. That\nrocket there\u2014just an ordinary Earth satellite vehicle commandeered\nfrom the Army, but equipped by the Thinkers with Maizie-designed\nnuclear motors capable of the Mars journey and more. The first\nspaceship\u2014and the Secretary of Space was not in on it!\nStill, he told himself, Maizie had decreed it that way. And when\nhe remembered what the Thinkers had done for him in rescuing him\nfrom breakdown with their mental science, in rescuing the whole\nAdministration from collapse he realized he had to be satisfied. And\nthat was without taking into consideration the amazing additional\nmental discoveries that the Thinkers were bringing down from Mars.\n\"Lord,\" the President said to Jorj as if voicing the Secretary's\nfeeling, \"I wish you people could bring a couple of those wise little\ndevils back with you this trip. Be a good thing for the country.\"\nJorj looked at him a bit coldly. \"It's quite unthinkable,\" he said.\n\"The telepathic abilities of the Martians make them extremely\nsensitive. The conflicts of ordinary Earth minds would impinge on them\npsychotically, even fatally. As you know, the Thinkers were able to\ncontact them only because of our degree of learned mental poise and\nerrorless memory-chains. So for the present it must be our task alone\nto glean from the Martians their astounding mental skills. Of course,\nsome day in the future, when we have discovered how to armor the minds\nof the Martians\u2014\"\n\"Sure, I know,\" the President said hastily. \"Shouldn't have mentioned\nit, Jorj.\"\nConversation ceased. They waited with growing tension for the great\nviolet flames to bloom from the base of the silvery shaft.\nMeanwhile the question tape, like a New Year's streamer tossed out\na high window into the night, sped on its dark way along spinning\nrollers. Curling with an intricate aimlessness curiously like that\nof such a streamer, it tantalized the silvery fingers of a thousand\nrelays, saucily evaded the glances of ten thousand electric eyes,\nimpishly darted down a narrow black alleyway of memory banks, and,\nreaching the center of the cube, suddenly emerged into a small room\nwhere a suave fat man in shorts sat drinking beer.\nHe flipped the tape over to him with practiced finger, eyeing it as\na stockbroker might have studied a ticker tape. He read the first\nquestion, closed his eyes and frowned for five seconds. Then with the\nstaccato self-confidence of a hack writer, he began to tape out the\nanswer.\nFor many minutes the only sounds were the rustle of the paper ribbon\nand the click of the taper, except for the seconds the fat man took to\nclose his eyes, or to drink or pour beer. Once, too, he lifted a phone,\nasked a concise question, waited half a minute, listened to an answer,\nthen went back to the grind.\nUntil he came to Section Five, Question Four. That time he did his\nthinking with his eyes open.\nThe question was: \"Does Maizie stand for Maelzel?\"\nHe sat for a while slowly scratching his thigh. His loose, persuasive\nlips tightened, without closing, into the shape of a snarl.\nSuddenly he began to tape again.\n\"Maizie does not stand for Maelzel. Maizie stands for amazing,\nhumorously given the form of a girl's name. Section Six, Answer One:\nThe mid-term election viewcasts should be spaced as follows....\"\nBut his lips didn't lose the shape of a snarl.\nFive hundred miles above the ionosphere, the Mars rocket cut off\nits fuel and slumped gratefully into an orbit that would carry it\neffortlessly around the world at that altitude. The pilot unstrapped\nhimself and stretched, but he didn't look out the viewport at the\ndried-mud disc that was Earth, cloaked in its haze of blue sky. He knew\nhe had two maddening months ahead of him in which to do little more\nthan that. Instead, he unstrapped Sappho.\nUsed to free fall from two previous experiences, and loving it, the\nfluffy little cat was soon bounding about the cabin in curves and\ngyrations that would have made her the envy of all back-alley and\nparlor felines on the planet below. A miracle cat in the dream world of\nfree fall. For a long time she played with a string that the man would\ntoss out lazily. Sometimes she caught the string on the fly, sometimes\nshe swam for it frantically.\nAfter a while the man grew bored with the game. He unlocked a drawer\nand began to study the details of the wisdom he would discover on\nMars this trip\u2014priceless spiritual insights that would be balm to\nwar-battered mankind.\nThe cat carefully selected a spot three feet off the floor, curled up\non the air, and went to sleep.\nJorj Helmuth snipped the emerging answer tape into sections and handed\neach to the appropriate man. Most of them carefully tucked theirs away\nwith little more than a glance, but the Secretary of Space puzzled over\nhis.\n\"Who the devil would Maelzel be?\" he asked.\nA remote look came into the eyes of the Secretary of State. \"Edgar\nAllen Poe,\" he said frowningly, with eyes half-closed.\nThe grizzled general snapped his fingers. \"Sure! Maelzel's Chess\nplayer. Read it when I was a kid. About an automaton that was supposed\nto play chess. Poe proved it hid a man inside it.\"\nThe Secretary of Space frowned. \"Now what's the point in a fool\nquestion like that?\"\n\"You said it came from Opperly's group?\" Jorj asked sharply.\nThe Secretary of Space nodded. The others looked at the two men\npuzzledly.\n\"Who would that be?\" Jorj pressed. \"The group, I mean.\"\nThe Secretary of Space shrugged. \"Oh, the usual little bunch over at\nthe Institute. Hindeman, Gregory, Opperly himself. Oh, yes, and young\nFarquar.\"\n\"Sounds like Opperly's getting senile,\" Jorj commented coldly. \"I'd\ninvestigate.\"\nThe Secretary of Space nodded. He suddenly looked tough. \"I will. Right\naway.\"\nSunlight striking through French windows spotlighted a ballet of dust\nmotes untroubled by air-conditioning. Morton Opperly's living room was\nwell-kept but worn and quite behind the times. Instead of reading tapes\nthere were books; instead of steno-robots, pen and ink; while in place\nof a four by six TV screen, a Picasso hung on the wall. Only Opperly\nknew that the painting was still faintly radioactive, that it had been\nriskily so when he'd smuggled it out of his bomb-singed apartment in\nNew York City.\nThe two physicists fronted each other across a coffee table. The face\nof the elder was cadaverous, large-eyed, and tender\u2014fined down by\na long life of abstract thought. That of the younger was forceful,\nsensuous, bulky as his body, and exceptionally ugly. He looked rather\nlike a bear.\nOpperly was saying, \"So when he asked who was responsible for the\nMaelzel question, I said I didn't remember.\" He smiled. \"They still\nallow me my absent-mindedness, since it nourishes their contempt.\nAlmost my sole remaining privilege.\" The smile faded. \"Why do you keep\non teasing the zoo animals, Willard?\" he asked without rancor. \"I've\nmaintained many times that we shouldn't truckle to them by yielding\nto their demand that we ask Maizie questions. You and the rest have\noverruled me. But then to use those questions to convey veiled insults\nisn't reasonable. Apparently the Secretary of Space was bothered enough\nabout this last one to pay me a 'copter call within twenty minutes of\nthis morning's meeting at the Foundation. Why do you do it, Willard?\"\nThe features of the other convulsed unpleasantly. \"Because the\nThinkers are charlatans who must be exposed,\" he rapped out. \"We know\ntheir Maizie is no more than a tealeaf-reading fake. We've traced their\nMars rockets and found they go nowhere. We know their Martian mental\nscience is bunk.\"\n\"But we've already exposed the Thinkers very thoroughly,\" Opperly\ninterposed quietly. \"You know the good it did.\"\nFarquar hunched his Japanese-wrestler shoulders. \"Then it's got to be\ndone until it takes.\"\nOpperly studied the bowl of mutated flowers by the coffee pot. \"I think\nyou just want to tease the animals, for some personal reason of which\nyou probably aren't aware.\"\nFarquar scowled. \"We're the ones in the cages.\"\nOpperly continued his inspection of the flowers' bells. \"All the more\nreason not to poke sticks through the bars at the lions and tigers\nstrolling outside. No, Willard, I'm not counseling appeasement. But\nconsider the age in which we live. It wants magicians.\" His voice grew\nespecially tranquil. \"A scientist tells people the truth. When times\nare good\u2014that is, when the truth offers no threat\u2014people don't mind.\nBut when times are very, very bad....\" A shadow darkened his eyes.\n\"Well, we all know what happened to\u2014\" And he mentioned three names\nthat had been household words in the middle of the century. They\nwere the names on the brass plaque dedicated to the martyred three\nphysicists.\nHe went on, \"A magician, on the other hand, tells people what they\nwish were true\u2014that perpetual motion works, that cancer can be cured\nby colored lights, that a psychosis is no worse than a head cold, that\nthey'll live forever. In good times magicians are laughed at. They're a\nluxury of the spoiled wealthy few. But in bad times people sell their\nsouls for magic cures, and buy perpetual motion machines to power their\nwar rockets.\"\nFarquar clenched his fist. \"All the more reason to keep chipping away\nat the Thinkers. Are we supposed to beg off from a job because it's\ndifficult and dangerous?\"\nOpperly shook his head. \"We're to keep clear of the infection of\nviolence. In my day, Willard, I was one of the Frightened Men. Later I\nwas one of the Angry Men and then one of the Minds of Despair. Now I'm\nconvinced that all my reactions were futile.\"\n\"Exactly!\" Farquar agreed harshly. \"You reacted. You didn't act. If\nyou men who discovered atomic energy had only formed a secret league,\nif you'd only had the foresight and the guts to use your tremendous\nbargaining position to demand the power to shape mankind's future....\"\n\"By the time you were born, Willard,\" Opperly interrupted dreamily,\n\"Hitler was merely a name in the history books. We scientists weren't\nthe stuff out of which cloak-and-dagger men are made. Can you imagine\nOppenheimer wearing a mask or Einstein sneaking into the Old White\nHouse with a bomb in his briefcase?\" He smiled. \"Besides, that's not\nthe way power is seized. New ideas aren't useful to the man bargaining\nfor power\u2014only established facts or lies are.\"\n\"Just the same, it would have been a good thing if you'd had a little\nviolence in you.\"\n\"No,\" Opperly said.\n\"I've got violence in me,\" Farquar announced, shoving himself to his\nfeet.\nOpperly looked up from the flowers. \"I think you have,\" he agreed.\n\"But what are we to do?\" Farquar demanded. \"Surrender the world to\ncharlatans without a struggle?\"\nOpperly mused for a while. \"I don't know what the world needs now.\nEveryone knows Newton as the great scientist. Few remember that\nhe spent half his life muddling with alchemy, looking for the\nphilosopher's stone. Which Newton did the world need then?\"\n\"Now you are justifying the Thinkers!\"\n\"No, I leave that to history.\"\n\"And history consists of the actions of men,\" Farquar concluded. \"I\nintend to act. The Thinkers are vulnerable, their power fantastically\nprecarious. What's it based on? A few lucky guesses. Faith-healing.\nSome science hocus-pocus, on the level of those juke-box burlesque acts\nbetween the strips. Dubious mental comfort given to a few nerve-torn\nneurotics in the Inner Cabinet\u2014and their wives. The fact that the\nThinkers' clever stage-managing won the President a doubtful election.\nThe erroneous belief that the Soviets pulled out of Iraq and Iran\nbecause of the Thinkers' Mind Bomb threat. A brain-machine that's just\na cover for Jan Tregarron's guesswork. Oh, yes, and that hogwash of\n'Martian wisdom.' All of it mere bluff! A few pushes at the right times\nand points are all that are needed\u2014and the Thinkers know it! I'll bet\nthey're terrified already, and will be more so when they find that\nwe're gunning for them. Eventually they'll be making overtures to us,\nturning to us for help. You wait and see.\"\n\"I am thinking again of Hitler,\" Opperly interposed quietly. \"On his\nfirst half dozen big steps, he had nothing but bluff. His generals\nwere against him. They knew they were in a cardboard fort. Yet he won\nevery battle, until the last. Moreover,\" he pressed on, cutting Farquar\nshort, \"the power of the Thinkers isn't based on what they've got, but\non what the world hasn't got\u2014peace, honor, a good conscience....\"\nThe front-door knocker clanked. Farquar answered it. A skinny old man\nwith a radiation scar twisting across his temple handed him a tiny\ncylinder. \"Radiogram for you, Willard.\" He grinned across the hall at\nOpperly. \"When are you going to get a phone put in, Mr. Opperly?\"\nThe physicist waved to him. \"Next year, perhaps, Mr. Berry.\"\nThe old man snorted with good-humored incredulity and trudged off.\n\"What did I tell you about the Thinkers making overtures?\" Farquar\nchortled suddenly. \"It's come sooner than I expected. Look at this.\"\nHe held out the radiogram, but the older man didn't take it. Instead he\nasked, \"Who's it from? Tregarron?\"\n\"No, from Helmuth. There's a lot of sugar corn about man's future in\ndeep space, but the real reason is clear. They know that they're going\nto have to produce an actual nuclear rocket pretty soon, and for that\nthey'll need our help.\"\n\"An invitation?\"\nFarquar nodded. \"For this afternoon.\" He noticed Opperly's anxious\nthough distant frown. \"What's the matter?\" he asked. \"Are you bothered\nabout my going? Are you thinking it might be a trap\u2014that after the\nMaelzel question they may figure I'm better rubbed out?\"\nThe older man shook his head. \"I'm not afraid for your life, Willard.\nThat's yours to risk as you choose. No, I'm worried about other things\nthey might do to you.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" Farquar asked.\nOpperly looked at him with a gentle appraisal. \"You're a strong and\nvital man, Willard, with a strong man's prides and desires.\" His voice\ntrailed off for a bit. Then, \"Excuse me, Willard, but wasn't there a\ngirl once? A Miss Arkady?\"\nFarquar's ungainly figure froze. He nodded curtly, face averted.\n\"And didn't she go off with a Thinker?\"\n\"If girls find me ugly, that's their business,\" Farquar said harshly,\nstill not looking at Opperly. \"What's that got to do with this\ninvitation?\"\nOpperly didn't answer the question. His eyes got more distant. Finally\nhe said, \"In my day we had it a lot easier. A scientist was an\nacademician, cushioned by tradition.\"\nWillard snorted. \"Science had already entered the era of the police\ninspectors, with laboratory directors and political appointees stifling\nenterprise.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" Opperly agreed. \"Still, the scientist lived the safe,\nrestricted, highly respectable life of a university man. He wasn't\nexposed to the temptations of the world.\"\nFarquar turned on him. \"Are you implying that the Thinkers will somehow\nbe able to buy me off?\"\n\"Not exactly.\"\n\"You think I'll be persuaded to change my aims?\" Farquar demanded\nangrily.\nOpperly shrugged his helplessness. \"No, I don't think you'll change\nyour aims.\"\nClouds encroaching from the west blotted the parallelogram of sunlight\nbetween the two men.\nAs the slideway whisked him gently along the corridor toward his\napartment, Jorj was thinking of his spaceship. For a moment the\nsilver-winged vision crowded everything else out of his mind.\nJust think, a spaceship with sails! He smiled a bit, marveling at the\nparadox.\nDirect atomic power. Direct utilization of the force of the flying\nneutrons. No more ridiculous business of using a reactor to drive a\nsteam engine, or boil off something for a jet exhaust\u2014processes that\nwere as primitive and wasteful as burning gunpowder to keep yourself\nwarm.\nChemical jets would carry his spaceship above the atmosphere. Then\nwould come the thrilling order, \"Set sail for Mars!\" The vast umbrella\nwould unfold and open out around the stern, its rear or Earthward side\na gleaming expanse of radioactive ribbon perhaps only an atom thick\nand backed with a material that would reflect neutrons. Atoms in the\nribbon would split, blasting neutrons astern at fantastic velocities.\nReaction would send the spaceship hurtling forward.\nIn airless space, the expanse of sails would naturally not retard the\nship. More radioactive ribbon, manufactured as needed in the ship\nitself, would feed out onto the sail as that already there became\nexhausted.\nA spaceship with direct nuclear drive\u2014and he, a Thinker, had\nconceived it completely except for the technical details! Having\nstrengthened his mind by hard years of somno-learning, mind-casting,\nmemory-straightening, and sensory training, he had assured himself\nof the executive power to control the technicians and direct their\nspecialized abilities. Together they would build the true Mars rocket.\nBut that would only be a beginning. They would build the true Mind\nBomb. They would build the true Selective Microbe Slayer. They would\ndiscover the true laws of ESP and the inner life. They would even\u2014his\nimagination hesitated a moment, then strode boldly forward\u2014build the\ntrue Maizie!\nAnd then ... then the Thinkers would be on even terms with the\nscientists. Rather, they'd be far ahead. No more deception.\nHe was so exalted by this thought that he almost let the slideway carry\nhim past his door. He stepped inside and called, \"Caddy!\" He waited a\nmoment, then walked through the apartment, but she wasn't there.\nConfound the girl, he couldn't help thinking. This morning, when she\nshould have made herself scarce, she'd sprawled about sleeping. Now,\nwhen he felt like seeing her, when her presence would have added a\npleasant final touch to his glowing mood, she chose to be absent. He\nreally should use his hypnotic control on her, he decided, and again\nthere sprang into his mind the word\u2014a pet form of her name\u2014that would\nsend her into obedient trance.\nNo, he told himself again, that was to be reserved for some moment\nof crisis or desperate danger, when he would need someone to strike\nsuddenly and unquestioningly for himself and mankind. Caddy was merely\na wilful and rather silly girl, incapable at present of understanding\nthe tremendous tensions under which he operated. When he had time for\nit, he would train her up to be a fitting companion without hypnosis.\nYet the fact of her absence had a subtly disquieting effect. It shook\nhis perfect self-confidence just a fraction. He asked himself if\nhe'd been wise in summoning the rocket physicists without consulting\nTregarron.\nBut this mood, too, he conquered quickly. Tregarron wasn't his\nboss, but just the Thinker's most clever salesman, an expert in the\nmumbo-jumbo so necessary for social control in this chaotic era. He\nhimself, Jorj Helmuth, was the real leader in theoretics and all-over\nstrategy, the mind behind the mind behind Maizie.\nHe stretched himself on the bed, almost instantly achieved maximum\nrelaxation, turned on the somno-learner, and began the two hour rest he\nknew would be desirable before the big conference.\n", "summary": "The story begins with a scientist, Farquar, discussing with his colleague, Jan Tregarron, the mission he has been tasked with conducting on Mars. The mission is to find a way to destroy the human race so that they will no longer be able to continue on in their current form. They have been working on this mission for twelve hours, and it is becoming clearer and clearer that the mission is going to be a very dangerous one. They are going to need help from the Russians, who are working on developing a new kind of rocket. They know that they have to produce an actual nuclear rocket, and for that they need the help of the Russians. The Russians are worried that the humans will think that they know better than they do, and that the Russians will try to take over the world. They want the Russians to trust them, and they want them to help them with their mission.   The story then moves to the Thinkers' Foundation, where the executive director of the organization, Mr. Wilkins, is sitting in a chair. He is discussing the mission with his assistant, Dr. Gertrude Halden, who is an astrogation specialist. He tells Wilkins that he is going on a mission to find an alchemist\u2019s stone that will restore peace to mankind. He explains that he has spent half of his life muddling with alchemy, looking for the stone, and he has never met a human being who has experienced anything close to what he has experienced. He believes that humans are incapable of knowing when to stop and think, and when to believe. He also believes that the aliens are trying to trick humans into thinking they know what they\u2019re talking about, so they will continue to try to trick them into thinking that they do know better.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}

I'm sure losing my grip.\"\nAnn stared at him. \"Baby! How silly! Nothing happened, except you lost\nyour lease. You'll build up a better company in a new spot. We're young\nyet.\"\nJeff sighed and glanced around the crowded little restaurant. He wished\nhe could fly away somewhere. At that moment, he met the gaze of the\nmustachioed man at the next table.\nThe fellow seemed to be watching him and Ann. Something in his\nconfident gaze made Jeff uneasy. Had they met before?\nAnn whispered, \"So you noticed him, too. Maybe he's following us. I\nthink I saw him on the parking lot where we left the car.\"\nJeff shrugged his big shoulders. \"If he's following us, he's nuts.\nWe've got no secrets and no money.\"\n\"It must be my maddening beauty,\" said Ann.\n\"I'll kick him cross-eyed if he starts anything,\" Jeff said. \"I'm just\nin the mood.\"\nAnn giggled. \"Honey, what big veins you have! Forget him. Let's talk\nabout the engineering lab you're going to start. And let's eat.\"\nHe groaned. \"I lose my appetite every time I think about the building\nbeing sold. It isn't worth the twelve grand. I wouldn't buy it for that\nif I could. What burns me is that, five years ago, I could have bought\nit for two thousand.\"\n\"If only we could go back five years.\" She shrugged fatalistically.\n\"But since we can't\u2014\"\nThe character at the next table leaned over and spoke to them,\ngrinning. \"You like to get away? You wish to go back?\"\nJeff glanced across in annoyance. The man was evidently a salesman,\nwith extra gall.\n\"Not now, thanks,\" Jeff said. \"Haven't time.\"\nThe man waved his thick hand at the clock, as if to abolish time.\n\"Time? That is nothing. Your little lady. She spoke of go back five\nyears. Maybe I help you.\"\nHe spoke in an odd clipped way, obviously a foreigner. His shirt was\nyellow. His suit had a silky sheen. Its peculiar tailoring emphasized\nthe bulges in his stubby, muscular torso.\nAnn smiled back at him. \"You talk as if you could take us back to 1952.\nIs that what you really mean?\"\n\"Why not? You think this silly. But I can show you.\"\nJeff rose to go. \"Mister, you better get to a doctor. Ann, it's time we\nstarted home.\"\nAnn laid a hand on his sleeve. \"I haven't finished eating. Let's\nchat with the gent.\" She added in an undertone to Jeff, \"Must be a\npsycho\u2014but sort of an inspired one.\"\nThe man said to Ann, \"You are kind lady, I think. Good to crazy people.\nI join you.\"\nHe did not wait for consent, but slid into a seat at their table with\nan easy grace that was almost arrogant.\n\"You are unhappy in 1957,\" he went on. \"Discouraged. Restless. Why not\ntake trip to another time?\"\n\"Why not?\" Ann said gaily. \"How much does it cost?\"\n\"Free trial trip. Cost nothing. See whether you like. Then maybe we\ntalk money.\" He handed Jeff a card made of a stiff plastic substance.\nJeff glanced at it, then handed it to Ann with a half-smile. It read:\n4-D TRAVEL BEURO\nGreet Snader, Traffic Ajent\n\"Mr. Snader's bureau is different,\" Jeff said to his wife. \"He even\nspells it different.\"\nSnader chuckled. \"I come from other time. We spell otherwise.\"\n\"You mean you come from the future?\"\n\"Just different time. I show you. You come with me?\"\n\"Come where?\" Jeff asked, studying Snader's mocking eyes. The man\ndidn't seem a mere eccentric. He had a peculiar suggestion of humor and\nforce.\n\"Come on little trip to different time,\" invited Snader. He added\npersuasively, \"Could be back here in hour.\"\n\"It would be painless, I suppose?\" Jeff gave it a touch of derision.\n\"Maybe not. That is risk you take. But look at me. I make trips every\nday. I look damaged?\"\nAs a matter of fact, he did. His thick-fleshed face bore a scar and\nhis nose was broad and flat, as if it had been broken. But Jeff\npolitely agreed that he did not look damaged.\nAnn was enjoying this. \"Tell me more, Mr. Snader. How does your time\ntravel work?\"\n\"Cannot explain. Same if you are asked how subway train works. Too\ncomplicated.\" He flashed his white teeth. \"You think time travel not\npossible. Just like television not possible to your grandfather.\"\nAnn said, \"Why invite us? We're not rich enough for expensive trips.\"\n\"Invite many people,\" Snader said quickly. \"Not expensive. You know\nMissing Persons lists, from police? Dozens people disappear. They go\nwith me to other time. Many stay.\"\n\"Oh, sure,\" Jeff said. \"But how do you select the ones to invite?\"\n\"Find ones like you, Mr. Elliott. Ones who want change, escape.\"\nJeff was slightly startled. How did this fellow know his name was\nElliott?\nBefore he could ask, Ann popped another question. \"Mr. Snader, you\nheard us talking. You know we're in trouble because Jeff missed a good\nchance five years ago. Do you claim people can really go back into the\npast and correct mistakes they've made?\"\n\"They can go back. What they do when arrive? Depends on them.\"\n\"Don't you wish it were true?\" she sighed to Jeff.\n\"You afraid to believe,\" said Snader, a glimmer of amusement in his\nrestless eyes. \"Why not try? What you lose? Come on, look at station.\nVery near here.\"\nAnn jumped up. \"It might be fun, Jeff. Let's see what he means, if\nanything.\"\nJeff's pulse quickened. He too felt a sort of midsummer night's\nmadness\u2014a yearning to forget his troubles. \"Okay, just for kicks. But\nwe go in my car.\"\nSnader moved ahead to the cashier's stand. Jeff watched the weasel-like\ngrace of his short, broad body.\n\"This is no ordinary oddball,\" Jeff told Ann. \"He's tricky. He's got\nsome gimmick.\"\n\"First I just played him along, to see how loony he was,\" Ann said.\n\"Now I wonder who's kidding whom.\" She concluded thoughtfully, \"He's\nkind of handsome, in a tough way.\"\nII\nSnader's \"station\" proved to be a middle-sized, middle-cost home in a\ngood neighborhood. Lights glowed in the windows. Jeff could hear the\nwhisper of traffic on a boulevard a few blocks away. Through the warm\ndusk, he could dimly see the mountains on the horizon. All was peaceful.\nSnader unlocked the front door with a key which he drew from a fine\nmetal chain around his neck. He swept open the front door with a\nflourish and beamed at them, but Ann drew back.\n\"'Walk into my parlor, said the spider to the fly,'\" she murmured to\nJeff. \"This could be a gambling hell. Or a dope den.\"\n\"No matter what kind of clip joint, it can't clip us much,\" he said.\n\"There's only four bucks in my wallet. My guess is it's a 'temple' for\nsome daffy religious sect.\"\nThey went in. A fat man smiled at them from a desk in the hall. Snader\nsaid, \"Meet Peter Powers. Local agent of our bureau.\"\nThe man didn't get up, but nodded comfortably and waved them toward the\nnext room, after a glance at Snader's key.\nThe key opened this room's door, too. Its spring lock snapped shut\nafter them.\nThe room was like a doctor's waiting room, with easy chairs along the\nwalls. Its only peculiar aspects were a sign hanging from the middle\nof the ceiling and two movie screens\u2014or were they giant television\nscreens?\u2014occupying a whole wall at either end of the room.\nThe sign bore the number 701 in bright yellow on black. Beneath it, an\narrow pointed to the screen on the left with the word\nAnte\n, and to\nthe right with the word\nPost\n.\nJeff studied the big screens. On each, a picture was in motion. One\nappeared to be moving through a long corridor, lined with seats like\na railroad club car. The picture seemed to rush at them from the left\nwall. When he turned to the right, a similar endless chair-lined\ncorridor moved toward him from that direction.\n\"Somebody worked hard on this layout,\" he said to Snader. \"What's it\nfor?\"\n\"Time travel,\" said Snader. \"You like?\"\n\"Almost as good as Disneyland. These movies represent the stream of\ntime, I suppose?\"\nInstead of answering, Snader pointed to the screen. The picture showed\na group of people chatting in a fast-moving corridor. As it hurtled\ntoward them, Snader flipped his hand in a genial salute. Two people in\nthe picture waved back.\nAnn gasped. \"It was just as if they saw us.\"\n\"They did,\" Snader said. \"No movie. Time travelers. In fourth\ndimension. To you, they look like flat picture. To them, we look flat.\"\n\"What's he supposed to be?\" Jeff asked as the onrushing picture showed\nthem briefly a figure bound hand and foot, huddled in one of the\nchairs. He stared at them piteously for an instant before the picture\nsurged past.\nSnader showed his teeth. \"That was convict from my time. We have\ncriminals, like in your time. But we do not kill. We make them work.\nWhere he going? To end of line. To earliest year this time groove\nreach. About 600 A.D., your calendar. Authorities pick up when\nhe get there. Put him to work.\"\n\"What kind of work?\" Jeff asked.\n\"Building the groove further back.\"\n\"Sounds like interesting work.\"\nSnader chortled and slapped him on the back. \"Maybe you see it some\nday, but forget that now. You come with me. Little trip.\"\nJeff was perspiring. This was odder than he expected. Whatever the\nfakery, it was clever. His curiosity as a technician made him want to\nknow about it. He asked Snader, \"Where do you propose to go? And how?\"\nSnader said, \"Watch me. Then look at other wall.\"\nHe moved gracefully to the screen on the left wall, stepped into it and\ndisappeared. It was as if he had slid into opaque water.\nJeff and Ann blinked in mystification. Then they remembered his\ninstruction to watch the other screen. They turned. After a moment, in\nthe far distance down the long moving corridor, they could see a stocky\nfigure. The motion of the picture brought him nearer. In a few seconds,\nhe was recognizable as Snader\u2014and as the picture brought him forward,\nhe stepped down out of it and was with them again.\n\"Simple,\" Snader said. \"I rode to next station. Then crossed over. Took\nother carrier back here.\"\n\"Brother, that's the best trick I've seen in years,\" Jeff said. \"How\ndid you do it? Can I do it, too?\"\n\"I show you.\" Grinning like a wildcat, Snader linked his arms with Ann\nand Jeff, and walked them toward the screen. \"Now,\" he said. \"Step in.\"\nJeff submitted to Snader's pressure and stepped cautiously into the\nscreen. Amazingly, he felt no resistance at all, no sense of change or\nmotion. It was like stepping through a fog-bank into another room.\nIn fact, that was what they seemed to have done. They were in the\nchair-lined corridor. As Snader turned them around and seated them,\nthey faced another moving picture screen. It seemed to rush through a\ndark tunnel toward a lighted square in the far distance.\nThe square grew on the screen. Soon they saw it was another room like\nthe waiting room they had left, except that the number hanging from the\nceiling was 702. They seemed to glide through it. Then they were in the\ndark tunnel again.\nAnn was clutching Jeff's arm. He patted her hand. \"Fun, hey? Like Alice\nthrough the looking-glass.\"\n\"You really think we're going back in time?\" she whispered.\n\"Hardly! But we're seeing a million-dollar trick. I can't even begin to\nfigure it out yet.\"\nAnother lighted room grew out of the tunnel on the screen, and when\nthey had flickered through it, another and then another.\n\"Mr. Snader,\" Ann said unsteadily, \"how long\u2014how many years back are\nyou taking us?\"\nSnader was humming to himself. \"Six years. Station 725 fine place to\nstop.\"\nFor a little while, Jeff let himself think it might be true. \"Six years\nago, your dad was alive,\" he mused to Ann. \"If this should somehow be\nreal, we could see him again.\"\n\"We could if we went to our house. He lived with us then, remember?\nWould we see ourselves, six years younger? Or would\u2014\"\nSnader took Jeff's arm and pulled him to his feet. The screen was\nmoving through a room numbered 724.\n\"Soon now,\" Snader grunted happily. \"Then no more questions.\"\nHe took an arm of each as he had before. When the screen was filled by\na room with the number 725, he propelled them forward into it.\nAgain there was no sense of motion. They had simply stepped through a\nbright wall they could not feel. They found themselves in a replica of\nthe room they had left at 701. On the wall, a picture of the continuous\nclub-car corridor rolled toward them in a silent, endless stream.\n\"The same room,\" Ann said in disappointment. \"They just changed the\nnumber. We haven't been anywhere.\"\nSnader was fishing under his shirt for the key. He gave Ann a glance\nthat was almost a leer. Then he carefully unlocked the door.\nIn the hall, a motherly old lady bustled up, but Snader brushed past\nher. \"Official,\" he said, showing her the key. \"No lodging.\"\nHe unlocked the front door without another word and carefully shut it\nbehind them as Jeff and Ann followed him out of the house.\n\"Hey, where's my car?\" Jeff demanded, looking up and down the street.\nThe whole street looked different. Where he had parked his roadster,\nthere was now a long black limousine.\n\"Your car is in future,\" Snader said briskly. \"Where it belong. Get\nin.\" He opened the door of the limousine.\nJeff felt a little flame of excitement licking inside him. Something\nwas happening, he felt. Something exciting and dangerous.\n\"Snader,\" he said, \"if you're kidnaping us, you made a mistake. Nobody\non Earth will pay ransom for us.\"\nSnader seemed amused. \"You are foolish fellow. Silly talk about ransom.\nYou in different time now.\"\n\"When does this gag stop?\" Jeff demanded irritably. \"You haven't fooled\nus. We're still in 1957.\"\n\"You are? Look around.\"\nJeff looked at the street again. He secretly admitted to himself\nthat these were different trees and houses than he remembered. Even\nthe telephone poles and street lights seemed peculiar, vaguely\nforeign-looking. It must be an elaborate practical joke. Snader had\nprobably ushered them into one house, then through a tunnel and out\nanother house.\n\"Get in,\" Snader said curtly.\nJeff decided to go along with the hoax or whatever it was. He could\nsee no serious risk. He helped Ann into the back seat and sat beside\nher. Snader slammed the door and slid into the driver's seat. He\nstarted the engine with a roar and they rocketed away from the curb,\nnarrowly missing another car.\nJeff yelled, \"Easy, man! Look where you're going!\"\nSnader guffawed. \"Tonight, you look where you are going.\"\nAnn clung to Jeff. \"Did you notice the house we came out of?\"\n\"What about it?\"\n\"It looked as though they were afraid people might try to break in.\nThere were bars at the windows.\"\n\"Lots of houses are built that way, honey. Let's see, where are we?\" He\nglanced at house numbers. \"This is the 800 block. Remember that. And\nthe street\u2014\" He peered up at a sign as they whirled around a corner.\n\"The street is Green Thru-Way. I never heard of a street like that.\"\nIII\nThey were headed back toward what should have been the boulevard. The\ncar zoomed through a cloverleaf turn and up onto a broad freeway. Jeff\nknew for certain there was no freeway there in 1957\u2014nor in any earlier\nyear. But on the horizon, he could see the familiar dark bulk of the\nmountains. The whole line of moonlit ridges was the same as always.\n\"Ann,\" he said slowly, \"I think this is for real. Somehow I guess we\nescaped from 1957. We've been transported in time.\"\nShe squeezed his arm. \"If I'm dreaming, don't wake me! I was scared a\nminute ago. But now, oh, boy!\"\n\"Likewise. But I still wonder what Snader's angle is.\" He leaned\nforward and tapped the driver on his meaty shoulder. \"You brought us\ninto the future instead of the past, didn't you?\"\nIt was hard to know whether Snader was sleepy or just bored, but he\nshrugged briefly to show there was no reply coming. Then he yawned.\nJeff smiled tightly. \"I guess we'll find out in good time. Let's sit\nback and enjoy the strangest ride of our lives.\"\nAs the limousine swept along through the traffic, there were plenty\nof big signs for turn-offs, but none gave any hint where they were.\nThe names were unfamiliar. Even the language seemed grotesque. \"Rite\nChannel for Creepers,\" he read. \"Yaw for Torrey Rushway\" flared at him\nfrom a fork in the freeway.\n\"This can't be the future,\" Ann said. \"This limousine is almost new,\nbut it doesn't even have an automatic gear shift\u2014\"\nShe broke off as the car shot down a ramp off the freeway and pulled up\nin front of an apartment house. Just beyond was a big shopping center,\nablaze with lights and swarming with shoppers. Jeff did not recognize\nit, in spite of his familiarity with the city.\nSnader bounded out, pulled open the rear door and jerked his head in a\ncommanding gesture. But Jeff did not get out. He told Snader, \"Let's\nhave some answers before we go any further.\"\nSnader gave him a hard grin. \"You hear everything upstairs.\"\nThe building appeared harmless enough. Jeff looked thoughtfully at Ann.\nShe said, \"It's just an apartment house. We've come this far. Might as\nwell go in and see what's there.\"\nSnader led them in, up to the sixth floor in an elevator and along a\ncorridor with heavy carpets and soft gold lights. He knocked on a door.\nA tall, silver-haired, important-looking man opened it and greeted them\nheartily.\n\"Solid man, Greet!\" he exclaimed. \"You're a real scratcher! And is this\nour sharp?\" He gave Jeff a friendly but appraising look.\n\"Just what you order,\" Snader said proudly. \"His name\u2014Jeff Elliott.\nFine sharp. Best in his circuit. He brings his lifemate, too. Ann\nElliott.\"\nThe old man rubbed his smooth hands together. \"Prime! I wish joy,\" he\nsaid to Ann and Jeff. \"I'm Septo Kersey. Come in. Bullen's waiting.\"\nHe led them into a spacious drawing room with great windows looking out\non the lights of the city. There was a leather chair in a corner, and\nin it sat a heavy man with a grim mouth. He made no move, but grunted\na perfunctory \"Wish joy\" when Kersey introduced them. His cold eyes\nstudied Jeff while Kersey seated them in big chairs.\nSnader did not sit down, however. \"No need for me now,\" he said, and\nmoved toward the door with a mocking wave at Ann.\nBullen nodded. \"You get the rest of your pay when Elliott proves out.\"\n\"Here, wait a minute!\" Jeff called. But Snader was gone.\n\"Sit still,\" Bullen growled to Jeff. \"You understand radioptics?\"\nThe blood went to Jeff's head. \"My business is television, if that's\nwhat you mean. What's this about?\"\n\"Tell him, Kersey,\" the big man said, and stared out the window.\nKersey began, \"You understand, I think, that you have come back in\ntime. About six years back.\"\n\"That's a matter of opinion, but go on.\"\n\"I am general manager of Continental Radioptic Combine, owned by Mr.\nDumont Bullen.\" He nodded toward the big man. \"Chromatics have not\nyet been developed here in connection with radioptics. They are well\nunderstood in your time, are they not?\"\n\"What's chromatics? Color television?\"\n\"Exactly. You are an expert in\u2014ah\u2014colored television, I think.\"\nJeff nodded. \"So what?\"\nThe old man beamed at him. \"You are here to work for our company. You\nwill enable us to be first with chromatics in this time wave.\"\nJeff stood up. \"Don't tell me who I'll work for.\"\nBullen slapped a big fist on the arm of his chair. \"No fog about this!\nYou're bought and paid for, Elliott! You'll get a fair labor contract,\nbut you do what I say!\"\n\"Why, the man thinks he owns you.\" Ann laughed shakily.\n\"You'll find my barmen know their law,\" Bullen said. \"This isn't the\nway I like to recruit. But it was only way to get a man with your\nknowledge.\"\nKersey said politely, \"You are here illegally, with no immigrate\npermit or citizen file. Therefore you cannot get work. But Mr. Bullen\nhas taken an interest in your trouble. Through his influence, you can\nmake a living. We even set aside an apartment in this building for you\nto live in. You are really very luxe, do you see?\"\nJeff's legs felt weak. These highbinders seemed brutally confident. He\nwondered how he and Ann would find their way home through the strange\nstreets. But he put on a bold front.\n\"I don't believe your line about time travel and I don't plan to work\nfor you,\" he said. \"My wife and I are walking out right now. Try and\nstop us, legally or any other way.\"\nKersey's smooth old face turned hard. But, unexpectedly, Bullen\nchuckled deep in his throat. \"Good pop and bang. Like to see it. Go\non, walk out. You hang in trouble, call up here\u2014Butterfly 9, ask for\nBullen. Whole exchange us. I'll meet you here about eleven tomorrow\npre-noon.\"\n\"Don't hold your breath. Let's go, Ann.\"\nWhen they were on the sidewalk, Ann took a deep breath. \"We made it.\nFor a minute, I thought there'd be a brawl. Why did they let us go?\"\n\"No telling. Maybe they're harmless lunatics\u2014or practical jokers.\" He\nlooked over his shoulder as they walked down the street, but there was\nno sign of pursuit. \"It's a long time since supper.\"\nHer hand was cold in his and her face was white. To take her mind off\ntheir problem, he ambled toward the lighted shop windows.\n\"Look at that sign,\" he said, pointing to a poster over a display of\nneckties. \"'Sleek neck-sashes, only a Dick and a dollop!' How do they\nexpect to sell stuff with that crazy lingo?\"\n\"It's jive talk. They must cater to the high-school crowd.\" Ann\nglanced nervously at the strolling people around them. \"Jeff, where\nare we? This isn't any part of the city I've ever seen. It doesn't\neven look much like America.\" Her voice rose. \"The way the women are\ndressed\u2014it's not old-fashioned, just different.\"\n\"Baby, don't be scared. This is an adventure. Let's have fun.\" He\npressed her hand soothingly and pulled her toward a lunch counter.\nIf the haberdasher's sign was jive, the restaurant spoke the same\njargon. The signs on the wall and the bill of fare were baffling. Jeff\npondered the list of beef shingles, scorchers, smack sticks and fruit\nchills, until he noticed that a couple at the counter were eating what\nclearly were hamburgers\u2014though the \"buns\" looked more like tortillas.\nJeff jerked his thumb at them and told the waitress, \"Two, please.\"\nWhen the sandwiches arrived, they were ordinary enough. He and Ann ate\nin silence. A feeling of foreboding hung over them.\nWhen they finished, the clerk gave him a check marked 1/20. Jeff looked\nat it thoughtfully, shrugged and handed it to the cashier with two\ndollar bills.\nThe man at the desk glanced at them and laughed. \"Stage money, eh?\"\n\"No, that's good money,\" Jeff assured him with a rather hollow smile.\n\"They're just new bills, that's all.\"\nThe cashier picked one up and looked at it curiously. \"I'm afraid it's\nno good here,\" he said, and pushed it back.\nThe bottom dropped out of Jeff's stomach. \"What kind of money do you\nwant? This is all I have.\"\nThe cashier's smile faded. He caught the eye of a man in uniform on one\nof the stools. The uniform was dark green, but the man acted like a\npoliceman. He loomed up beside Jeff.\n\"What's the rasper?\" he demanded. Other customers, waiting to pay their\nchecks, eyed Jeff curiously.\n\"I guess I'm in trouble,\" Jeff told him. \"I'm a stranger here and I got\nsomething to eat under the impression that my money was legal tender.\nDo you know where I can exchange it?\"\nThe officer picked up the dollar bill and fingered it with evident\ninterest. He turned it over and studied the printing. \"United States of\nAmerica,\" he read aloud. \"What are those?\"\n\"It's the name of the country I come from,\" Jeff said carefully.\n\"I\u2014uh\u2014got on the wrong train, apparently, and must have come further\nthan I thought. What's the name of this place?\"\n\"This is Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Say, you\nmust come from an umpty remote part of the world if you don't know\nabout this country.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Where'd you learn to speak\nFederal, if you come from so far?\"\nJeff said helplessly, \"I can't explain, if you don't know about the\nUnited States. Listen, can you take me to a bank, or some place where\nthey know about foreign exchange?\"\nThe policeman scowled. \"How'd you get into this country, anyway? You\ngot immigrate clearance?\"\nAn angry muttering started among the bystanders.\nThe policeman made up his mind. \"You come with me.\"\nAt the police station, Jeff put his elbows dejectedly on the high\ncounter while the policeman talked to an officer in charge. Some men\nwhom Jeff took for reporters got up from a table and eased over to\nlisten.\n\"I don't know whether to charge them with fakemake, bumsy, peekage or\nlunate,\" the policeman said as he finished.\nHis superior gave Jeff a long puzzled stare.\nJeff sighed. \"I know it sounds impossible, but a man brought me in\nsomething he claimed was a time traveler. You speak the same language I\ndo\u2014more or less\u2014but everything else is kind of unfamiliar. I belong\nin the United States, a country in North America. I can't believe I'm\nso far in the future that the United States has been forgotten.\"\nThere ensued a long, confused, inconclusive interrogation.\nThe man behind the desk asked questions which seemed stupid to Jeff and\ngot answers which probably seemed stupid to him.\nThe reporters quizzed Jeff gleefully. \"Come out, what are you\nadvertising?\" they kept asking. \"Who got you up to this?\"\nThe police puzzled over his driver's license and the other cards in his\nwallet. They asked repeatedly about the lack of a \"Work License,\" which\nJeff took to be some sort of union card. Evidently there was grave\ndoubt that he had any legal right to be in the country.\nIn the end, Jeff and Ann were locked in separate cells for the night.\nJeff groaned and pounded the bars as he thought of his wife, imprisoned\nand alone in a smelly jail. After hours of pacing the cell, he lay down\nin the cot and reached automatically for his silver pillbox. Then he\nhesitated.\nIn past weeks, his insomnia had grown worse and worse, so that lately\nhe had begun taking stronger pills. After a longing glance at the\nbig red and yellow capsules, he put the box away. Whatever tomorrow\nbrought, it wouldn't find him slow and drowsy.\nIV\nHe passed a wakeful night. In the early morning, he looked up to see a\nlittle man with a briefcase at his cell door.\n\"Wish joy, Mr. Elliott,\" the man said coolly. \"I am one of Mr. Bullen's\nbarmen. You know, represent at law? He sent me to arrange your release,\nif you are ready to be reasonable.\"\nJeff lay there and put his hands behind his head. \"I doubt if I'm\nready. I'm comfortable here. By the way, how did you know where I was?\"\n\"No problem. When we read in this morning's newspapers about a man\nclaiming to be a time traveler, we knew.\"\n\"All right. Now start explaining. Until I understand where I am, Bullen\nisn't getting me out of here.\"\nThe lawyer smiled and sat down. \"Mr. Kersey told you yesterday\u2014you've\ngone back six years. But you'll need some mental gymnastics to\nunderstand. Time is a dimension, not a stream of events like a movie\nfilm. A film never changes. Space does\u2014and time does. For example, if\na movie showed a burning house at Sixth and Main, would you expect to\nfind a house burning whenever you returned to that corner?\"\n\"You mean to say that if I went back to 1865, I wouldn't find the Civil\nWar was over and Lincoln had been assassinated?\"\n\"If you go back to the time you call 1865\u2014which is most easily\ndone\u2014you will find that the people there know nothing of a Lincoln or\nthat war.\"\nJeff looked blank. \"What are they doing then?\"\nThe little man spread his hands. \"What are the people doing now at\nSixth and Main? Certainly not the same things they were doing the day\nof the fire. We're talking about a dimension, not an event. Don't you\ngrasp the difference between the two?\"\n\"Nope. To me, 1865 means the end of the Civil War.

Their minds were busy with Jeff's troubles.\n\"You're still the smartest color engineer in television,\" Ann told Jeff\nas they dallied with their food. \"You'll bounce back. Now eat your\nsupper.\"\n\"This beanery is too noisy and hot,\" he grumbled. \"I can't eat. Can't\ntalk. Can't think.\" He took a silver pillbox from his pocket and\nfumbled for a black one. Those were vitamin pills; the big red and\nyellow ones were sleeping capsules. He gulped the pill.\nAnn looked disapproving in a wifely way. \"Lately you chew pills like\npopcorn,\" she said. \"Do you really need so many?\"\n\"I need something. I'm sure losing my grip.\"\nAnn stared at him. \"Baby! How silly! Nothing happened, except you lost\nyour lease. You'll build up a better company in a new spot. We're young\nyet.\"\nJeff sighed and glanced around the crowded little restaurant. He wished\nhe could fly away somewhere. At that moment, he met the gaze of the\nmustachioed man at the next table.\nThe fellow seemed to be watching him and Ann. Something in his\nconfident gaze made Jeff uneasy. Had they met before?\nAnn whispered, \"So you noticed him, too. Maybe he's following us. I\nthink I saw him on the parking lot where we left the car.\"\nJeff shrugged his big shoulders. \"If he's following us, he's nuts.\nWe've got no secrets and no money.\"\n\"It must be my maddening beauty,\" said Ann.\n\"I'll kick him cross-eyed if he starts anything,\" Jeff said. \"I'm just\nin the mood.\"\nAnn giggled. \"Honey, what big veins you have! Forget him. Let's talk\nabout the engineering lab you're going to start. And let's eat.\"\nHe groaned. \"I lose my appetite every time I think about the building\nbeing sold. It isn't worth the twelve grand. I wouldn't buy it for that\nif I could. What burns me is that, five years ago, I could have bought\nit for two thousand.\"\n\"If only we could go back five years.\" She shrugged fatalistically.\n\"But since we can't\u2014\"\nThe character at the next table leaned over and spoke to them,\ngrinning. \"You like to get away? You wish to go back?\"\nJeff glanced across in annoyance. The man was evidently a salesman,\nwith extra gall.\n\"Not now, thanks,\" Jeff said. \"Haven't time.\"\nThe man waved his thick hand at the clock, as if to abolish time.\n\"Time? That is nothing. Your little lady. She spoke of go back five\nyears. Maybe I help you.\"\nHe spoke in an odd clipped way, obviously a foreigner. His shirt was\nyellow. His suit had a silky sheen. Its peculiar tailoring emphasized\nthe bulges in his stubby, muscular torso.\nAnn smiled back at him. \"You talk as if you could take us back to 1952.\nIs that what you really mean?\"\n\"Why not? You think this silly. But I can show you.\"\nJeff rose to go. \"Mister, you better get to a doctor. Ann, it's time we\nstarted home.\"\nAnn laid a hand on his sleeve. \"I haven't finished eating. Let's\nchat with the gent.\" She added in an undertone to Jeff, \"Must be a\npsycho\u2014but sort of an inspired one.\"\nThe man said to Ann, \"You are kind lady, I think. Good to crazy people.\nI join you.\"\nHe did not wait for consent, but slid into a seat at their table with\nan easy grace that was almost arrogant.\n\"You are unhappy in 1957,\" he went on. \"Discouraged. Restless. Why not\ntake trip to another time?\"\n\"Why not?\" Ann said gaily. \"How much does it cost?\"\n\"Free trial trip. Cost nothing. See whether you like. Then maybe we\ntalk money.\" He handed Jeff a card made of a stiff plastic substance.\nJeff glanced at it, then handed it to Ann with a half-smile. It read:\n4-D TRAVEL BEURO\nGreet Snader, Traffic Ajent\n\"Mr. Snader's bureau is different,\" Jeff said to his wife. \"He even\nspells it different.\"\nSnader chuckled. \"I come from other time. We spell otherwise.\"\n\"You mean you come from the future?\"\n\"Just different time. I show you. You come with me?\"\n\"Come where?\" Jeff asked, studying Snader's mocking eyes. The man\ndidn't seem a mere eccentric. He had a peculiar suggestion of humor and\nforce.\n\"Come on little trip to different time,\" invited Snader. He added\npersuasively, \"Could be back here in hour.\"\n\"It would be painless, I suppose?\" Jeff gave it a touch of derision.\n\"Maybe not. That is risk you take. But look at me. I make trips every\nday. I look damaged?\"\nAs a matter of fact, he did. His thick-fleshed face bore a scar and\nhis nose was broad and flat, as if it had been broken. But Jeff\npolitely agreed that he did not look damaged.\nAnn was enjoying this. \"Tell me more, Mr. Snader. How does your time\ntravel work?\"\n\"Cannot explain. Same if you are asked how subway train works. Too\ncomplicated.\" He flashed his white teeth. \"You think time travel not\npossible. Just like television not possible to your grandfather.\"\nAnn said, \"Why invite us? We're not rich enough for expensive trips.\"\n\"Invite many people,\" Snader said quickly. \"Not expensive. You know\nMissing Persons lists, from police? Dozens people disappear. They go\nwith me to other time. Many stay.\"\n\"Oh, sure,\" Jeff said. \"But how do you select the ones to invite?\"\n\"Find ones like you, Mr. Elliott. Ones who want change, escape.\"\nJeff was slightly startled. How did this fellow know his name was\nElliott?\nBefore he could ask, Ann popped another question. \"Mr. Snader, you\nheard us talking. You know we're in trouble because Jeff missed a good\nchance five years ago. Do you claim people can really go back into the\npast and correct mistakes they've made?\"\n\"They can go back. What they do when arrive? Depends on them.\"\n\"Don't you wish it were true?\" she sighed to Jeff.\n\"You afraid to believe,\" said Snader, a glimmer of amusement in his\nrestless eyes. \"Why not try? What you lose? Come on, look at station.\nVery near here.\"\nAnn jumped up. \"It might be fun, Jeff. Let's see what he means, if\nanything.\"\nJeff's pulse quickened. He too felt a sort of midsummer night's\nmadness\u2014a yearning to forget his troubles. \"Okay, just for kicks. But\nwe go in my car.\"\nSnader moved ahead to the cashier's stand. Jeff watched the weasel-like\ngrace of his short, broad body.\n\"This is no ordinary oddball,\" Jeff told Ann. \"He's tricky. He's got\nsome gimmick.\"\n\"First I just played him along, to see how loony he was,\" Ann said.\n\"Now I wonder who's kidding whom.\" She concluded thoughtfully, \"He's\nkind of handsome, in a tough way.\"\nII\nSnader's \"station\" proved to be a middle-sized, middle-cost home in a\ngood neighborhood. Lights glowed in the windows. Jeff could hear the\nwhisper of traffic on a boulevard a few blocks away. Through the warm\ndusk, he could dimly see the mountains on the horizon. All was peaceful.\nSnader unlocked the front door with a key which he drew from a fine\nmetal chain around his neck. He swept open the front door with a\nflourish and beamed at them, but Ann drew back.\n\"'Walk into my parlor, said the spider to the fly,'\" she murmured to\nJeff. \"This could be a gambling hell. Or a dope den.\"\n\"No matter what kind of clip joint, it can't clip us much,\" he said.\n\"There's only four bucks in my wallet. My guess is it's a 'temple' for\nsome daffy religious sect.\"\nThey went in. A fat man smiled at them from a desk in the hall. Snader\nsaid, \"Meet Peter Powers. Local agent of our bureau.\"\nThe man didn't get up, but nodded comfortably and waved them toward the\nnext room, after a glance at Snader's key.\nThe key opened this room's door, too. Its spring lock snapped shut\nafter them.\nThe room was like a doctor's waiting room, with easy chairs along the\nwalls. Its only peculiar aspects were a sign hanging from the middle\nof the ceiling and two movie screens\u2014or were they giant television\nscreens?\u2014occupying a whole wall at either end of the room.\nThe sign bore the number 701 in bright yellow on black. Beneath it, an\narrow pointed to the screen on the left with the word\nAnte\n, and to\nthe right with the word\nPost\n.\nJeff studied the big screens. On each, a picture was in motion. One\nappeared to be moving through a long corridor, lined with seats like\na railroad club car. The picture seemed to rush at them from the left\nwall. When he turned to the right, a similar endless chair-lined\ncorridor moved toward him from that direction.\n\"Somebody worked hard on this layout,\" he said to Snader. \"What's it\nfor?\"\n\"Time travel,\" said Snader. \"You like?\"\n\"Almost as good as Disneyland. These movies represent the stream of\ntime, I suppose?\"\nInstead of answering, Snader pointed to the screen. The picture showed\na group of people chatting in a fast-moving corridor. As it hurtled\ntoward them, Snader flipped his hand in a genial salute. Two people in\nthe picture waved back.\nAnn gasped. \"It was just as if they saw us.\"\n\"They did,\" Snader said. \"No movie. Time travelers. In fourth\ndimension. To you, they look like flat picture. To them, we look flat.\"\n\"What's he supposed to be?\" Jeff asked as the onrushing picture showed\nthem briefly a figure bound hand and foot, huddled in one of the\nchairs. He stared at them piteously for an instant before the picture\nsurged past.\nSnader showed his teeth. \"That was convict from my time. We have\ncriminals, like in your time. But we do not kill. We make them work.\nWhere he going? To end of line. To earliest year this time groove\nreach. About 600 A.D., your calendar. Authorities pick up when\nhe get there. Put him to work.\"\n\"What kind of work?\" Jeff asked.\n\"Building the groove further back.\"\n\"Sounds like interesting work.\"\nSnader chortled and slapped him on the back. \"Maybe you see it some\nday, but forget that now. You come with me. Little trip.\"\nJeff was perspiring. This was odder than he expected. Whatever the\nfakery, it was clever. His curiosity as a technician made him want to\nknow about it. He asked Snader, \"Where do you propose to go? And how?\"\nSnader said, \"Watch me. Then look at other wall.\"\nHe moved gracefully to the screen on the left wall, stepped into it and\ndisappeared. It was as if he had slid into opaque water.\nJeff and Ann blinked in mystification. Then they remembered his\ninstruction to watch the other screen. They turned. After a moment, in\nthe far distance down the long moving corridor, they could see a stocky\nfigure. The motion of the picture brought him nearer. In a few seconds,\nhe was recognizable as Snader\u2014and as the picture brought him forward,\nhe stepped down out of it and was with them again.\n\"Simple,\" Snader said. \"I rode to next station. Then crossed over. Took\nother carrier back here.\"\n\"Brother, that's the best trick I've seen in years,\" Jeff said. \"How\ndid you do it? Can I do it, too?\"\n\"I show you.\" Grinning like a wildcat, Snader linked his arms with Ann\nand Jeff, and walked them toward the screen. \"Now,\" he said. \"Step in.\"\nJeff submitted to Snader's pressure and stepped cautiously into the\nscreen. Amazingly, he felt no resistance at all, no sense of change or\nmotion. It was like stepping through a fog-bank into another room.\nIn fact, that was what they seemed to have done. They were in the\nchair-lined corridor. As Snader turned them around and seated them,\nthey faced another moving picture screen. It seemed to rush through a\ndark tunnel toward a lighted square in the far distance.\nThe square grew on the screen. Soon they saw it was another room like\nthe waiting room they had left, except that the number hanging from the\nceiling was 702. They seemed to glide through it. Then they were in the\ndark tunnel again.\nAnn was clutching Jeff's arm. He patted her hand. \"Fun, hey? Like Alice\nthrough the looking-glass.\"\n\"You really think we're going back in time?\" she whispered.\n\"Hardly! But we're seeing a million-dollar trick. I can't even begin to\nfigure it out yet.\"\nAnother lighted room grew out of the tunnel on the screen, and when\nthey had flickered through it, another and then another.\n\"Mr. Snader,\" Ann said unsteadily, \"how long\u2014how many years back are\nyou taking us?\"\nSnader was humming to himself. \"Six years. Station 725 fine place to\nstop.\"\nFor a little while, Jeff let himself think it might be true. \"Six years\nago, your dad was alive,\" he mused to Ann. \"If this should somehow be\nreal, we could see him again.\"\n\"We could if we went to our house. He lived with us then, remember?\nWould we see ourselves, six years younger? Or would\u2014\"\nSnader took Jeff's arm and pulled him to his feet. The screen was\nmoving through a room numbered 724.\n\"Soon now,\" Snader grunted happily. \"Then no more questions.\"\nHe took an arm of each as he had before. When the screen was filled by\na room with the number 725, he propelled them forward into it.\nAgain there was no sense of motion. They had simply stepped through a\nbright wall they could not feel. They found themselves in a replica of\nthe room they had left at 701. On the wall, a picture of the continuous\nclub-car corridor rolled toward them in a silent, endless stream.\n\"The same room,\" Ann said in disappointment. \"They just changed the\nnumber. We haven't been anywhere.\"\nSnader was fishing under his shirt for the key. He gave Ann a glance\nthat was almost a leer. Then he carefully unlocked the door.\nIn the hall, a motherly old lady bustled up, but Snader brushed past\nher. \"Official,\" he said, showing her the key. \"No lodging.\"\nHe unlocked the front door without another word and carefully shut it\nbehind them as Jeff and Ann followed him out of the house.\n\"Hey, where's my car?\" Jeff demanded, looking up and down the street.\nThe whole street looked different. Where he had parked his roadster,\nthere was now a long black limousine.\n\"Your car is in future,\" Snader said briskly. \"Where it belong. Get\nin.\" He opened the door of the limousine.\nJeff felt a little flame of excitement licking inside him. Something\nwas happening, he felt. Something exciting and dangerous.\n\"Snader,\" he said, \"if you're kidnaping us, you made a mistake. Nobody\non Earth will pay ransom for us.\"\nSnader seemed amused. \"You are foolish fellow. Silly talk about ransom.\nYou in different time now.\"\n\"When does this gag stop?\" Jeff demanded irritably. \"You haven't fooled\nus. We're still in 1957.\"\n\"You are? Look around.\"\nJeff looked at the street again. He secretly admitted to himself\nthat these were different trees and houses than he remembered. Even\nthe telephone poles and street lights seemed peculiar, vaguely\nforeign-looking. It must be an elaborate practical joke. Snader had\nprobably ushered them into one house, then through a tunnel and out\nanother house.\n\"Get in,\" Snader said curtly.\nJeff decided to go along with the hoax or whatever it was. He could\nsee no serious risk. He helped Ann into the back seat and sat beside\nher. Snader slammed the door and slid into the driver's seat. He\nstarted the engine with a roar and they rocketed away from the curb,\nnarrowly missing another car.\nJeff yelled, \"Easy, man! Look where you're going!\"\nSnader guffawed. \"Tonight, you look where you are going.\"\nAnn clung to Jeff. \"Did you notice the house we came out of?\"\n\"What about it?\"\n\"It looked as though they were afraid people might try to break in.\nThere were bars at the windows.\"\n\"Lots of houses are built that way, honey. Let's see, where are we?\" He\nglanced at house numbers. \"This is the 800 block. Remember that. And\nthe street\u2014\" He peered up at a sign as they whirled around a corner.\n\"The street is Green Thru-Way. I never heard of a street like that.\"\nIII\nThey were headed back toward what should have been the boulevard. The\ncar zoomed through a cloverleaf turn and up onto a broad freeway. Jeff\nknew for certain there was no freeway there in 1957\u2014nor in any earlier\nyear. But on the horizon, he could see the familiar dark bulk of the\nmountains. The whole line of moonlit ridges was the same as always.\n\"Ann,\" he said slowly, \"I think this is for real. Somehow I guess we\nescaped from 1957. We've been transported in time.\"\nShe squeezed his arm. \"If I'm dreaming, don't wake me! I was scared a\nminute ago. But now, oh, boy!\"\n\"Likewise. But I still wonder what Snader's angle is.\" He leaned\nforward and tapped the driver on his meaty shoulder. \"You brought us\ninto the future instead of the past, didn't you?\"\nIt was hard to know whether Snader was sleepy or just bored, but he\nshrugged briefly to show there was no reply coming. Then he yawned.\nJeff smiled tightly. \"I guess we'll find out in good time. Let's sit\nback and enjoy the strangest ride of our lives.\"\nAs the limousine swept along through the traffic, there were plenty\nof big signs for turn-offs, but none gave any hint where they were.\nThe names were unfamiliar. Even the language seemed grotesque. \"Rite\nChannel for Creepers,\" he read. \"Yaw for Torrey Rushway\" flared at him\nfrom a fork in the freeway.\n\"This can't be the future,\" Ann said. \"This limousine is almost new,\nbut it doesn't even have an automatic gear shift\u2014\"\nShe broke off as the car shot down a ramp off the freeway and pulled up\nin front of an apartment house. Just beyond was a big shopping center,\nablaze with lights and swarming with shoppers. Jeff did not recognize\nit, in spite of his familiarity with the city.\nSnader bounded out, pulled open the rear door and jerked his head in a\ncommanding gesture. But Jeff did not get out. He told Snader, \"Let's\nhave some answers before we go any further.\"\nSnader gave him a hard grin. \"You hear everything upstairs.\"\nThe building appeared harmless enough. Jeff looked thoughtfully at Ann.\nShe said, \"It's just an apartment house. We've come this far. Might as\nwell go in and see what's there.\"\nSnader led them in, up to the sixth floor in an elevator and along a\ncorridor with heavy carpets and soft gold lights. He knocked on a door.\nA tall, silver-haired, important-looking man opened it and greeted them\nheartily.\n\"Solid man, Greet!\" he exclaimed. \"You're a real scratcher! And is this\nour sharp?\" He gave Jeff a friendly but appraising look.\n\"Just what you order,\" Snader said proudly. \"His name\u2014Jeff Elliott.\nFine sharp. Best in his circuit. He brings his lifemate, too. Ann\nElliott.\"\nThe old man rubbed his smooth hands together. \"Prime! I wish joy,\" he\nsaid to Ann and Jeff. \"I'm Septo Kersey. Come in. Bullen's waiting.\"\nHe led them into a spacious drawing room with great windows looking out\non the lights of the city. There was a leather chair in a corner, and\nin it sat a heavy man with a grim mouth. He made no move, but grunted\na perfunctory \"Wish joy\" when Kersey introduced them. His cold eyes\nstudied Jeff while Kersey seated them in big chairs.\nSnader did not sit down, however. \"No need for me now,\" he said, and\nmoved toward the door with a mocking wave at Ann.\nBullen nodded. \"You get the rest of your pay when Elliott proves out.\"\n\"Here, wait a minute!\" Jeff called. But Snader was gone.\n\"Sit still,\" Bullen growled to Jeff. \"You understand radioptics?\"\nThe blood went to Jeff's head. \"My business is television, if that's\nwhat you mean. What's this about?\"\n\"Tell him, Kersey,\" the big man said, and stared out the window.\nKersey began, \"You understand, I think, that you have come back in\ntime. About six years back.\"\n\"That's a matter of opinion, but go on.\"\n\"I am general manager of Continental Radioptic Combine, owned by Mr.\nDumont Bullen.\" He nodded toward the big man. \"Chromatics have not\nyet been developed here in connection with radioptics. They are well\nunderstood in your time, are they not?\"\n\"What's chromatics? Color television?\"\n\"Exactly. You are an expert in\u2014ah\u2014colored television, I think.\"\nJeff nodded. \"So what?\"\nThe old man beamed at him. \"You are here to work for our company. You\nwill enable us to be first with chromatics in this time wave.\"\nJeff stood up. \"Don't tell me who I'll work for.\"\nBullen slapped a big fist on the arm of his chair. \"No fog about this!\nYou're bought and paid for, Elliott! You'll get a fair labor contract,\nbut you do what I say!\"\n\"Why, the man thinks he owns you.\" Ann laughed shakily.\n\"You'll find my barmen know their law,\" Bullen said. \"This isn't the\nway I like to recruit. But it was only way to get a man with your\nknowledge.\"\nKersey said politely, \"You are here illegally, with no immigrate\npermit or citizen file. Therefore you cannot get work. But Mr. Bullen\nhas taken an interest in your trouble. Through his influence, you can\nmake a living. We even set aside an apartment in this building for you\nto live in. You are really very luxe, do you see?\"\nJeff's legs felt weak. These highbinders seemed brutally confident. He\nwondered how he and Ann would find their way home through the strange\nstreets. But he put on a bold front.\n\"I don't believe your line about time travel and I don't plan to work\nfor you,\" he said. \"My wife and I are walking out right now. Try and\nstop us, legally or any other way.\"\nKersey's smooth old face turned hard. But, unexpectedly, Bullen\nchuckled deep in his throat. \"Good pop and bang. Like to see it. Go\non, walk out. You hang in trouble, call up here\u2014Butterfly 9, ask for\nBullen. Whole exchange us. I'll meet you here about eleven tomorrow\npre-noon.\"\n\"Don't hold your breath. Let's go, Ann.\"\nWhen they were on the sidewalk, Ann took a deep breath. \"We made it.\nFor a minute, I thought there'd be a brawl. Why did they let us go?\"\n\"No telling. Maybe they're harmless lunatics\u2014or practical jokers.\" He\nlooked over his shoulder as they walked down the street, but there was\nno sign of pursuit. \"It's a long time since supper.\"\nHer hand was cold in his and her face was white. To take her mind off\ntheir problem, he ambled toward the lighted shop windows.\n\"Look at that sign,\" he said, pointing to a poster over a display of\nneckties. \"'Sleek neck-sashes, only a Dick and a dollop!' How do they\nexpect to sell stuff with that crazy lingo?\"\n\"It's jive talk. They must cater to the high-school crowd.\" Ann\nglanced nervously at the strolling people around them. \"Jeff, where\nare we? This isn't any part of the city I've ever seen. It doesn't\neven look much like America.\" Her voice rose. \"The way the women are\ndressed\u2014it's not old-fashioned, just different.\"\n\"Baby, don't be scared. This is an adventure. Let's have fun.\" He\npressed her hand soothingly and pulled her toward a lunch counter.\nIf the haberdasher's sign was jive, the restaurant spoke the same\njargon. The signs on the wall and the bill of fare were baffling. Jeff\npondered the list of beef shingles, scorchers, smack sticks and fruit\nchills, until he noticed that a couple at the counter were eating what\nclearly were hamburgers\u2014though the \"buns\" looked more like tortillas.\nJeff jerked his thumb at them and told the waitress, \"Two, please.\"\nWhen the sandwiches arrived, they were ordinary enough. He and Ann ate\nin silence. A feeling of foreboding hung over them.\nWhen they finished, the clerk gave him a check marked 1/20. Jeff looked\nat it thoughtfully, shrugged and handed it to the cashier with two\ndollar bills.\nThe man at the desk glanced at them and laughed. \"Stage money, eh?\"\n\"No, that's good money,\" Jeff assured him with a rather hollow smile.\n\"They're just new bills, that's all.\"\nThe cashier picked one up and looked at it curiously. \"I'm afraid it's\nno good here,\" he said, and pushed it back.\nThe bottom dropped out of Jeff's stomach. \"What kind of money do you\nwant? This is all I have.\"\nThe cashier's smile faded. He caught the eye of a man in uniform on one\nof the stools. The uniform was dark green, but the man acted like a\npoliceman. He loomed up beside Jeff.\n\"What's the rasper?\" he demanded. Other customers, waiting to pay their\nchecks, eyed Jeff curiously.\n\"I guess I'm in trouble,\" Jeff told him. \"I'm a stranger here and I got\nsomething to eat under the impression that my money was legal tender.\nDo you know where I can exchange it?\"\nThe officer picked up the dollar bill and fingered it with evident\ninterest. He turned it over and studied the printing. \"United States of\nAmerica,\" he read aloud. \"What are those?\"\n\"It's the name of the country I come from,\" Jeff said carefully.\n\"I\u2014uh\u2014got on the wrong train, apparently, and must have come further\nthan I thought. What's the name of this place?\"\n\"This is Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Say, you\nmust come from an umpty remote part of the world if you don't know\nabout this country.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Where'd you learn to speak\nFederal, if you come from so far?\"\nJeff said helplessly, \"I can't explain, if you don't know about the\nUnited States. Listen, can you take me to a bank, or some place where\nthey know about foreign exchange?\"\nThe policeman scowled. \"How'd you get into this country, anyway? You\ngot immigrate clearance?\"\nAn angry muttering started among the bystanders.\nThe policeman made up his mind. \"You come with me.\"\nAt the police station, Jeff put his elbows dejectedly on the high\ncounter while the policeman talked to an officer in charge. Some men\nwhom Jeff took for reporters got up from a table and eased over to\nlisten.\n\"I don't know whether to charge them with fakemake, bumsy, peekage or\nlunate,\" the policeman said as he finished.\nHis superior gave Jeff a long puzzled stare.\nJeff sighed. \"I know it sounds impossible, but a man brought me in\nsomething he claimed was a time traveler. You speak the same language I\ndo\u2014more or less\u2014but everything else is kind of unfamiliar. I belong\nin the United States, a country in North America. I can't believe I'm\nso far in the future that the United States has been forgotten.\"\nThere ensued a long, confused, inconclusive interrogation.\nThe man behind the desk asked questions which seemed stupid to Jeff and\ngot answers which probably seemed stupid to him.\nThe reporters quizzed Jeff gleefully. \"Come out, what are you\nadvertising?\" they kept asking. \"Who got you up to this?\"\nThe police puzzled over his driver's license and the other cards in his\nwallet. They asked repeatedly about the lack of a \"Work License,\" which\nJeff took to be some sort of union card. Evidently there was grave\ndoubt that he had any legal right to be in the country.\nIn the end, Jeff and Ann were locked in separate cells for the night.\nJeff groaned and pounded the bars as he thought of his wife, imprisoned\nand alone in a smelly jail. After hours of pacing the cell, he lay down\nin the cot and reached automatically for his silver pillbox. Then he\nhesitated.\nIn past weeks, his insomnia had grown worse and worse, so that lately\nhe had begun taking stronger pills. After a longing glance at the\nbig red and yellow capsules, he put the box away. Whatever tomorrow\nbrought, it wouldn't find him slow and drowsy.\nIV\nHe passed a wakeful night. In the early morning, he looked up to see a\nlittle man with a briefcase at his cell door.\n\"Wish joy, Mr. Elliott,\" the man said coolly. \"I am one of Mr. Bullen's\nbarmen. You know, represent at law? He sent me to arrange your release,\nif you are ready to be reasonable.\"\nJeff lay there and put his hands behind his head. \"I doubt if I'm\nready. I'm comfortable here. By the way, how did you know where I was?\"\n\"No problem. When we read in this morning's newspapers about a man\nclaiming to be a time traveler, we knew.\"\n\"All right. Now start explaining. Until I understand where I am, Bullen\nisn't getting me out of here.\"\nThe lawyer smiled and sat down. \"Mr. Kersey told you yesterday\u2014you've\ngone back six years. But you'll need some mental gymnastics to\nunderstand. Time is a dimension, not a stream of events like a movie\nfilm. A film never changes. Space does\u2014and time does. For example, if\na movie showed a burning house at Sixth and Main, would you expect to\nfind a house burning whenever you returned to that corner?\"\n\"You mean to say that if I went back to 1865, I wouldn't find the Civil\nWar was over and Lincoln had been assassinated?\"\n\"If you go back to the time you call 1865\u2014which is most easily\ndone\u2014you will find that the people there know nothing of a Lincoln or\nthat war.\"\nJeff looked blank. \"What are they doing then?\"\nThe little man spread his hands. \"What are the people doing now at\nSixth and Main? Certainly not the same things they were doing the day\nof the fire. We're talking about a dimension, not an event. Don't you\ngrasp the difference between the two?\"\n\"Nope. To me, 1865 means the end of the Civil War. How else can you\nspeak of a point in time except by the events that happened then?\"\n\"Well, if you go to a place in three-dimensional space\u2014say, a lake\nin the mountains\u2014how do you identify that place? By looking for\nlandmarks. It doesn't matter that an eagle is soaring over a mountain\npeak. That's only an event. The peak is the landmark. You follow me?\"\n\"So far. Keep talking.\"\n", "summary": "The story begins with Jeff and Ann sitting at a table in a restaurant in a crowded area. They are discussing their upcoming venture into the engineering lab. Jeff is discussing the possibility of selling the building that he owns and the possibility that he will start a new company. Ann is discussing how she is jealous of the genius genius that Jeff is and how much money he has saved up for the venture. Jeff mentions that he is not in the mood to talk about the building and the idea of selling it. Ann suggests that they go to the doctor to discuss their concerns. Jeff does not want to go, but Ann insists that they should go. They leave the restaurant and walk down a long hall. They pass a store that sells soda and a bar. They enter a small room with a bed, chairs, and a bureau. Jeff notices that the place is very noisy and hot. He is annoyed by the smell. He goes to the bathroom to take a drink and sees a man at the next table. He notices that he has a mustachioed man at his table. The man is a foreigner and he is talking to Jeff. Jeff tries to ignore him but he is persistent. He tells Jeff that he needs a job and the man is following him. Jeff tells Ann that he can't find anything to do with him. He wants to go back to his old job. He then goes to his typewriter to look at his old magazines. He finds a magazine with a picture of a woman in it. He looks at the picture of her and notices that she is wearing a skirt. He asks her out for dinner. She says she is married and that she has a husband. He says that he would like to go out for food. He orders a drink. He takes a large amount of pills and takes a bite. He begins to talk to Ann about the new company he is going to start. He mentions that the building is being sold and that he lost his lease on. He also mentions that it is too noisy and too hot. Ann tells him that she does not like the smell of the building. He tries to explain that he cannot find anything that would help him. She tells him to go to bed. He leaves the room and goes to take his medicine. He returns to the room. He sees a magazine and sees that it has a picture with a woman on it. The woman is a beautiful blonde with blue eyes. She is wearing pink straitjackets. She asks him to marry her. He agrees. He starts to tell her about the idea and she says that she will marry him.   Jeff tells her that he wants to take the job of a teacher. He explains that he was offered a teaching job but he cannot because he is the best in his field. He offers to train the kids. He has to go through a series of tests. He gets the job and Ann is upset. He gives her a locket to keep.", "faithfulness": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, null, null, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, null, 0, 0, 0, null, 0, null, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, null, 0, null, 0, null, null, 0, 0]}

Their minds were busy with Jeff's troubles.\n\"You're still the smartest color engineer in television,\" Ann told Jeff\nas they dallied with their food. \"You'll bounce back. Now eat your\nsupper.\"\n\"This beanery is too noisy and hot,\" he grumbled. \"I can't eat. Can't\ntalk. Can't think.\" He took a silver pillbox from his pocket and\nfumbled for a black one. Those were vitamin pills; the big red and\nyellow ones were sleeping capsules. He gulped the pill.\nAnn looked disapproving in a wifely way. \"Lately you chew pills like\npopcorn,\" she said. \"Do you really need so many?\"\n\"I need something. I'm sure losing my grip.\"\nAnn stared at him. \"Baby! How silly! Nothing happened, except you lost\nyour lease. You'll build up a better company in a new spot. We're young\nyet.\"\nJeff sighed and glanced around the crowded little restaurant. He wished\nhe could fly away somewhere. At that moment, he met the gaze of the\nmustachioed man at the next table.\nThe fellow seemed to be watching him and Ann. Something in his\nconfident gaze made Jeff uneasy. Had they met before?\nAnn whispered, \"So you noticed him, too. Maybe he's following us. I\nthink I saw him on the parking lot where we left the car.\"\nJeff shrugged his big shoulders. \"If he's following us, he's nuts.\nWe've got no secrets and no money.\"\n\"It must be my maddening beauty,\" said Ann.\n\"I'll kick him cross-eyed if he starts anything,\" Jeff said. \"I'm just\nin the mood.\"\nAnn giggled. \"Honey, what big veins you have! Forget him. Let's talk\nabout the engineering lab you're going to start. And let's eat.\"\nHe groaned. \"I lose my appetite every time I think about the building\nbeing sold. It isn't worth the twelve grand. I wouldn't buy it for that\nif I could. What burns me is that, five years ago, I could have bought\nit for two thousand.\"\n\"If only we could go back five years.\" She shrugged fatalistically.\n\"But since we can't\u2014\"\nThe character at the next table leaned over and spoke to them,\ngrinning. \"You like to get away? You wish to go back?\"\nJeff glanced across in annoyance. The man was evidently a salesman,\nwith extra gall.\n\"Not now, thanks,\" Jeff said. \"Haven't time.\"\nThe man waved his thick hand at the clock, as if to abolish time.\n\"Time? That is nothing. Your little lady. She spoke of go back five\nyears. Maybe I help you.\"\nHe spoke in an odd clipped way, obviously a foreigner. His shirt was\nyellow. His suit had a silky sheen. Its peculiar tailoring emphasized\nthe bulges in his stubby, muscular torso.\nAnn smiled back at him. \"You talk as if you could take us back to 1952.\nIs that what you really mean?\"\n\"Why not? You think this silly. But I can show you.\"\nJeff rose to go. \"Mister, you better get to a doctor. Ann, it's time we\nstarted home.\"\nAnn laid a hand on his sleeve. \"I haven't finished eating. Let's\nchat with the gent.\" She added in an undertone to Jeff, \"Must be a\npsycho\u2014but sort of an inspired one.\"\nThe man said to Ann, \"You are kind lady, I think. Good to crazy people.\nI join you.\"\nHe did not wait for consent, but slid into a seat at their table with\nan easy grace that was almost arrogant.\n\"You are unhappy in 1957,\" he went on. \"Discouraged. Restless. Why not\ntake trip to another time?\"\n\"Why not?\" Ann said gaily. \"How much does it cost?\"\n\"Free trial trip. Cost nothing. See whether you like. Then maybe we\ntalk money.\" He handed Jeff a card made of a stiff plastic substance.\nJeff glanced at it, then handed it to Ann with a half-smile. It read:\n4-D TRAVEL BEURO\nGreet Snader, Traffic Ajent\n\"Mr. Snader's bureau is different,\" Jeff said to his wife. \"He even\nspells it different.\"\nSnader chuckled. \"I come from other time. We spell otherwise.\"\n\"You mean you come from the future?\"\n\"Just different time. I show you. You come with me?\"\n\"Come where?\" Jeff asked, studying Snader's mocking eyes. The man\ndidn't seem a mere eccentric. He had a peculiar suggestion of humor and\nforce.\n\"Come on little trip to different time,\" invited Snader. He added\npersuasively, \"Could be back here in hour.\"\n\"It would be painless, I suppose?\" Jeff gave it a touch of derision.\n\"Maybe not. That is risk you take. But look at me. I make trips every\nday. I look damaged?\"\nAs a matter of fact, he did. His thick-fleshed face bore a scar and\nhis nose was broad and flat, as if it had been broken. But Jeff\npolitely agreed that he did not look damaged.\nAnn was enjoying this. \"Tell me more, Mr. Snader. How does your time\ntravel work?\"\n\"Cannot explain. Same if you are asked how subway train works. Too\ncomplicated.\" He flashed his white teeth. \"You think time travel not\npossible. Just like television not possible to your grandfather.\"\nAnn said, \"Why invite us? We're not rich enough for expensive trips.\"\n\"Invite many people,\" Snader said quickly. \"Not expensive. You know\nMissing Persons lists, from police? Dozens people disappear. They go\nwith me to other time. Many stay.\"\n\"Oh, sure,\" Jeff said. \"But how do you select the ones to invite?\"\n\"Find ones like you, Mr. Elliott. Ones who want change, escape.\"\nJeff was slightly startled. How did this fellow know his name was\nElliott?\nBefore he could ask, Ann popped another question. \"Mr. Snader, you\nheard us talking. You know we're in trouble because Jeff missed a good\nchance five years ago. Do you claim people can really go back into the\npast and correct mistakes they've made?\"\n\"They can go back. What they do when arrive? Depends on them.\"\n\"Don't you wish it were true?\" she sighed to Jeff.\n\"You afraid to believe,\" said Snader, a glimmer of amusement in his\nrestless eyes. \"Why not try? What you lose? Come on, look at station.\nVery near here.\"\nAnn jumped up. \"It might be fun, Jeff. Let's see what he means, if\nanything.\"\nJeff's pulse quickened. He too felt a sort of midsummer night's\nmadness\u2014a yearning to forget his troubles. \"Okay, just for kicks. But\nwe go in my car.\"\nSnader moved ahead to the cashier's stand. Jeff watched the weasel-like\ngrace of his short, broad body.\n\"This is no ordinary oddball,\" Jeff told Ann. \"He's tricky. He's got\nsome gimmick.\"\n\"First I just played him along, to see how loony he was,\" Ann said.\n\"Now I wonder who's kidding whom.\" She concluded thoughtfully, \"He's\nkind of handsome, in a tough way.\"\nII\nSnader's \"station\" proved to be a middle-sized, middle-cost home in a\ngood neighborhood. Lights glowed in the windows. Jeff could hear the\nwhisper of traffic on a boulevard a few blocks away. Through the warm\ndusk, he could dimly see the mountains on the horizon. All was peaceful.\nSnader unlocked the front door with a key which he drew from a fine\nmetal chain around his neck. He swept open the front door with a\nflourish and beamed at them, but Ann drew back.\n\"'Walk into my parlor, said the spider to the fly,'\" she murmured to\nJeff. \"This could be a gambling hell. Or a dope den.\"\n\"No matter what kind of clip joint, it can't clip us much,\" he said.\n\"There's only four bucks in my wallet. My guess is it's a 'temple' for\nsome daffy religious sect.\"\nThey went in. A fat man smiled at them from a desk in the hall. Snader\nsaid, \"Meet Peter Powers. Local agent of our bureau.\"\nThe man didn't get up, but nodded comfortably and waved them toward the\nnext room, after a glance at Snader's key.\nThe key opened this room's door, too. Its spring lock snapped shut\nafter them.\nThe room was like a doctor's waiting room, with easy chairs along the\nwalls. Its only peculiar aspects were a sign hanging from the middle\nof the ceiling and two movie screens\u2014or were they giant television\nscreens?\u2014occupying a whole wall at either end of the room.\nThe sign bore the number 701 in bright yellow on black. Beneath it, an\narrow pointed to the screen on the left with the word\nAnte\n, and to\nthe right with the word\nPost\n.\nJeff studied the big screens. On each, a picture was in motion. One\nappeared to be moving through a long corridor, lined with seats like\na railroad club car. The picture seemed to rush at them from the left\nwall. When he turned to the right, a similar endless chair-lined\ncorridor moved toward him from that direction.\n\"Somebody worked hard on this layout,\" he said to Snader. \"What's it\nfor?\"\n\"Time travel,\" said Snader. \"You like?\"\n\"Almost as good as Disneyland. These movies represent the stream of\ntime, I suppose?\"\nInstead of answering, Snader pointed to the screen. The picture showed\na group of people chatting in a fast-moving corridor. As it hurtled\ntoward them, Snader flipped his hand in a genial salute. Two people in\nthe picture waved back.\nAnn gasped. \"It was just as if they saw us.\"\n\"They did,\" Snader said. \"No movie. Time travelers. In fourth\ndimension. To you, they look like flat picture. To them, we look flat.\"\n\"What's he supposed to be?\" Jeff asked as the onrushing picture showed\nthem briefly a figure bound hand and foot, huddled in one of the\nchairs. He stared at them piteously for an instant before the picture\nsurged past.\nSnader showed his teeth. \"That was convict from my time. We have\ncriminals, like in your time. But we do not kill. We make them work.\nWhere he going? To end of line. To earliest year this time groove\nreach. About 600 A.D., your calendar. Authorities pick up when\nhe get there. Put him to work.\"\n\"What kind of work?\" Jeff asked.\n\"Building the groove further back.\"\n\"Sounds like interesting work.\"\nSnader chortled and slapped him on the back. \"Maybe you see it some\nday, but forget that now. You come with me. Little trip.\"\nJeff was perspiring. This was odder than he expected. Whatever the\nfakery, it was clever. His curiosity as a technician made him want to\nknow about it. He asked Snader, \"Where do you propose to go? And how?\"\nSnader said, \"Watch me. Then look at other wall.\"\nHe moved gracefully to the screen on the left wall, stepped into it and\ndisappeared. It was as if he had slid into opaque water.\nJeff and Ann blinked in mystification. Then they remembered his\ninstruction to watch the other screen. They turned. After a moment, in\nthe far distance down the long moving corridor, they could see a stocky\nfigure. The motion of the picture brought him nearer. In a few seconds,\nhe was recognizable as Snader\u2014and as the picture brought him forward,\nhe stepped down out of it and was with them again.\n\"Simple,\" Snader said. \"I rode to next station. Then crossed over. Took\nother carrier back here.\"\n\"Brother, that's the best trick I've seen in years,\" Jeff said. \"How\ndid you do it? Can I do it, too?\"\n\"I show you.\" Grinning like a wildcat, Snader linked his arms with Ann\nand Jeff, and walked them toward the screen. \"Now,\" he said. \"Step in.\"\nJeff submitted to Snader's pressure and stepped cautiously into the\nscreen. Amazingly, he felt no resistance at all, no sense of change or\nmotion. It was like stepping through a fog-bank into another room.\nIn fact, that was what they seemed to have done. They were in the\nchair-lined corridor. As Snader turned them around and seated them,\nthey faced another moving picture screen. It seemed to rush through a\ndark tunnel toward a lighted square in the far distance.\nThe square grew on the screen. Soon they saw it was another room like\nthe waiting room they had left, except that the number hanging from the\nceiling was 702. They seemed to glide through it. Then they were in the\ndark tunnel again.\nAnn was clutching Jeff's arm. He patted her hand. \"Fun, hey? Like Alice\nthrough the looking-glass.\"\n\"You really think we're going back in time?\" she whispered.\n\"Hardly! But we're seeing a million-dollar trick. I can't even begin to\nfigure it out yet.\"\nAnother lighted room grew out of the tunnel on the screen, and when\nthey had flickered through it, another and then another.\n\"Mr. Snader,\" Ann said unsteadily, \"how long\u2014how many years back are\nyou taking us?\"\nSnader was humming to himself. \"Six years. Station 725 fine place to\nstop.\"\nFor a little while, Jeff let himself think it might be true. \"Six years\nago, your dad was alive,\" he mused to Ann. \"If this should somehow be\nreal, we could see him again.\"\n\"We could if we went to our house. He lived with us then, remember?\nWould we see ourselves, six years younger? Or would\u2014\"\nSnader took Jeff's arm and pulled him to his feet. The screen was\nmoving through a room numbered 724.\n\"Soon now,\" Snader grunted happily. \"Then no more questions.\"\nHe took an arm of each as he had before. When the screen was filled by\na room with the number 725, he propelled them forward into it.\nAgain there was no sense of motion. They had simply stepped through a\nbright wall they could not feel. They found themselves in a replica of\nthe room they had left at 701. On the wall, a picture of the continuous\nclub-car corridor rolled toward them in a silent, endless stream.\n\"The same room,\" Ann said in disappointment. \"They just changed the\nnumber. We haven't been anywhere.\"\nSnader was fishing under his shirt for the key. He gave Ann a glance\nthat was almost a leer. Then he carefully unlocked the door.\nIn the hall, a motherly old lady bustled up, but Snader brushed past\nher. \"Official,\" he said, showing her the key. \"No lodging.\"\nHe unlocked the front door without another word and carefully shut it\nbehind them as Jeff and Ann followed him out of the house.\n\"Hey, where's my car?\" Jeff demanded, looking up and down the street.\nThe whole street looked different. Where he had parked his roadster,\nthere was now a long black limousine.\n\"Your car is in future,\" Snader said briskly. \"Where it belong. Get\nin.\" He opened the door of the limousine.\nJeff felt a little flame of excitement licking inside him. Something\nwas happening, he felt. Something exciting and dangerous.\n\"Snader,\" he said, \"if you're kidnaping us, you made a mistake. Nobody\non Earth will pay ransom for us.\"\nSnader seemed amused. \"You are foolish fellow. Silly talk about ransom.\nYou in different time now.\"\n\"When does this gag stop?\" Jeff demanded irritably. \"You haven't fooled\nus. We're still in 1957.\"\n\"You are? Look around.\"\nJeff looked at the street again. He secretly admitted to himself\nthat these were different trees and houses than he remembered. Even\nthe telephone poles and street lights seemed peculiar, vaguely\nforeign-looking. It must be an elaborate practical joke. Snader had\nprobably ushered them into one house, then through a tunnel and out\nanother house.\n\"Get in,\" Snader said curtly.\nJeff decided to go along with the hoax or whatever it was. He could\nsee no serious risk. He helped Ann into the back seat and sat beside\nher. Snader slammed the door and slid into the driver's seat. He\nstarted the engine with a roar and they rocketed away from the curb,\nnarrowly missing another car.\nJeff yelled, \"Easy, man! Look where you're going!\"\nSnader guffawed. \"Tonight, you look where you are going.\"\nAnn clung to Jeff. \"Did you notice the house we came out of?\"\n\"What about it?\"\n\"It looked as though they were afraid people might try to break in.\nThere were bars at the windows.\"\n\"Lots of houses are built that way, honey. Let's see, where are we?\" He\nglanced at house numbers. \"This is the 800 block. Remember that. And\nthe street\u2014\" He peered up at a sign as they whirled around a corner.\n\"The street is Green Thru-Way. I never heard of a street like that.\"\nIII\nThey were headed back toward what should have been the boulevard. The\ncar zoomed through a cloverleaf turn and up onto a broad freeway. Jeff\nknew for certain there was no freeway there in 1957\u2014nor in any earlier\nyear. But on the horizon, he could see the familiar dark bulk of the\nmountains. The whole line of moonlit ridges was the same as always.\n\"Ann,\" he said slowly, \"I think this is for real. Somehow I guess we\nescaped from 1957. We've been transported in time.\"\nShe squeezed his arm. \"If I'm dreaming, don't wake me! I was scared a\nminute ago. But now, oh, boy!\"\n\"Likewise. But I still wonder what Snader's angle is.\" He leaned\nforward and tapped the driver on his meaty shoulder. \"You brought us\ninto the future instead of the past, didn't you?\"\nIt was hard to know whether Snader was sleepy or just bored, but he\nshrugged briefly to show there was no reply coming. Then he yawned.\nJeff smiled tightly. \"I guess we'll find out in good time. Let's sit\nback and enjoy the strangest ride of our lives.\"\nAs the limousine swept along through the traffic, there were plenty\nof big signs for turn-offs, but none gave any hint where they were.\nThe names were unfamiliar. Even the language seemed grotesque. \"Rite\nChannel for Creepers,\" he read. \"Yaw for Torrey Rushway\" flared at him\nfrom a fork in the freeway.\n\"This can't be the future,\" Ann said. \"This limousine is almost new,\nbut it doesn't even have an automatic gear shift\u2014\"\nShe broke off as the car shot down a ramp off the freeway and pulled up\nin front of an apartment house. Just beyond was a big shopping center,\nablaze with lights and swarming with shoppers. Jeff did not recognize\nit, in spite of his familiarity with the city.\nSnader bounded out, pulled open the rear door and jerked his head in a\ncommanding gesture. But Jeff did not get out. He told Snader, \"Let's\nhave some answers before we go any further.\"\nSnader gave him a hard grin. \"You hear everything upstairs.\"\nThe building appeared harmless enough. Jeff looked thoughtfully at Ann.\nShe said, \"It's just an apartment house. We've come this far. Might as\nwell go in and see what's there.\"\nSnader led them in, up to the sixth floor in an elevator and along a\ncorridor with heavy carpets and soft gold lights. He knocked on a door.\nA tall, silver-haired, important-looking man opened it and greeted them\nheartily.\n\"Solid man, Greet!\" he exclaimed. \"You're a real scratcher! And is this\nour sharp?\" He gave Jeff a friendly but appraising look.\n\"Just what you order,\" Snader said proudly. \"His name\u2014Jeff Elliott.\nFine sharp. Best in his circuit. He brings his lifemate, too. Ann\nElliott.\"\nThe old man rubbed his smooth hands together. \"Prime! I wish joy,\" he\nsaid to Ann and Jeff. \"I'm Septo Kersey. Come in. Bullen's waiting.\"\nHe led them into a spacious drawing room with great windows looking out\non the lights of the city. There was a leather chair in a corner, and\nin it sat a heavy man with a grim mouth. He made no move, but grunted\na perfunctory \"Wish joy\" when Kersey introduced them. His cold eyes\nstudied Jeff while Kersey seated them in big chairs.\nSnader did not sit down, however. \"No need for me now,\" he said, and\nmoved toward the door with a mocking wave at Ann.\nBullen nodded. \"You get the rest of your pay when Elliott proves out.\"\n\"Here, wait a minute!\" Jeff called. But Snader was gone.\n\"Sit still,\" Bullen growled to Jeff. \"You understand radioptics?\"\nThe blood went to Jeff's head. \"My business is television, if that's\nwhat you mean. What's this about?\"\n\"Tell him, Kersey,\" the big man said, and stared out the window.\nKersey began, \"You understand, I think, that you have come back in\ntime. About six years back.\"\n\"That's a matter of opinion, but go on.\"\n\"I am general manager of Continental Radioptic Combine, owned by Mr.\nDumont Bullen.\" He nodded toward the big man. \"Chromatics have not\nyet been developed here in connection with radioptics. They are well\nunderstood in your time, are they not?\"\n\"What's chromatics? Color television?\"\n\"Exactly. You are an expert in\u2014ah\u2014colored television, I think.\"\nJeff nodded. \"So what?\"\nThe old man beamed at him. \"You are here to work for our company. You\nwill enable us to be first with chromatics in this time wave.\"\nJeff stood up. \"Don't tell me who I'll work for.\"\nBullen slapped a big fist on the arm of his chair. \"No fog about this!\nYou're bought and paid for, Elliott! You'll get a fair labor contract,\nbut you do what I say!\"\n\"Why, the man thinks he owns you.\" Ann laughed shakily.\n\"You'll find my barmen know their law,\" Bullen said. \"This isn't the\nway I like to recruit. But it was only way to get a man with your\nknowledge.\"\nKersey said politely, \"You are here illegally, with no immigrate\npermit or citizen file. Therefore you cannot get work. But Mr. Bullen\nhas taken an interest in your trouble. Through his influence, you can\nmake a living. We even set aside an apartment in this building for you\nto live in. You are really very luxe, do you see?\"\nJeff's legs felt weak. These highbinders seemed brutally confident. He\nwondered how he and Ann would find their way home through the strange\nstreets. But he put on a bold front.\n\"I don't believe your line about time travel and I don't plan to work\nfor you,\" he said. \"My wife and I are walking out right now. Try and\nstop us, legally or any other way.\"\nKersey's smooth old face turned hard. But, unexpectedly, Bullen\nchuckled deep in his throat. \"Good pop and bang. Like to see it. Go\non, walk out. You hang in trouble, call up here\u2014Butterfly 9, ask for\nBullen. Whole exchange us. I'll meet you here about eleven tomorrow\npre-noon.\"\n\"Don't hold your breath. Let's go, Ann.\"\nWhen they were on the sidewalk, Ann took a deep breath. \"We made it.\nFor a minute, I thought there'd be a brawl. Why did they let us go?\"\n\"No telling. Maybe they're harmless lunatics\u2014or practical jokers.\" He\nlooked over his shoulder as they walked down the street, but there was\nno sign of pursuit. \"It's a long time since supper.\"\nHer hand was cold in his and her face was white. To take her mind off\ntheir problem, he ambled toward the lighted shop windows.\n\"Look at that sign,\" he said, pointing to a poster over a display of\nneckties. \"'Sleek neck-sashes, only a Dick and a dollop!' How do they\nexpect to sell stuff with that crazy lingo?\"\n\"It's jive talk. They must cater to the high-school crowd.\" Ann\nglanced nervously at the strolling people around them. \"Jeff, where\nare we? This isn't any part of the city I've ever seen. It doesn't\neven look much like America.\" Her voice rose. \"The way the women are\ndressed\u2014it's not old-fashioned, just different.\"\n\"Baby, don't be scared. This is an adventure. Let's have fun.\" He\npressed her hand soothingly and pulled her toward a lunch counter.\nIf the haberdasher's sign was jive, the restaurant spoke the same\njargon. The signs on the wall and the bill of fare were baffling. Jeff\npondered the list of beef shingles, scorchers, smack sticks and fruit\nchills, until he noticed that a couple at the counter were eating what\nclearly were hamburgers\u2014though the \"buns\" looked more like tortillas.\nJeff jerked his thumb at them and told the waitress, \"Two, please.\"\nWhen the sandwiches arrived, they were ordinary enough. He and Ann ate\nin silence. A feeling of foreboding hung over them.\nWhen they finished, the clerk gave him a check marked 1/20. Jeff looked\nat it thoughtfully, shrugged and handed it to the cashier with two\ndollar bills.\nThe man at the desk glanced at them and laughed. \"Stage money, eh?\"\n\"No, that's good money,\" Jeff assured him with a rather hollow smile.\n\"They're just new bills, that's all.\"\nThe cashier picked one up and looked at it curiously. \"I'm afraid it's\nno good here,\" he said, and pushed it back.\nThe bottom dropped out of Jeff's stomach. \"What kind of money do you\nwant? This is all I have.\"\nThe cashier's smile faded. He caught the eye of a man in uniform on one\nof the stools. The uniform was dark green, but the man acted like a\npoliceman. He loomed up beside Jeff.\n\"What's the rasper?\" he demanded. Other customers, waiting to pay their\nchecks, eyed Jeff curiously.\n\"I guess I'm in trouble,\" Jeff told him. \"I'm a stranger here and I got\nsomething to eat under the impression that my money was legal tender.\nDo you know where I can exchange it?\"\nThe officer picked up the dollar bill and fingered it with evident\ninterest. He turned it over and studied the printing. \"United States of\nAmerica,\" he read aloud. \"What are those?\"\n\"It's the name of the country I come from,\" Jeff said carefully.\n\"I\u2014uh\u2014got on the wrong train, apparently, and must have come further\nthan I thought. What's the name of this place?\"\n\"This is Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Say, you\nmust come from an umpty remote part of the world if you don't know\nabout this country.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Where'd you learn to speak\nFederal, if you come from so far?\"\nJeff said helplessly, \"I can't explain, if you don't know about the\nUnited States. Listen, can you take me to a bank, or some place where\nthey know about foreign exchange?\"\nThe policeman scowled. \"How'd you get into this country, anyway? You\ngot immigrate clearance?\"\nAn angry muttering started among the bystanders.\nThe policeman made up his mind. \"You come with me.\"\nAt the police station, Jeff put his elbows dejectedly on the high\ncounter while the policeman talked to an officer in charge. Some men\nwhom Jeff took for reporters got up from a table and eased over to\nlisten.\n\"I don't know whether to charge them with fakemake, bumsy, peekage or\nlunate,\" the policeman said as he finished.\nHis superior gave Jeff a long puzzled stare.\nJeff sighed. \"I know it sounds impossible, but a man brought me in\nsomething he claimed was a time traveler. You speak the same language I\ndo\u2014more or less\u2014but everything else is kind of unfamiliar. I belong\nin the United States, a country in North America. I can't believe I'm\nso far in the future that the United States has been forgotten.\"\nThere ensued a long, confused, inconclusive interrogation.\nThe man behind the desk asked questions which seemed stupid to Jeff and\ngot answers which probably seemed stupid to him.\nThe reporters quizzed Jeff gleefully. \"Come out, what are you\nadvertising?\" they kept asking. \"Who got you up to this?\"\nThe police puzzled over his driver's license and the other cards in his\nwallet. They asked repeatedly about the lack of a \"Work License,\" which\nJeff took to be some sort of union card. Evidently there was grave\ndoubt that he had any legal right to be in the country.\nIn the end, Jeff and Ann were locked in separate cells for the night.\nJeff groaned and pounded the bars as he thought of his wife, imprisoned\nand alone in a smelly jail. After hours of pacing the cell, he lay down\nin the cot and reached automatically for his silver pillbox. Then he\nhesitated.\nIn past weeks, his insomnia had grown worse and worse, so that lately\nhe had begun taking stronger pills. After a longing glance at the\nbig red and yellow capsules, he put the box away. Whatever tomorrow\nbrought, it wouldn't find him slow and drowsy.\nIV\nHe passed a wakeful night. In the early morning, he looked up to see a\nlittle man with a briefcase at his cell door.\n\"Wish joy, Mr. Elliott,\" the man said coolly. \"I am one of Mr. Bullen's\nbarmen. You know, represent at law? He sent me to arrange your release,\nif you are ready to be reasonable.\"\nJeff lay there and put his hands behind his head. \"I doubt if I'm\nready. I'm comfortable here. By the way, how did you know where I was?\"\n\"No problem. When we read in this morning's newspapers about a man\nclaiming to be a time traveler, we knew.\"\n\"All right. Now start explaining. Until I understand where I am, Bullen\nisn't getting me out of here.\"\nThe lawyer smiled and sat down. \"Mr. Kersey told you yesterday\u2014you've\ngone back six years. But you'll need some mental gymnastics to\nunderstand. Time is a dimension, not a stream of events like a movie\nfilm. A film never changes. Space does\u2014and time does. For example, if\na movie showed a burning house at Sixth and Main, would you expect to\nfind a house burning whenever you returned to that corner?\"\n\"You mean to say that if I went back to 1865, I wouldn't find the Civil\nWar was over and Lincoln had been assassinated?\"\n\"If you go back to the time you call 1865\u2014which is most easily\ndone\u2014you will find that the people there know nothing of a Lincoln or\nthat war.\"\nJeff looked blank. \"What are they doing then?\"\nThe little man spread his hands. \"What are the people doing now at\nSixth and Main? Certainly not the same things they were doing the day\nof the fire. We're talking about a dimension, not an event. Don't you\ngrasp the difference between the two?\"\n\"Nope. To me, 1865 means the end of the Civil War. How else can you\nspeak of a point in time except by the events that happened then?\"\n\"Well, if you go to a place in three-dimensional space\u2014say, a lake\nin the mountains\u2014how do you identify that place? By looking for\nlandmarks. It doesn't matter that an eagle is soaring over a mountain\npeak. That's only an event. The peak is the landmark. You follow me?\"\n\"So far. Keep talking.\"\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nButterfly 9\nBy DONALD KEITH\nIllustrated by GAUGHAN\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nGalaxy Science Fiction January 1957.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nJeff needed a job and this man had a job to\noffer\u2014one where giant economy-size trouble\nhad labels like fakemake, bumsy and peekage!\nI\nAt first, Jeff scarcely noticed the bold-looking man at the next table.\nNor did Ann. Their minds were busy with Jeff's troubles.\n\"You're still the smartest color engineer in television,\" Ann told Jeff\nas they dallied with their food. \"You'll bounce back. Now eat your\nsupper.\"\n\"This beanery is too noisy and hot,\" he grumbled. \"I can't eat. Can't\ntalk. Can't think.\" He took a silver pillbox from his pocket and\nfumbled for a black one. Those were vitamin pills; the big red and\nyellow ones were sleeping capsules. He gulped the pill.\nAnn looked disapproving in a wifely way. \"Lately you chew pills like\npopcorn,\" she said. \"Do you really need so many?\"\n\"I need something. I'm sure losing my grip.\"\nAnn stared at him. \"Baby! How silly! Nothing happened, except you lost\nyour lease. You'll build up a better company in a new spot. We're young\nyet.\"\nJeff sighed and glanced around the crowded little restaurant. He wished\nhe could fly away somewhere. At that moment, he met the gaze of the\nmustachioed man at the next table.\nThe fellow seemed to be watching him and Ann. Something in his\nconfident gaze made Jeff uneasy. Had they met before?\nAnn whispered, \"So you noticed him, too. Maybe he's following us. I\nthink I saw him on the parking lot where we left the car.\"\nJeff shrugged his big shoulders. \"If he's following us, he's nuts.\nWe've got no secrets and no money.\"\n\"It must be my maddening beauty,\" said Ann.\n\"I'll kick him cross-eyed if he starts anything,\" Jeff said. \"I'm just\nin the mood.\"\nAnn giggled. \"Honey, what big veins you have! Forget him. Let's talk\nabout the engineering lab you're going to start. And let's eat.\"\nHe groaned. \"I lose my appetite every time I think about the building\nbeing sold. It isn't worth the twelve grand. I wouldn't buy it for that\nif I could. What burns me is that, five years ago, I could have bought\nit for two thousand.\"\n\"If only we could go back five years.\" She shrugged fatalistically.\n\"But since we can't\u2014\"\nThe character at the next table leaned over and spoke to them,\ngrinning. \"You like to get away? You wish to go back?\"\nJeff glanced across in annoyance. The man was evidently a salesman,\nwith extra gall.\n\"Not now, thanks,\" Jeff said. \"Haven't time.\"\nThe man waved his thick hand at the clock, as if to abolish time.\n\"Time? That is nothing. Your little lady. She spoke of go back five\nyears. Maybe I help you.\"\nHe spoke in an odd clipped way, obviously a foreigner. His shirt was\nyellow. His suit had a silky sheen. Its peculiar tailoring emphasized\nthe bulges in his stubby, muscular torso.\nAnn smiled back at him. \"You talk as if you could take us back to 1952.\nIs that what you really mean?\"\n\"Why not? You think this silly. But I can show you.\"\nJeff rose to go. \"Mister, you better get to a doctor. Ann, it's time we\nstarted home.\"\nAnn laid a hand on his sleeve. \"I haven't finished eating. Let's\nchat with the gent.\" She added in an undertone to Jeff, \"Must be a\npsycho\u2014but sort of an inspired one.\"\nThe man said to Ann, \"You are kind lady, I think. Good to crazy people.\nI join you.\"\nHe did not wait for consent, but slid into a seat at their table with\nan easy grace that was almost arrogant.\n\"You are unhappy in 1957,\" he went on. \"Discouraged. Restless. Why not\ntake trip to another time?\"\n\"Why not?\" Ann said gaily. \"How much does it cost?\"\n\"Free trial trip. Cost nothing. See whether you like. Then maybe we\ntalk money.\" He handed Jeff a card made of a stiff plastic substance.\nJeff glanced at it, then handed it to Ann with a half-smile. It read:\n4-D TRAVEL BEURO\nGreet Snader, Traffic Ajent\n\"Mr. Snader's bureau is different,\" Jeff said to his wife. \"He even\nspells it different.\"\nSnader chuckled. \"I come from other time. We spell otherwise.\"\n\"You mean you come from the future?\"\n\"Just different time. I show you. You come with me?\"\n\"Come where?\" Jeff asked, studying Snader's mocking eyes. The man\ndidn't seem a mere eccentric. He had a peculiar suggestion of humor and\nforce.\n\"Come on little trip to different time,\" invited Snader. He added\npersuasively, \"Could be back here in hour.\"\n\"It would be painless, I suppose?\" Jeff gave it a touch of derision.\n\"Maybe not. That is risk you take. But look at me. I make trips every\nday. I look damaged?\"\nAs a matter of fact, he did. His thick-fleshed face bore a scar and\nhis nose was broad and flat, as if it had been broken. But Jeff\npolitely agreed that he did not look damaged.\nAnn was enjoying this. \"Tell me more, Mr. Snader. How does your time\ntravel work?\"\n\"Cannot explain. Same if you are asked how subway train works. Too\ncomplicated.\" He flashed his white teeth. \"You think time travel not\npossible. Just like television not possible to your grandfather.\"\nAnn said, \"Why invite us? We're not rich enough for expensive trips.\"\n\"Invite many people,\" Snader said quickly. \"Not expensive. You know\nMissing Persons lists, from police? Dozens people disappear. They go\nwith me to other time. Many stay.\"\n\"Oh, sure,\" Jeff said. \"But how do you select the ones to invite?\"\n\"Find ones like you, Mr. Elliott. Ones who want change, escape.\"\nJeff was slightly startled. How did this fellow know his name was\nElliott?\nBefore he could ask, Ann popped another question. \"Mr. Snader, you\nheard us talking. You know we're in trouble because Jeff missed a good\nchance five years ago. Do you claim people can really go back into the\npast and correct mistakes they've made?\"\n\"They can go back. What they do when arrive? Depends on them.\"\n\"Don't you wish it were true?\" she sighed to Jeff.\n\"You afraid to believe,\" said Snader, a glimmer of amusement in his\nrestless eyes. \"Why not try? What you lose? Come on, look at station.\nVery near here.\"\nAnn jumped up. \"It might be fun, Jeff. Let's see what he means, if\nanything.\"\nJeff's pulse quickened. He too felt a sort of midsummer night's\nmadness\u2014a yearning to forget his troubles. \"Okay, just for kicks. But\nwe go in my car.\"\nSnader moved ahead to the cashier's stand. Jeff watched the weasel-like\ngrace of his short, broad body.\n\"This is no ordinary oddball,\" Jeff told Ann. \"He's tricky. He's got\nsome gimmick.\"\n\"First I just played him along, to see how loony he was,\" Ann said.\n\"Now I wonder who's kidding whom.\" She concluded thoughtfully, \"He's\nkind of handsome, in a tough way.\"\nII\nSnader's \"station\" proved to be a middle-sized, middle-cost home in a\ngood neighborhood. Lights glowed in the windows. Jeff could hear the\nwhisper of traffic on a boulevard a few blocks away. Through the warm\ndusk, he could dimly see the mountains on the horizon. All was peaceful.\nSnader unlocked the front door with a key which he drew from a fine\nmetal chain around his neck. He swept open the front door with a\nflourish and beamed at them, but Ann drew back.\n\"'Walk into my parlor, said the spider to the fly,'\" she murmured to\nJeff. \"This could be a gambling hell. Or a dope den.\"\n\"No matter what kind of clip joint, it can't clip us much,\" he said.\n\"There's only four bucks in my wallet. My guess is it's a 'temple' for\nsome daffy religious sect.\"\nThey went in. A fat man smiled at them from a desk in the hall. Snader\nsaid, \"Meet Peter Powers. Local agent of our bureau.\"\nThe man didn't get up, but nodded comfortably and waved them toward the\nnext room, after a glance at Snader's key.\nThe key opened this room's door, too. Its spring lock snapped shut\nafter them.\nThe room was like a doctor's waiting room, with easy chairs along the\nwalls. Its only peculiar aspects were a sign hanging from the middle\nof the ceiling and two movie screens\u2014or were they giant television\nscreens?\u2014occupying a whole wall at either end of the room.\nThe sign bore the number 701 in bright yellow on black. Beneath it, an\narrow pointed to the screen on the left with the word\nAnte\n, and to\nthe right with the word\nPost\n.\nJeff studied the big screens. On each, a picture was in motion. One\nappeared to be moving through a long corridor, lined with seats like\na railroad club car. The picture seemed to rush at them from the left\nwall. When he turned to the right, a similar endless chair-lined\ncorridor moved toward him from that direction.\n\"Somebody worked hard on this layout,\" he said to Snader. \"What's it\nfor?\"\n\"Time travel,\" said Snader. \"You like?\"\n\"Almost as good as Disneyland. These movies represent the stream of\ntime, I suppose?\"\nInstead of answering, Snader pointed to the screen. The picture showed\na group of people chatting in a fast-moving corridor. As it hurtled\ntoward them, Snader flipped his hand in a genial salute. Two people in\nthe picture waved back.\nAnn gasped. \"It was just as if they saw us.\"\n\"They did,\" Snader said. \"No movie. Time travelers. In fourth\ndimension. To you, they look like flat picture. To them, we look flat.\"\n\"What's he supposed to be?\" Jeff asked as the onrushing picture showed\nthem briefly a figure bound hand and foot, huddled in one of the\nchairs. He stared at them piteously for an instant before the picture\nsurged past.\nSnader showed his teeth. \"That was convict from my time. We have\ncriminals, like in your time. But we do not kill. We make them work.\nWhere he going? To end of line. To earliest year this time groove\nreach. About 600 A.D., your calendar. Authorities pick up when\nhe get there. Put him to work.\"\n\"What kind of work?\" Jeff asked.\n\"Building the groove further back.\"\n\"Sounds like interesting work.\"\nSnader chortled and slapped him on the back. \"Maybe you see it some\nday, but forget that now. You come with me. Little trip.\"\nJeff was perspiring. This was odder than he expected. Whatever the\nfakery, it was clever. His curiosity as a technician made him want to\nknow about it. He asked Snader, \"Where do you propose to go? And how?\"\nSnader said, \"Watch me. Then look at other wall.\"\nHe moved gracefully to the screen on the left wall, stepped into it and\ndisappeared. It was as if he had slid into opaque water.\nJeff and Ann blinked in mystification. Then they remembered his\ninstruction to watch the other screen. They turned. After a moment, in\nthe far distance down the long moving corridor, they could see a stocky\nfigure. The motion of the picture brought him nearer. In a few seconds,\nhe was recognizable as Snader\u2014and as the picture brought him forward,\nhe stepped down out of it and was with them again.\n\"Simple,\" Snader said. \"I rode to next station. Then crossed over. Took\nother carrier back here.\"\n\"Brother, that's the best trick I've seen in years,\" Jeff said. \"How\ndid you do it? Can I do it, too?\"\n\"I show you.\" Grinning like a wildcat, Snader linked his arms with Ann\nand Jeff, and walked them toward the screen. \"Now,\" he said. \"Step in.\"\nJeff submitted to Snader's pressure and stepped cautiously into the\nscreen. Amazingly, he felt no resistance at all, no sense of change or\nmotion. It was like stepping through a fog-bank into another room.\nIn fact, that was what they seemed to have done. They were in the\nchair-lined corridor. As Snader turned them around and seated them,\nthey faced another moving picture screen. It seemed to rush through a\ndark tunnel toward a lighted square in the far distance.\nThe square grew on the screen. Soon they saw it was another room like\nthe waiting room they had left, except that the number hanging from the\nceiling was 702. They seemed to glide through it. Then they were in the\ndark tunnel again.\nAnn was clutching Jeff's arm. He patted her hand. \"Fun, hey? Like Alice\nthrough the looking-glass.\"\n\"You really think we're going back in time?\" she whispered.\n\"Hardly! But we're seeing a million-dollar trick. I can't even begin to\nfigure it out yet.\"\nAnother lighted room grew out of the tunnel on the screen, and when\nthey had flickered through it, another and then another.\n\"Mr. Snader,\" Ann said unsteadily, \"how long\u2014how many years back are\nyou taking us?\"\nSnader was humming to himself. \"Six years. Station 725 fine place to\nstop.\"\nFor a little while, Jeff let himself think it might be true. \"Six years\nago, your dad was alive,\" he mused to Ann. \"If this should somehow be\nreal, we could see him again.\"\n\"We could if we went to our house. He lived with us then, remember?\nWould we see ourselves, six years younger? Or would\u2014\"\nSnader took Jeff's arm and pulled him to his feet. The screen was\nmoving through a room numbered 724.\n\"Soon now,\" Snader grunted happily. \"Then no more questions.\"\nHe took an arm of each as he had before. When the screen was filled by\na room with the number 725, he propelled them forward into it.\nAgain there was no sense of motion. They had simply stepped through a\nbright wall they could not feel. They found themselves in a replica of\nthe room they had left at 701. On the wall, a picture of the continuous\nclub-car corridor rolled toward them in a silent, endless stream.\n\"The same room,\" Ann said in disappointment. \"They just changed the\nnumber. We haven't been anywhere.\"\nSnader was fishing under his shirt for the key. He gave Ann a glance\nthat was almost a leer. Then he carefully unlocked the door.\nIn the hall, a motherly old lady bustled up, but Snader brushed past\nher. \"Official,\" he said, showing her the key. \"No lodging.\"\nHe unlocked the front door without another word and carefully shut it\nbehind them as Jeff and Ann followed him out of the house.\n\"Hey, where's my car?\" Jeff demanded, looking up and down the street.\nThe whole street looked different. Where he had parked his roadster,\nthere was now a long black limousine.\n\"Your car is in future,\" Snader said briskly. \"Where it belong. Get\nin.\" He opened the door of the limousine.\nJeff felt a little flame of excitement licking inside him. Something\nwas happening, he felt. Something exciting and dangerous.\n\"Snader,\" he said, \"if you're kidnaping us, you made a mistake. Nobody\non Earth will pay ransom for us.\"\nSnader seemed amused. \"You are foolish fellow. Silly talk about ransom.\nYou in different time now.\"\n\"When does this gag stop?\" Jeff demanded irritably. \"You haven't fooled\nus. We're still in 1957.\"\n\"You are? Look around.\"\nJeff looked at the street again. He secretly admitted to himself\nthat these were different trees and houses than he remembered. Even\nthe telephone poles and street lights seemed peculiar, vaguely\nforeign-looking. It must be an elaborate practical joke. Snader had\nprobably ushered them into one house, then through a tunnel and out\nanother house.\n\"Get in,\" Snader said curtly.\nJeff decided to go along with the hoax or whatever it was. He could\nsee no serious risk. He helped Ann into the back seat and sat beside\nher. Snader slammed the door and slid into the driver's seat. He\nstarted the engine with a roar and they rocketed away from the curb,\nnarrowly missing another car.\nJeff yelled, \"Easy, man! Look where you're going!\"\nSnader guffawed. \"Tonight, you look where you are going.\"\nAnn clung to Jeff. \"Did you notice the house we came out of?\"\n\"What about it?\"\n\"It looked as though they were afraid people might try to break in.\nThere were bars at the windows.\"\n\"Lots of houses are built that way, honey. Let's see, where are we?\" He\nglanced at house numbers. \"This is the 800 block. Remember that. And\nthe street\u2014\" He peered up at a sign as they whirled around a corner.\n\"The street is Green Thru-Way. I never heard of a street like that.\"\nIII\nThey were headed back toward what should have been the boulevard. The\ncar zoomed through a cloverleaf turn and up onto a broad freeway. Jeff\nknew for certain there was no freeway there in 1957\u2014nor in any earlier\nyear. But on the horizon, he could see the familiar dark bulk of the\nmountains. The whole line of moonlit ridges was the same as always.\n\"Ann,\" he said slowly, \"I think this is for real. Somehow I guess we\nescaped from 1957. We've been transported in time.\"\nShe squeezed his arm. \"If I'm dreaming, don't wake me! I was scared a\nminute ago. But now, oh, boy!\"\n\"Likewise. But I still wonder what Snader's angle is.\" He leaned\nforward and tapped the driver on his meaty shoulder. \"You brought us\ninto the future instead of the past, didn't you?\"\nIt was hard to know whether Snader was sleepy or just bored, but he\nshrugged briefly to show there was no reply coming. Then he yawned.\nJeff smiled tightly. \"I guess we'll find out in good time. Let's sit\nback and enjoy the strangest ride of our lives.\"\nAs the limousine swept along through the traffic, there were plenty\nof big signs for turn-offs, but none gave any hint where they were.\nThe names were unfamiliar. Even the language seemed grotesque. \"Rite\nChannel for Creepers,\" he read. \"Yaw for Torrey Rushway\" flared at him\nfrom a fork in the freeway.\n\"This can't be the future,\" Ann said. \"This limousine is almost new,\nbut it doesn't even have an automatic gear shift\u2014\"\nShe broke off as the car shot down a ramp off the freeway and pulled up\nin front of an apartment house. Just beyond was a big shopping center,\nablaze with lights and swarming with shoppers. Jeff did not recognize\nit, in spite of his familiarity with the city.\nSnader bounded out, pulled open the rear door and jerked his head in a\ncommanding gesture. But Jeff did not get out. He told Snader, \"Let's\nhave some answers before we go any further.\"\nSnader gave him a hard grin. \"You hear everything upstairs.\"\nThe building appeared harmless enough. Jeff looked thoughtfully at Ann.\nShe said, \"It's just an apartment house. We've come this far. Might as\nwell go in and see what's there.\"\nSnader led them in, up to the sixth floor in an elevator and along a\ncorridor with heavy carpets and soft gold lights. He knocked on a door.\nA tall, silver-haired, important-looking man opened it and greeted them\nheartily.\n\"Solid man, Greet!\" he exclaimed. \"You're a real scratcher! And is this\nour sharp?\" He gave Jeff a friendly but appraising look.\n\"Just what you order,\" Snader said proudly. \"His name\u2014Jeff Elliott.\nFine sharp. Best in his circuit. He brings his lifemate, too. Ann\nElliott.\"\nThe old man rubbed his smooth hands together. \"Prime! I wish joy,\" he\nsaid to Ann and Jeff. \"I'm Septo Kersey. Come in. Bullen's waiting.\"\nHe led them into a spacious drawing room with great windows looking out\non the lights of the city. There was a leather chair in a corner, and\nin it sat a heavy man with a grim mouth. He made no move, but grunted\na perfunctory \"Wish joy\" when Kersey introduced them. His cold eyes\nstudied Jeff while Kersey seated them in big chairs.\nSnader did not sit down, however. \"No need for me now,\" he said, and\nmoved toward the door with a mocking wave at Ann.\nBullen nodded. \"You get the rest of your pay when Elliott proves out.\"\n\"Here, wait a minute!\" Jeff called. But Snader was gone.\n\"Sit still,\" Bullen growled to Jeff. \"You understand radioptics?\"\nThe blood went to Jeff's head. \"My business is television, if that's\nwhat you mean. What's this about?\"\n\"Tell him, Kersey,\" the big man said, and stared out the window.\nKersey began, \"You understand, I think, that you have come back in\ntime. About six years back.\"\n\"That's a matter of opinion, but go on.\"\n\"I am general manager of Continental Radioptic Combine, owned by Mr.\nDumont Bullen.\" He nodded toward the big man. \"Chromatics have not\nyet been developed here in connection with radioptics. They are well\nunderstood in your time, are they not?\"\n\"What's chromatics? Color television?\"\n\"Exactly. You are an expert in\u2014ah\u2014colored television, I think.\"\nJeff nodded. \"So what?\"\nThe old man beamed at him. \"You are here to work for our company. You\nwill enable us to be first with chromatics in this time wave.\"\nJeff stood up. \"Don't tell me who I'll work for.\"\nBullen slapped a big fist on the arm of his chair. \"No fog about this!\nYou're bought and paid for, Elliott! You'll get a fair labor contract,\nbut you do what I say!\"\n\"Why, the man thinks he owns you.\" Ann laughed shakily.\n\"You'll find my barmen know their law,\" Bullen said. \"This isn't the\nway I like to recruit. But it was only way to get a man with your\nknowledge.\"\nKersey said politely, \"You are here illegally, with no immigrate\npermit or citizen file. Therefore you cannot get work. But Mr. Bullen\nhas taken an interest in your trouble. Through his influence, you can\nmake a living. We even set aside an apartment in this building for you\nto live in. You are really very luxe, do you see?\"\nJeff's legs felt weak. These highbinders seemed brutally confident. He\nwondered how he and Ann would find their way home through the strange\nstreets. But he put on a bold front.\n\"I don't believe your line about time travel and I don't plan to work\nfor you,\" he said. \"My wife and I are walking out right now. Try and\nstop us, legally or any other way.\"\nKersey's smooth old face turned hard. But, unexpectedly, Bullen\nchuckled deep in his throat. \"Good pop and bang. Like to see it. Go\non, walk out. You hang in trouble, call up here\u2014Butterfly 9, ask for\nBullen. Whole exchange us. I'll meet you here about eleven tomorrow\npre-noon.\"\n\"Don't hold your breath. Let's go, Ann.\"\nWhen they were on the sidewalk, Ann took a deep breath. \"We made it.\nFor a minute, I thought there'd be a brawl. Why did they let us go?\"\n\"No telling. Maybe they're harmless lunatics\u2014or practical jokers.\" He\nlooked over his shoulder as they walked down the street, but there was\nno sign of pursuit. \"It's a long time since supper.\"\nHer hand was cold in his and her face was white. To take her mind off\ntheir problem, he ambled toward the lighted shop windows.\n\"Look at that sign,\" he said, pointing to a poster over a display of\nneckties. \"'Sleek neck-sashes, only a Dick and a dollop!' How do they\nexpect to sell stuff with that crazy lingo?\"\n\"It's jive talk. They must cater to the high-school crowd.\" Ann\nglanced nervously at the strolling people around them. \"Jeff, where\nare we? This isn't any part of the city I've ever seen. It doesn't\neven look much like America.\" Her voice rose. \"The way the women are\ndressed\u2014it's not old-fashioned, just different.\"\n\"Baby, don't be scared. This is an adventure. Let's have fun.\" He\npressed her hand soothingly and pulled her toward a lunch counter.\nIf the haberdasher's sign was jive, the restaurant spoke the same\njargon. The signs on the wall and the bill of fare were baffling. Jeff\npondered the list of beef shingles, scorchers, smack sticks and fruit\nchills, until he noticed that a couple at the counter were eating what\nclearly were hamburgers\u2014though the \"buns\" looked more like tortillas.\nJeff jerked his thumb at them and told the waitress, \"Two, please.\"\nWhen the sandwiches arrived, they were ordinary enough. He and Ann ate\nin silence. A feeling of foreboding hung over them.\nWhen they finished, the clerk gave him a check marked 1/20. Jeff looked\nat it thoughtfully, shrugged and handed it to the cashier with two\ndollar bills.\nThe man at the desk glanced at them and laughed. \"Stage money, eh?\"\n\"No, that's good money,\" Jeff assured him with a rather hollow smile.\n\"They're just new bills, that's all.\"\nThe cashier picked one up and looked at it curiously. \"I'm afraid it's\nno good here,\" he said, and pushed it back.\nThe bottom dropped out of Jeff's stomach. \"What kind of money do you\nwant? This is all I have.\"\nThe cashier's smile faded. He caught the eye of a man in uniform on one\nof the stools. The uniform was dark green, but the man acted like a\npoliceman. He loomed up beside Jeff.\n\"What's the rasper?\" he demanded. Other customers, waiting to pay their\nchecks, eyed Jeff curiously.\n\"I guess I'm in trouble,\" Jeff told him. \"I'm a stranger here and I got\nsomething to eat under the impression that my money was legal tender.\nDo you know where I can exchange it?\"\nThe officer picked up the dollar bill and fingered it with evident\ninterest. He turned it over and studied the printing. \"United States of\nAmerica,\" he read aloud. \"What are those?\"\n\"It's the name of the country I come from,\" Jeff said carefully.\n\"I\u2014uh\u2014got on the wrong train, apparently, and must have come further\nthan I thought. What's the name of this place?\"\n\"This is Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Say, you\nmust come from an umpty remote part of the world if you don't know\nabout this country.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Where'd you learn to speak\nFederal, if you come from so far?\"\nJeff said helplessly, \"I can't explain, if you don't know about the\nUnited States. Listen, can you take me to a bank, or some place where\nthey know about foreign exchange?\"\nThe policeman scowled. \"How'd you get into this country, anyway? You\ngot immigrate clearance?\"\nAn angry muttering started among the bystanders.\nThe policeman made up his mind. \"You come with me.\"\nAt the police station, Jeff put his elbows dejectedly on the high\ncounter while the policeman talked to an officer in charge. Some men\nwhom Jeff took for reporters got up from a table and eased over to\nlisten.\n\"I don't know whether to charge them with fakemake, bumsy, peekage or\nlunate,\" the policeman said as he finished.\nHis superior gave Jeff a long puzzled stare.\nJeff sighed. \"I know it sounds impossible, but a man brought me in\nsomething he claimed was a time traveler. You speak the same language I\ndo\u2014more or less\u2014but everything else is kind of unfamiliar. I belong\nin the United States, a country in North America. I can't believe I'm\nso far in the future that the United States has been forgotten.\"\nThere ensued a long, confused, inconclusive interrogation.\nThe man behind the desk asked questions which seemed stupid to Jeff and\ngot answers which probably seemed stupid to him.\nThe reporters quizzed Jeff gleefully. \"Come out, what are you\nadvertising?\" they kept asking. \"Who got you up to this?\"\nThe police puzzled over his driver's license and the other cards in his\nwallet. They asked repeatedly about the lack of a \"Work License,\" which\nJeff took to be some sort of union card. Evidently there was grave\ndoubt that he had any legal right to be in the country.\nIn the end, Jeff and Ann were locked in separate cells for the night.\nJeff groaned and pounded the bars as he thought of his wife, imprisoned\nand alone in a smelly jail. After hours of pacing the cell, he lay down\nin the cot and reached automatically for his silver pillbox. Then he\nhesitated.\nIn past weeks, his insomnia had grown worse and worse, so that lately\nhe had begun taking stronger pills. After a longing glance at the\nbig red and yellow capsules, he put the box away. Whatever tomorrow\nbrought, it wouldn't find him slow and drowsy.\nIV\nHe passed a wakeful night. In the early morning, he looked up to see a\nlittle man with a briefcase at his cell door.\n\"Wish joy, Mr. Elliott,\" the man said coolly. \"I am one of Mr. Bullen's\nbarmen. You know, represent at law? He sent me to arrange your release,\nif you are ready to be reasonable.\"\nJeff lay there and put his hands behind his head. \"I doubt if I'm\nready. I'm comfortable here. By the way, how did you know where I was?\"\n\"No problem. When we read in this morning's newspapers about a man\nclaiming to be a time traveler, we knew.\"\n\"All right. Now start explaining. Until I understand where I am, Bullen\nisn't getting me out of here.\"\nThe lawyer smiled and sat down. \"Mr. Kersey told you yesterday\u2014you've\ngone back six years. But you'll need some mental gymnastics to\nunderstand. Time is a dimension, not a stream of events like a movie\nfilm. A film never changes. Space does\u2014and time does. For example, if\na movie showed a burning house at Sixth and Main, would you expect to\nfind a house burning whenever you returned to that corner?\"\n\"You mean to say that if I went back to 1865, I wouldn't find the Civil\nWar was over and Lincoln had been assassinated?\"\n\"If you go back to the time you call 1865\u2014which is most easily\ndone\u2014you will find that the people there know nothing of a Lincoln or\nthat war.\"\nJeff looked blank. \"What are they doing then?\"\nThe little man spread his hands. \"What are the people doing now at\nSixth and Main? Certainly not the same things they were doing the day\nof the fire. We're talking about a dimension, not an event. Don't you\ngrasp the difference between the two?\"\n\"Nope. To me, 1865 means the end of the Civil War. How else can you\nspeak of a point in time except by the events that happened then?\"\n\"Well, if you go to a place in three-dimensional space\u2014say, a lake\nin the mountains\u2014how do you identify that place? By looking for\nlandmarks. It doesn't matter that an eagle is soaring over a mountain\npeak. That's only an event. The peak is the landmark. You follow me?\"\n\"So far. Keep talking.\"\n", "summary": "The story begins with Jeff and Ann discussing how they want to go back in time to see their friend Mr. Burns. Jeff is skeptical of the possibility of time travel, but Ann is convinced that it can happen. They go to the police station, where they meet Officer Kersey. He tells them that they can't go back to the past, but they can go forward to the future. Jeff asks the officer if he has any idea where they are going, but the officer says he doesn't know. They decide to go to a movie theater to see a movie about Mr. Burnside, and when they enter the theater, they are greeted by a huge crowd of people. When they leave, they head to the elevators to go up to the sixth floor. On the way up, they run into a police officer, who asks them to leave. They do, but when they get to the top of the stairs, they see a moving picture screen. They realize that the moving picture is a picture of their friend, and they realize that they have been transported to a different dimension.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}

It's the third on the subject this week. It refers to the\nmatter of sponsorship of Youth groups\u2014\"\n\"Some youths,\" Retief said. \"Average age, seventy-five.\"\n\"The Fustians are a long-lived people,\" Magnan snapped. \"These matters\nare relative. At seventy-five, a male Fustian is at a trying age\u2014\"\n\"That's right. He'll try anything\u2014in the hope it will maim somebody.\"\n\"Precisely the problem,\" Magnan said. \"But the Youth Movement is\nthe important news in today's political situation here on Fust. And\nsponsorship of Youth groups is a shrewd stroke on the part of the\nTerrestrial Embassy. At my suggestion, well nigh every member of the\nmission has leaped at the opportunity to score a few p\u2014that is, cement\nrelations with this emergent power group\u2014the leaders of the future.\nYou, Retief, as Councillor, are the outstanding exception.\"\n\"I'm not convinced these hoodlums need my help in organizing their\nrumbles,\" Retief said. \"Now, if you have a proposal for a pest control\ngroup\u2014\"\n\"To the Fustians this is no jesting matter,\" Magnan cut in. \"This\ngroup\u2014\" he glanced at the paper\u2014\"known as the Sexual, Cultural, and\nAthletic Recreational Society, or SCARS for short, has been awaiting\nsponsorship for a matter of weeks now.\"\n\"Meaning they want someone to buy them a clubhouse, uniforms, equipment\nand anything else they need to complete their sexual, cultural and\nathletic development,\" Retief said.\n\"If we don't act promptly,\" Magnan said, \"the Groaci Embassy may well\nanticipate us. They're very active here.\"\n\"That's an idea,\" said Retief. \"Let 'em. After awhile they'll go broke\ninstead of us.\"\n\"Nonsense. The group requires a sponsor. I can't actually order you to\nstep forward. However....\" Magnan let the sentence hang in the air.\nRetief raised one eyebrow.\n\"For a minute there,\" he said, \"I thought you were going to make a\npositive statement.\"\nMagnan leaned back, lacing his fingers over his stomach. \"I don't think\nyou'll find a diplomat of my experience doing anything so naive,\" he\nsaid.\n\"I like the adult Fustians,\" said Retief. \"Too bad they have to lug\nhalf a ton of horn around on their backs. I wonder if surgery would\nhelp.\"\n\"Great heavens, Retief,\" Magnan sputtered. \"I'm amazed that even you\nwould bring up a matter of such delicacy. A race's unfortunate physical\ncharacteristics are hardly a fit matter for Terrestrial curiosity.\"\n\"Well, of course your experience of the Fustian mentality is greater\nthan mine. I've only been here a month. But it's been my experience,\nMr. Ambassador, that few races are above improving on nature. Otherwise\nyou, for example, would be tripping over your beard.\"\nMagnan shuddered. \"Please\u2014never mention the idea to a Fustian.\"\nRetief stood. \"My own program for the day includes going over to the\ndockyards. There are some features of this new passenger liner the\nFustians are putting together that I want to look into. With your\npermission, Mr. Ambassador...?\"\nMagnan snorted. \"Your pre-occupation with the trivial disturbs me,\nRetief. More interest in substantive matters\u2014such as working with\nYouth groups\u2014would create a far better impression.\"\n\"Before getting too involved with these groups, it might be a good idea\nto find out a little more about them,\" said Retief. \"Who organizes\nthem? There are three strong political parties here on Fust. What's the\nalignment of this SCARS organization?\"\n\"You forget, these are merely teenagers, so to speak,\" Magnan said.\n\"Politics mean nothing to them ... yet.\"\n\"Then there are the Groaci. Why their passionate interest in a\ntwo-horse world like Fust? Normally they're concerned with nothing but\nbusiness. But what has Fust got that they could use?\"\n\"You may rule out the commercial aspect in this instance,\" said Magnan.\n\"Fust possesses a vigorous steel-age manufacturing economy. The Groaci\nare barely ahead of them.\"\n\"Barely,\" said Retief. \"Just over the line into crude atomics ... like\nfission bombs.\"\nMagnan shook his head, turned back to his papers. \"What market exists\nfor such devices on a world at peace? I suggest you address your\nattention to the less spectacular but more rewarding work of studying\nthe social patterns of the local youth.\"\n\"I've studied them,\" said Retief. \"And before I meet any of the local\nyouth socially I want to get myself a good blackjack.\"\nII\nRetief left the sprawling bungalow-type building that housed the\nchancery of the Terrestrial Embassy, swung aboard a passing flat-car\nand leaned back against the wooden guard rail as the heavy vehicle\ntrundled through the city toward the looming gantries of the shipyards.\nIt was a cool morning. A light breeze carried the fishy odor of Fusty\ndwellings across the broad cobbled avenue. A few mature Fustians\nlumbered heavily along in the shade of the low buildings, audibly\nwheezing under the burden of their immense carapaces. Among them,\nshell-less youths trotted briskly on scaly stub legs. The driver of the\nflat-car, a labor-caste Fustian with his guild colors emblazoned on his\nback, heaved at the tiller, swung the unwieldy conveyance through the\nshipyard gates, creaked to a halt.\n\"Thus I come to the shipyard with frightful speed,\" he said in Fustian.\n\"Well I know the way of the naked-backs, who move always in haste.\"\nRetief climbed down, handed him a coin. \"You should take up\nprofessional racing,\" he said. \"Daredevil.\"\nHe crossed the littered yard and tapped at the door of a rambling shed.\nBoards creaked inside. Then the door swung back.\nA gnarled ancient with tarnished facial scales and a weathered carapace\npeered out at Retief.\n\"Long-may-you-sleep,\" said Retief. \"I'd like to take a look around, if\nyou don't mind. I understand you're laying the bedplate for your new\nliner today.\"\n\"May-you-dream-of-the-deeps,\" the old fellow mumbled. He waved a stumpy\narm toward a group of shell-less Fustians standing by a massive hoist.\n\"The youths know more of bedplates than do I, who but tend the place of\npapers.\"\n\"I know how you feel, old-timer,\" said Retief. \"That sounds like the\nstory of my life. Among your papers do you have a set of plans for the\nvessel? I understand it's to be a passenger liner.\"\nThe oldster nodded. He shuffled to a drawing file, rummaged, pulled out\na sheaf of curled prints and spread them on the table. Retief stood\nsilently, running a finger over the uppermost drawing, tracing lines....\n\"What does the naked-back here?\" barked a deep voice behind Retief. He\nturned. A heavy-faced Fustian youth, wrapped in a mantle, stood at the\nopen door. Beady yellow eyes set among fine scales bored into Retief.\n\"I came to take a look at your new liner,\" said Retief.\n\"We need no prying foreigners here,\" the youth snapped. His eye fell on\nthe drawings. He hissed in sudden anger.\n\"Doddering hulk!\" he snapped at the ancient. \"May you toss in\nnightmares! Put by the plans!\"\n\"My mistake,\" Retief said. \"I didn't know this was a secret project.\"\nThe youth hesitated. \"It is not a secret project,\" he muttered. \"Why\nshould it be secret?\"\n\"You tell me.\"\nThe youth worked his jaws and rocked his head from side to side in the\nFusty gesture of uncertainty. \"There is nothing to conceal,\" he said.\n\"We merely construct a passenger liner.\"\n\"Then you don't mind if I look over the drawings,\" said Retief. \"Who\nknows? Maybe some day I'll want to reserve a suite for the trip out.\"\nThe youth turned and disappeared. Retief grinned at the oldster. \"Went\nfor his big brother, I guess,\" he said. \"I have a feeling I won't get\nto study these in peace here. Mind if I copy them?\"\n\"Willingly, light-footed one,\" said the old Fustian. \"And mine is the\nshame for the discourtesy of youth.\"\nRetief took out a tiny camera, flipped a copying lens in place, leafed\nthrough the drawings, clicking the shutter.\n\"A plague on these youths,\" said the oldster, \"who grow more virulent\nday by day.\"\n\"Why don't you elders clamp down?\"\n\"Agile are they and we are slow of foot. And this unrest is new.\nUnknown in my youth was such insolence.\"\n\"The police\u2014\"\n\"Bah!\" the ancient rumbled. \"None have we worthy of the name, nor have\nwe needed ought ere now.\"\n\"What's behind it?\"\n\"They have found leaders. The spiv, Slock, is one. And I fear they plot\nmischief.\" He pointed to the window. \"They come, and a Soft One with\nthem.\"\nRetief pocketed the camera, glanced out the window. A pale-featured\nGroaci with an ornately decorated crest stood with the youths, who eyed\nthe hut, then started toward it.\n\"That's the military attache of the Groaci Embassy,\" Retief said. \"I\nwonder what he and the boys are cooking up together?\"\n\"Naught that augurs well for the dignity of Fust,\" the oldster rumbled.\n\"Flee, agile one, while I engage their attentions.\"\n\"I was just leaving,\" Retief said. \"Which way out?\"\n\"The rear door,\" the Fustian gestured with a stubby member. \"Rest well,\nstranger on these shores.\" He moved to the entrance.\n\"Same to you, pop,\" said Retief. \"And thanks.\"\nHe eased through the narrow back entrance, waited until voices were\nraised at the front of the shed, then strolled off toward the gate.\nThe second dark of the third cycle was lightening when Retief left the\nEmbassy technical library and crossed the corridor to his office. He\nflipped on a light. A note was tucked under a paperweight:\n\"Retief\u2014I shall expect your attendance at the IAS dinner at first\ndark of the fourth cycle. There will be a brief but, I hope, impressive\nSponsorship ceremony for the SCARS group, with full press coverage,\narrangements for which I have managed to complete in spite of your\nintransigence.\"\nRetief snorted and glanced at his watch. Less than three hours. Just\ntime to creep home by flat-car, dress in ceremonial uniform and creep\nback.\nOutside he flagged a lumbering bus. He stationed himself in a corner\nand watched the yellow sun, Beta, rise rapidly above the low skyline.\nThe nearby sea was at high tide now, under the pull of the major sun\nand the three moons, and the stiff breeze carried a mist of salt spray.\nRetief turned up his collar against the dampness. In half an hour he\nwould be perspiring under the vertical rays of a third-noon sun, but\nthe thought failed to keep the chill off.\nTwo Youths clambered up on the platform, moving purposefully toward\nRetief. He moved off the rail, watching them, weight balanced.\n\"That's close enough, kids,\" he said. \"Plenty of room on this scow. No\nneed to crowd up.\"\n\"There are certain films,\" the lead Fustian muttered. His voice was\nunusually deep for a Youth. He was wrapped in a heavy cloak and moved\nawkwardly. His adolescence was nearly at an end, Retief guessed.\n\"I told you once,\" said Retief. \"Don't crowd me.\"\nThe two stepped close, slit mouths snapping in anger. Retief put out a\nfoot, hooked it behind the scaly leg of the overaged juvenile and threw\nhis weight against the cloaked chest. The clumsy Fustian tottered, fell\nheavily. Retief was past him and off the flat-car before the other\nYouth had completed his vain lunge toward the spot Retief had occupied.\nThe Terrestrial waved cheerfully at the pair, hopped aboard another\nvehicle, watched his would-be assailants lumber down from their car,\ntiny heads twisted to follow his retreating figure.\nSo they wanted the film? Retief reflected, thumbing a cigar alight.\nThey were a little late. He had already filed it in the Embassy vault,\nafter running a copy for the reference files.\nAnd a comparison of the drawings with those of the obsolete Mark XXXV\nbattle cruiser used two hundred years earlier by the Concordiat Naval\nArm showed them to be almost identical, gun emplacements and all. The\nterm \"obsolete\" was a relative one. A ship which had been outmoded in\nthe armories of the Galactic Powers could still be king of the walk in\nthe Eastern Arm.\nBut how had these two known of the film? There had been no one present\nbut himself and the old-timer\u2014and he was willing to bet the elderly\nFustian hadn't told them anything.\nAt least not willingly....\nRetief frowned, dropped the cigar over the side, waited until the\nflat-car negotiated a mud-wallow, then swung down and headed for the\nshipyard.\nThe door, hinges torn loose, had been propped loosely back in position.\nRetief looked around at the battered interior of the shed. The old\nfellow had put up a struggle.\nThere were deep drag-marks in the dust behind the building. Retief\nfollowed them across the yard. They disappeared under the steel door of\na warehouse.\nRetief glanced around. Now, at the mid-hour of the fourth cycle, the\nworkmen were heaped along the edge of the refreshment pond, deep in\ntheir siesta. He took a multi-bladed tool from a pocket, tried various\nfittings in the lock. It snicked open.\nHe eased the door aside far enough to enter.\nHeaped bales loomed before him. Snapping on the tiny lamp in the handle\nof the combination tool, Retief looked over the pile. One stack seemed\nout of alignment ... and the dust had been scraped from the floor\nbefore it. He pocketed the light, climbed up on the bales, looked over\ninto a nest made by stacking the bundles around a clear spot. The aged\nFustian lay in it, on his back, a heavy sack tied over his head.\nRetief dropped down inside the ring of bales, sawed at the tough twine\nand pulled the sack free.\n\"It's me, old fellow,\" Retief said. \"The nosy stranger. Sorry I got you\ninto this.\"\nThe oldster threshed his gnarled legs. He rocked slightly and fell\nback. \"A curse on the cradle that rocked their infant slumbers,\" he\nrumbled. \"But place me back on my feet and I hunt down the youth,\nSlock, though he flee to the bottommost muck of the Sea of Torments.\"\n\"How am I going to get you out of here? Maybe I'd better get some help.\"\n\"Nay. The perfidious Youths abound here,\" said the old Fustian. \"It\nwould be your life.\"\n\"I doubt if they'd go that far.\"\n\"Would they not?\" The Fustian stretched his neck. \"Cast your light\nhere. But for the toughness of my hide....\"\nRetief put the beam of the light on the leathery neck. A great smear of\nthick purplish blood welled from a ragged cut. The oldster chuckled, a\nsound like a seal coughing.\n\"Traitor, they called me. For long they sawed at me\u2014in vain. Then\nthey trussed me and dumped me here. They think to return with weapons\nto complete the task.\"\n\"Weapons? I thought it was illegal!\"\n\"Their evil genius, the Soft One,\" said the Fustian. \"He would provide\nfuel to the Devil himself.\"\n\"The Groaci again,\" said Retief. \"I wonder what their angle is.\"\n\"And I must confess, I told them of you, ere I knew their full\nintentions. Much can I tell you of their doings. But first, I pray, the\nblock and tackle.\"\nRetief found the hoist where the Fustian directed him, maneuvered it\ninto position, hooked onto the edge of the carapace and hauled away.\nThe immense Fustian rose slowly, teetered ... then flopped on his chest.\nSlowly he got to his feet.\n\"My name is Whonk, fleet one,\" he said. \"My cows are yours.\"\n\"Thanks. I'm Retief. I'd like to meet the girls some time. But right\nnow, let's get out of here.\"\nWhonk leaned his bulk against the ponderous stacks of baled kelp,\nbulldozed them aside. \"Slow am I to anger,\" he said, \"but implacable in\nmy wrath. Slock, beware!\"\n\"Hold it,\" said Retief suddenly. He sniffed. \"What's that odor?\" He\nflashed the light around, played it over a dry stain on the floor. He\nknelt, sniffed at the spot.\n\"What kind of cargo was stacked here, Whonk? And where is it now?\"\nWhonk considered. \"There were drums,\" he said. \"Four of them, quite\nsmall, painted an evil green, the property of the Soft Ones, the\nGroaci. They lay here a day and a night. At full dark of the first\nperiod they came with stevedores and loaded them aboard the barge\nMoss\nRock\n.\"\n\"The VIP boat. Who's scheduled to use it?\"\n\"I know not. But what matters this? Let us discuss cargo movements\nafter I have settled a score with certain Youths.\"\n\"We'd better follow this up first, Whonk. There's only one substance I\nknow of that's transported in drums and smells like that blot on the\nfloor. That's titanite: the hottest explosive this side of a uranium\npile.\"\nIII\nBeta was setting as Retief, Whonk puffing at his heels, came up to the\nsentry box beside the gangway leading to the plush interior of the\nofficial luxury space barge\nMoss Rock\n.\n\"A sign of the times,\" said Whonk, glancing inside the empty shelter.\n\"A guard should stand here, but I see him not. Doubtless he crept away\nto sleep.\"\n\"Let's go aboard and take a look around.\"\nThey entered the ship. Soft lights glowed in utter silence. A rough box\nstood on the floor, rollers and pry-bars beside it\u2014a discordant note\nin the muted luxury of the setting. Whonk rummaged in it.\n\"Curious,\" he said. \"What means this?\" He held up a stained cloak of\norange and green, a metal bracelet, papers.\n\"Orange and green,\" mused Relief. \"Whose colors are those?\"\n\"I know not.\" Whonk glanced at the arm-band. \"But this is lettered.\" He\npassed the metal band to Retief.\n\"SCARS,\" Retief read. He looked at Whonk. \"It seems to me I've heard\nthe name before,\" he murmured. \"Let's get back to the Embassy\u2014fast.\"\nBack on the ramp Retief heard a sound ... and turned in time to duck\nthe charge of a hulking Fustian youth who thundered past him and\nfetched up against the broad chest of Whonk, who locked him in a warm\nembrace.\n\"Nice catch, Whonk. Where'd he sneak out of?\"\n\"The lout hid there by the storage bin,\" rumbled Whonk. The captive\nyouth thumped fists and toes fruitlessly against the oldster's carapace.\n\"Hang onto him,\" said Retief. \"He looks like the biting kind.\"\n\"No fear. Clumsy I am, yet not without strength.\"\n\"Ask him where the titanite is tucked away.\"\n\"Speak, witless grub,\" growled Whonk, \"lest I tweak you in twain.\"\nThe youth gurgled.\n\"Better let up before you make a mess of him,\" said Retief. Whonk\nlifted the Youth clear of the floor, then flung him down with a thump\nthat made the ground quiver. The younger Fustian glared up at the\nelder, mouth snapping.\n\"This one was among those who trussed me and hid me away for the\nkilling,\" said Whonk. \"In his repentance he will tell all to his elder.\"\n\"That's the same young squirt that tried to strike up an acquaintance\nwith me on the bus,\" Retief said. \"He gets around.\"\nThe youth scrambled to hands and knees, scuttled for freedom. Retief\nplanted a foot on his dragging cloak; it ripped free. He stared at the\nbare back of the Fustian\u2014\n\"By the Great Egg!\" Whonk exclaimed, tripping the refugee as he tried\nto rise. \"This is no Youth! His carapace has been taken from him!\"\nRetief looked at the scarred back. \"I thought he looked a little old.\nBut I thought\u2014\"\n\"This is not possible,\" Whonk said wonderingly. \"The great nerve trunks\nare deeply involved. Not even the cleverest surgeon could excise the\ncarapace and leave the patient living.\"\n\"It looks like somebody did the trick. But let's take this boy with us\nand get out of here. His folks may come home.\"\n\"Too late,\" said Whonk. Retief turned.\nThree youths came from behind the sheds.\n\"Well,\" Retief said. \"It looks like the SCARS are out in force tonight.\nWhere's your pal?\" he said to the advancing trio. \"The sticky little\nbird with the eye-stalks? Back at his Embassy, leaving you suckers\nholding the bag, I'll bet.\"\n\"Shelter behind me, Retief,\" said Whonk.\n\"Go get 'em, old-timer.\" Retief stooped, picked up one of the pry-bars.\n\"I'll jump around and distract them.\"\nWhonk let out a whistling roar and charged for the immature Fustians.\nThey fanned out ... and one tripped, sprawled on his face. Retief\nwhirled the metal bar he had thrust between the Fustian's legs, slammed\nit against the skull of another, who shook his head, turned on\nRetief ... and bounced off the steel hull of the\nMoss Rock\nas Whonk\ntook him in full charge.\nRetief used the bar on another head. His third blow laid the Fustian\non the pavement, oozing purple. The other two club members departed\nhastily, seriously dented but still mobile.\nRetief leaned on his club, breathing hard. \"Tough heads these kids\nhave got. I'm tempted to chase those two lads down, but I've got\nanother errand to run. I don't know who the Groaci intended to blast,\nbut I have a sneaking suspicion somebody of importance was scheduled\nfor a boat ride in the next few hours. And three drums of titanite is\nenough to vaporize this tub and everyone aboard her.\"\n\"The plot is foiled,\" said Whonk. \"But what reason did they have?\"\n\"The Groaci are behind it. I have an idea the SCARS didn't know about\nthis gambit.\"\n\"Which of these is the leader?\" asked Whonk. He prodded a fallen Youth\nwith a horny toe. \"Arise, dreaming one.\"\n\"Never mind him, Whonk. We'll tie these two up and leave them here. I\nknow where to find the boss.\"\nA stolid crowd filled the low-ceilinged banquet hall. Retief scanned\nthe tables for the pale blobs of Terrestrial faces, dwarfed by the\ngiant armored bodies of the Fustians. Across the room Magnan fluttered\na hand. Retief headed toward him. A low-pitched vibration filled the\nair: the rumble of subsonic Fustian music.\nRetief slid into his place beside Magnan. \"Sorry to be late, Mr.\nAmbassador.\"\n\"I'm honored that you chose to appear at all,\" said Magnan coldly. He\nturned back to the Fustian on his left.\n\"Ah, yes, Mr. Minister,\" he said. \"Charming, most charming. So joyous.\"\nThe Fustian looked at him, beady-eyed. \"It is the\nLament of\nHatching\n,\" he said; \"our National Dirge.\"\n\"Oh,\" said Magnan. \"How interesting. Such a pleasing balance of\ninstruments\u2014\"\n\"It is a droon solo,\" said the Fustian, eyeing the Terrestrial\nAmbassador suspiciously.\n\"Why don't you just admit you can't hear it,\" Retief whispered loudly.\n\"And if I may interrupt a moment\u2014\"\nMagnan cleared his throat. \"Now that our Mr. Retief has arrived,\nperhaps we could rush right along to the Sponsorship ceremonies.\"\n\"This group,\" said Retief, leaning across Magnan, \"the SCARS. How much\ndo you know about them, Mr. Minister?\"\n\"Nothing at all,\" the huge Fustian elder rumbled. \"For my taste, all\nYouths should be kept penned with the livestock until they grow a\ncarapace to tame their irresponsibility.\"\n\"We mustn't lose sight of the importance of channeling youthful\nenergies,\" said Magnan.\n\"Labor gangs,\" said the minister. \"In my youth we were indentured to\nthe dredge-masters. I myself drew a muck sledge.\"\n\"But in these modern times,\" put in Magnan, \"surely it's incumbent on\nus to make happy these golden hours.\"\nThe minister snorted. \"Last week I had a golden hour. They set upon me\nand pelted me with overripe stench-fruit.\"\n\"But this was merely a manifestation of normal youthful frustrations,\"\ncried Magnan. \"Their essential tenderness\u2014\"\n\"You'd not find a tender spot on that lout yonder,\" the minister\nsaid, pointing with a fork at a newly arrived Youth, \"if you drilled\nboreholes and blasted.\"\n\"Why, that's our guest of honor,\" said Magnan, \"a fine young fellow!\nSlop I believe his name is.\"\n\"Slock,\" said Retief. \"Eight feet of armor-plated orneriness. And\u2014\"\nMagnan rose and tapped on his glass. The Fustians winced at the, to\nthem, supersonic vibrations. They looked at each other muttering.\nMagnan tapped louder. The Minister drew in his head, eyes closed. Some\nof the Fustians rose, tottered for the doors; the noise level rose.\nMagnan redoubled his efforts. The glass broke with a clatter and green\nwine gushed on the tablecloth.\n\"What in the name of the Great Egg!\" the Minister muttered. He blinked,\nbreathing deeply.\n\"Oh, forgive me,\" blurted Magnan, dabbing at the wine.\n\"Too bad the glass gave out,\" said Retief. \"In another minute you'd\nhave cleared the hall. And then maybe I could have gotten a word in\nsideways. There's a matter you should know about\u2014\"\n\"Your attention, please,\" Magnan said, rising. \"I see that our fine\nyoung guest has arrived, and I hope that the remainder of his committee\nwill be along in a moment. It is my pleasure to announce that our Mr.\nRetief has had the good fortune to win out in the keen bidding for the\npleasure of sponsoring this lovely group.\"\nRetief tugged at Magnan's sleeve. \"Don't introduce me yet,\" he said. \"I\nwant to appear suddenly. More dramatic, you know.\"\n\"Well,\" murmured Magnan, glancing down at Retief, \"I'm gratified to\nsee you entering into the spirit of the event at last.\" He turned his\nattention back to the assembled guests. \"If our honored guest will join\nme on the rostrum...?\" he said. \"The gentlemen of the press may want to\ncatch a few shots of the presentation.\"\nMagnan stepped up on the low platform at the center of the wide room,\ntook his place beside the robed Fustian youth and beamed at the cameras.\n\"How gratifying it is to take this opportunity to express once more the\ngreat pleasure we have in sponsoring SCARS,\" he said, talking slowly\nfor the benefit of the scribbling reporters. \"We'd like to think that\nin our modest way we're to be a part of all that the SCARS achieve\nduring the years ahead.\"\nMagnan paused as a huge Fustian elder heaved his bulk up the two low\nsteps to the rostrum, approached the guest of honor. He watched as the\nnewcomer paused behind Slock, who did not see the new arrival.\nRetief pushed through the crowd, stepped up to face the Fustian youth.\nSlock stared at him, drew back.\n\"You know me, Slock,\" said Retief loudly. \"An old fellow named Whonk\ntold you about me, just before you tried to saw his head off, remember?\nIt was when I came out to take a look at that battle cruiser you're\nbuilding.\"\nIV\nWith a bellow Slock reached for Retief\u2014and choked off in mid-cry as\nthe Fustian elder, Whonk, pinioned him from behind, lifting him clear\nof the floor.\n\"Glad you reporters happened along,\" said Retief to the gaping newsmen.\n\"Slock here had a deal with a sharp operator from the Groaci Embassy.\nThe Groaci were to supply the necessary hardware and Slock, as foreman\nat the shipyards, was to see that everything was properly installed.\nThe next step, I assume, would have been a local take-over, followed\nby a little interplanetary war on Flamenco or one of the other nearby\nworlds ... for which the Groaci would be glad to supply plenty of ammo.\"\nMagnan found his tongue. \"Are you mad, Retief?\" he screeched. \"This\ngroup was vouched for by the Ministry of Youth!\"\n\"The Ministry's overdue for a purge,\" snapped Retief. He turned back\nto Slock. \"I wonder if you were in on the little diversion that was\nplanned for today. When the\nMoss Rock\nblew, a variety of clues were\nto be planted where they'd be easy to find ... with SCARS written all\nover them. The Groaci would thus have neatly laid the whole affair\nsquarely at the door of the Terrestrial Embassy ... whose sponsorship\nof the SCARS had received plenty of publicity.\"\n\"The\nMoss Rock\n?\" said Magnan. \"But that was\u2014Retief! This is idiotic.\nSlock himself was scheduled to go on a cruise tomorrow!\"\nSlock roared suddenly, twisting violently. Whonk teetered, his grip\nloosened ... and Slock pulled free and was off the platform, butting\nhis way through the milling oldsters on the dining room floor. Magnan\nwatched, open-mouthed.\n\"The Groaci were playing a double game, as usual,\" Retief said. \"They\nintended to dispose of this fellow Slock, once he'd served their\npurpose.\"\n\"Well, don't stand there,\" yelped Magnan over the uproar. \"If Slock is\nthe ring-leader of a delinquent gang...!\" He moved to give chase.\nRetief grabbed his arm. \"Don't jump down there! You'd have as much\nchance of getting through as a jack-rabbit through a threshing contest.\"\nTen minutes later the crowd had thinned slightly. \"We can get through\nnow,\" Whonk called. \"This way.\" He lowered himself to the floor, bulled\nthrough to the exit. Flashbulbs popped. Retief and Magnan followed in\nWhonk's wake.\nIn the lounge Retief grabbed the phone, waited for the operator, gave a\ncode letter. No reply. He tried another.\n\"No good,\" he said after a full minute had passed. \"Wonder what's\nloose?\" He slammed the phone back in its niche. \"Let's grab a cab.\"\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nAIDE MEMOIRE\nBY KEITH LAUMER\nThe Fustians looked like turtles\u2014but\nthey could move fast when they chose!\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nWorlds of If Science Fiction, July 1962.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nAcross the table from Retief, Ambassador Magnan rustled a stiff sheet\nof parchment and looked grave.\n\"This aide memoire,\" he said, \"was just handed to me by the Cultural\nAttache. It's the third on the subject this week. It refers to the\nmatter of sponsorship of Youth groups\u2014\"\n\"Some youths,\" Retief said. \"Average age, seventy-five.\"\n\"The Fustians are a long-lived people,\" Magnan snapped. \"These matters\nare relative. At seventy-five, a male Fustian is at a trying age\u2014\"\n\"That's right. He'll try anything\u2014in the hope it will maim somebody.\"\n\"Precisely the problem,\" Magnan said. \"But the Youth Movement is\nthe important news in today's political situation here on Fust. And\nsponsorship of Youth groups is a shrewd stroke on the part of the\nTerrestrial Embassy. At my suggestion, well nigh every member of the\nmission has leaped at the opportunity to score a few p\u2014that is, cement\nrelations with this emergent power group\u2014the leaders of the future.\nYou, Retief, as Councillor, are the outstanding exception.\"\n\"I'm not convinced these hoodlums need my help in organizing their\nrumbles,\" Retief said. \"Now, if you have a proposal for a pest control\ngroup\u2014\"\n\"To the Fustians this is no jesting matter,\" Magnan cut in. \"This\ngroup\u2014\" he glanced at the paper\u2014\"known as the Sexual, Cultural, and\nAthletic Recreational Society, or SCARS for short, has been awaiting\nsponsorship for a matter of weeks now.\"\n\"Meaning they want someone to buy them a clubhouse, uniforms, equipment\nand anything else they need to complete their sexual, cultural and\nathletic development,\" Retief said.\n\"If we don't act promptly,\" Magnan said, \"the Groaci Embassy may well\nanticipate us. They're very active here.\"\n\"That's an idea,\" said Retief. \"Let 'em. After awhile they'll go broke\ninstead of us.\"\n\"Nonsense. The group requires a sponsor. I can't actually order you to\nstep forward. However....\" Magnan let the sentence hang in the air.\nRetief raised one eyebrow.\n\"For a minute there,\" he said, \"I thought you were going to make a\npositive statement.\"\nMagnan leaned back, lacing his fingers over his stomach. \"I don't think\nyou'll find a diplomat of my experience doing anything so naive,\" he\nsaid.\n\"I like the adult Fustians,\" said Retief. \"Too bad they have to lug\nhalf a ton of horn around on their backs. I wonder if surgery would\nhelp.\"\n\"Great heavens, Retief,\" Magnan sputtered. \"I'm amazed that even you\nwould bring up a matter of such delicacy. A race's unfortunate physical\ncharacteristics are hardly a fit matter for Terrestrial curiosity.\"\n\"Well, of course your experience of the Fustian mentality is greater\nthan mine. I've only been here a month. But it's been my experience,\nMr. Ambassador, that few races are above improving on nature. Otherwise\nyou, for example, would be tripping over your beard.\"\nMagnan shuddered. \"Please\u2014never mention the idea to a Fustian.\"\nRetief stood. \"My own program for the day includes going over to the\ndockyards. There are some features of this new passenger liner the\nFustians are putting together that I want to look into. With your\npermission, Mr. Ambassador...?\"\nMagnan snorted. \"Your pre-occupation with the trivial disturbs me,\nRetief. More interest in substantive matters\u2014such as working with\nYouth groups\u2014would create a far better impression.\"\n\"Before getting too involved with these groups, it might be a good idea\nto find out a little more about them,\" said Retief. \"Who organizes\nthem? There are three strong political parties here on Fust. What's the\nalignment of this SCARS organization?\"\n\"You forget, these are merely teenagers, so to speak,\" Magnan said.\n\"Politics mean nothing to them ... yet.\"\n\"Then there are the Groaci. Why their passionate interest in a\ntwo-horse world like Fust? Normally they're concerned with nothing but\nbusiness. But what has Fust got that they could use?\"\n\"You may rule out the commercial aspect in this instance,\" said Magnan.\n\"Fust possesses a vigorous steel-age manufacturing economy. The Groaci\nare barely ahead of them.\"\n\"Barely,\" said Retief. \"Just over the line into crude atomics ... like\nfission bombs.\"\nMagnan shook his head, turned back to his papers. \"What market exists\nfor such devices on a world at peace? I suggest you address your\nattention to the less spectacular but more rewarding work of studying\nthe social patterns of the local youth.\"\n\"I've studied them,\" said Retief. \"And before I meet any of the local\nyouth socially I want to get myself a good blackjack.\"\nII\nRetief left the sprawling bungalow-type building that housed the\nchancery of the Terrestrial Embassy, swung aboard a passing flat-car\nand leaned back against the wooden guard rail as the heavy vehicle\ntrundled through the city toward the looming gantries of the shipyards.\nIt was a cool morning. A light breeze carried the fishy odor of Fusty\ndwellings across the broad cobbled avenue. A few mature Fustians\nlumbered heavily along in the shade of the low buildings, audibly\nwheezing under the burden of their immense carapaces. Among them,\nshell-less youths trotted briskly on scaly stub legs. The driver of the\nflat-car, a labor-caste Fustian with his guild colors emblazoned on his\nback, heaved at the tiller, swung the unwieldy conveyance through the\nshipyard gates, creaked to a halt.\n\"Thus I come to the shipyard with frightful speed,\" he said in Fustian.\n\"Well I know the way of the naked-backs, who move always in haste.\"\nRetief climbed down, handed him a coin. \"You should take up\nprofessional racing,\" he said. \"Daredevil.\"\nHe crossed the littered yard and tapped at the door of a rambling shed.\nBoards creaked inside. Then the door swung back.\nA gnarled ancient with tarnished facial scales and a weathered carapace\npeered out at Retief.\n\"Long-may-you-sleep,\" said Retief. \"I'd like to take a look around, if\nyou don't mind. I understand you're laying the bedplate for your new\nliner today.\"\n\"May-you-dream-of-the-deeps,\" the old fellow mumbled. He waved a stumpy\narm toward a group of shell-less Fustians standing by a massive hoist.\n\"The youths know more of bedplates than do I, who but tend the place of\npapers.\"\n\"I know how you feel, old-timer,\" said Retief. \"That sounds like the\nstory of my life. Among your papers do you have a set of plans for the\nvessel? I understand it's to be a passenger liner.\"\nThe oldster nodded. He shuffled to a drawing file, rummaged, pulled out\na sheaf of curled prints and spread them on the table. Retief stood\nsilently, running a finger over the uppermost drawing, tracing lines....\n\"What does the naked-back here?\" barked a deep voice behind Retief. He\nturned. A heavy-faced Fustian youth, wrapped in a mantle, stood at the\nopen door. Beady yellow eyes set among fine scales bored into Retief.\n\"I came to take a look at your new liner,\" said Retief.\n\"We need no prying foreigners here,\" the youth snapped. His eye fell on\nthe drawings. He hissed in sudden anger.\n\"Doddering hulk!\" he snapped at the ancient. \"May you toss in\nnightmares! Put by the plans!\"\n\"My mistake,\" Retief said. \"I didn't know this was a secret project.\"\nThe youth hesitated. \"It is not a secret project,\" he muttered. \"Why\nshould it be secret?\"\n\"You tell me.\"\nThe youth worked his jaws and rocked his head from side to side in the\nFusty gesture of uncertainty. \"There is nothing to conceal,\" he said.\n\"We merely construct a passenger liner.\"\n\"Then you don't mind if I look over the drawings,\" said Retief. \"Who\nknows? Maybe some day I'll want to reserve a suite for the trip out.\"\nThe youth turned and disappeared. Retief grinned at the oldster. \"Went\nfor his big brother, I guess,\" he said. \"I have a feeling I won't get\nto study these in peace here. Mind if I copy them?\"\n\"Willingly, light-footed one,\" said the old Fustian. \"And mine is the\nshame for the discourtesy of youth.\"\nRetief took out a tiny camera, flipped a copying lens in place, leafed\nthrough the drawings, clicking the shutter.\n\"A plague on these youths,\" said the oldster, \"who grow more virulent\nday by day.\"\n\"Why don't you elders clamp down?\"\n\"Agile are they and we are slow of foot. And this unrest is new.\nUnknown in my youth was such insolence.\"\n\"The police\u2014\"\n\"Bah!\" the ancient rumbled. \"None have we worthy of the name, nor have\nwe needed ought ere now.\"\n\"What's behind it?\"\n\"They have found leaders. The spiv, Slock, is one. And I fear they plot\nmischief.\" He pointed to the window. \"They come, and a Soft One with\nthem.\"\nRetief pocketed the camera, glanced out the window. A pale-featured\nGroaci with an ornately decorated crest stood with the youths, who eyed\nthe hut, then started toward it.\n\"That's the military attache of the Groaci Embassy,\" Retief said. \"I\nwonder what he and the boys are cooking up together?\"\n\"Naught that augurs well for the dignity of Fust,\" the oldster rumbled.\n\"Flee, agile one, while I engage their attentions.\"\n\"I was just leaving,\" Retief said. \"Which way out?\"\n\"The rear door,\" the Fustian gestured with a stubby member. \"Rest well,\nstranger on these shores.\" He moved to the entrance.\n\"Same to you, pop,\" said Retief. \"And thanks.\"\nHe eased through the narrow back entrance, waited until voices were\nraised at the front of the shed, then strolled off toward the gate.\nThe second dark of the third cycle was lightening when Retief left the\nEmbassy technical library and crossed the corridor to his office. He\nflipped on a light. A note was tucked under a paperweight:\n\"Retief\u2014I shall expect your attendance at the IAS dinner at first\ndark of the fourth cycle. There will be a brief but, I hope, impressive\nSponsorship ceremony for the SCARS group, with full press coverage,\narrangements for which I have managed to complete in spite of your\nintransigence.\"\nRetief snorted and glanced at his watch. Less than three hours. Just\ntime to creep home by flat-car, dress in ceremonial uniform and creep\nback.\nOutside he flagged a lumbering bus. He stationed himself in a corner\nand watched the yellow sun, Beta, rise rapidly above the low skyline.\nThe nearby sea was at high tide now, under the pull of the major sun\nand the three moons, and the stiff breeze carried a mist of salt spray.\nRetief turned up his collar against the dampness. In half an hour he\nwould be perspiring under the vertical rays of a third-noon sun, but\nthe thought failed to keep the chill off.\nTwo Youths clambered up on the platform, moving purposefully toward\nRetief. He moved off the rail, watching them, weight balanced.\n\"That's close enough, kids,\" he said. \"Plenty of room on this scow. No\nneed to crowd up.\"\n\"There are certain films,\" the lead Fustian muttered. His voice was\nunusually deep for a Youth. He was wrapped in a heavy cloak and moved\nawkwardly. His adolescence was nearly at an end, Retief guessed.\n\"I told you once,\" said Retief. \"Don't crowd me.\"\nThe two stepped close, slit mouths snapping in anger. Retief put out a\nfoot, hooked it behind the scaly leg of the overaged juvenile and threw\nhis weight against the cloaked chest. The clumsy Fustian tottered, fell\nheavily. Retief was past him and off the flat-car before the other\nYouth had completed his vain lunge toward the spot Retief had occupied.\nThe Terrestrial waved cheerfully at the pair, hopped aboard another\nvehicle, watched his would-be assailants lumber down from their car,\ntiny heads twisted to follow his retreating figure.\nSo they wanted the film? Retief reflected, thumbing a cigar alight.\nThey were a little late. He had already filed it in the Embassy vault,\nafter running a copy for the reference files.\nAnd a comparison of the drawings with those of the obsolete Mark XXXV\nbattle cruiser used two hundred years earlier by the Concordiat Naval\nArm showed them to be almost identical, gun emplacements and all. The\nterm \"obsolete\" was a relative one. A ship which had been outmoded in\nthe armories of the Galactic Powers could still be king of the walk in\nthe Eastern Arm.\nBut how had these two known of the film? There had been no one present\nbut himself and the old-timer\u2014and he was willing to bet the elderly\nFustian hadn't told them anything.\nAt least not willingly....\nRetief frowned, dropped the cigar over the side, waited until the\nflat-car negotiated a mud-wallow, then swung down and headed for the\nshipyard.\nThe door, hinges torn loose, had been propped loosely back in position.\nRetief looked around at the battered interior of the shed. The old\nfellow had put up a struggle.\nThere were deep drag-marks in the dust behind the building. Retief\nfollowed them across the yard. They disappeared under the steel door of\na warehouse.\nRetief glanced around. Now, at the mid-hour of the fourth cycle, the\nworkmen were heaped along the edge of the refreshment pond, deep in\ntheir siesta. He took a multi-bladed tool from a pocket, tried various\nfittings in the lock. It snicked open.\nHe eased the door aside far enough to enter.\nHeaped bales loomed before him. Snapping on the tiny lamp in the handle\nof the combination tool, Retief looked over the pile. One stack seemed\nout of alignment ... and the dust had been scraped from the floor\nbefore it. He pocketed the light, climbed up on the bales, looked over\ninto a nest made by stacking the bundles around a clear spot. The aged\nFustian lay in it, on his back, a heavy sack tied over his head.\nRetief dropped down inside the ring of bales, sawed at the tough twine\nand pulled the sack free.\n\"It's me, old fellow,\" Retief said. \"The nosy stranger. Sorry I got you\ninto this.\"\nThe oldster threshed his gnarled legs. He rocked slightly and fell\nback. \"A curse on the cradle that rocked their infant slumbers,\" he\nrumbled. \"But place me back on my feet and I hunt down the youth,\nSlock, though he flee to the bottommost muck of the Sea of Torments.\"\n\"How am I going to get you out of here? Maybe I'd better get some help.\"\n\"Nay. The perfidious Youths abound here,\" said the old Fustian. \"It\nwould be your life.\"\n\"I doubt if they'd go that far.\"\n\"Would they not?\" The Fustian stretched his neck. \"Cast your light\nhere. But for the toughness of my hide....\"\nRetief put the beam of the light on the leathery neck. A great smear of\nthick purplish blood welled from a ragged cut. The oldster chuckled, a\nsound like a seal coughing.\n\"Traitor, they called me. For long they sawed at me\u2014in vain. Then\nthey trussed me and dumped me here. They think to return with weapons\nto complete the task.\"\n\"Weapons? I thought it was illegal!\"\n\"Their evil genius, the Soft One,\" said the Fustian. \"He would provide\nfuel to the Devil himself.\"\n\"The Groaci again,\" said Retief. \"I wonder what their angle is.\"\n\"And I must confess, I told them of you, ere I knew their full\nintentions. Much can I tell you of their doings. But first, I pray, the\nblock and tackle.\"\nRetief found the hoist where the Fustian directed him, maneuvered it\ninto position, hooked onto the edge of the carapace and hauled away.\nThe immense Fustian rose slowly, teetered ... then flopped on his chest.\nSlowly he got to his feet.\n\"My name is Whonk, fleet one,\" he said. \"My cows are yours.\"\n\"Thanks. I'm Retief. I'd like to meet the girls some time. But right\nnow, let's get out of here.\"\nWhonk leaned his bulk against the ponderous stacks of baled kelp,\nbulldozed them aside. \"Slow am I to anger,\" he said, \"but implacable in\nmy wrath. Slock, beware!\"\n\"Hold it,\" said Retief suddenly. He sniffed. \"What's that odor?\" He\nflashed the light around, played it over a dry stain on the floor. He\nknelt, sniffed at the spot.\n\"What kind of cargo was stacked here, Whonk? And where is it now?\"\nWhonk considered. \"There were drums,\" he said. \"Four of them, quite\nsmall, painted an evil green, the property of the Soft Ones, the\nGroaci. They lay here a day and a night. At full dark of the first\nperiod they came with stevedores and loaded them aboard the barge\nMoss\nRock\n.\"\n\"The VIP boat. Who's scheduled to use it?\"\n\"I know not. But what matters this? Let us discuss cargo movements\nafter I have settled a score with certain Youths.\"\n\"We'd better follow this up first, Whonk. There's only one substance I\nknow of that's transported in drums and smells like that blot on the\nfloor. That's titanite: the hottest explosive this side of a uranium\npile.\"\nIII\nBeta was setting as Retief, Whonk puffing at his heels, came up to the\nsentry box beside the gangway leading to the plush interior of the\nofficial luxury space barge\nMoss Rock\n.\n\"A sign of the times,\" said Whonk, glancing inside the empty shelter.\n\"A guard should stand here, but I see him not. Doubtless he crept away\nto sleep.\"\n\"Let's go aboard and take a look around.\"\nThey entered the ship. Soft lights glowed in utter silence. A rough box\nstood on the floor, rollers and pry-bars beside it\u2014a discordant note\nin the muted luxury of the setting. Whonk rummaged in it.\n\"Curious,\" he said. \"What means this?\" He held up a stained cloak of\norange and green, a metal bracelet, papers.\n\"Orange and green,\" mused Relief. \"Whose colors are those?\"\n\"I know not.\" Whonk glanced at the arm-band. \"But this is lettered.\" He\npassed the metal band to Retief.\n\"SCARS,\" Retief read. He looked at Whonk. \"It seems to me I've heard\nthe name before,\" he murmured. \"Let's get back to the Embassy\u2014fast.\"\nBack on the ramp Retief heard a sound ... and turned in time to duck\nthe charge of a hulking Fustian youth who thundered past him and\nfetched up against the broad chest of Whonk, who locked him in a warm\nembrace.\n\"Nice catch, Whonk. Where'd he sneak out of?\"\n\"The lout hid there by the storage bin,\" rumbled Whonk. The captive\nyouth thumped fists and toes fruitlessly against the oldster's carapace.\n\"Hang onto him,\" said Retief. \"He looks like the biting kind.\"\n\"No fear. Clumsy I am, yet not without strength.\"\n\"Ask him where the titanite is tucked away.\"\n\"Speak, witless grub,\" growled Whonk, \"lest I tweak you in twain.\"\nThe youth gurgled.\n\"Better let up before you make a mess of him,\" said Retief. Whonk\nlifted the Youth clear of the floor, then flung him down with a thump\nthat made the ground quiver. The younger Fustian glared up at the\nelder, mouth snapping.\n\"This one was among those who trussed me and hid me away for the\nkilling,\" said Whonk. \"In his repentance he will tell all to his elder.\"\n\"That's the same young squirt that tried to strike up an acquaintance\nwith me on the bus,\" Retief said. \"He gets around.\"\nThe youth scrambled to hands and knees, scuttled for freedom. Retief\nplanted a foot on his dragging cloak; it ripped free. He stared at the\nbare back of the Fustian\u2014\n\"By the Great Egg!\" Whonk exclaimed, tripping the refugee as he tried\nto rise. \"This is no Youth! His carapace has been taken from him!\"\nRetief looked at the scarred back. \"I thought he looked a little old.\nBut I thought\u2014\"\n\"This is not possible,\" Whonk said wonderingly. \"The great nerve trunks\nare deeply involved. Not even the cleverest surgeon could excise the\ncarapace and leave the patient living.\"\n\"It looks like somebody did the trick. But let's take this boy with us\nand get out of here. His folks may come home.\"\n\"Too late,\" said Whonk. Retief turned.\nThree youths came from behind the sheds.\n\"Well,\" Retief said. \"It looks like the SCARS are out in force tonight.\nWhere's your pal?\" he said to the advancing trio. \"The sticky little\nbird with the eye-stalks? Back at his Embassy, leaving you suckers\nholding the bag, I'll bet.\"\n\"Shelter behind me, Retief,\" said Whonk.\n\"Go get 'em, old-timer.\" Retief stooped, picked up one of the pry-bars.\n\"I'll jump around and distract them.\"\nWhonk let out a whistling roar and charged for the immature Fustians.\nThey fanned out ... and one tripped, sprawled on his face. Retief\nwhirled the metal bar he had thrust between the Fustian's legs, slammed\nit against the skull of another, who shook his head, turned on\nRetief ... and bounced off the steel hull of the\nMoss Rock\nas Whonk\ntook him in full charge.\nRetief used the bar on another head. His third blow laid the Fustian\non the pavement, oozing purple. The other two club members departed\nhastily, seriously dented but still mobile.\nRetief leaned on his club, breathing hard. \"Tough heads these kids\nhave got. I'm tempted to chase those two lads down, but I've got\nanother errand to run. I don't know who the Groaci intended to blast,\nbut I have a sneaking suspicion somebody of importance was scheduled\nfor a boat ride in the next few hours. And three drums of titanite is\nenough to vaporize this tub and everyone aboard her.\"\n\"The plot is foiled,\" said Whonk. \"But what reason did they have?\"\n\"The Groaci are behind it. I have an idea the SCARS didn't know about\nthis gambit.\"\n\"Which of these is the leader?\" asked Whonk. He prodded a fallen Youth\nwith a horny toe. \"Arise, dreaming one.\"\n\"Never mind him, Whonk. We'll tie these two up and leave them here. I\nknow where to find the boss.\"\nA stolid crowd filled the low-ceilinged banquet hall. Retief scanned\nthe tables for the pale blobs of Terrestrial faces, dwarfed by the\ngiant armored bodies of the Fustians. Across the room Magnan fluttered\na hand. Retief headed toward him. A low-pitched vibration filled the\nair: the rumble of subsonic Fustian music.\nRetief slid into his place beside Magnan. \"Sorry to be late, Mr.\nAmbassador.\"\n\"I'm honored that you chose to appear at all,\" said Magnan coldly. He\nturned back to the Fustian on his left.\n\"Ah, yes, Mr. Minister,\" he said. \"Charming, most charming. So joyous.\"\nThe Fustian looked at him, beady-eyed. \"It is the\nLament of\nHatching\n,\" he said; \"our National Dirge.\"\n\"Oh,\" said Magnan. \"How interesting. Such a pleasing balance of\ninstruments\u2014\"\n\"It is a droon solo,\" said the Fustian, eyeing the Terrestrial\nAmbassador suspiciously.\n\"Why don't you just admit you can't hear it,\" Retief whispered loudly.\n\"And if I may interrupt a moment\u2014\"\nMagnan cleared his throat. \"Now that our Mr. Retief has arrived,\nperhaps we could rush right along to the Sponsorship ceremonies.\"\n\"This group,\" said Retief, leaning across Magnan, \"the SCARS. How much\ndo you know about them, Mr. Minister?\"\n\"Nothing at all,\" the huge Fustian elder rumbled. \"For my taste, all\nYouths should be kept penned with the livestock until they grow a\ncarapace to tame their irresponsibility.\"\n\"We mustn't lose sight of the importance of channeling youthful\nenergies,\" said Magnan.\n\"Labor gangs,\" said the minister. \"In my youth we were indentured to\nthe dredge-masters. I myself drew a muck sledge.\"\n\"But in these modern times,\" put in Magnan, \"surely it's incumbent on\nus to make happy these golden hours.\"\nThe minister snorted. \"Last week I had a golden hour. They set upon me\nand pelted me with overripe stench-fruit.\"\n\"But this was merely a manifestation of normal youthful frustrations,\"\ncried Magnan. \"Their essential tenderness\u2014\"\n\"You'd not find a tender spot on that lout yonder,\" the minister\nsaid, pointing with a fork at a newly arrived Youth, \"if you drilled\nboreholes and blasted.\"\n\"Why, that's our guest of honor,\" said Magnan, \"a fine young fellow!\nSlop I believe his name is.\"\n\"Slock,\" said Retief. \"Eight feet of armor-plated orneriness. And\u2014\"\nMagnan rose and tapped on his glass. The Fustians winced at the, to\nthem, supersonic vibrations. They looked at each other muttering.\nMagnan tapped louder. The Minister drew in his head, eyes closed. Some\nof the Fustians rose, tottered for the doors; the noise level rose.\nMagnan redoubled his efforts. The glass broke with a clatter and green\nwine gushed on the tablecloth.\n\"What in the name of the Great Egg!\" the Minister muttered. He blinked,\nbreathing deeply.\n\"Oh, forgive me,\" blurted Magnan, dabbing at the wine.\n\"Too bad the glass gave out,\" said Retief. \"In another minute you'd\nhave cleared the hall. And then maybe I could have gotten a word in\nsideways. There's a matter you should know about\u2014\"\n\"Your attention, please,\" Magnan said, rising. \"I see that our fine\nyoung guest has arrived, and I hope that the remainder of his committee\nwill be along in a moment. It is my pleasure to announce that our Mr.\nRetief has had the good fortune to win out in the keen bidding for the\npleasure of sponsoring this lovely group.\"\nRetief tugged at Magnan's sleeve. \"Don't introduce me yet,\" he said. \"I\nwant to appear suddenly. More dramatic, you know.\"\n\"Well,\" murmured Magnan, glancing down at Retief, \"I'm gratified to\nsee you entering into the spirit of the event at last.\" He turned his\nattention back to the assembled guests. \"If our honored guest will join\nme on the rostrum...?\" he said. \"The gentlemen of the press may want to\ncatch a few shots of the presentation.\"\nMagnan stepped up on the low platform at the center of the wide room,\ntook his place beside the robed Fustian youth and beamed at the cameras.\n\"How gratifying it is to take this opportunity to express once more the\ngreat pleasure we have in sponsoring SCARS,\" he said, talking slowly\nfor the benefit of the scribbling reporters. \"We'd like to think that\nin our modest way we're to be a part of all that the SCARS achieve\nduring the years ahead.\"\nMagnan paused as a huge Fustian elder heaved his bulk up the two low\nsteps to the rostrum, approached the guest of honor. He watched as the\nnewcomer paused behind Slock, who did not see the new arrival.\nRetief pushed through the crowd, stepped up to face the Fustian youth.\nSlock stared at him, drew back.\n\"You know me, Slock,\" said Retief loudly. \"An old fellow named Whonk\ntold you about me, just before you tried to saw his head off, remember?\nIt was when I came out to take a look at that battle cruiser you're\nbuilding.\"\nIV\nWith a bellow Slock reached for Retief\u2014and choked off in mid-cry as\nthe Fustian elder, Whonk, pinioned him from behind, lifting him clear\nof the floor.\n\"Glad you reporters happened along,\" said Retief to the gaping newsmen.\n\"Slock here had a deal with a sharp operator from the Groaci Embassy.\nThe Groaci were to supply the necessary hardware and Slock, as foreman\nat the shipyards, was to see that everything was properly installed.\nThe next step, I assume, would have been a local take-over, followed\nby a little interplanetary war on Flamenco or one of the other nearby\nworlds ... for which the Groaci would be glad to supply plenty of ammo.\"\nMagnan found his tongue. \"Are you mad, Retief?\" he screeched. \"This\ngroup was vouched for by the Ministry of Youth!\"\n\"The Ministry's overdue for a purge,\" snapped Retief. He turned back\nto Slock. \"I wonder if you were in on the little diversion that was\nplanned for today. When the\nMoss Rock\nblew, a variety of clues were\nto be planted where they'd be easy to find ... with SCARS written all\nover them. The Groaci would thus have neatly laid the whole affair\nsquarely at the door of the Terrestrial Embassy ... whose sponsorship\nof the SCARS had received plenty of publicity.\"\n\"The\nMoss Rock\n?\" said Magnan. \"But that was\u2014Retief! This is idiotic.\nSlock himself was scheduled to go on a cruise tomorrow!\"\nSlock roared suddenly, twisting violently. Whonk teetered, his grip\nloosened ... and Slock pulled free and was off the platform, butting\nhis way through the milling oldsters on the dining room floor. Magnan\nwatched, open-mouthed.\n\"The Groaci were playing a double game, as usual,\" Retief said. \"They\nintended to dispose of this fellow Slock, once he'd served their\npurpose.\"\n\"Well, don't stand there,\" yelped Magnan over the uproar. \"If Slock is\nthe ring-leader of a delinquent gang...!\" He moved to give chase.\nRetief grabbed his arm. \"Don't jump down there! You'd have as much\nchance of getting through as a jack-rabbit through a threshing contest.\"\nTen minutes later the crowd had thinned slightly. \"We can get through\nnow,\" Whonk called. \"This way.\" He lowered himself to the floor, bulled\nthrough to the exit. Flashbulbs popped. Retief and Magnan followed in\nWhonk's wake.\nIn the lounge Retief grabbed the phone, waited for the operator, gave a\ncode letter. No reply. He tried another.\n\"No good,\" he said after a full minute had passed. \"Wonder what's\nloose?\" He slammed the phone back in its niche. \"Let's grab a cab.\"\n", "summary": "Retief, a Councillor of the Terrestrial Embassy, meets with Ambassador Magnan, who is discussing a matter of importance to him. It refers to the matter of sponsorship of Youth groups. The Fustians are a long-lived people, and the Fustian culture is based on a traditional, hunter-gatherer way of life. The Ambassador is concerned that the Fusians are not able to take care of themselves, and he wants Retief to help him with this matter. Retief is a Terran diplomat, and is concerned about the Fussians\u2019 attitude towards Terrestrials. He is also concerned that they will be unable to take Retief\u2019s suggestions seriously because they are not used to dealing with Terrestrians. Retieving is upset when Magnan tells him that he cannot help because he is a Terrestrial diplomat. He also tells Retief that he is not allowed to interfere with the Fuhs\u2019 affairs because he has no diplomatic immunity. Retieve is upset and tries to explain to Magnan that he has a better idea than the one he was given. Magnan is skeptical and says that he does not want to hear Retief out. He then tells Retieving that he will not be able to help because the Fausians are in charge of the pest control. Retie is upset at this and wants to know why the Fursians are so interested in pest control, but Magnan refuses to give him any information. He tells Retie that the pest problem is a simple solution. Retee is upset because he wants to help the Fufians with their pest problem. He wants to be able take care themselves. He asks Magnan to help with the pest issue, but he is told that he can\u2019t. Reteed that he needs to find a way to help them. Magan is skeptical of the idea and says he will help. He gives Retief a contract to help set up a pest control group. Retiever is skeptical but agrees to help.   Retief is upset with the Ambassador because he thinks he is being manipulated. He tries to convince Magnan of the success of the program but is unsuccessful. He thinks that the Ambassador is trying to scare him. He goes to the Youth Center to find out more information about the pest situation and is met by a Fusti named Mr. Gulver. He explains that the pests are harmless and that the only pest control is done by the Fuses. Retif is upset that the Terrestreals are not allowed on the planet and wants the Fuseians to help out. Retifi is upset again when Gulver tells him about the Groaci Embassy and how they have a pest problem and that they need to help Fustia. Retef is upset by this and tries again to convince the Ambassador to help, but the Ambassador refuses. Retietee is then informed that the Groacians have a problem with the Terrans because they have no diplomatic relations with the Terran government. Retive is upset. He decides to go to the bar and meets Mr. Karsh, a Fusian who is a member of the Youth Club. He meets him and he is very friendly and offers to help Mr. Gertrude, a female Fustinian. Retieved, he is pleased when she is a foreigner. He offers to pay for the Youth club. Retife is happy to help and they go to bed.", "faithfulness": [1, null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, null, 0, 0, null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, null, null, null, 0, 0, 0]}

It's the third on the subject this week. It refers to the\nmatter of sponsorship of Youth groups\u2014\"\n\"Some youths,\" Retief said. \"Average age, seventy-five.\"\n\"The Fustians are a long-lived people,\" Magnan snapped. \"These matters\nare relative. At seventy-five, a male Fustian is at a trying age\u2014\"\n\"That's right. He'll try anything\u2014in the hope it will maim somebody.\"\n\"Precisely the problem,\" Magnan said. \"But the Youth Movement is\nthe important news in today's political situation here on Fust. And\nsponsorship of Youth groups is a shrewd stroke on the part of the\nTerrestrial Embassy. At my suggestion, well nigh every member of the\nmission has leaped at the opportunity to score a few p\u2014that is, cement\nrelations with this emergent power group\u2014the leaders of the future.\nYou, Retief, as Councillor, are the outstanding exception.\"\n\"I'm not convinced these hoodlums need my help in organizing their\nrumbles,\" Retief said. \"Now, if you have a proposal for a pest control\ngroup\u2014\"\n\"To the Fustians this is no jesting matter,\" Magnan cut in. \"This\ngroup\u2014\" he glanced at the paper\u2014\"known as the Sexual, Cultural, and\nAthletic Recreational Society, or SCARS for short, has been awaiting\nsponsorship for a matter of weeks now.\"\n\"Meaning they want someone to buy them a clubhouse, uniforms, equipment\nand anything else they need to complete their sexual, cultural and\nathletic development,\" Retief said.\n\"If we don't act promptly,\" Magnan said, \"the Groaci Embassy may well\nanticipate us. They're very active here.\"\n\"That's an idea,\" said Retief. \"Let 'em. After awhile they'll go broke\ninstead of us.\"\n\"Nonsense. The group requires a sponsor. I can't actually order you to\nstep forward. However....\" Magnan let the sentence hang in the air.\nRetief raised one eyebrow.\n\"For a minute there,\" he said, \"I thought you were going to make a\npositive statement.\"\nMagnan leaned back, lacing his fingers over his stomach. \"I don't think\nyou'll find a diplomat of my experience doing anything so naive,\" he\nsaid.\n\"I like the adult Fustians,\" said Retief. \"Too bad they have to lug\nhalf a ton of horn around on their backs. I wonder if surgery would\nhelp.\"\n\"Great heavens, Retief,\" Magnan sputtered. \"I'm amazed that even you\nwould bring up a matter of such delicacy. A race's unfortunate physical\ncharacteristics are hardly a fit matter for Terrestrial curiosity.\"\n\"Well, of course your experience of the Fustian mentality is greater\nthan mine. I've only been here a month. But it's been my experience,\nMr. Ambassador, that few races are above improving on nature. Otherwise\nyou, for example, would be tripping over your beard.\"\nMagnan shuddered. \"Please\u2014never mention the idea to a Fustian.\"\nRetief stood. \"My own program for the day includes going over to the\ndockyards. There are some features of this new passenger liner the\nFustians are putting together that I want to look into. With your\npermission, Mr. Ambassador...?\"\nMagnan snorted. \"Your pre-occupation with the trivial disturbs me,\nRetief. More interest in substantive matters\u2014such as working with\nYouth groups\u2014would create a far better impression.\"\n\"Before getting too involved with these groups, it might be a good idea\nto find out a little more about them,\" said Retief. \"Who organizes\nthem? There are three strong political parties here on Fust. What's the\nalignment of this SCARS organization?\"\n\"You forget, these are merely teenagers, so to speak,\" Magnan said.\n\"Politics mean nothing to them ... yet.\"\n\"Then there are the Groaci. Why their passionate interest in a\ntwo-horse world like Fust? Normally they're concerned with nothing but\nbusiness. But what has Fust got that they could use?\"\n\"You may rule out the commercial aspect in this instance,\" said Magnan.\n\"Fust possesses a vigorous steel-age manufacturing economy. The Groaci\nare barely ahead of them.\"\n\"Barely,\" said Retief. \"Just over the line into crude atomics ... like\nfission bombs.\"\nMagnan shook his head, turned back to his papers. \"What market exists\nfor such devices on a world at peace? I suggest you address your\nattention to the less spectacular but more rewarding work of studying\nthe social patterns of the local youth.\"\n\"I've studied them,\" said Retief. \"And before I meet any of the local\nyouth socially I want to get myself a good blackjack.\"\nII\nRetief left the sprawling bungalow-type building that housed the\nchancery of the Terrestrial Embassy, swung aboard a passing flat-car\nand leaned back against the wooden guard rail as the heavy vehicle\ntrundled through the city toward the looming gantries of the shipyards.\nIt was a cool morning. A light breeze carried the fishy odor of Fusty\ndwellings across the broad cobbled avenue. A few mature Fustians\nlumbered heavily along in the shade of the low buildings, audibly\nwheezing under the burden of their immense carapaces. Among them,\nshell-less youths trotted briskly on scaly stub legs. The driver of the\nflat-car, a labor-caste Fustian with his guild colors emblazoned on his\nback, heaved at the tiller, swung the unwieldy conveyance through the\nshipyard gates, creaked to a halt.\n\"Thus I come to the shipyard with frightful speed,\" he said in Fustian.\n\"Well I know the way of the naked-backs, who move always in haste.\"\nRetief climbed down, handed him a coin. \"You should take up\nprofessional racing,\" he said. \"Daredevil.\"\nHe crossed the littered yard and tapped at the door of a rambling shed.\nBoards creaked inside. Then the door swung back.\nA gnarled ancient with tarnished facial scales and a weathered carapace\npeered out at Retief.\n\"Long-may-you-sleep,\" said Retief. \"I'd like to take a look around, if\nyou don't mind. I understand you're laying the bedplate for your new\nliner today.\"\n\"May-you-dream-of-the-deeps,\" the old fellow mumbled. He waved a stumpy\narm toward a group of shell-less Fustians standing by a massive hoist.\n\"The youths know more of bedplates than do I, who but tend the place of\npapers.\"\n\"I know how you feel, old-timer,\" said Retief. \"That sounds like the\nstory of my life. Among your papers do you have a set of plans for the\nvessel? I understand it's to be a passenger liner.\"\nThe oldster nodded. He shuffled to a drawing file, rummaged, pulled out\na sheaf of curled prints and spread them on the table. Retief stood\nsilently, running a finger over the uppermost drawing, tracing lines....\n\"What does the naked-back here?\" barked a deep voice behind Retief. He\nturned. A heavy-faced Fustian youth, wrapped in a mantle, stood at the\nopen door. Beady yellow eyes set among fine scales bored into Retief.\n\"I came to take a look at your new liner,\" said Retief.\n\"We need no prying foreigners here,\" the youth snapped. His eye fell on\nthe drawings. He hissed in sudden anger.\n\"Doddering hulk!\" he snapped at the ancient. \"May you toss in\nnightmares! Put by the plans!\"\n\"My mistake,\" Retief said. \"I didn't know this was a secret project.\"\nThe youth hesitated. \"It is not a secret project,\" he muttered. \"Why\nshould it be secret?\"\n\"You tell me.\"\nThe youth worked his jaws and rocked his head from side to side in the\nFusty gesture of uncertainty. \"There is nothing to conceal,\" he said.\n\"We merely construct a passenger liner.\"\n\"Then you don't mind if I look over the drawings,\" said Retief. \"Who\nknows? Maybe some day I'll want to reserve a suite for the trip out.\"\nThe youth turned and disappeared. Retief grinned at the oldster. \"Went\nfor his big brother, I guess,\" he said. \"I have a feeling I won't get\nto study these in peace here. Mind if I copy them?\"\n\"Willingly, light-footed one,\" said the old Fustian. \"And mine is the\nshame for the discourtesy of youth.\"\nRetief took out a tiny camera, flipped a copying lens in place, leafed\nthrough the drawings, clicking the shutter.\n\"A plague on these youths,\" said the oldster, \"who grow more virulent\nday by day.\"\n\"Why don't you elders clamp down?\"\n\"Agile are they and we are slow of foot. And this unrest is new.\nUnknown in my youth was such insolence.\"\n\"The police\u2014\"\n\"Bah!\" the ancient rumbled. \"None have we worthy of the name, nor have\nwe needed ought ere now.\"\n\"What's behind it?\"\n\"They have found leaders. The spiv, Slock, is one. And I fear they plot\nmischief.\" He pointed to the window. \"They come, and a Soft One with\nthem.\"\nRetief pocketed the camera, glanced out the window. A pale-featured\nGroaci with an ornately decorated crest stood with the youths, who eyed\nthe hut, then started toward it.\n\"That's the military attache of the Groaci Embassy,\" Retief said. \"I\nwonder what he and the boys are cooking up together?\"\n\"Naught that augurs well for the dignity of Fust,\" the oldster rumbled.\n\"Flee, agile one, while I engage their attentions.\"\n\"I was just leaving,\" Retief said. \"Which way out?\"\n\"The rear door,\" the Fustian gestured with a stubby member. \"Rest well,\nstranger on these shores.\" He moved to the entrance.\n\"Same to you, pop,\" said Retief. \"And thanks.\"\nHe eased through the narrow back entrance, waited until voices were\nraised at the front of the shed, then strolled off toward the gate.\nThe second dark of the third cycle was lightening when Retief left the\nEmbassy technical library and crossed the corridor to his office. He\nflipped on a light. A note was tucked under a paperweight:\n\"Retief\u2014I shall expect your attendance at the IAS dinner at first\ndark of the fourth cycle. There will be a brief but, I hope, impressive\nSponsorship ceremony for the SCARS group, with full press coverage,\narrangements for which I have managed to complete in spite of your\nintransigence.\"\nRetief snorted and glanced at his watch. Less than three hours. Just\ntime to creep home by flat-car, dress in ceremonial uniform and creep\nback.\nOutside he flagged a lumbering bus. He stationed himself in a corner\nand watched the yellow sun, Beta, rise rapidly above the low skyline.\nThe nearby sea was at high tide now, under the pull of the major sun\nand the three moons, and the stiff breeze carried a mist of salt spray.\nRetief turned up his collar against the dampness. In half an hour he\nwould be perspiring under the vertical rays of a third-noon sun, but\nthe thought failed to keep the chill off.\nTwo Youths clambered up on the platform, moving purposefully toward\nRetief. He moved off the rail, watching them, weight balanced.\n\"That's close enough, kids,\" he said. \"Plenty of room on this scow. No\nneed to crowd up.\"\n\"There are certain films,\" the lead Fustian muttered. His voice was\nunusually deep for a Youth. He was wrapped in a heavy cloak and moved\nawkwardly. His adolescence was nearly at an end, Retief guessed.\n\"I told you once,\" said Retief. \"Don't crowd me.\"\nThe two stepped close, slit mouths snapping in anger. Retief put out a\nfoot, hooked it behind the scaly leg of the overaged juvenile and threw\nhis weight against the cloaked chest. The clumsy Fustian tottered, fell\nheavily. Retief was past him and off the flat-car before the other\nYouth had completed his vain lunge toward the spot Retief had occupied.\nThe Terrestrial waved cheerfully at the pair, hopped aboard another\nvehicle, watched his would-be assailants lumber down from their car,\ntiny heads twisted to follow his retreating figure.\nSo they wanted the film? Retief reflected, thumbing a cigar alight.\nThey were a little late. He had already filed it in the Embassy vault,\nafter running a copy for the reference files.\nAnd a comparison of the drawings with those of the obsolete Mark XXXV\nbattle cruiser used two hundred years earlier by the Concordiat Naval\nArm showed them to be almost identical, gun emplacements and all. The\nterm \"obsolete\" was a relative one. A ship which had been outmoded in\nthe armories of the Galactic Powers could still be king of the walk in\nthe Eastern Arm.\nBut how had these two known of the film? There had been no one present\nbut himself and the old-timer\u2014and he was willing to bet the elderly\nFustian hadn't told them anything.\nAt least not willingly....\nRetief frowned, dropped the cigar over the side, waited until the\nflat-car negotiated a mud-wallow, then swung down and headed for the\nshipyard.\nThe door, hinges torn loose, had been propped loosely back in position.\nRetief looked around at the battered interior of the shed. The old\nfellow had put up a struggle.\nThere were deep drag-marks in the dust behind the building. Retief\nfollowed them across the yard. They disappeared under the steel door of\na warehouse.\nRetief glanced around. Now, at the mid-hour of the fourth cycle, the\nworkmen were heaped along the edge of the refreshment pond, deep in\ntheir siesta. He took a multi-bladed tool from a pocket, tried various\nfittings in the lock. It snicked open.\nHe eased the door aside far enough to enter.\nHeaped bales loomed before him. Snapping on the tiny lamp in the handle\nof the combination tool, Retief looked over the pile. One stack seemed\nout of alignment ... and the dust had been scraped from the floor\nbefore it. He pocketed the light, climbed up on the bales, looked over\ninto a nest made by stacking the bundles around a clear spot. The aged\nFustian lay in it, on his back, a heavy sack tied over his head.\nRetief dropped down inside the ring of bales, sawed at the tough twine\nand pulled the sack free.\n\"It's me, old fellow,\" Retief said. \"The nosy stranger. Sorry I got you\ninto this.\"\nThe oldster threshed his gnarled legs. He rocked slightly and fell\nback. \"A curse on the cradle that rocked their infant slumbers,\" he\nrumbled. \"But place me back on my feet and I hunt down the youth,\nSlock, though he flee to the bottommost muck of the Sea of Torments.\"\n\"How am I going to get you out of here? Maybe I'd better get some help.\"\n\"Nay. The perfidious Youths abound here,\" said the old Fustian. \"It\nwould be your life.\"\n\"I doubt if they'd go that far.\"\n\"Would they not?\" The Fustian stretched his neck. \"Cast your light\nhere. But for the toughness of my hide....\"\nRetief put the beam of the light on the leathery neck. A great smear of\nthick purplish blood welled from a ragged cut. The oldster chuckled, a\nsound like a seal coughing.\n\"Traitor, they called me. For long they sawed at me\u2014in vain. Then\nthey trussed me and dumped me here. They think to return with weapons\nto complete the task.\"\n\"Weapons? I thought it was illegal!\"\n\"Their evil genius, the Soft One,\" said the Fustian. \"He would provide\nfuel to the Devil himself.\"\n\"The Groaci again,\" said Retief. \"I wonder what their angle is.\"\n\"And I must confess, I told them of you, ere I knew their full\nintentions. Much can I tell you of their doings. But first, I pray, the\nblock and tackle.\"\nRetief found the hoist where the Fustian directed him, maneuvered it\ninto position, hooked onto the edge of the carapace and hauled away.\nThe immense Fustian rose slowly, teetered ... then flopped on his chest.\nSlowly he got to his feet.\n\"My name is Whonk, fleet one,\" he said. \"My cows are yours.\"\n\"Thanks. I'm Retief. I'd like to meet the girls some time. But right\nnow, let's get out of here.\"\nWhonk leaned his bulk against the ponderous stacks of baled kelp,\nbulldozed them aside. \"Slow am I to anger,\" he said, \"but implacable in\nmy wrath. Slock, beware!\"\n\"Hold it,\" said Retief suddenly. He sniffed. \"What's that odor?\" He\nflashed the light around, played it over a dry stain on the floor. He\nknelt, sniffed at the spot.\n\"What kind of cargo was stacked here, Whonk? And where is it now?\"\nWhonk considered. \"There were drums,\" he said. \"Four of them, quite\nsmall, painted an evil green, the property of the Soft Ones, the\nGroaci. They lay here a day and a night. At full dark of the first\nperiod they came with stevedores and loaded them aboard the barge\nMoss\nRock\n.\"\n\"The VIP boat. Who's scheduled to use it?\"\n\"I know not. But what matters this? Let us discuss cargo movements\nafter I have settled a score with certain Youths.\"\n\"We'd better follow this up first, Whonk. There's only one substance I\nknow of that's transported in drums and smells like that blot on the\nfloor. That's titanite: the hottest explosive this side of a uranium\npile.\"\nIII\nBeta was setting as Retief, Whonk puffing at his heels, came up to the\nsentry box beside the gangway leading to the plush interior of the\nofficial luxury space barge\nMoss Rock\n.\n\"A sign of the times,\" said Whonk, glancing inside the empty shelter.\n\"A guard should stand here, but I see him not. Doubtless he crept away\nto sleep.\"\n\"Let's go aboard and take a look around.\"\nThey entered the ship. Soft lights glowed in utter silence. A rough box\nstood on the floor, rollers and pry-bars beside it\u2014a discordant note\nin the muted luxury of the setting. Whonk rummaged in it.\n\"Curious,\" he said. \"What means this?\" He held up a stained cloak of\norange and green, a metal bracelet, papers.\n\"Orange and green,\" mused Relief. \"Whose colors are those?\"\n\"I know not.\" Whonk glanced at the arm-band. \"But this is lettered.\" He\npassed the metal band to Retief.\n\"SCARS,\" Retief read. He looked at Whonk. \"It seems to me I've heard\nthe name before,\" he murmured. \"Let's get back to the Embassy\u2014fast.\"\nBack on the ramp Retief heard a sound ... and turned in time to duck\nthe charge of a hulking Fustian youth who thundered past him and\nfetched up against the broad chest of Whonk, who locked him in a warm\nembrace.\n\"Nice catch, Whonk. Where'd he sneak out of?\"\n\"The lout hid there by the storage bin,\" rumbled Whonk. The captive\nyouth thumped fists and toes fruitlessly against the oldster's carapace.\n\"Hang onto him,\" said Retief. \"He looks like the biting kind.\"\n\"No fear. Clumsy I am, yet not without strength.\"\n\"Ask him where the titanite is tucked away.\"\n\"Speak, witless grub,\" growled Whonk, \"lest I tweak you in twain.\"\nThe youth gurgled.\n\"Better let up before you make a mess of him,\" said Retief. Whonk\nlifted the Youth clear of the floor, then flung him down with a thump\nthat made the ground quiver. The younger Fustian glared up at the\nelder, mouth snapping.\n\"This one was among those who trussed me and hid me away for the\nkilling,\" said Whonk. \"In his repentance he will tell all to his elder.\"\n\"That's the same young squirt that tried to strike up an acquaintance\nwith me on the bus,\" Retief said. \"He gets around.\"\nThe youth scrambled to hands and knees, scuttled for freedom. Retief\nplanted a foot on his dragging cloak; it ripped free. He stared at the\nbare back of the Fustian\u2014\n\"By the Great Egg!\" Whonk exclaimed, tripping the refugee as he tried\nto rise. \"This is no Youth! His carapace has been taken from him!\"\nRetief looked at the scarred back. \"I thought he looked a little old.\nBut I thought\u2014\"\n\"This is not possible,\" Whonk said wonderingly. \"The great nerve trunks\nare deeply involved. Not even the cleverest surgeon could excise the\ncarapace and leave the patient living.\"\n\"It looks like somebody did the trick. But let's take this boy with us\nand get out of here. His folks may come home.\"\n\"Too late,\" said Whonk. Retief turned.\nThree youths came from behind the sheds.\n\"Well,\" Retief said. \"It looks like the SCARS are out in force tonight.\nWhere's your pal?\" he said to the advancing trio. \"The sticky little\nbird with the eye-stalks? Back at his Embassy, leaving you suckers\nholding the bag, I'll bet.\"\n\"Shelter behind me, Retief,\" said Whonk.\n\"Go get 'em, old-timer.\" Retief stooped, picked up one of the pry-bars.\n\"I'll jump around and distract them.\"\nWhonk let out a whistling roar and charged for the immature Fustians.\nThey fanned out ... and one tripped, sprawled on his face. Retief\nwhirled the metal bar he had thrust between the Fustian's legs, slammed\nit against the skull of another, who shook his head, turned on\nRetief ... and bounced off the steel hull of the\nMoss Rock\nas Whonk\ntook him in full charge.\nRetief used the bar on another head. His third blow laid the Fustian\non the pavement, oozing purple. The other two club members departed\nhastily, seriously dented but still mobile.\nRetief leaned on his club, breathing hard. \"Tough heads these kids\nhave got. I'm tempted to chase those two lads down, but I've got\nanother errand to run. I don't know who the Groaci intended to blast,\nbut I have a sneaking suspicion somebody of importance was scheduled\nfor a boat ride in the next few hours. And three drums of titanite is\nenough to vaporize this tub and everyone aboard her.\"\n\"The plot is foiled,\" said Whonk. \"But what reason did they have?\"\n\"The Groaci are behind it. I have an idea the SCARS didn't know about\nthis gambit.\"\n\"Which of these is the leader?\" asked Whonk. He prodded a fallen Youth\nwith a horny toe. \"Arise, dreaming one.\"\n\"Never mind him, Whonk. We'll tie these two up and leave them here. I\nknow where to find the boss.\"\nA stolid crowd filled the low-ceilinged banquet hall. Retief scanned\nthe tables for the pale blobs of Terrestrial faces, dwarfed by the\ngiant armored bodies of the Fustians. Across the room Magnan fluttered\na hand. Retief headed toward him. A low-pitched vibration filled the\nair: the rumble of subsonic Fustian music.\nRetief slid into his place beside Magnan. \"Sorry to be late, Mr.\nAmbassador.\"\n\"I'm honored that you chose to appear at all,\" said Magnan coldly. He\nturned back to the Fustian on his left.\n\"Ah, yes, Mr. Minister,\" he said. \"Charming, most charming. So joyous.\"\nThe Fustian looked at him, beady-eyed. \"It is the\nLament of\nHatching\n,\" he said; \"our National Dirge.\"\n\"Oh,\" said Magnan. \"How interesting. Such a pleasing balance of\ninstruments\u2014\"\n\"It is a droon solo,\" said the Fustian, eyeing the Terrestrial\nAmbassador suspiciously.\n\"Why don't you just admit you can't hear it,\" Retief whispered loudly.\n\"And if I may interrupt a moment\u2014\"\nMagnan cleared his throat. \"Now that our Mr. Retief has arrived,\nperhaps we could rush right along to the Sponsorship ceremonies.\"\n\"This group,\" said Retief, leaning across Magnan, \"the SCARS. How much\ndo you know about them, Mr. Minister?\"\n\"Nothing at all,\" the huge Fustian elder rumbled. \"For my taste, all\nYouths should be kept penned with the livestock until they grow a\ncarapace to tame their irresponsibility.\"\n\"We mustn't lose sight of the importance of channeling youthful\nenergies,\" said Magnan.\n\"Labor gangs,\" said the minister. \"In my youth we were indentured to\nthe dredge-masters. I myself drew a muck sledge.\"\n\"But in these modern times,\" put in Magnan, \"surely it's incumbent on\nus to make happy these golden hours.\"\nThe minister snorted. \"Last week I had a golden hour. They set upon me\nand pelted me with overripe stench-fruit.\"\n\"But this was merely a manifestation of normal youthful frustrations,\"\ncried Magnan. \"Their essential tenderness\u2014\"\n\"You'd not find a tender spot on that lout yonder,\" the minister\nsaid, pointing with a fork at a newly arrived Youth, \"if you drilled\nboreholes and blasted.\"\n\"Why, that's our guest of honor,\" said Magnan, \"a fine young fellow!\nSlop I believe his name is.\"\n\"Slock,\" said Retief. \"Eight feet of armor-plated orneriness. And\u2014\"\nMagnan rose and tapped on his glass. The Fustians winced at the, to\nthem, supersonic vibrations. They looked at each other muttering.\nMagnan tapped louder. The Minister drew in his head, eyes closed. Some\nof the Fustians rose, tottered for the doors; the noise level rose.\nMagnan redoubled his efforts. The glass broke with a clatter and green\nwine gushed on the tablecloth.\n\"What in the name of the Great Egg!\" the Minister muttered. He blinked,\nbreathing deeply.\n\"Oh, forgive me,\" blurted Magnan, dabbing at the wine.\n\"Too bad the glass gave out,\" said Retief. \"In another minute you'd\nhave cleared the hall. And then maybe I could have gotten a word in\nsideways. There's a matter you should know about\u2014\"\n\"Your attention, please,\" Magnan said, rising. \"I see that our fine\nyoung guest has arrived, and I hope that the remainder of his committee\nwill be along in a moment. It is my pleasure to announce that our Mr.\nRetief has had the good fortune to win out in the keen bidding for the\npleasure of sponsoring this lovely group.\"\nRetief tugged at Magnan's sleeve. \"Don't introduce me yet,\" he said. \"I\nwant to appear suddenly. More dramatic, you know.\"\n\"Well,\" murmured Magnan, glancing down at Retief, \"I'm gratified to\nsee you entering into the spirit of the event at last.\" He turned his\nattention back to the assembled guests. \"If our honored guest will join\nme on the rostrum...?\" he said. \"The gentlemen of the press may want to\ncatch a few shots of the presentation.\"\nMagnan stepped up on the low platform at the center of the wide room,\ntook his place beside the robed Fustian youth and beamed at the cameras.\n\"How gratifying it is to take this opportunity to express once more the\ngreat pleasure we have in sponsoring SCARS,\" he said, talking slowly\nfor the benefit of the scribbling reporters. \"We'd like to think that\nin our modest way we're to be a part of all that the SCARS achieve\nduring the years ahead.\"\nMagnan paused as a huge Fustian elder heaved his bulk up the two low\nsteps to the rostrum, approached the guest of honor. He watched as the\nnewcomer paused behind Slock, who did not see the new arrival.\nRetief pushed through the crowd, stepped up to face the Fustian youth.\nSlock stared at him, drew back.\n\"You know me, Slock,\" said Retief loudly. \"An old fellow named Whonk\ntold you about me, just before you tried to saw his head off, remember?\nIt was when I came out to take a look at that battle cruiser you're\nbuilding.\"\nIV\nWith a bellow Slock reached for Retief\u2014and choked off in mid-cry as\nthe Fustian elder, Whonk, pinioned him from behind, lifting him clear\nof the floor.\n\"Glad you reporters happened along,\" said Retief to the gaping newsmen.\n\"Slock here had a deal with a sharp operator from the Groaci Embassy.\nThe Groaci were to supply the necessary hardware and Slock, as foreman\nat the shipyards, was to see that everything was properly installed.\nThe next step, I assume, would have been a local take-over, followed\nby a little interplanetary war on Flamenco or one of the other nearby\nworlds ... for which the Groaci would be glad to supply plenty of ammo.\"\nMagnan found his tongue. \"Are you mad, Retief?\" he screeched. \"This\ngroup was vouched for by the Ministry of Youth!\"\n\"The Ministry's overdue for a purge,\" snapped Retief. He turned back\nto Slock. \"I wonder if you were in on the little diversion that was\nplanned for today. When the\nMoss Rock\nblew, a variety of clues were\nto be planted where they'd be easy to find ... with SCARS written all\nover them. The Groaci would thus have neatly laid the whole affair\nsquarely at the door of the Terrestrial Embassy ... whose sponsorship\nof the SCARS had received plenty of publicity.\"\n\"The\nMoss Rock\n?\" said Magnan. \"But that was\u2014Retief! This is idiotic.\nSlock himself was scheduled to go on a cruise tomorrow!\"\nSlock roared suddenly, twisting violently. Whonk teetered, his grip\nloosened ... and Slock pulled free and was off the platform, butting\nhis way through the milling oldsters on the dining room floor. Magnan\nwatched, open-mouthed.\n\"The Groaci were playing a double game, as usual,\" Retief said. \"They\nintended to dispose of this fellow Slock, once he'd served their\npurpose.\"\n\"Well, don't stand there,\" yelped Magnan over the uproar. \"If Slock is\nthe ring-leader of a delinquent gang...!\" He moved to give chase.\nRetief grabbed his arm. \"Don't jump down there! You'd have as much\nchance of getting through as a jack-rabbit through a threshing contest.\"\nTen minutes later the crowd had thinned slightly. \"We can get through\nnow,\" Whonk called. \"This way.\" He lowered himself to the floor, bulled\nthrough to the exit. Flashbulbs popped. Retief and Magnan followed in\nWhonk's wake.\nIn the lounge Retief grabbed the phone, waited for the operator, gave a\ncode letter. No reply. He tried another.\n\"No good,\" he said after a full minute had passed. \"Wonder what's\nloose?\" He slammed the phone back in its niche. \"Let's grab a cab.\"\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nAIDE MEMOIRE\nBY KEITH LAUMER\nThe Fustians looked like turtles\u2014but\nthey could move fast when they chose!\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nWorlds of If Science Fiction, July 1962.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nAcross the table from Retief, Ambassador Magnan rustled a stiff sheet\nof parchment and looked grave.\n\"This aide memoire,\" he said, \"was just handed to me by the Cultural\nAttache. It's the third on the subject this week. It refers to the\nmatter of sponsorship of Youth groups\u2014\"\n\"Some youths,\" Retief said. \"Average age, seventy-five.\"\n\"The Fustians are a long-lived people,\" Magnan snapped. \"These matters\nare relative. At seventy-five, a male Fustian is at a trying age\u2014\"\n\"That's right. He'll try anything\u2014in the hope it will maim somebody.\"\n\"Precisely the problem,\" Magnan said. \"But the Youth Movement is\nthe important news in today's political situation here on Fust. And\nsponsorship of Youth groups is a shrewd stroke on the part of the\nTerrestrial Embassy. At my suggestion, well nigh every member of the\nmission has leaped at the opportunity to score a few p\u2014that is, cement\nrelations with this emergent power group\u2014the leaders of the future.\nYou, Retief, as Councillor, are the outstanding exception.\"\n\"I'm not convinced these hoodlums need my help in organizing their\nrumbles,\" Retief said. \"Now, if you have a proposal for a pest control\ngroup\u2014\"\n\"To the Fustians this is no jesting matter,\" Magnan cut in. \"This\ngroup\u2014\" he glanced at the paper\u2014\"known as the Sexual, Cultural, and\nAthletic Recreational Society, or SCARS for short, has been awaiting\nsponsorship for a matter of weeks now.\"\n\"Meaning they want someone to buy them a clubhouse, uniforms, equipment\nand anything else they need to complete their sexual, cultural and\nathletic development,\" Retief said.\n\"If we don't act promptly,\" Magnan said, \"the Groaci Embassy may well\nanticipate us. They're very active here.\"\n\"That's an idea,\" said Retief. \"Let 'em. After awhile they'll go broke\ninstead of us.\"\n\"Nonsense. The group requires a sponsor. I can't actually order you to\nstep forward. However....\" Magnan let the sentence hang in the air.\nRetief raised one eyebrow.\n\"For a minute there,\" he said, \"I thought you were going to make a\npositive statement.\"\nMagnan leaned back, lacing his fingers over his stomach. \"I don't think\nyou'll find a diplomat of my experience doing anything so naive,\" he\nsaid.\n\"I like the adult Fustians,\" said Retief. \"Too bad they have to lug\nhalf a ton of horn around on their backs. I wonder if surgery would\nhelp.\"\n\"Great heavens, Retief,\" Magnan sputtered. \"I'm amazed that even you\nwould bring up a matter of such delicacy. A race's unfortunate physical\ncharacteristics are hardly a fit matter for Terrestrial curiosity.\"\n\"Well, of course your experience of the Fustian mentality is greater\nthan mine. I've only been here a month. But it's been my experience,\nMr. Ambassador, that few races are above improving on nature. Otherwise\nyou, for example, would be tripping over your beard.\"\nMagnan shuddered. \"Please\u2014never mention the idea to a Fustian.\"\nRetief stood. \"My own program for the day includes going over to the\ndockyards. There are some features of this new passenger liner the\nFustians are putting together that I want to look into. With your\npermission, Mr. Ambassador...?\"\nMagnan snorted. \"Your pre-occupation with the trivial disturbs me,\nRetief. More interest in substantive matters\u2014such as working with\nYouth groups\u2014would create a far better impression.\"\n\"Before getting too involved with these groups, it might be a good idea\nto find out a little more about them,\" said Retief. \"Who organizes\nthem? There are three strong political parties here on Fust. What's the\nalignment of this SCARS organization?\"\n\"You forget, these are merely teenagers, so to speak,\" Magnan said.\n\"Politics mean nothing to them ... yet.\"\n\"Then there are the Groaci. Why their passionate interest in a\ntwo-horse world like Fust? Normally they're concerned with nothing but\nbusiness. But what has Fust got that they could use?\"\n\"You may rule out the commercial aspect in this instance,\" said Magnan.\n\"Fust possesses a vigorous steel-age manufacturing economy. The Groaci\nare barely ahead of them.\"\n\"Barely,\" said Retief. \"Just over the line into crude atomics ... like\nfission bombs.\"\nMagnan shook his head, turned back to his papers. \"What market exists\nfor such devices on a world at peace? I suggest you address your\nattention to the less spectacular but more rewarding work of studying\nthe social patterns of the local youth.\"\n\"I've studied them,\" said Retief. \"And before I meet any of the local\nyouth socially I want to get myself a good blackjack.\"\nII\nRetief left the sprawling bungalow-type building that housed the\nchancery of the Terrestrial Embassy, swung aboard a passing flat-car\nand leaned back against the wooden guard rail as the heavy vehicle\ntrundled through the city toward the looming gantries of the shipyards.\nIt was a cool morning. A light breeze carried the fishy odor of Fusty\ndwellings across the broad cobbled avenue. A few mature Fustians\nlumbered heavily along in the shade of the low buildings, audibly\nwheezing under the burden of their immense carapaces. Among them,\nshell-less youths trotted briskly on scaly stub legs. The driver of the\nflat-car, a labor-caste Fustian with his guild colors emblazoned on his\nback, heaved at the tiller, swung the unwieldy conveyance through the\nshipyard gates, creaked to a halt.\n\"Thus I come to the shipyard with frightful speed,\" he said in Fustian.\n\"Well I know the way of the naked-backs, who move always in haste.\"\nRetief climbed down, handed him a coin. \"You should take up\nprofessional racing,\" he said. \"Daredevil.\"\nHe crossed the littered yard and tapped at the door of a rambling shed.\nBoards creaked inside. Then the door swung back.\nA gnarled ancient with tarnished facial scales and a weathered carapace\npeered out at Retief.\n\"Long-may-you-sleep,\" said Retief. \"I'd like to take a look around, if\nyou don't mind. I understand you're laying the bedplate for your new\nliner today.\"\n\"May-you-dream-of-the-deeps,\" the old fellow mumbled. He waved a stumpy\narm toward a group of shell-less Fustians standing by a massive hoist.\n\"The youths know more of bedplates than do I, who but tend the place of\npapers.\"\n\"I know how you feel, old-timer,\" said Retief. \"That sounds like the\nstory of my life. Among your papers do you have a set of plans for the\nvessel? I understand it's to be a passenger liner.\"\nThe oldster nodded. He shuffled to a drawing file, rummaged, pulled out\na sheaf of curled prints and spread them on the table. Retief stood\nsilently, running a finger over the uppermost drawing, tracing lines....\n\"What does the naked-back here?\" barked a deep voice behind Retief. He\nturned. A heavy-faced Fustian youth, wrapped in a mantle, stood at the\nopen door. Beady yellow eyes set among fine scales bored into Retief.\n\"I came to take a look at your new liner,\" said Retief.\n\"We need no prying foreigners here,\" the youth snapped. His eye fell on\nthe drawings. He hissed in sudden anger.\n\"Doddering hulk!\" he snapped at the ancient. \"May you toss in\nnightmares! Put by the plans!\"\n\"My mistake,\" Retief said. \"I didn't know this was a secret project.\"\nThe youth hesitated. \"It is not a secret project,\" he muttered. \"Why\nshould it be secret?\"\n\"You tell me.\"\nThe youth worked his jaws and rocked his head from side to side in the\nFusty gesture of uncertainty. \"There is nothing to conceal,\" he said.\n\"We merely construct a passenger liner.\"\n\"Then you don't mind if I look over the drawings,\" said Retief. \"Who\nknows? Maybe some day I'll want to reserve a suite for the trip out.\"\nThe youth turned and disappeared. Retief grinned at the oldster. \"Went\nfor his big brother, I guess,\" he said. \"I have a feeling I won't get\nto study these in peace here. Mind if I copy them?\"\n\"Willingly, light-footed one,\" said the old Fustian. \"And mine is the\nshame for the discourtesy of youth.\"\nRetief took out a tiny camera, flipped a copying lens in place, leafed\nthrough the drawings, clicking the shutter.\n\"A plague on these youths,\" said the oldster, \"who grow more virulent\nday by day.\"\n\"Why don't you elders clamp down?\"\n\"Agile are they and we are slow of foot. And this unrest is new.\nUnknown in my youth was such insolence.\"\n\"The police\u2014\"\n\"Bah!\" the ancient rumbled. \"None have we worthy of the name, nor have\nwe needed ought ere now.\"\n\"What's behind it?\"\n\"They have found leaders. The spiv, Slock, is one. And I fear they plot\nmischief.\" He pointed to the window. \"They come, and a Soft One with\nthem.\"\nRetief pocketed the camera, glanced out the window. A pale-featured\nGroaci with an ornately decorated crest stood with the youths, who eyed\nthe hut, then started toward it.\n\"That's the military attache of the Groaci Embassy,\" Retief said. \"I\nwonder what he and the boys are cooking up together?\"\n\"Naught that augurs well for the dignity of Fust,\" the oldster rumbled.\n\"Flee, agile one, while I engage their attentions.\"\n\"I was just leaving,\" Retief said. \"Which way out?\"\n\"The rear door,\" the Fustian gestured with a stubby member. \"Rest well,\nstranger on these shores.\" He moved to the entrance.\n\"Same to you, pop,\" said Retief. \"And thanks.\"\nHe eased through the narrow back entrance, waited until voices were\nraised at the front of the shed, then strolled off toward the gate.\nThe second dark of the third cycle was lightening when Retief left the\nEmbassy technical library and crossed the corridor to his office. He\nflipped on a light. A note was tucked under a paperweight:\n\"Retief\u2014I shall expect your attendance at the IAS dinner at first\ndark of the fourth cycle. There will be a brief but, I hope, impressive\nSponsorship ceremony for the SCARS group, with full press coverage,\narrangements for which I have managed to complete in spite of your\nintransigence.\"\nRetief snorted and glanced at his watch. Less than three hours. Just\ntime to creep home by flat-car, dress in ceremonial uniform and creep\nback.\nOutside he flagged a lumbering bus. He stationed himself in a corner\nand watched the yellow sun, Beta, rise rapidly above the low skyline.\nThe nearby sea was at high tide now, under the pull of the major sun\nand the three moons, and the stiff breeze carried a mist of salt spray.\nRetief turned up his collar against the dampness. In half an hour he\nwould be perspiring under the vertical rays of a third-noon sun, but\nthe thought failed to keep the chill off.\nTwo Youths clambered up on the platform, moving purposefully toward\nRetief. He moved off the rail, watching them, weight balanced.\n\"That's close enough, kids,\" he said. \"Plenty of room on this scow. No\nneed to crowd up.\"\n\"There are certain films,\" the lead Fustian muttered. His voice was\nunusually deep for a Youth. He was wrapped in a heavy cloak and moved\nawkwardly. His adolescence was nearly at an end, Retief guessed.\n\"I told you once,\" said Retief. \"Don't crowd me.\"\nThe two stepped close, slit mouths snapping in anger. Retief put out a\nfoot, hooked it behind the scaly leg of the overaged juvenile and threw\nhis weight against the cloaked chest. The clumsy Fustian tottered, fell\nheavily. Retief was past him and off the flat-car before the other\nYouth had completed his vain lunge toward the spot Retief had occupied.\nThe Terrestrial waved cheerfully at the pair, hopped aboard another\nvehicle, watched his would-be assailants lumber down from their car,\ntiny heads twisted to follow his retreating figure.\nSo they wanted the film? Retief reflected, thumbing a cigar alight.\nThey were a little late. He had already filed it in the Embassy vault,\nafter running a copy for the reference files.\nAnd a comparison of the drawings with those of the obsolete Mark XXXV\nbattle cruiser used two hundred years earlier by the Concordiat Naval\nArm showed them to be almost identical, gun emplacements and all. The\nterm \"obsolete\" was a relative one. A ship which had been outmoded in\nthe armories of the Galactic Powers could still be king of the walk in\nthe Eastern Arm.\nBut how had these two known of the film? There had been no one present\nbut himself and the old-timer\u2014and he was willing to bet the elderly\nFustian hadn't told them anything.\nAt least not willingly....\nRetief frowned, dropped the cigar over the side, waited until the\nflat-car negotiated a mud-wallow, then swung down and headed for the\nshipyard.\nThe door, hinges torn loose, had been propped loosely back in position.\nRetief looked around at the battered interior of the shed. The old\nfellow had put up a struggle.\nThere were deep drag-marks in the dust behind the building. Retief\nfollowed them across the yard. They disappeared under the steel door of\na warehouse.\nRetief glanced around. Now, at the mid-hour of the fourth cycle, the\nworkmen were heaped along the edge of the refreshment pond, deep in\ntheir siesta. He took a multi-bladed tool from a pocket, tried various\nfittings in the lock. It snicked open.\nHe eased the door aside far enough to enter.\nHeaped bales loomed before him. Snapping on the tiny lamp in the handle\nof the combination tool, Retief looked over the pile. One stack seemed\nout of alignment ... and the dust had been scraped from the floor\nbefore it. He pocketed the light, climbed up on the bales, looked over\ninto a nest made by stacking the bundles around a clear spot. The aged\nFustian lay in it, on his back, a heavy sack tied over his head.\nRetief dropped down inside the ring of bales, sawed at the tough twine\nand pulled the sack free.\n\"It's me, old fellow,\" Retief said. \"The nosy stranger. Sorry I got you\ninto this.\"\nThe oldster threshed his gnarled legs. He rocked slightly and fell\nback. \"A curse on the cradle that rocked their infant slumbers,\" he\nrumbled. \"But place me back on my feet and I hunt down the youth,\nSlock, though he flee to the bottommost muck of the Sea of Torments.\"\n\"How am I going to get you out of here? Maybe I'd better get some help.\"\n\"Nay. The perfidious Youths abound here,\" said the old Fustian. \"It\nwould be your life.\"\n\"I doubt if they'd go that far.\"\n\"Would they not?\" The Fustian stretched his neck. \"Cast your light\nhere. But for the toughness of my hide....\"\nRetief put the beam of the light on the leathery neck. A great smear of\nthick purplish blood welled from a ragged cut. The oldster chuckled, a\nsound like a seal coughing.\n\"Traitor, they called me. For long they sawed at me\u2014in vain. Then\nthey trussed me and dumped me here. They think to return with weapons\nto complete the task.\"\n\"Weapons? I thought it was illegal!\"\n\"Their evil genius, the Soft One,\" said the Fustian. \"He would provide\nfuel to the Devil himself.\"\n\"The Groaci again,\" said Retief. \"I wonder what their angle is.\"\n\"And I must confess, I told them of you, ere I knew their full\nintentions. Much can I tell you of their doings. But first, I pray, the\nblock and tackle.\"\nRetief found the hoist where the Fustian directed him, maneuvered it\ninto position, hooked onto the edge of the carapace and hauled away.\nThe immense Fustian rose slowly, teetered ... then flopped on his chest.\nSlowly he got to his feet.\n\"My name is Whonk, fleet one,\" he said. \"My cows are yours.\"\n\"Thanks. I'm Retief. I'd like to meet the girls some time. But right\nnow, let's get out of here.\"\nWhonk leaned his bulk against the ponderous stacks of baled kelp,\nbulldozed them aside. \"Slow am I to anger,\" he said, \"but implacable in\nmy wrath. Slock, beware!\"\n\"Hold it,\" said Retief suddenly. He sniffed. \"What's that odor?\" He\nflashed the light around, played it over a dry stain on the floor. He\nknelt, sniffed at the spot.\n\"What kind of cargo was stacked here, Whonk? And where is it now?\"\nWhonk considered. \"There were drums,\" he said. \"Four of them, quite\nsmall, painted an evil green, the property of the Soft Ones, the\nGroaci. They lay here a day and a night. At full dark of the first\nperiod they came with stevedores and loaded them aboard the barge\nMoss\nRock\n.\"\n\"The VIP boat. Who's scheduled to use it?\"\n\"I know not. But what matters this? Let us discuss cargo movements\nafter I have settled a score with certain Youths.\"\n\"We'd better follow this up first, Whonk. There's only one substance I\nknow of that's transported in drums and smells like that blot on the\nfloor. That's titanite: the hottest explosive this side of a uranium\npile.\"\nIII\nBeta was setting as Retief, Whonk puffing at his heels, came up to the\nsentry box beside the gangway leading to the plush interior of the\nofficial luxury space barge\nMoss Rock\n.\n\"A sign of the times,\" said Whonk, glancing inside the empty shelter.\n\"A guard should stand here, but I see him not. Doubtless he crept away\nto sleep.\"\n\"Let's go aboard and take a look around.\"\nThey entered the ship. Soft lights glowed in utter silence. A rough box\nstood on the floor, rollers and pry-bars beside it\u2014a discordant note\nin the muted luxury of the setting. Whonk rummaged in it.\n\"Curious,\" he said. \"What means this?\" He held up a stained cloak of\norange and green, a metal bracelet, papers.\n\"Orange and green,\" mused Relief. \"Whose colors are those?\"\n\"I know not.\" Whonk glanced at the arm-band. \"But this is lettered.\" He\npassed the metal band to Retief.\n\"SCARS,\" Retief read. He looked at Whonk. \"It seems to me I've heard\nthe name before,\" he murmured. \"Let's get back to the Embassy\u2014fast.\"\nBack on the ramp Retief heard a sound ... and turned in time to duck\nthe charge of a hulking Fustian youth who thundered past him and\nfetched up against the broad chest of Whonk, who locked him in a warm\nembrace.\n\"Nice catch, Whonk. Where'd he sneak out of?\"\n\"The lout hid there by the storage bin,\" rumbled Whonk. The captive\nyouth thumped fists and toes fruitlessly against the oldster's carapace.\n\"Hang onto him,\" said Retief. \"He looks like the biting kind.\"\n\"No fear. Clumsy I am, yet not without strength.\"\n\"Ask him where the titanite is tucked away.\"\n\"Speak, witless grub,\" growled Whonk, \"lest I tweak you in twain.\"\nThe youth gurgled.\n\"Better let up before you make a mess of him,\" said Retief. Whonk\nlifted the Youth clear of the floor, then flung him down with a thump\nthat made the ground quiver. The younger Fustian glared up at the\nelder, mouth snapping.\n\"This one was among those who trussed me and hid me away for the\nkilling,\" said Whonk. \"In his repentance he will tell all to his elder.\"\n\"That's the same young squirt that tried to strike up an acquaintance\nwith me on the bus,\" Retief said. \"He gets around.\"\nThe youth scrambled to hands and knees, scuttled for freedom. Retief\nplanted a foot on his dragging cloak; it ripped free. He stared at the\nbare back of the Fustian\u2014\n\"By the Great Egg!\" Whonk exclaimed, tripping the refugee as he tried\nto rise. \"This is no Youth! His carapace has been taken from him!\"\nRetief looked at the scarred back. \"I thought he looked a little old.\nBut I thought\u2014\"\n\"This is not possible,\" Whonk said wonderingly. \"The great nerve trunks\nare deeply involved. Not even the cleverest surgeon could excise the\ncarapace and leave the patient living.\"\n\"It looks like somebody did the trick. But let's take this boy with us\nand get out of here. His folks may come home.\"\n\"Too late,\" said Whonk. Retief turned.\nThree youths came from behind the sheds.\n\"Well,\" Retief said. \"It looks like the SCARS are out in force tonight.\nWhere's your pal?\" he said to the advancing trio. \"The sticky little\nbird with the eye-stalks? Back at his Embassy, leaving you suckers\nholding the bag, I'll bet.\"\n\"Shelter behind me, Retief,\" said Whonk.\n\"Go get 'em, old-timer.\" Retief stooped, picked up one of the pry-bars.\n\"I'll jump around and distract them.\"\nWhonk let out a whistling roar and charged for the immature Fustians.\nThey fanned out ... and one tripped, sprawled on his face. Retief\nwhirled the metal bar he had thrust between the Fustian's legs, slammed\nit against the skull of another, who shook his head, turned on\nRetief ... and bounced off the steel hull of the\nMoss Rock\nas Whonk\ntook him in full charge.\nRetief used the bar on another head. His third blow laid the Fustian\non the pavement, oozing purple. The other two club members departed\nhastily, seriously dented but still mobile.\nRetief leaned on his club, breathing hard. \"Tough heads these kids\nhave got. I'm tempted to chase those two lads down, but I've got\nanother errand to run. I don't know who the Groaci intended to blast,\nbut I have a sneaking suspicion somebody of importance was scheduled\nfor a boat ride in the next few hours. And three drums of titanite is\nenough to vaporize this tub and everyone aboard her.\"\n\"The plot is foiled,\" said Whonk. \"But what reason did they have?\"\n\"The Groaci are behind it. I have an idea the SCARS didn't know about\nthis gambit.\"\n\"Which of these is the leader?\" asked Whonk. He prodded a fallen Youth\nwith a horny toe. \"Arise, dreaming one.\"\n\"Never mind him, Whonk. We'll tie these two up and leave them here. I\nknow where to find the boss.\"\nA stolid crowd filled the low-ceilinged banquet hall. Retief scanned\nthe tables for the pale blobs of Terrestrial faces, dwarfed by the\ngiant armored bodies of the Fustians. Across the room Magnan fluttered\na hand. Retief headed toward him. A low-pitched vibration filled the\nair: the rumble of subsonic Fustian music.\nRetief slid into his place beside Magnan. \"Sorry to be late, Mr.\nAmbassador.\"\n\"I'm honored that you chose to appear at all,\" said Magnan coldly. He\nturned back to the Fustian on his left.\n\"Ah, yes, Mr. Minister,\" he said. \"Charming, most charming. So joyous.\"\nThe Fustian looked at him, beady-eyed. \"It is the\nLament of\nHatching\n,\" he said; \"our National Dirge.\"\n\"Oh,\" said Magnan. \"How interesting. Such a pleasing balance of\ninstruments\u2014\"\n\"It is a droon solo,\" said the Fustian, eyeing the Terrestrial\nAmbassador suspiciously.\n\"Why don't you just admit you can't hear it,\" Retief whispered loudly.\n\"And if I may interrupt a moment\u2014\"\nMagnan cleared his throat. \"Now that our Mr. Retief has arrived,\nperhaps we could rush right along to the Sponsorship ceremonies.\"\n\"This group,\" said Retief, leaning across Magnan, \"the SCARS. How much\ndo you know about them, Mr. Minister?\"\n\"Nothing at all,\" the huge Fustian elder rumbled. \"For my taste, all\nYouths should be kept penned with the livestock until they grow a\ncarapace to tame their irresponsibility.\"\n\"We mustn't lose sight of the importance of channeling youthful\nenergies,\" said Magnan.\n\"Labor gangs,\" said the minister. \"In my youth we were indentured to\nthe dredge-masters. I myself drew a muck sledge.\"\n\"But in these modern times,\" put in Magnan, \"surely it's incumbent on\nus to make happy these golden hours.\"\nThe minister snorted. \"Last week I had a golden hour. They set upon me\nand pelted me with overripe stench-fruit.\"\n\"But this was merely a manifestation of normal youthful frustrations,\"\ncried Magnan. \"Their essential tenderness\u2014\"\n\"You'd not find a tender spot on that lout yonder,\" the minister\nsaid, pointing with a fork at a newly arrived Youth, \"if you drilled\nboreholes and blasted.\"\n\"Why, that's our guest of honor,\" said Magnan, \"a fine young fellow!\nSlop I believe his name is.\"\n\"Slock,\" said Retief. \"Eight feet of armor-plated orneriness. And\u2014\"\nMagnan rose and tapped on his glass. The Fustians winced at the, to\nthem, supersonic vibrations. They looked at each other muttering.\nMagnan tapped louder. The Minister drew in his head, eyes closed. Some\nof the Fustians rose, tottered for the doors; the noise level rose.\nMagnan redoubled his efforts. The glass broke with a clatter and green\nwine gushed on the tablecloth.\n\"What in the name of the Great Egg!\" the Minister muttered. He blinked,\nbreathing deeply.\n\"Oh, forgive me,\" blurted Magnan, dabbing at the wine.\n\"Too bad the glass gave out,\" said Retief. \"In another minute you'd\nhave cleared the hall. And then maybe I could have gotten a word in\nsideways. There's a matter you should know about\u2014\"\n\"Your attention, please,\" Magnan said, rising. \"I see that our fine\nyoung guest has arrived, and I hope that the remainder of his committee\nwill be along in a moment. It is my pleasure to announce that our Mr.\nRetief has had the good fortune to win out in the keen bidding for the\npleasure of sponsoring this lovely group.\"\nRetief tugged at Magnan's sleeve. \"Don't introduce me yet,\" he said. \"I\nwant to appear suddenly. More dramatic, you know.\"\n\"Well,\" murmured Magnan, glancing down at Retief, \"I'm gratified to\nsee you entering into the spirit of the event at last.\" He turned his\nattention back to the assembled guests. \"If our honored guest will join\nme on the rostrum...?\" he said. \"The gentlemen of the press may want to\ncatch a few shots of the presentation.\"\nMagnan stepped up on the low platform at the center of the wide room,\ntook his place beside the robed Fustian youth and beamed at the cameras.\n\"How gratifying it is to take this opportunity to express once more the\ngreat pleasure we have in sponsoring SCARS,\" he said, talking slowly\nfor the benefit of the scribbling reporters. \"We'd like to think that\nin our modest way we're to be a part of all that the SCARS achieve\nduring the years ahead.\"\nMagnan paused as a huge Fustian elder heaved his bulk up the two low\nsteps to the rostrum, approached the guest of honor. He watched as the\nnewcomer paused behind Slock, who did not see the new arrival.\nRetief pushed through the crowd, stepped up to face the Fustian youth.\nSlock stared at him, drew back.\n\"You know me, Slock,\" said Retief loudly. \"An old fellow named Whonk\ntold you about me, just before you tried to saw his head off, remember?\nIt was when I came out to take a look at that battle cruiser you're\nbuilding.\"\nIV\nWith a bellow Slock reached for Retief\u2014and choked off in mid-cry as\nthe Fustian elder, Whonk, pinioned him from behind, lifting him clear\nof the floor.\n\"Glad you reporters happened along,\" said Retief to the gaping newsmen.\n\"Slock here had a deal with a sharp operator from the Groaci Embassy.\nThe Groaci were to supply the necessary hardware and Slock, as foreman\nat the shipyards, was to see that everything was properly installed.\nThe next step, I assume, would have been a local take-over, followed\nby a little interplanetary war on Flamenco or one of the other nearby\nworlds ... for which the Groaci would be glad to supply plenty of ammo.\"\nMagnan found his tongue. \"Are you mad, Retief?\" he screeched. \"This\ngroup was vouched for by the Ministry of Youth!\"\n\"The Ministry's overdue for a purge,\" snapped Retief. He turned back\nto Slock. \"I wonder if you were in on the little diversion that was\nplanned for today. When the\nMoss Rock\nblew, a variety of clues were\nto be planted where they'd be easy to find ... with SCARS written all\nover them. The Groaci would thus have neatly laid the whole affair\nsquarely at the door of the Terrestrial Embassy ... whose sponsorship\nof the SCARS had received plenty of publicity.\"\n\"The\nMoss Rock\n?\" said Magnan. \"But that was\u2014Retief! This is idiotic.\nSlock himself was scheduled to go on a cruise tomorrow!\"\nSlock roared suddenly, twisting violently. Whonk teetered, his grip\nloosened ... and Slock pulled free and was off the platform, butting\nhis way through the milling oldsters on the dining room floor. Magnan\nwatched, open-mouthed.\n\"The Groaci were playing a double game, as usual,\" Retief said. \"They\nintended to dispose of this fellow Slock, once he'd served their\npurpose.\"\n\"Well, don't stand there,\" yelped Magnan over the uproar. \"If Slock is\nthe ring-leader of a delinquent gang...!\" He moved to give chase.\nRetief grabbed his arm. \"Don't jump down there! You'd have as much\nchance of getting through as a jack-rabbit through a threshing contest.\"\nTen minutes later the crowd had thinned slightly. \"We can get through\nnow,\" Whonk called. \"This way.\" He lowered himself to the floor, bulled\nthrough to the exit. Flashbulbs popped. Retief and Magnan followed in\nWhonk's wake.\nIn the lounge Retief grabbed the phone, waited for the operator, gave a\ncode letter. No reply. He tried another.\n\"No good,\" he said after a full minute had passed. \"Wonder what's\nloose?\" He slammed the phone back in its niche. \"Let's grab a cab.\"\n", "summary": "Retief, the Terrestrial Ambassador to the planet of Fustian, arrives on the planet to investigate the activities of the Youth Movement, an organization that seeks to overthrow the government of the Groacian Autonomy. He meets with Mr. Magnan, the Foreign Ministry official, who is in charge of the affairs of the planet. Retief questions the motives of the youth movement, and Magnan admits that they have found leaders. He also reveals that they are working on a ship that is similar to the one used two hundred years ago by the Concordiat Naval Arm. When Retief asks about the weapons, he is told that the weapons are being transported to the ship by the ship\u2019s cook, Whonk, who smells of decay. When the ship is attacked, Retief is able to escape by hiding in a nearby cavern.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}

It doesn't\nhappen to be any of your business. I'm still in possession of my wits,\nand I know Peterson can't handle that ship. Furthermore Gladney will\nbe in it too, right along side of that sick girl in there! And Rat,\nget this:\nI'm\ngoing to pilot that ship. Understand? Consulate or\nno Consulate, job or no job, I'm wheeling that crate to Earth because\nthis is an emergency. And the emergency happens to be bigger than my\nposition, to me at any rate.\" His tone dropped to a deadly softness.\n\"Now will you kindly remove your stinking carcass from this office?\"\nUnheeding, Rat swung his eyes around in the gloom and discovered the\nwoman, a nurse in uniform. He blinked at her and she returned the look,\nwavering. She bit her lip and determination flowed back. She met the\nstare of his boring, off-colored eyes. Rat grinned suddenly. Nurse Gray\nalmost smiled back, stopped before the others could see it.\n\"Won't go!\" The Centaurian resumed his fight. \"You not go, lose job,\nblack-listed. Never get another. Look at me. I know.\" He retreated\na precious step to escape a rolled up fist. \"Little ship carry four\nnice. Rip out lockers and bunks. Swing hammocks. Put fuel in water\ntanks. Live on concentrates. Earth hospital fix bellyache afterwards,\nallright. I pilot ship. Yes?\"\n\"No!\" Roberds screamed.\nAlmost in answer, a moan issued from a small side room. The men in the\noffice froze as Nurse Gray ran across the room. She disappeared through\nthe narrow door.\n\"Peterson,\" the field manager ordered, \"come over here and help me\nthrow this rat out....\" He went for Rat. Peterson swung up out of his\nchair with balled fist. The outlander backed rapidly.\n\"No need, no need, no need!\" he said quickly. \"I go.\" Still backing, he\nblindly kicked at the door and stepped into the night.\nWhen the door slammed shut Roberds locked it. Peterson slumped in the\nchair.\n\"Do you mean that, Chief? About taking the ship yourself?\"\n\"True enough.\" Roberds cast an anxious glance at the partly closed\ndoor, lowered his voice. \"It'll cost me my job, but that girl in there\nhas to be taken to a hospital quickly! And it's her luck to be landed\non a planet that doesn't boast even one! So it's Earth ... or she\ndies. I'd feel a lot better too if we could get Gladney to a hospital,\nI'm not too confident of that patching job.\" He pulled a pipe from a\njacket pocket. \"So, might as well kill two birds with one stone ... and\nthat wasn't meant to be funny!\"\nPeterson said nothing, sat watching the door.\n\"Rat has the right idea,\" Roberds continued, \"but I had already thought\nof it. About the bunks and lockers. Greaseball has been out there all\nnight tearing them out. We just\nmight\nbe able to hop by dawn ... and\nhell of a long, grinding hop it will be!\"\nThe nurse came out of the door.\n\"How is she?\" Roberds asked.\n\"Sleeping,\" Gray whispered. \"But sinking....\"\n\"We can take off at dawn, I think.\" He filled the pipe and didn't look\nat her. \"You'll have to spend most of the trip in a hammock.\"\n\"I can take it.\" Suddenly she smiled, wanly. \"I was with the Fleet. How\nlong will it take?\"\n\"Eight days, in\nthat\nship.\"\nRoberds lit his pipe, and carefully hid his emotions. He knew Peterson\nwas harboring the same thoughts. Eight days in space, in a small ship\nmeant for two, and built for planetary surface flights. Eight days in\nthat untrustworthy crate, hurtling to save the lives of that girl and\nGladney.\n\"Who was that ... man? The one you put out?\" Gray asked.\n\"We call him Rat,\" Roberds said.\nShe didn't ask why. She said: \"Why couldn't he pilot the ship, I mean?\nWhat is his record?\"\nPeterson opened his mouth.\n\"Shut up, Peterson!\" the Chief snapped. \"We don't talk about his record\naround here, Miss Gray. It's not a pretty thing to tell.\"\n\"Stow it, Chief,\" said Peterson. \"Miss Gray is no pantywaist.\" He\nturned to the nurse. \"Ever hear of the Sansan massacre?\"\nPatti Gray paled. \"Yes,\" she whispered. \"Was Rat in that?\"\nRoberds shook his head. \"He didn't take part in it. But Rat was\nattached to a very important office at the time, the outpost watch.\nAnd when Mad Barry Sansan and his gang of thugs swooped down on the\nGanymedean colony, there was no warning. Our friend Rat was AWOL.\n\"As to who he is ... well, just one of those freaks from up around\nCentauria somewhere. He's been hanging around all the fields and dumps\non Mars a long time, finally landed up here.\"\n\"But,\" protested Miss Gray, \"I don't understand? I always thought that\nleaving one's post under such circumstances meant execution.\"\nThe Chief Consul nodded. \"It does, usually. But this was a freak case.\nIt would take hours to explain. However, I'll just sum it up in one\nword: politics. Politics, with which Rat had no connection saved him.\"\nThe girl shook her head, more in sympathy than condemnation.\n\"Are you expecting the others in soon?\" she asked. \"It wouldn't be\nright to leave Peterson.\"\n\"They will be in, in a day or two. Peterson will beat it over to Base\nstation for repairs, and to notify Earth we're coming. He'll be all\nright.\"\nAbruptly she stood up. \"Goodnight gentlemen. Call me if I'm needed.\"\nRoberds nodded acknowledgement. The door to the side room closed behind\nher. Peterson hauled his chair over to the desk. He sniffed the air.\n\"Damned rat!\" he whispered harshly. \"They ought to make a law forcing\nhim to wear dark glasses!\"\nRoberds smiled wearily. \"His eyes do get a man, don't they?\"\n\"I'd like to burn 'em out!\" Peterson snarled.\nRat helped Greaseball fill the water tanks to capacity with fuel,\nchecked the concentrated rations and grunted.\nGreaseball looked over the interior and chuckled. \"The boss said strip\nher, and strip her I did. All right, Rat, outside.\" He followed the\nCentaurian out, and pulled the ladder away from the lip of the lock.\nThe two walked across the strip of sandy soil to the office building.\nOn tiptoes, Greaseball poked his head through the door panel. \"All set.\"\nRoberds nodded at him. \"Stick with it!\" and jerked a thumb at Rat\noutside. Grease nodded understanding.\n\"Okay, Rat, you can go to bed now.\" He dropped the ladder against the\nwall and sat on it. \"Good night.\" He watched Rat walk slowly away.\nSwinging down the path towards his own rambling shack, Rat caught a\nsibilant whisper. Pausing, undecided, he heard it again.\n\"Here ... can you see me?\" A white clad arm waved in the gloom. Rat\nregarded the arm in the window. Another impatient gesture, and he\nstepped to the sill.\n\"Yes?\"\u2014in the softest of whispers. The voices of the men in droning\nconversation drifted in. \"What you want?\"\nNothing but silence for a few hanging seconds, and then: \"Can you pilot\nthat ship?\" Her voice was shaky.\nHe didn't answer, stared at her confused. He felt her fear as clearly\nas he detected it in her words.\n\"Well,\ncan\nyou?\" she demanded.\n\"Damn yes!\" he stated simply. \"It now necessary?\"\n\"Very! She is becoming worse. I'm afraid to wait until daylight.\nAnd ... well, we want\nyou\nto pilot it! She refuses to risk\nMr. Roberds' job. She favors you.\"\nRat stepped back, astonished. \"She?\"\nNurse Gray moved from the window and Rat saw the second form in the\nroom, a slight, quiet figure on a small cot. \"My patient,\" Nurse Gray\nexplained. \"She overheard our conversation awhile ago. Quick, please,\ncan you?\"\nRat looked at her and then at the girl on the cot. He vanished from the\nwindow. Almost immediately, he was back again.\n\"When?\" he whispered.\n\"As soon as possible. Yes. Do you know...?\" but he had gone again.\nNurse Gray found herself addressing blackness. On the point of turning,\nshe saw him back again.\n\"Blankets,\" he instructed. \"Wrap in blankets. Cold\u2014hot too. Wrap\ngood!\" And he was gone again. Gray blinked away the illusion he\ndisappeared upwards.\nShe ran over to the girl. \"Judith, if you want to back down, now is the\ntime. He'll be back in a moment.\"\n\"No!\" Judith moaned. \"No!\" Gray smiled in the darkness and began\nwrapping the blankets around her. A light tapping at the window\nannounced the return of Rat. The nurse pushed open the window wide, saw\nhim out there with arms upstretched.\n\"Grit your teeth and hold on! Here we go.\" She picked up the blanketed\ngirl in both arms and walked to the window. Rat took the girl easily as\nshe was swung out, the blackness hid them both. But he appeared again\ninstantly.\n\"Better lock window,\" he cautioned. \"Stall, if Boss call. Back\nsoon....\" and he was gone.\nTo Nurse Gray the fifteen minute wait seemed like hours, impatient\nagonizing hours of tight-lipped anxiety.\nFeet first, she swung through the window, clutching a small bag in her\nhands. She never touched ground. Rat whispered \"Hold tight!\" in her\near and the wind was abruptly yanked from her! The ground fell away\nin a dizzy rush, unseen but felt, in the night! Her feet scraped on\nsome projection, and she felt herself being lifted still higher. Wind\nreturned to her throat, and she breathed again.\n\"I'm sorry,\" she managed to get out, gaspingly. \"I wasn't expecting\nthat. I had forgotten you\u2014\"\n\"\u2014had wings,\" he finished and chuckled. \"So likewise Greaseball.\" The\npale office lights dropped away as they sped over the field. On the far\nhorizon, a tinge of dawn crept along the uneven terrain.\n\"Oh, the bag!\" she gasped. \"I've dropped it.\"\nHe chuckled again. \"Have got. You scare, I catch.\"\nShe didn't see the ship because of the wind in her eyes, but without\nwarning she plummeted down and her feet jarred on the lip of the lock.\n\"Inside. No noise, no light. Easy.\" But in spite of his warning she\ntripped in the darkness. He helped her from the floor and guided her to\nthe hammocks.\n\"Judith?\" she asked.\n\"Here. Beside you, trussed up so tight I can hardly breathe.\"\n\"No talk!\" Rat insisted. \"Much hush-hush needed. Other girl shipshape.\nYou make likewise.\" Forcibly he shoved her into a hammock. \"Wrap up\ntight. Straps tight. When we go, we go fast. Bang!\" And he left her.\n\"Hey! Where are you going now?\"\n\"To get Gladney. He sick too. Hush hush!\" His voice floated back.\n\"Where has he gone?\" Judith called.\n\"Back for another man. Remember the two miners who found us when we\ncrashed? The burly one fell off a rock-bank as they were bringing us\nin. Stove in his ribs pretty badly. The other has a broken arm ...\nhappened once while you were out. They wouldn't let me say anything for\nfear of worrying you.\"\nThe girl did not answer then and a hushed expectancy fell over the\nship. Somewhere aft a small motor was running. Wind whistled past the\nopen lock.\n\"I've caused plenty of trouble haven't I?\" she asked aloud, finally.\n\"This was certainly a fool stunt, and I'm guilty of a lot of fool\nstunts! I just didn't realize until now the\nwhy\nof that law.\"\n\"Don't talk so much,\" the nurse admonished. \"A lot of people have found\nout the\nwhy\nof that law the hard way, just as you are doing, and\nlived to remember it. Until hospitals are built on this forlorn world,\nhumans like you who haven't been properly conditioned will have to stay\nright at home.\"\n\"How about these men that live and work here?\"\n\"They never get here until they've been through the mill first.\nAdenoids, appendix', all the extra parts they can get along without.\"\n\"Well,\" Judith said. \"I've certainly learned my lesson!\"\nGray didn't answer, but from out of the darkness surrounding her came a\nsound remarkably resembling a snort.\n\"Gray?\" Judith asked fearfully.\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Hasn't the pilot been gone an awfully long time?\"\nRat himself provided the answer by alighting at the lip with a jar that\nshook the ship. He was breathing heavily and lugging something in his\narms. The burden groaned.\n\"Gladney!\" Nurse Gray exclaimed.\n\"I got.\" Rat confirmed. \"Yes, Gladney. Damn heavy, Gladney.\"\n\"But how?\" she demanded. \"What of Roberds and Peterson?\"\n\"Trick,\" he sniggered. \"I burn down my shack. Boss run out. I run in.\nVery simple.\" He packed Gladney into the remaining hammock and snapped\nbuckles.\n\"And Peterson?\" she prompted.\n\"Oh yes. Peterson. So sorry about Peterson. Had to fan him.\"\n\"\nFan\nhim? I don't understand.\"\n\"Fan. With chair. Everything all right. I apologized.\" Rat finished up\nand was walking back to the lock. They heard a slight rustling of wings\nas he padded away.\nHe was back instantly, duplicating his feat of a short time ago.\nCursing shouts were slung on the night air, and the deadly spang of\nbullets bounced on the hull! Some entered the lock. The Centaurian\nsnapped it shut. Chunks of lead continued to pound the ship. Rat leaped\nfor the pilot's chair, heavily, a wing drooping.\n\"You've been hurt!\" Gray cried. A small panel light outlined his\nfeatures. She tried to struggle up.\n\"Lie still! We go. Boss get wise.\" With lightning fingers he flicked\nseveral switches on the panel, turned to her. \"Hold belly. Zoom!\"\nGray folded her hands across her stomach and closed her eyes.\nRat unlocked the master level and shoved!\n\"Whew!\" Nurse Gray came back to throbbing awareness, the all too\nfamiliar feeling of a misplaced stomach attempting to force its\ncrowded way into her boots plaguing her. Rockets roared in the rear.\nShe loosened a few straps and twisted over. Judith was still out, her\nface tensed in pain. Gray bit her lip and twisted the other way. The\nCentaurian was grinning at her.\n\"Do you always leave in a hurry?\" she demanded, and instantly wished\nshe hadn't said it. He gave no outward sign.\n\"Long-time sleep,\" he announced. \"Four, five hours maybe.\" The chest\nstrap was lying loose at his side.\n\"That long!\" she was incredulous. \"I'm never out more than three\nhours!\" Unloosening more straps, she sat up, glanced at the control\npanel.\n\"Not taking time,\" he stated simply and pointed to a dial. Gray shook\nher head and looked at the others.\n\"That isn't doing either of them any good!\"\nRat nodded unhappily. \"What's her matter\u2014?\" pointing.\n\"Appendix. Something about this atmosphere sends it haywire. The thing\nitself isn't diseased, but it starts manufacturing poison. Patient dies\nin a week unless it is taken out.\"\n\"Don't know it,\" he said briefly.\n\"Do you mean to say you don't have an appendix?\" she demanded.\nRat folded his arms and considered this. \"Don't know. Maybe yes, maybe\nno. Where's it hurt?\"\nGray pointed out the location. The Centaurian considered this further\nand drifted into long contemplation. Watching him, Gray remembered his\neyes that night ... only\nlast\nnight ... in the office. Peterson had\nrefused to meet them. After awhile Rat came out of it.\n\"No,\" he waved. \"No appendix. Never nowhere appendix.\"\n\"Then Mother Nature has finally woke up!\" she exclaimed. \"But why do\nCentaurians rate it exclusively?\"\nRat ignored this and asked one of her. \"What you and her doing up\nthere?\" He pointed back and up, to where Mars obliterated the stars.\n\"You might call it a pleasure jaunt. She's only seventeen. We came over\nin a cruiser belonging to her father; it was rather large and easy to\nhandle. But the cruise ended when she lost control of the ship because\nof an attack of space-appendicitis. The rest you know.\"\n\"So you?\"\n\"So I'm a combination nurse, governess, guard and what have you. Or\nwill be until we get back. After this, I'll probably be looking for\nwork.\" She shivered.\n\"Cold?\" he inquired concernedly.\n\"On the contrary, I'm too warm.\" She started to remove the blanket. Rat\nthrew up a hand to stop her.\n\"Leave on! Hot out here.\"\n\"But I'm too hot now. I want to take it off!\"\n\"No. Leave on. Wool blanket. Keep in body heat, yes. Keep out cold,\nyes. Keep in, keep out, likewise. See?\"\nGray stared at him. \"I never thought of it that way before. Why of\ncourse! If it protects from one temperature, it will protect from\nanother. Isn't it silly of me not to know that?\" Heat pressing on her\nface accented the fact.\n\"What is your name?\" she asked. \"Your real one I mean.\"\nHe grinned. \"Big. You couldn't say it. Sound like Christmas and\nbottlenose together real fast. Just say Rat. Everybody does.\" His eyes\nswept the panel and flashed back to her. \"Your name Gray. Have a front\nname?\"\n\"Patti.\"\n\"Pretty, Patti.\"\n\"No, just Patti. Say, what's the matter with the cooling system?\"\n\"Damn punk,\" he said. \"This crate for surface work. No space. Cooling\nsystem groan, damn punk. Won't keep cool here.\"\n\"And ...\" she followed up, \"it will get warmer as we go out?\"\nRat turned back to his board in a brown study and carefully ignored\nher. Gray grasped an inkling of what the coming week could bring.\n\"But how about water?\" she demanded next. \"Is there enough?\"\nHe faced about. \"For her\u2014\" nodding to Judith, \"and him\u2014\" to Gladney,\n\"yes. Sparingly. Four hours every time, maybe.\" Back to Gray. \"You,\nme ... twice a day. Too bad.\" His eyes drifted aft to the tank of\nwater. She followed. \"One tank water. All the rest fuel. Too bad, too\nbad. We get thirsty I think.\"\nThey did get thirsty, soon. A damnable hot thirst accented by\nthe knowledge that water was precious, a thirst increased by a\ndried-up-in-the-mouth sensation. Their first drink was strangely\nbitter; tragically disappointing. Patti Gray suddenly swung upright in\nthe hammock and kicked her legs. She massaged her throat with a nervous\nhand, wiped damp hair from about her face.\n\"I have to have a drink.\"\nRat stared at her without answer.\n\"I said, I have to have a drink!\"\n\"Heard you.\"\n\"Well...?\"\n\"Well, nothing. Stall. Keep water longer.\"\nShe swung a vicious boot and missed by inches. Rat grinned, and made\nhis way aft, hand over hand. He treaded cautiously along the deck. \"Do\nlike this,\" he called over his shoulder. \"Gravity punk too. Back and\nunder, gravity.\" He waited until she joined him at the water tap.\nThey stood there glaring idiotically at each other.\nShe burst out laughing. \"They even threw the drinking cups out!\" Rat\ninched the handle grudgingly and she applied lips to the faucet.\n\"Faugh!\" Gray sprang back, forgot herself and lost her balance, sat\ndown on the deck and spat out the water. \"It's hot! It tastes like hell\nand it's hot! It must be fuel!\"\nRat applied his lips to the tap and sampled. Coming up with a mouthful\nhe swished it around on his tongue like mouthwash. Abruptly he\ncontrived a facial contortion between a grin and a grimace, and let\nsome of the water trickle from the edges of his mouth. He swallowed and\nit cost him something.\n\"No. I mean yes, I think. Water, no doubt. Yes. Fuel out, water in.\nSwish-swush. Dammit, Greaseball forget to wash tank!\"\n\"But what makes it so hot?\" She worked her mouth to dry-rinse the taste\nof the fuel.\n\"Ship get hot. Water on sun side. H-m-m-m-m-m-m.\"\n\"H-m-m-m-m-m-m-m what?\"\n\"Flip-flop.\" He could talk with his hands as well. \"Hot side over like\npancake.\" Rat hobbled over to the board and sat down. An experimental\nflick on a lever produced nothing. Another flick, this time followed by\na quivering jar. He contemplated the panel board while fastening his\nbelt.\n\"H-m-m-m-m-m-m,\" the lower lip protruded.\nGray protested. \"Oh, stop humming and do something! That wa\u2014\" the\nword was queerly torn from her throat, and a scream magically filled\nthe vacancy. Nurse Gray sat up and rubbed a painful spot that had\nsuddenly appeared on her arm. She found her nose bleeding and another\nnew, swelling bruise on the side of her head. Around her the place was\nempty. Bare.\nNo, not quite. A wispy something was hanging just out of sight in\nthe corner of the eye; the water tap was now moulded\nupward\n, beads\nglistening on its handle. The wispy thing caught her attention again\nand she looked up.\nTwo people, tightly wrapped and bound in hammocks, were staring down at\nher, amazed, swinging on their stomachs. Craning further, she saw Rat.\nHe was hanging upside down in the chair, grinning at her in reverse.\n\"Flip-flop,\" he laconically explained.\n\"For cripes sakes, Jehosaphat!\" Gladney groaned. \"Turn me over on my\nback! Do something!\" Gray stood on tiptoes and just could pivot the\nhammocks on their rope-axis.\n\"And now, please, just\nhow\ndo I get into mine?\" she bit at Rat.\nExistence dragged. Paradoxically, time dropped away like a cloak as\nthe sense of individual hours and minutes vanished, and into its place\ncrept a slow-torturing substitute. As the ship revolved, monotonously,\nfirst the ceiling and then the floor took on dullish, maddening\naspects, eyes ached continuously from staring at them time and again\nwithout surcease. The steady, drumming rockets crashed into the mind\nand the walls shrieked malevolently on the eyeballs. Dull, throbbing\nsameness of the poorly filtered air, a growing taint in the nostrils.\nDamp warm skin, reeking blankets. The taste of fuel in the mouth for\nrefreshment. Slowly mounting mental duress. And above all the drumming\nof the rockets.\nOnce, a sudden, frightening change of pitch in the rockets and a wild,\nsickening lurch. Meteor rain. Maddening, plunging swings to the far\nright and left, made without warning. A torn lip as a sudden lurch\ntears the faucet from her mouth. A shattered tooth.\n\"Sorry!\" Rat whispered.\n\"Shut up and drive!\" she cried.\n\"Patti ...\" Judith called out, in pain.\nPeace of mind followed peace of body into a forgotten limbo of lost\nthings, a slyly climbing madness directed at one another. Waspish\nwords uttered in pain, fatigue and temper. Fractiousness. A hot,\nconfined, stale hell. Sleep became a hollow mockery, as bad water\nand concentrated tablets brought on stomach pains to plague them.\nConsciousness punctured only by spasms of lethargy, shared to some\nextent by the invalids. Above all, crawling lassitude and incalescent\ntempers.\nRat watched the white, drawn face swing in the hammock beside him. And\nhis hands never faltered on the controls.\nNever a slackening of the terrific pace; abnormal speed, gruelling\ndrive ... drive ... drive. Fear. Tantalizing fear made worse because\nRat couldn't understand. Smothered moaning that ate at his nerves.\nGrim-faced, sleep-wracked, belted to the chair, driving!\n\"How many days? How many days!\" Gray begged of him thousands of times\nuntil the very repetition grated on her eardrums. \"How many days?\"\nHis only answer was an inhuman snarl, and the cruel blazing of those\ninhuman eyes.\nShe fell face first to the floor. \"I can't keep it up!\" she cried. The\nsound of her voice rolled along the hot steel deck. \"I cant! I cant!\"\nA double handful of tepid water was thrown in her face. \"Get up!\" Rat\nstood over her, face twisted, his body hunched. \"Get up!\" She stared at\nhim, dazed. He kicked her. \"Get up!\" The tepid water ran off her face\nand far away she heard Judith calling.... She forced herself up. Rat\nwas back in the chair.\nGladney unexpectedly exploded. He had been awake for a long time,\nwatching Rat at the board. Wrenching loose a chest strap he attempted\nto sit up.\n\"Rat! Damn you Rat, listen to me!\nWhen're you going to start braking\n,\nRat?\"\n\"I hear you.\" He turned on Gladney with dulled eyes. \"Lie down. You\nsick.\"\n\"I'll be damned if I'm going to lie here and let you drive us to Orion!\nWe must be near the half-way line! When are you going to start braking?\"\n\"Not brake,\" Rat answered sullenly. \"No, not brake.\"\n\"\nNot brake?\n\" Gladney screamed and sat bolt upright. Nurse Gray jumped\nfor him. \"Are you crazy, you skinny rat?\" Gray secured a hold on his\nshoulders and forced him down. \"You gotta brake! Don't you understand\nthat? You have to, you vacuum-skull!\" Gray was pleading with him to\nshut-up like a good fellow. He appealed to her. \"He's gotta brake! Make\nhim!\"\n\"He has a good point there, Rat,\" she spoke up. \"What about this\nhalf-way line?\"\nHe turned to her with a weary ghost of the old smile on his face. \"We\npassed line. Three days ago, maybe.\" A shrug of shoulders.\n\"Passed!\" Gray and Gladney exclaimed in unison.\n\"You catch on quick,\" Rat nodded. \"This six day, don't you know?\"\nGladney sank back, exhausted. The nurse crept over to the pilot.\n\"Getting your figures mixed, aren't you?\"\nRat shook his head and said nothing.\n\"But Roberds said eight days, and he\u2014\"\n\"\u2014he on Mars. I here. Boss nuts, too sad. He drive, it be eight days.\nNow only six.\" He cast a glance at Judith and found her eyes closed.\n\"Six days, no brake. No.\"\n\"I see your point, and appreciate it,\" Gray cut in. \"But now what? This\ndeceleration business ... there is a whole lot I don't know, but some\nthings I do!\"\nRat refused the expected answer. \"Land tonight, I think. Never been to\nEarth before. Somebody meet us, I think.\"\n\"You can bet your leather boots somebody will meet us!\" Gladney cried.\nGray turned to him. \"The Chief'll have the whole planet waiting for\nyou\n!\" He laughed with real satisfaction. \"Oh yes, Rat, they'll be\nsomebody waiting for us all right.\" And then he added: \"If we land.\"\n\"Oh, we land.\" Rat confided, glad to share a secret.\n\"Yeah,\" Gladney grated. \"But in how many little pieces?\"\n\"I've never been to Earth before. Nice, I think.\" Patti Gray caught\nsomething new in the tone and stared at him. Gladney must have noticed\nit, too.\nThe Centaurian moved sideways and pointed. Gray placed her eyes in the\nvacated position.\n\"Earth!\" she shouted.\n\"Quite. Nice. Do me a favor?\"\n\"Just name it!\"\n\"Not drink long time. Some water?\"\nGray nodded and went to the faucet. The drumming seemed remote, the\ntension vanished. She was an uncommonly long time in returning, at last\nshe appeared beside him, outstretched hands dry.\n\"There isn't any left, Rat.\"\nRat batted his tired eyes expressively. \"Tasted punk,\" he grinned at\nher.\nShe sat down on the floor suddenly and buried her face.\n\"Rat,\" she said presently, \"I want to ask you something, rather\npersonal? Your ... name. 'Rat'? Roberds told me something about your\nrecord. But ... please tell me, Rat. You didn't know the attack was\ncoming, did you?\"\nHe grinned again and waggled his head at her. \"No. Who tell Rat?\"\nSuddenly he was deadly serious as he spoke to her. \"Rat a.w.o.l., go\nout to help sick man alone in desert. Rat leave post. Not time send\ncall through. Come back with man, find horrible thing happen.\"\n\"But why didn't you explain?\"\nHe grinned again. \"Who believe? Sick man die soon after.\"\nGladney sat up. He had heard the conversation between the two. \"You're\nright, Rat. No one would have believed you then, and no one will now.\nYou've been safe enough on Mars, but the police will nab you as soon as\nyou get out of the ship.\"\n\"They can't!\" cried Patti Gray. \"They can't hurt him after what he's\ndone now.\"\nThe Centaurian grinned in a cynical way.\n\"Police not get me, Gladney. Gladney's memory damn punk, I think. Earth\npretty nice place, maybe. But not for Rat.\"\nGladney stared at him for minutes. Then: \"Say, I get it ... you're\u2014\"\n\"Shut up!\" Rat cut him off sharply. \"You talk too much.\" He cast a\nglance at Nurse Gray and then threw a meaning look at Gladney.\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nPRISON PLANET\nBy BOB TUCKER\nTo remain on Mars meant death from agonizing\nspace-sickness, but Earth-surgery lay\ndays of flight away. And there was only\na surface rocket in which to escape\u2014with\na traitorous Ganymedean for its pilot.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Fall 1942.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\"Listen, Rat!\" Roberds said, \"what\nI\nsay goes around here. It doesn't\nhappen to be any of your business. I'm still in possession of my wits,\nand I know Peterson can't handle that ship. Furthermore Gladney will\nbe in it too, right along side of that sick girl in there! And Rat,\nget this:\nI'm\ngoing to pilot that ship. Understand? Consulate or\nno Consulate, job or no job, I'm wheeling that crate to Earth because\nthis is an emergency. And the emergency happens to be bigger than my\nposition, to me at any rate.\" His tone dropped to a deadly softness.\n\"Now will you kindly remove your stinking carcass from this office?\"\nUnheeding, Rat swung his eyes around in the gloom and discovered the\nwoman, a nurse in uniform. He blinked at her and she returned the look,\nwavering. She bit her lip and determination flowed back. She met the\nstare of his boring, off-colored eyes. Rat grinned suddenly. Nurse Gray\nalmost smiled back, stopped before the others could see it.\n\"Won't go!\" The Centaurian resumed his fight. \"You not go, lose job,\nblack-listed. Never get another. Look at me. I know.\" He retreated\na precious step to escape a rolled up fist. \"Little ship carry four\nnice. Rip out lockers and bunks. Swing hammocks. Put fuel in water\ntanks. Live on concentrates. Earth hospital fix bellyache afterwards,\nallright. I pilot ship. Yes?\"\n\"No!\" Roberds screamed.\nAlmost in answer, a moan issued from a small side room. The men in the\noffice froze as Nurse Gray ran across the room. She disappeared through\nthe narrow door.\n\"Peterson,\" the field manager ordered, \"come over here and help me\nthrow this rat out....\" He went for Rat. Peterson swung up out of his\nchair with balled fist. The outlander backed rapidly.\n\"No need, no need, no need!\" he said quickly. \"I go.\" Still backing, he\nblindly kicked at the door and stepped into the night.\nWhen the door slammed shut Roberds locked it. Peterson slumped in the\nchair.\n\"Do you mean that, Chief? About taking the ship yourself?\"\n\"True enough.\" Roberds cast an anxious glance at the partly closed\ndoor, lowered his voice. \"It'll cost me my job, but that girl in there\nhas to be taken to a hospital quickly! And it's her luck to be landed\non a planet that doesn't boast even one! So it's Earth ... or she\ndies. I'd feel a lot better too if we could get Gladney to a hospital,\nI'm not too confident of that patching job.\" He pulled a pipe from a\njacket pocket. \"So, might as well kill two birds with one stone ... and\nthat wasn't meant to be funny!\"\nPeterson said nothing, sat watching the door.\n\"Rat has the right idea,\" Roberds continued, \"but I had already thought\nof it. About the bunks and lockers. Greaseball has been out there all\nnight tearing them out. We just\nmight\nbe able to hop by dawn ... and\nhell of a long, grinding hop it will be!\"\nThe nurse came out of the door.\n\"How is she?\" Roberds asked.\n\"Sleeping,\" Gray whispered. \"But sinking....\"\n\"We can take off at dawn, I think.\" He filled the pipe and didn't look\nat her. \"You'll have to spend most of the trip in a hammock.\"\n\"I can take it.\" Suddenly she smiled, wanly. \"I was with the Fleet. How\nlong will it take?\"\n\"Eight days, in\nthat\nship.\"\nRoberds lit his pipe, and carefully hid his emotions. He knew Peterson\nwas harboring the same thoughts. Eight days in space, in a small ship\nmeant for two, and built for planetary surface flights. Eight days in\nthat untrustworthy crate, hurtling to save the lives of that girl and\nGladney.\n\"Who was that ... man? The one you put out?\" Gray asked.\n\"We call him Rat,\" Roberds said.\nShe didn't ask why. She said: \"Why couldn't he pilot the ship, I mean?\nWhat is his record?\"\nPeterson opened his mouth.\n\"Shut up, Peterson!\" the Chief snapped. \"We don't talk about his record\naround here, Miss Gray. It's not a pretty thing to tell.\"\n\"Stow it, Chief,\" said Peterson. \"Miss Gray is no pantywaist.\" He\nturned to the nurse. \"Ever hear of the Sansan massacre?\"\nPatti Gray paled. \"Yes,\" she whispered. \"Was Rat in that?\"\nRoberds shook his head. \"He didn't take part in it. But Rat was\nattached to a very important office at the time, the outpost watch.\nAnd when Mad Barry Sansan and his gang of thugs swooped down on the\nGanymedean colony, there was no warning. Our friend Rat was AWOL.\n\"As to who he is ... well, just one of those freaks from up around\nCentauria somewhere. He's been hanging around all the fields and dumps\non Mars a long time, finally landed up here.\"\n\"But,\" protested Miss Gray, \"I don't understand? I always thought that\nleaving one's post under such circumstances meant execution.\"\nThe Chief Consul nodded. \"It does, usually. But this was a freak case.\nIt would take hours to explain. However, I'll just sum it up in one\nword: politics. Politics, with which Rat had no connection saved him.\"\nThe girl shook her head, more in sympathy than condemnation.\n\"Are you expecting the others in soon?\" she asked. \"It wouldn't be\nright to leave Peterson.\"\n\"They will be in, in a day or two. Peterson will beat it over to Base\nstation for repairs, and to notify Earth we're coming. He'll be all\nright.\"\nAbruptly she stood up. \"Goodnight gentlemen. Call me if I'm needed.\"\nRoberds nodded acknowledgement. The door to the side room closed behind\nher. Peterson hauled his chair over to the desk. He sniffed the air.\n\"Damned rat!\" he whispered harshly. \"They ought to make a law forcing\nhim to wear dark glasses!\"\nRoberds smiled wearily. \"His eyes do get a man, don't they?\"\n\"I'd like to burn 'em out!\" Peterson snarled.\nRat helped Greaseball fill the water tanks to capacity with fuel,\nchecked the concentrated rations and grunted.\nGreaseball looked over the interior and chuckled. \"The boss said strip\nher, and strip her I did. All right, Rat, outside.\" He followed the\nCentaurian out, and pulled the ladder away from the lip of the lock.\nThe two walked across the strip of sandy soil to the office building.\nOn tiptoes, Greaseball poked his head through the door panel. \"All set.\"\nRoberds nodded at him. \"Stick with it!\" and jerked a thumb at Rat\noutside. Grease nodded understanding.\n\"Okay, Rat, you can go to bed now.\" He dropped the ladder against the\nwall and sat on it. \"Good night.\" He watched Rat walk slowly away.\nSwinging down the path towards his own rambling shack, Rat caught a\nsibilant whisper. Pausing, undecided, he heard it again.\n\"Here ... can you see me?\" A white clad arm waved in the gloom. Rat\nregarded the arm in the window. Another impatient gesture, and he\nstepped to the sill.\n\"Yes?\"\u2014in the softest of whispers. The voices of the men in droning\nconversation drifted in. \"What you want?\"\nNothing but silence for a few hanging seconds, and then: \"Can you pilot\nthat ship?\" Her voice was shaky.\nHe didn't answer, stared at her confused. He felt her fear as clearly\nas he detected it in her words.\n\"Well,\ncan\nyou?\" she demanded.\n\"Damn yes!\" he stated simply. \"It now necessary?\"\n\"Very! She is becoming worse. I'm afraid to wait until daylight.\nAnd ... well, we want\nyou\nto pilot it! She refuses to risk\nMr. Roberds' job. She favors you.\"\nRat stepped back, astonished. \"She?\"\nNurse Gray moved from the window and Rat saw the second form in the\nroom, a slight, quiet figure on a small cot. \"My patient,\" Nurse Gray\nexplained. \"She overheard our conversation awhile ago. Quick, please,\ncan you?\"\nRat looked at her and then at the girl on the cot. He vanished from the\nwindow. Almost immediately, he was back again.\n\"When?\" he whispered.\n\"As soon as possible. Yes. Do you know...?\" but he had gone again.\nNurse Gray found herself addressing blackness. On the point of turning,\nshe saw him back again.\n\"Blankets,\" he instructed. \"Wrap in blankets. Cold\u2014hot too. Wrap\ngood!\" And he was gone again. Gray blinked away the illusion he\ndisappeared upwards.\nShe ran over to the girl. \"Judith, if you want to back down, now is the\ntime. He'll be back in a moment.\"\n\"No!\" Judith moaned. \"No!\" Gray smiled in the darkness and began\nwrapping the blankets around her. A light tapping at the window\nannounced the return of Rat. The nurse pushed open the window wide, saw\nhim out there with arms upstretched.\n\"Grit your teeth and hold on! Here we go.\" She picked up the blanketed\ngirl in both arms and walked to the window. Rat took the girl easily as\nshe was swung out, the blackness hid them both. But he appeared again\ninstantly.\n\"Better lock window,\" he cautioned. \"Stall, if Boss call. Back\nsoon....\" and he was gone.\nTo Nurse Gray the fifteen minute wait seemed like hours, impatient\nagonizing hours of tight-lipped anxiety.\nFeet first, she swung through the window, clutching a small bag in her\nhands. She never touched ground. Rat whispered \"Hold tight!\" in her\near and the wind was abruptly yanked from her! The ground fell away\nin a dizzy rush, unseen but felt, in the night! Her feet scraped on\nsome projection, and she felt herself being lifted still higher. Wind\nreturned to her throat, and she breathed again.\n\"I'm sorry,\" she managed to get out, gaspingly. \"I wasn't expecting\nthat. I had forgotten you\u2014\"\n\"\u2014had wings,\" he finished and chuckled. \"So likewise Greaseball.\" The\npale office lights dropped away as they sped over the field. On the far\nhorizon, a tinge of dawn crept along the uneven terrain.\n\"Oh, the bag!\" she gasped. \"I've dropped it.\"\nHe chuckled again. \"Have got. You scare, I catch.\"\nShe didn't see the ship because of the wind in her eyes, but without\nwarning she plummeted down and her feet jarred on the lip of the lock.\n\"Inside. No noise, no light. Easy.\" But in spite of his warning she\ntripped in the darkness. He helped her from the floor and guided her to\nthe hammocks.\n\"Judith?\" she asked.\n\"Here. Beside you, trussed up so tight I can hardly breathe.\"\n\"No talk!\" Rat insisted. \"Much hush-hush needed. Other girl shipshape.\nYou make likewise.\" Forcibly he shoved her into a hammock. \"Wrap up\ntight. Straps tight. When we go, we go fast. Bang!\" And he left her.\n\"Hey! Where are you going now?\"\n\"To get Gladney. He sick too. Hush hush!\" His voice floated back.\n\"Where has he gone?\" Judith called.\n\"Back for another man. Remember the two miners who found us when we\ncrashed? The burly one fell off a rock-bank as they were bringing us\nin. Stove in his ribs pretty badly. The other has a broken arm ...\nhappened once while you were out. They wouldn't let me say anything for\nfear of worrying you.\"\nThe girl did not answer then and a hushed expectancy fell over the\nship. Somewhere aft a small motor was running. Wind whistled past the\nopen lock.\n\"I've caused plenty of trouble haven't I?\" she asked aloud, finally.\n\"This was certainly a fool stunt, and I'm guilty of a lot of fool\nstunts! I just didn't realize until now the\nwhy\nof that law.\"\n\"Don't talk so much,\" the nurse admonished. \"A lot of people have found\nout the\nwhy\nof that law the hard way, just as you are doing, and\nlived to remember it. Until hospitals are built on this forlorn world,\nhumans like you who haven't been properly conditioned will have to stay\nright at home.\"\n\"How about these men that live and work here?\"\n\"They never get here until they've been through the mill first.\nAdenoids, appendix', all the extra parts they can get along without.\"\n\"Well,\" Judith said. \"I've certainly learned my lesson!\"\nGray didn't answer, but from out of the darkness surrounding her came a\nsound remarkably resembling a snort.\n\"Gray?\" Judith asked fearfully.\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Hasn't the pilot been gone an awfully long time?\"\nRat himself provided the answer by alighting at the lip with a jar that\nshook the ship. He was breathing heavily and lugging something in his\narms. The burden groaned.\n\"Gladney!\" Nurse Gray exclaimed.\n\"I got.\" Rat confirmed. \"Yes, Gladney. Damn heavy, Gladney.\"\n\"But how?\" she demanded. \"What of Roberds and Peterson?\"\n\"Trick,\" he sniggered. \"I burn down my shack. Boss run out. I run in.\nVery simple.\" He packed Gladney into the remaining hammock and snapped\nbuckles.\n\"And Peterson?\" she prompted.\n\"Oh yes. Peterson. So sorry about Peterson. Had to fan him.\"\n\"\nFan\nhim? I don't understand.\"\n\"Fan. With chair. Everything all right. I apologized.\" Rat finished up\nand was walking back to the lock. They heard a slight rustling of wings\nas he padded away.\nHe was back instantly, duplicating his feat of a short time ago.\nCursing shouts were slung on the night air, and the deadly spang of\nbullets bounced on the hull! Some entered the lock. The Centaurian\nsnapped it shut. Chunks of lead continued to pound the ship. Rat leaped\nfor the pilot's chair, heavily, a wing drooping.\n\"You've been hurt!\" Gray cried. A small panel light outlined his\nfeatures. She tried to struggle up.\n\"Lie still! We go. Boss get wise.\" With lightning fingers he flicked\nseveral switches on the panel, turned to her. \"Hold belly. Zoom!\"\nGray folded her hands across her stomach and closed her eyes.\nRat unlocked the master level and shoved!\n\"Whew!\" Nurse Gray came back to throbbing awareness, the all too\nfamiliar feeling of a misplaced stomach attempting to force its\ncrowded way into her boots plaguing her. Rockets roared in the rear.\nShe loosened a few straps and twisted over. Judith was still out, her\nface tensed in pain. Gray bit her lip and twisted the other way. The\nCentaurian was grinning at her.\n\"Do you always leave in a hurry?\" she demanded, and instantly wished\nshe hadn't said it. He gave no outward sign.\n\"Long-time sleep,\" he announced. \"Four, five hours maybe.\" The chest\nstrap was lying loose at his side.\n\"That long!\" she was incredulous. \"I'm never out more than three\nhours!\" Unloosening more straps, she sat up, glanced at the control\npanel.\n\"Not taking time,\" he stated simply and pointed to a dial. Gray shook\nher head and looked at the others.\n\"That isn't doing either of them any good!\"\nRat nodded unhappily. \"What's her matter\u2014?\" pointing.\n\"Appendix. Something about this atmosphere sends it haywire. The thing\nitself isn't diseased, but it starts manufacturing poison. Patient dies\nin a week unless it is taken out.\"\n\"Don't know it,\" he said briefly.\n\"Do you mean to say you don't have an appendix?\" she demanded.\nRat folded his arms and considered this. \"Don't know. Maybe yes, maybe\nno. Where's it hurt?\"\nGray pointed out the location. The Centaurian considered this further\nand drifted into long contemplation. Watching him, Gray remembered his\neyes that night ... only\nlast\nnight ... in the office. Peterson had\nrefused to meet them. After awhile Rat came out of it.\n\"No,\" he waved. \"No appendix. Never nowhere appendix.\"\n\"Then Mother Nature has finally woke up!\" she exclaimed. \"But why do\nCentaurians rate it exclusively?\"\nRat ignored this and asked one of her. \"What you and her doing up\nthere?\" He pointed back and up, to where Mars obliterated the stars.\n\"You might call it a pleasure jaunt. She's only seventeen. We came over\nin a cruiser belonging to her father; it was rather large and easy to\nhandle. But the cruise ended when she lost control of the ship because\nof an attack of space-appendicitis. The rest you know.\"\n\"So you?\"\n\"So I'm a combination nurse, governess, guard and what have you. Or\nwill be until we get back. After this, I'll probably be looking for\nwork.\" She shivered.\n\"Cold?\" he inquired concernedly.\n\"On the contrary, I'm too warm.\" She started to remove the blanket. Rat\nthrew up a hand to stop her.\n\"Leave on! Hot out here.\"\n\"But I'm too hot now. I want to take it off!\"\n\"No. Leave on. Wool blanket. Keep in body heat, yes. Keep out cold,\nyes. Keep in, keep out, likewise. See?\"\nGray stared at him. \"I never thought of it that way before. Why of\ncourse! If it protects from one temperature, it will protect from\nanother. Isn't it silly of me not to know that?\" Heat pressing on her\nface accented the fact.\n\"What is your name?\" she asked. \"Your real one I mean.\"\nHe grinned. \"Big. You couldn't say it. Sound like Christmas and\nbottlenose together real fast. Just say Rat. Everybody does.\" His eyes\nswept the panel and flashed back to her. \"Your name Gray. Have a front\nname?\"\n\"Patti.\"\n\"Pretty, Patti.\"\n\"No, just Patti. Say, what's the matter with the cooling system?\"\n\"Damn punk,\" he said. \"This crate for surface work. No space. Cooling\nsystem groan, damn punk. Won't keep cool here.\"\n\"And ...\" she followed up, \"it will get warmer as we go out?\"\nRat turned back to his board in a brown study and carefully ignored\nher. Gray grasped an inkling of what the coming week could bring.\n\"But how about water?\" she demanded next. \"Is there enough?\"\nHe faced about. \"For her\u2014\" nodding to Judith, \"and him\u2014\" to Gladney,\n\"yes. Sparingly. Four hours every time, maybe.\" Back to Gray. \"You,\nme ... twice a day. Too bad.\" His eyes drifted aft to the tank of\nwater. She followed. \"One tank water. All the rest fuel. Too bad, too\nbad. We get thirsty I think.\"\nThey did get thirsty, soon. A damnable hot thirst accented by\nthe knowledge that water was precious, a thirst increased by a\ndried-up-in-the-mouth sensation. Their first drink was strangely\nbitter; tragically disappointing. Patti Gray suddenly swung upright in\nthe hammock and kicked her legs. She massaged her throat with a nervous\nhand, wiped damp hair from about her face.\n\"I have to have a drink.\"\nRat stared at her without answer.\n\"I said, I have to have a drink!\"\n\"Heard you.\"\n\"Well...?\"\n\"Well, nothing. Stall. Keep water longer.\"\nShe swung a vicious boot and missed by inches. Rat grinned, and made\nhis way aft, hand over hand. He treaded cautiously along the deck. \"Do\nlike this,\" he called over his shoulder. \"Gravity punk too. Back and\nunder, gravity.\" He waited until she joined him at the water tap.\nThey stood there glaring idiotically at each other.\nShe burst out laughing. \"They even threw the drinking cups out!\" Rat\ninched the handle grudgingly and she applied lips to the faucet.\n\"Faugh!\" Gray sprang back, forgot herself and lost her balance, sat\ndown on the deck and spat out the water. \"It's hot! It tastes like hell\nand it's hot! It must be fuel!\"\nRat applied his lips to the tap and sampled. Coming up with a mouthful\nhe swished it around on his tongue like mouthwash. Abruptly he\ncontrived a facial contortion between a grin and a grimace, and let\nsome of the water trickle from the edges of his mouth. He swallowed and\nit cost him something.\n\"No. I mean yes, I think. Water, no doubt. Yes. Fuel out, water in.\nSwish-swush. Dammit, Greaseball forget to wash tank!\"\n\"But what makes it so hot?\" She worked her mouth to dry-rinse the taste\nof the fuel.\n\"Ship get hot. Water on sun side. H-m-m-m-m-m-m.\"\n\"H-m-m-m-m-m-m-m what?\"\n\"Flip-flop.\" He could talk with his hands as well. \"Hot side over like\npancake.\" Rat hobbled over to the board and sat down. An experimental\nflick on a lever produced nothing. Another flick, this time followed by\na quivering jar. He contemplated the panel board while fastening his\nbelt.\n\"H-m-m-m-m-m-m,\" the lower lip protruded.\nGray protested. \"Oh, stop humming and do something! That wa\u2014\" the\nword was queerly torn from her throat, and a scream magically filled\nthe vacancy. Nurse Gray sat up and rubbed a painful spot that had\nsuddenly appeared on her arm. She found her nose bleeding and another\nnew, swelling bruise on the side of her head. Around her the place was\nempty. Bare.\nNo, not quite. A wispy something was hanging just out of sight in\nthe corner of the eye; the water tap was now moulded\nupward\n, beads\nglistening on its handle. The wispy thing caught her attention again\nand she looked up.\nTwo people, tightly wrapped and bound in hammocks, were staring down at\nher, amazed, swinging on their stomachs. Craning further, she saw Rat.\nHe was hanging upside down in the chair, grinning at her in reverse.\n\"Flip-flop,\" he laconically explained.\n\"For cripes sakes, Jehosaphat!\" Gladney groaned. \"Turn me over on my\nback! Do something!\" Gray stood on tiptoes and just could pivot the\nhammocks on their rope-axis.\n\"And now, please, just\nhow\ndo I get into mine?\" she bit at Rat.\nExistence dragged. Paradoxically, time dropped away like a cloak as\nthe sense of individual hours and minutes vanished, and into its place\ncrept a slow-torturing substitute. As the ship revolved, monotonously,\nfirst the ceiling and then the floor took on dullish, maddening\naspects, eyes ached continuously from staring at them time and again\nwithout surcease. The steady, drumming rockets crashed into the mind\nand the walls shrieked malevolently on the eyeballs. Dull, throbbing\nsameness of the poorly filtered air, a growing taint in the nostrils.\nDamp warm skin, reeking blankets. The taste of fuel in the mouth for\nrefreshment. Slowly mounting mental duress. And above all the drumming\nof the rockets.\nOnce, a sudden, frightening change of pitch in the rockets and a wild,\nsickening lurch. Meteor rain. Maddening, plunging swings to the far\nright and left, made without warning. A torn lip as a sudden lurch\ntears the faucet from her mouth. A shattered tooth.\n\"Sorry!\" Rat whispered.\n\"Shut up and drive!\" she cried.\n\"Patti ...\" Judith called out, in pain.\nPeace of mind followed peace of body into a forgotten limbo of lost\nthings, a slyly climbing madness directed at one another. Waspish\nwords uttered in pain, fatigue and temper. Fractiousness. A hot,\nconfined, stale hell. Sleep became a hollow mockery, as bad water\nand concentrated tablets brought on stomach pains to plague them.\nConsciousness punctured only by spasms of lethargy, shared to some\nextent by the invalids. Above all, crawling lassitude and incalescent\ntempers.\nRat watched the white, drawn face swing in the hammock beside him. And\nhis hands never faltered on the controls.\nNever a slackening of the terrific pace; abnormal speed, gruelling\ndrive ... drive ... drive. Fear. Tantalizing fear made worse because\nRat couldn't understand. Smothered moaning that ate at his nerves.\nGrim-faced, sleep-wracked, belted to the chair, driving!\n\"How many days? How many days!\" Gray begged of him thousands of times\nuntil the very repetition grated on her eardrums. \"How many days?\"\nHis only answer was an inhuman snarl, and the cruel blazing of those\ninhuman eyes.\nShe fell face first to the floor. \"I can't keep it up!\" she cried. The\nsound of her voice rolled along the hot steel deck. \"I cant! I cant!\"\nA double handful of tepid water was thrown in her face. \"Get up!\" Rat\nstood over her, face twisted, his body hunched. \"Get up!\" She stared at\nhim, dazed. He kicked her. \"Get up!\" The tepid water ran off her face\nand far away she heard Judith calling.... She forced herself up. Rat\nwas back in the chair.\nGladney unexpectedly exploded. He had been awake for a long time,\nwatching Rat at the board. Wrenching loose a chest strap he attempted\nto sit up.\n\"Rat! Damn you Rat, listen to me!\nWhen're you going to start braking\n,\nRat?\"\n\"I hear you.\" He turned on Gladney with dulled eyes. \"Lie down. You\nsick.\"\n\"I'll be damned if I'm going to lie here and let you drive us to Orion!\nWe must be near the half-way line! When are you going to start braking?\"\n\"Not brake,\" Rat answered sullenly. \"No, not brake.\"\n\"\nNot brake?\n\" Gladney screamed and sat bolt upright. Nurse Gray jumped\nfor him. \"Are you crazy, you skinny rat?\" Gray secured a hold on his\nshoulders and forced him down. \"You gotta brake! Don't you understand\nthat? You have to, you vacuum-skull!\" Gray was pleading with him to\nshut-up like a good fellow. He appealed to her. \"He's gotta brake! Make\nhim!\"\n\"He has a good point there, Rat,\" she spoke up. \"What about this\nhalf-way line?\"\nHe turned to her with a weary ghost of the old smile on his face. \"We\npassed line. Three days ago, maybe.\" A shrug of shoulders.\n\"Passed!\" Gray and Gladney exclaimed in unison.\n\"You catch on quick,\" Rat nodded. \"This six day, don't you know?\"\nGladney sank back, exhausted. The nurse crept over to the pilot.\n\"Getting your figures mixed, aren't you?\"\nRat shook his head and said nothing.\n\"But Roberds said eight days, and he\u2014\"\n\"\u2014he on Mars. I here. Boss nuts, too sad. He drive, it be eight days.\nNow only six.\" He cast a glance at Judith and found her eyes closed.\n\"Six days, no brake. No.\"\n\"I see your point, and appreciate it,\" Gray cut in. \"But now what? This\ndeceleration business ... there is a whole lot I don't know, but some\nthings I do!\"\nRat refused the expected answer. \"Land tonight, I think. Never been to\nEarth before. Somebody meet us, I think.\"\n\"You can bet your leather boots somebody will meet us!\" Gladney cried.\nGray turned to him. \"The Chief'll have the whole planet waiting for\nyou\n!\" He laughed with real satisfaction. \"Oh yes, Rat, they'll be\nsomebody waiting for us all right.\" And then he added: \"If we land.\"\n\"Oh, we land.\" Rat confided, glad to share a secret.\n\"Yeah,\" Gladney grated. \"But in how many little pieces?\"\n\"I've never been to Earth before. Nice, I think.\" Patti Gray caught\nsomething new in the tone and stared at him. Gladney must have noticed\nit, too.\nThe Centaurian moved sideways and pointed. Gray placed her eyes in the\nvacated position.\n\"Earth!\" she shouted.\n\"Quite. Nice. Do me a favor?\"\n\"Just name it!\"\n\"Not drink long time. Some water?\"\nGray nodded and went to the faucet. The drumming seemed remote, the\ntension vanished. She was an uncommonly long time in returning, at last\nshe appeared beside him, outstretched hands dry.\n\"There isn't any left, Rat.\"\nRat batted his tired eyes expressively. \"Tasted punk,\" he grinned at\nher.\nShe sat down on the floor suddenly and buried her face.\n\"Rat,\" she said presently, \"I want to ask you something, rather\npersonal? Your ... name. 'Rat'? Roberds told me something about your\nrecord. But ... please tell me, Rat. You didn't know the attack was\ncoming, did you?\"\nHe grinned again and waggled his head at her. \"No. Who tell Rat?\"\nSuddenly he was deadly serious as he spoke to her. \"Rat a.w.o.l., go\nout to help sick man alone in desert. Rat leave post. Not time send\ncall through. Come back with man, find horrible thing happen.\"\n\"But why didn't you explain?\"\nHe grinned again. \"Who believe? Sick man die soon after.\"\nGladney sat up. He had heard the conversation between the two. \"You're\nright, Rat. No one would have believed you then, and no one will now.\nYou've been safe enough on Mars, but the police will nab you as soon as\nyou get out of the ship.\"\n\"They can't!\" cried Patti Gray. \"They can't hurt him after what he's\ndone now.\"\nThe Centaurian grinned in a cynical way.\n\"Police not get me, Gladney. Gladney's memory damn punk, I think. Earth\npretty nice place, maybe. But not for Rat.\"\nGladney stared at him for minutes. Then: \"Say, I get it ... you're\u2014\"\n\"Shut up!\" Rat cut him off sharply. \"You talk too much.\" He cast a\nglance at Nurse Gray and then threw a meaning look at Gladney.\n", "summary": "The story begins with the field manager, Robert Roberds, locking himself and his colleague, Captain Benson, in an office with a sick woman in a room. The woman, a nurse named Helen Gray, is in the room and she is complaining of a stomachache. She is being held in a small room by the field marshal, Captain Peterson. The men in the office are worried about her and try to get her to a hospital, but she refuses. The Captain and his henchman, Rat, are also worried about the sick woman and try and get her into a hospital. The ship is on a mission to Earth, but it is not loaded with enough fuel to get there in time. The captain and his employee, Captain Bransten, are worried that the ship will crash on Earth, and they are worried the ship is going to crash on Mars. The story then moves to the control room, where the captain is trying to get the ship loaded with a bunch of papers. The room is small and cramped, and there is a door that is locked. The door is also ajar, and the captain and the outlander, Rat and the field man, Captain Robert Peterson, are locked in there. The two men are worried they will die if they cannot get out. The doctor, Dr. Tony, arrives and tells them that the only way to escape is to go to Earth. The nurse, Helen Gray (who is in a hospital on Earth), is in her own room, and she has been there for eight days. She tells them she is to take the ship to Earth because she is sick. The doctors there are worried she will die from the lack of oxygen. The rest of the crew members are worried. The three men leave the room, leaving Helen alone. The next morning, the Captain and the Captain return to the office. The Doctor is worried that Helen will not survive the trip to Earth and is worried about what will happen to her. The other man, the fieldman, is worried the Captain will be killed. The Colonel is worried he will be too. The whole crew is worried Helen will die. The only way they can escape is if they can get to Earth in time, and Helen is worried she won't make it. The crew members leave the office and Helen goes to the ship. The pilot, Captain Roberds (who has been assigned to pilot the ship), is worried his job will be lost because of Helen's illness. The team leaves the ship and Helen heads to the hospital. She arrives at the hospital and is told she has to be put into a room with a doctor. The hospital is small, but Helen is able to get a room in a larger room. She sees a doctor and he tells her she has a very good chance of getting better. Helen is then taken to the Captain's office.   The story then goes to a ship, where a man named Rat is the pilot. He is angry at the Captain for not letting him take the sick girl to Earth to be treated. The man is named Captain Branstetter. He tells the Captain that he is a traitorous Ganymedean and that he will kill him. The General is furious. The group leaves the room.", "faithfulness": [null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, null, 0, null, 0, 0, 0, 0, null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, null, 0, null, 0, 0, null, 0, null, 0]}

And there was only\na surface rocket in which to escape\u2014with\na traitorous Ganymedean for its pilot.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Fall 1942.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\"Listen, Rat!\" Roberds said, \"what\nI\nsay goes around here. It doesn't\nhappen to be any of your business. I'm still in possession of my wits,\nand I know Peterson can't handle that ship. Furthermore Gladney will\nbe in it too, right along side of that sick girl in there! And Rat,\nget this:\nI'm\ngoing to pilot that ship. Understand? Consulate or\nno Consulate, job or no job, I'm wheeling that crate to Earth because\nthis is an emergency. And the emergency happens to be bigger than my\nposition, to me at any rate.\" His tone dropped to a deadly softness.\n\"Now will you kindly remove your stinking carcass from this office?\"\nUnheeding, Rat swung his eyes around in the gloom and discovered the\nwoman, a nurse in uniform. He blinked at her and she returned the look,\nwavering. She bit her lip and determination flowed back. She met the\nstare of his boring, off-colored eyes. Rat grinned suddenly. Nurse Gray\nalmost smiled back, stopped before the others could see it.\n\"Won't go!\" The Centaurian resumed his fight. \"You not go, lose job,\nblack-listed. Never get another. Look at me. I know.\" He retreated\na precious step to escape a rolled up fist. \"Little ship carry four\nnice. Rip out lockers and bunks. Swing hammocks. Put fuel in water\ntanks. Live on concentrates. Earth hospital fix bellyache afterwards,\nallright. I pilot ship. Yes?\"\n\"No!\" Roberds screamed.\nAlmost in answer, a moan issued from a small side room. The men in the\noffice froze as Nurse Gray ran across the room. She disappeared through\nthe narrow door.\n\"Peterson,\" the field manager ordered, \"come over here and help me\nthrow this rat out....\" He went for Rat. Peterson swung up out of his\nchair with balled fist. The outlander backed rapidly.\n\"No need, no need, no need!\" he said quickly. \"I go.\" Still backing, he\nblindly kicked at the door and stepped into the night.\nWhen the door slammed shut Roberds locked it. Peterson slumped in the\nchair.\n\"Do you mean that, Chief? About taking the ship yourself?\"\n\"True enough.\" Roberds cast an anxious glance at the partly closed\ndoor, lowered his voice. \"It'll cost me my job, but that girl in there\nhas to be taken to a hospital quickly! And it's her luck to be landed\non a planet that doesn't boast even one! So it's Earth ... or she\ndies. I'd feel a lot better too if we could get Gladney to a hospital,\nI'm not too confident of that patching job.\" He pulled a pipe from a\njacket pocket. \"So, might as well kill two birds with one stone ... and\nthat wasn't meant to be funny!\"\nPeterson said nothing, sat watching the door.\n\"Rat has the right idea,\" Roberds continued, \"but I had already thought\nof it. About the bunks and lockers. Greaseball has been out there all\nnight tearing them out. We just\nmight\nbe able to hop by dawn ... and\nhell of a long, grinding hop it will be!\"\nThe nurse came out of the door.\n\"How is she?\" Roberds asked.\n\"Sleeping,\" Gray whispered. \"But sinking....\"\n\"We can take off at dawn, I think.\" He filled the pipe and didn't look\nat her. \"You'll have to spend most of the trip in a hammock.\"\n\"I can take it.\" Suddenly she smiled, wanly. \"I was with the Fleet. How\nlong will it take?\"\n\"Eight days, in\nthat\nship.\"\nRoberds lit his pipe, and carefully hid his emotions. He knew Peterson\nwas harboring the same thoughts. Eight days in space, in a small ship\nmeant for two, and built for planetary surface flights. Eight days in\nthat untrustworthy crate, hurtling to save the lives of that girl and\nGladney.\n\"Who was that ... man? The one you put out?\" Gray asked.\n\"We call him Rat,\" Roberds said.\nShe didn't ask why. She said: \"Why couldn't he pilot the ship, I mean?\nWhat is his record?\"\nPeterson opened his mouth.\n\"Shut up, Peterson!\" the Chief snapped. \"We don't talk about his record\naround here, Miss Gray. It's not a pretty thing to tell.\"\n\"Stow it, Chief,\" said Peterson. \"Miss Gray is no pantywaist.\" He\nturned to the nurse. \"Ever hear of the Sansan massacre?\"\nPatti Gray paled. \"Yes,\" she whispered. \"Was Rat in that?\"\nRoberds shook his head. \"He didn't take part in it. But Rat was\nattached to a very important office at the time, the outpost watch.\nAnd when Mad Barry Sansan and his gang of thugs swooped down on the\nGanymedean colony, there was no warning. Our friend Rat was AWOL.\n\"As to who he is ... well, just one of those freaks from up around\nCentauria somewhere. He's been hanging around all the fields and dumps\non Mars a long time, finally landed up here.\"\n\"But,\" protested Miss Gray, \"I don't understand? I always thought that\nleaving one's post under such circumstances meant execution.\"\nThe Chief Consul nodded. \"It does, usually. But this was a freak case.\nIt would take hours to explain. However, I'll just sum it up in one\nword: politics. Politics, with which Rat had no connection saved him.\"\nThe girl shook her head, more in sympathy than condemnation.\n\"Are you expecting the others in soon?\" she asked. \"It wouldn't be\nright to leave Peterson.\"\n\"They will be in, in a day or two. Peterson will beat it over to Base\nstation for repairs, and to notify Earth we're coming. He'll be all\nright.\"\nAbruptly she stood up. \"Goodnight gentlemen. Call me if I'm needed.\"\nRoberds nodded acknowledgement. The door to the side room closed behind\nher. Peterson hauled his chair over to the desk. He sniffed the air.\n\"Damned rat!\" he whispered harshly. \"They ought to make a law forcing\nhim to wear dark glasses!\"\nRoberds smiled wearily. \"His eyes do get a man, don't they?\"\n\"I'd like to burn 'em out!\" Peterson snarled.\nRat helped Greaseball fill the water tanks to capacity with fuel,\nchecked the concentrated rations and grunted.\nGreaseball looked over the interior and chuckled. \"The boss said strip\nher, and strip her I did. All right, Rat, outside.\" He followed the\nCentaurian out, and pulled the ladder away from the lip of the lock.\nThe two walked across the strip of sandy soil to the office building.\nOn tiptoes, Greaseball poked his head through the door panel. \"All set.\"\nRoberds nodded at him. \"Stick with it!\" and jerked a thumb at Rat\noutside. Grease nodded understanding.\n\"Okay, Rat, you can go to bed now.\" He dropped the ladder against the\nwall and sat on it. \"Good night.\" He watched Rat walk slowly away.\nSwinging down the path towards his own rambling shack, Rat caught a\nsibilant whisper. Pausing, undecided, he heard it again.\n\"Here ... can you see me?\" A white clad arm waved in the gloom. Rat\nregarded the arm in the window. Another impatient gesture, and he\nstepped to the sill.\n\"Yes?\"\u2014in the softest of whispers. The voices of the men in droning\nconversation drifted in. \"What you want?\"\nNothing but silence for a few hanging seconds, and then: \"Can you pilot\nthat ship?\" Her voice was shaky.\nHe didn't answer, stared at her confused. He felt her fear as clearly\nas he detected it in her words.\n\"Well,\ncan\nyou?\" she demanded.\n\"Damn yes!\" he stated simply. \"It now necessary?\"\n\"Very! She is becoming worse. I'm afraid to wait until daylight.\nAnd ... well, we want\nyou\nto pilot it! She refuses to risk\nMr. Roberds' job. She favors you.\"\nRat stepped back, astonished. \"She?\"\nNurse Gray moved from the window and Rat saw the second form in the\nroom, a slight, quiet figure on a small cot. \"My patient,\" Nurse Gray\nexplained. \"She overheard our conversation awhile ago. Quick, please,\ncan you?\"\nRat looked at her and then at the girl on the cot. He vanished from the\nwindow. Almost immediately, he was back again.\n\"When?\" he whispered.\n\"As soon as possible. Yes. Do you know...?\" but he had gone again.\nNurse Gray found herself addressing blackness. On the point of turning,\nshe saw him back again.\n\"Blankets,\" he instructed. \"Wrap in blankets. Cold\u2014hot too. Wrap\ngood!\" And he was gone again. Gray blinked away the illusion he\ndisappeared upwards.\nShe ran over to the girl. \"Judith, if you want to back down, now is the\ntime. He'll be back in a moment.\"\n\"No!\" Judith moaned. \"No!\" Gray smiled in the darkness and began\nwrapping the blankets around her. A light tapping at the window\nannounced the return of Rat. The nurse pushed open the window wide, saw\nhim out there with arms upstretched.\n\"Grit your teeth and hold on! Here we go.\" She picked up the blanketed\ngirl in both arms and walked to the window. Rat took the girl easily as\nshe was swung out, the blackness hid them both. But he appeared again\ninstantly.\n\"Better lock window,\" he cautioned. \"Stall, if Boss call. Back\nsoon....\" and he was gone.\nTo Nurse Gray the fifteen minute wait seemed like hours, impatient\nagonizing hours of tight-lipped anxiety.\nFeet first, she swung through the window, clutching a small bag in her\nhands. She never touched ground. Rat whispered \"Hold tight!\" in her\near and the wind was abruptly yanked from her! The ground fell away\nin a dizzy rush, unseen but felt, in the night! Her feet scraped on\nsome projection, and she felt herself being lifted still higher. Wind\nreturned to her throat, and she breathed again.\n\"I'm sorry,\" she managed to get out, gaspingly. \"I wasn't expecting\nthat. I had forgotten you\u2014\"\n\"\u2014had wings,\" he finished and chuckled. \"So likewise Greaseball.\" The\npale office lights dropped away as they sped over the field. On the far\nhorizon, a tinge of dawn crept along the uneven terrain.\n\"Oh, the bag!\" she gasped. \"I've dropped it.\"\nHe chuckled again. \"Have got. You scare, I catch.\"\nShe didn't see the ship because of the wind in her eyes, but without\nwarning she plummeted down and her feet jarred on the lip of the lock.\n\"Inside. No noise, no light. Easy.\" But in spite of his warning she\ntripped in the darkness. He helped her from the floor and guided her to\nthe hammocks.\n\"Judith?\" she asked.\n\"Here. Beside you, trussed up so tight I can hardly breathe.\"\n\"No talk!\" Rat insisted. \"Much hush-hush needed. Other girl shipshape.\nYou make likewise.\" Forcibly he shoved her into a hammock. \"Wrap up\ntight. Straps tight. When we go, we go fast. Bang!\" And he left her.\n\"Hey! Where are you going now?\"\n\"To get Gladney. He sick too. Hush hush!\" His voice floated back.\n\"Where has he gone?\" Judith called.\n\"Back for another man. Remember the two miners who found us when we\ncrashed? The burly one fell off a rock-bank as they were bringing us\nin. Stove in his ribs pretty badly. The other has a broken arm ...\nhappened once while you were out. They wouldn't let me say anything for\nfear of worrying you.\"\nThe girl did not answer then and a hushed expectancy fell over the\nship. Somewhere aft a small motor was running. Wind whistled past the\nopen lock.\n\"I've caused plenty of trouble haven't I?\" she asked aloud, finally.\n\"This was certainly a fool stunt, and I'm guilty of a lot of fool\nstunts! I just didn't realize until now the\nwhy\nof that law.\"\n\"Don't talk so much,\" the nurse admonished. \"A lot of people have found\nout the\nwhy\nof that law the hard way, just as you are doing, and\nlived to remember it. Until hospitals are built on this forlorn world,\nhumans like you who haven't been properly conditioned will have to stay\nright at home.\"\n\"How about these men that live and work here?\"\n\"They never get here until they've been through the mill first.\nAdenoids, appendix', all the extra parts they can get along without.\"\n\"Well,\" Judith said. \"I've certainly learned my lesson!\"\nGray didn't answer, but from out of the darkness surrounding her came a\nsound remarkably resembling a snort.\n\"Gray?\" Judith asked fearfully.\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Hasn't the pilot been gone an awfully long time?\"\nRat himself provided the answer by alighting at the lip with a jar that\nshook the ship. He was breathing heavily and lugging something in his\narms. The burden groaned.\n\"Gladney!\" Nurse Gray exclaimed.\n\"I got.\" Rat confirmed. \"Yes, Gladney. Damn heavy, Gladney.\"\n\"But how?\" she demanded. \"What of Roberds and Peterson?\"\n\"Trick,\" he sniggered. \"I burn down my shack. Boss run out. I run in.\nVery simple.\" He packed Gladney into the remaining hammock and snapped\nbuckles.\n\"And Peterson?\" she prompted.\n\"Oh yes. Peterson. So sorry about Peterson. Had to fan him.\"\n\"\nFan\nhim? I don't understand.\"\n\"Fan. With chair. Everything all right. I apologized.\" Rat finished up\nand was walking back to the lock. They heard a slight rustling of wings\nas he padded away.\nHe was back instantly, duplicating his feat of a short time ago.\nCursing shouts were slung on the night air, and the deadly spang of\nbullets bounced on the hull! Some entered the lock. The Centaurian\nsnapped it shut. Chunks of lead continued to pound the ship. Rat leaped\nfor the pilot's chair, heavily, a wing drooping.\n\"You've been hurt!\" Gray cried. A small panel light outlined his\nfeatures. She tried to struggle up.\n\"Lie still! We go. Boss get wise.\" With lightning fingers he flicked\nseveral switches on the panel, turned to her. \"Hold belly. Zoom!\"\nGray folded her hands across her stomach and closed her eyes.\nRat unlocked the master level and shoved!\n\"Whew!\" Nurse Gray came back to throbbing awareness, the all too\nfamiliar feeling of a misplaced stomach attempting to force its\ncrowded way into her boots plaguing her. Rockets roared in the rear.\nShe loosened a few straps and twisted over. Judith was still out, her\nface tensed in pain. Gray bit her lip and twisted the other way. The\nCentaurian was grinning at her.\n\"Do you always leave in a hurry?\" she demanded, and instantly wished\nshe hadn't said it. He gave no outward sign.\n\"Long-time sleep,\" he announced. \"Four, five hours maybe.\" The chest\nstrap was lying loose at his side.\n\"That long!\" she was incredulous. \"I'm never out more than three\nhours!\" Unloosening more straps, she sat up, glanced at the control\npanel.\n\"Not taking time,\" he stated simply and pointed to a dial. Gray shook\nher head and looked at the others.\n\"That isn't doing either of them any good!\"\nRat nodded unhappily. \"What's her matter\u2014?\" pointing.\n\"Appendix. Something about this atmosphere sends it haywire. The thing\nitself isn't diseased, but it starts manufacturing poison. Patient dies\nin a week unless it is taken out.\"\n\"Don't know it,\" he said briefly.\n\"Do you mean to say you don't have an appendix?\" she demanded.\nRat folded his arms and considered this. \"Don't know. Maybe yes, maybe\nno. Where's it hurt?\"\nGray pointed out the location. The Centaurian considered this further\nand drifted into long contemplation. Watching him, Gray remembered his\neyes that night ... only\nlast\nnight ... in the office. Peterson had\nrefused to meet them. After awhile Rat came out of it.\n\"No,\" he waved. \"No appendix. Never nowhere appendix.\"\n\"Then Mother Nature has finally woke up!\" she exclaimed. \"But why do\nCentaurians rate it exclusively?\"\nRat ignored this and asked one of her. \"What you and her doing up\nthere?\" He pointed back and up, to where Mars obliterated the stars.\n\"You might call it a pleasure jaunt. She's only seventeen. We came over\nin a cruiser belonging to her father; it was rather large and easy to\nhandle. But the cruise ended when she lost control of the ship because\nof an attack of space-appendicitis. The rest you know.\"\n\"So you?\"\n\"So I'm a combination nurse, governess, guard and what have you. Or\nwill be until we get back. After this, I'll probably be looking for\nwork.\" She shivered.\n\"Cold?\" he inquired concernedly.\n\"On the contrary, I'm too warm.\" She started to remove the blanket. Rat\nthrew up a hand to stop her.\n\"Leave on! Hot out here.\"\n\"But I'm too hot now. I want to take it off!\"\n\"No. Leave on. Wool blanket. Keep in body heat, yes. Keep out cold,\nyes. Keep in, keep out, likewise. See?\"\nGray stared at him. \"I never thought of it that way before. Why of\ncourse! If it protects from one temperature, it will protect from\nanother. Isn't it silly of me not to know that?\" Heat pressing on her\nface accented the fact.\n\"What is your name?\" she asked. \"Your real one I mean.\"\nHe grinned. \"Big. You couldn't say it. Sound like Christmas and\nbottlenose together real fast. Just say Rat. Everybody does.\" His eyes\nswept the panel and flashed back to her. \"Your name Gray. Have a front\nname?\"\n\"Patti.\"\n\"Pretty, Patti.\"\n\"No, just Patti. Say, what's the matter with the cooling system?\"\n\"Damn punk,\" he said. \"This crate for surface work. No space. Cooling\nsystem groan, damn punk. Won't keep cool here.\"\n\"And ...\" she followed up, \"it will get warmer as we go out?\"\nRat turned back to his board in a brown study and carefully ignored\nher. Gray grasped an inkling of what the coming week could bring.\n\"But how about water?\" she demanded next. \"Is there enough?\"\nHe faced about. \"For her\u2014\" nodding to Judith, \"and him\u2014\" to Gladney,\n\"yes. Sparingly. Four hours every time, maybe.\" Back to Gray. \"You,\nme ... twice a day. Too bad.\" His eyes drifted aft to the tank of\nwater. She followed. \"One tank water. All the rest fuel. Too bad, too\nbad. We get thirsty I think.\"\nThey did get thirsty, soon. A damnable hot thirst accented by\nthe knowledge that water was precious, a thirst increased by a\ndried-up-in-the-mouth sensation. Their first drink was strangely\nbitter; tragically disappointing. Patti Gray suddenly swung upright in\nthe hammock and kicked her legs. She massaged her throat with a nervous\nhand, wiped damp hair from about her face.\n\"I have to have a drink.\"\nRat stared at her without answer.\n\"I said, I have to have a drink!\"\n\"Heard you.\"\n\"Well...?\"\n\"Well, nothing. Stall. Keep water longer.\"\nShe swung a vicious boot and missed by inches. Rat grinned, and made\nhis way aft, hand over hand. He treaded cautiously along the deck. \"Do\nlike this,\" he called over his shoulder. \"Gravity punk too. Back and\nunder, gravity.\" He waited until she joined him at the water tap.\nThey stood there glaring idiotically at each other.\nShe burst out laughing. \"They even threw the drinking cups out!\" Rat\ninched the handle grudgingly and she applied lips to the faucet.\n\"Faugh!\" Gray sprang back, forgot herself and lost her balance, sat\ndown on the deck and spat out the water. \"It's hot! It tastes like hell\nand it's hot! It must be fuel!\"\nRat applied his lips to the tap and sampled. Coming up with a mouthful\nhe swished it around on his tongue like mouthwash. Abruptly he\ncontrived a facial contortion between a grin and a grimace, and let\nsome of the water trickle from the edges of his mouth. He swallowed and\nit cost him something.\n\"No. I mean yes, I think. Water, no doubt. Yes. Fuel out, water in.\nSwish-swush. Dammit, Greaseball forget to wash tank!\"\n\"But what makes it so hot?\" She worked her mouth to dry-rinse the taste\nof the fuel.\n\"Ship get hot. Water on sun side. H-m-m-m-m-m-m.\"\n\"H-m-m-m-m-m-m-m what?\"\n\"Flip-flop.\" He could talk with his hands as well. \"Hot side over like\npancake.\" Rat hobbled over to the board and sat down. An experimental\nflick on a lever produced nothing. Another flick, this time followed by\na quivering jar. He contemplated the panel board while fastening his\nbelt.\n\"H-m-m-m-m-m-m,\" the lower lip protruded.\nGray protested. \"Oh, stop humming and do something! That wa\u2014\" the\nword was queerly torn from her throat, and a scream magically filled\nthe vacancy. Nurse Gray sat up and rubbed a painful spot that had\nsuddenly appeared on her arm. She found her nose bleeding and another\nnew, swelling bruise on the side of her head. Around her the place was\nempty. Bare.\nNo, not quite. A wispy something was hanging just out of sight in\nthe corner of the eye; the water tap was now moulded\nupward\n, beads\nglistening on its handle. The wispy thing caught her attention again\nand she looked up.\nTwo people, tightly wrapped and bound in hammocks, were staring down at\nher, amazed, swinging on their stomachs. Craning further, she saw Rat.\nHe was hanging upside down in the chair, grinning at her in reverse.\n\"Flip-flop,\" he laconically explained.\n\"For cripes sakes, Jehosaphat!\" Gladney groaned. \"Turn me over on my\nback! Do something!\" Gray stood on tiptoes and just could pivot the\nhammocks on their rope-axis.\n\"And now, please, just\nhow\ndo I get into mine?\" she bit at Rat.\nExistence dragged. Paradoxically, time dropped away like a cloak as\nthe sense of individual hours and minutes vanished, and into its place\ncrept a slow-torturing substitute. As the ship revolved, monotonously,\nfirst the ceiling and then the floor took on dullish, maddening\naspects, eyes ached continuously from staring at them time and again\nwithout surcease. The steady, drumming rockets crashed into the mind\nand the walls shrieked malevolently on the eyeballs. Dull, throbbing\nsameness of the poorly filtered air, a growing taint in the nostrils.\nDamp warm skin, reeking blankets. The taste of fuel in the mouth for\nrefreshment. Slowly mounting mental duress. And above all the drumming\nof the rockets.\nOnce, a sudden, frightening change of pitch in the rockets and a wild,\nsickening lurch. Meteor rain. Maddening, plunging swings to the far\nright and left, made without warning. A torn lip as a sudden lurch\ntears the faucet from her mouth. A shattered tooth.\n\"Sorry!\" Rat whispered.\n\"Shut up and drive!\" she cried.\n\"Patti ...\" Judith called out, in pain.\nPeace of mind followed peace of body into a forgotten limbo of lost\nthings, a slyly climbing madness directed at one another. Waspish\nwords uttered in pain, fatigue and temper. Fractiousness. A hot,\nconfined, stale hell. Sleep became a hollow mockery, as bad water\nand concentrated tablets brought on stomach pains to plague them.\nConsciousness punctured only by spasms of lethargy, shared to some\nextent by the invalids. Above all, crawling lassitude and incalescent\ntempers.\nRat watched the white, drawn face swing in the hammock beside him. And\nhis hands never faltered on the controls.\nNever a slackening of the terrific pace; abnormal speed, gruelling\ndrive ... drive ... drive. Fear. Tantalizing fear made worse because\nRat couldn't understand. Smothered moaning that ate at his nerves.\nGrim-faced, sleep-wracked, belted to the chair, driving!\n\"How many days? How many days!\" Gray begged of him thousands of times\nuntil the very repetition grated on her eardrums. \"How many days?\"\nHis only answer was an inhuman snarl, and the cruel blazing of those\ninhuman eyes.\nShe fell face first to the floor. \"I can't keep it up!\" she cried. The\nsound of her voice rolled along the hot steel deck. \"I cant! I cant!\"\nA double handful of tepid water was thrown in her face. \"Get up!\" Rat\nstood over her, face twisted, his body hunched. \"Get up!\" She stared at\nhim, dazed. He kicked her. \"Get up!\" The tepid water ran off her face\nand far away she heard Judith calling.... She forced herself up. Rat\nwas back in the chair.\nGladney unexpectedly exploded. He had been awake for a long time,\nwatching Rat at the board. Wrenching loose a chest strap he attempted\nto sit up.\n\"Rat! Damn you Rat, listen to me!\nWhen're you going to start braking\n,\nRat?\"\n\"I hear you.\" He turned on Gladney with dulled eyes. \"Lie down. You\nsick.\"\n\"I'll be damned if I'm going to lie here and let you drive us to Orion!\nWe must be near the half-way line! When are you going to start braking?\"\n\"Not brake,\" Rat answered sullenly. \"No, not brake.\"\n\"\nNot brake?\n\" Gladney screamed and sat bolt upright. Nurse Gray jumped\nfor him. \"Are you crazy, you skinny rat?\" Gray secured a hold on his\nshoulders and forced him down. \"You gotta brake! Don't you understand\nthat? You have to, you vacuum-skull!\" Gray was pleading with him to\nshut-up like a good fellow. He appealed to her. \"He's gotta brake! Make\nhim!\"\n\"He has a good point there, Rat,\" she spoke up. \"What about this\nhalf-way line?\"\nHe turned to her with a weary ghost of the old smile on his face. \"We\npassed line. Three days ago, maybe.\" A shrug of shoulders.\n\"Passed!\" Gray and Gladney exclaimed in unison.\n\"You catch on quick,\" Rat nodded. \"This six day, don't you know?\"\nGladney sank back, exhausted. The nurse crept over to the pilot.\n\"Getting your figures mixed, aren't you?\"\nRat shook his head and said nothing.\n\"But Roberds said eight days, and he\u2014\"\n\"\u2014he on Mars. I here. Boss nuts, too sad. He drive, it be eight days.\nNow only six.\" He cast a glance at Judith and found her eyes closed.\n\"Six days, no brake. No.\"\n\"I see your point, and appreciate it,\" Gray cut in. \"But now what? This\ndeceleration business ... there is a whole lot I don't know, but some\nthings I do!\"\nRat refused the expected answer. \"Land tonight, I think. Never been to\nEarth before. Somebody meet us, I think.\"\n\"You can bet your leather boots somebody will meet us!\" Gladney cried.\nGray turned to him. \"The Chief'll have the whole planet waiting for\nyou\n!\" He laughed with real satisfaction. \"Oh yes, Rat, they'll be\nsomebody waiting for us all right.\" And then he added: \"If we land.\"\n\"Oh, we land.\" Rat confided, glad to share a secret.\n\"Yeah,\" Gladney grated. \"But in how many little pieces?\"\n\"I've never been to Earth before. Nice, I think.\" Patti Gray caught\nsomething new in the tone and stared at him. Gladney must have noticed\nit, too.\nThe Centaurian moved sideways and pointed. Gray placed her eyes in the\nvacated position.\n\"Earth!\" she shouted.\n\"Quite. Nice. Do me a favor?\"\n\"Just name it!\"\n\"Not drink long time. Some water?\"\nGray nodded and went to the faucet. The drumming seemed remote, the\ntension vanished. She was an uncommonly long time in returning, at last\nshe appeared beside him, outstretched hands dry.\n\"There isn't any left, Rat.\"\nRat batted his tired eyes expressively. \"Tasted punk,\" he grinned at\nher.\nShe sat down on the floor suddenly and buried her face.\n\"Rat,\" she said presently, \"I want to ask you something, rather\npersonal? Your ... name. 'Rat'? Roberds told me something about your\nrecord. But ... please tell me, Rat. You didn't know the attack was\ncoming, did you?\"\nHe grinned again and waggled his head at her. \"No. Who tell Rat?\"\nSuddenly he was deadly serious as he spoke to her. \"Rat a.w.o.l., go\nout to help sick man alone in desert. Rat leave post. Not time send\ncall through. Come back with man, find horrible thing happen.\"\n\"But why didn't you explain?\"\nHe grinned again. \"Who believe? Sick man die soon after.\"\nGladney sat up. He had heard the conversation between the two. \"You're\nright, Rat. No one would have believed you then, and no one will now.\nYou've been safe enough on Mars, but the police will nab you as soon as\nyou get out of the ship.\"\n\"They can't!\" cried Patti Gray. \"They can't hurt him after what he's\ndone now.\"\nThe Centaurian grinned in a cynical way.\n\"Police not get me, Gladney. Gladney's memory damn punk, I think. Earth\npretty nice place, maybe. But not for Rat.\"\nGladney stared at him for minutes. Then: \"Say, I get it ... you're\u2014\"\n\"Shut up!\" Rat cut him off sharply. \"You talk too much.\" He cast a\nglance at Nurse Gray and then threw a meaning look at Gladney.\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nPRISON PLANET\nBy BOB TUCKER\nTo remain on Mars meant death from agonizing\nspace-sickness, but Earth-surgery lay\ndays of flight away. And there was only\na surface rocket in which to escape\u2014with\na traitorous Ganymedean for its pilot.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Fall 1942.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\"Listen, Rat!\" Roberds said, \"what\nI\nsay goes around here. It doesn't\nhappen to be any of your business. I'm still in possession of my wits,\nand I know Peterson can't handle that ship. Furthermore Gladney will\nbe in it too, right along side of that sick girl in there! And Rat,\nget this:\nI'm\ngoing to pilot that ship. Understand? Consulate or\nno Consulate, job or no job, I'm wheeling that crate to Earth because\nthis is an emergency. And the emergency happens to be bigger than my\nposition, to me at any rate.\" His tone dropped to a deadly softness.\n\"Now will you kindly remove your stinking carcass from this office?\"\nUnheeding, Rat swung his eyes around in the gloom and discovered the\nwoman, a nurse in uniform. He blinked at her and she returned the look,\nwavering. She bit her lip and determination flowed back. She met the\nstare of his boring, off-colored eyes. Rat grinned suddenly. Nurse Gray\nalmost smiled back, stopped before the others could see it.\n\"Won't go!\" The Centaurian resumed his fight. \"You not go, lose job,\nblack-listed. Never get another. Look at me. I know.\" He retreated\na precious step to escape a rolled up fist. \"Little ship carry four\nnice. Rip out lockers and bunks. Swing hammocks. Put fuel in water\ntanks. Live on concentrates. Earth hospital fix bellyache afterwards,\nallright. I pilot ship. Yes?\"\n\"No!\" Roberds screamed.\nAlmost in answer, a moan issued from a small side room. The men in the\noffice froze as Nurse Gray ran across the room. She disappeared through\nthe narrow door.\n\"Peterson,\" the field manager ordered, \"come over here and help me\nthrow this rat out....\" He went for Rat. Peterson swung up out of his\nchair with balled fist. The outlander backed rapidly.\n\"No need, no need, no need!\" he said quickly. \"I go.\" Still backing, he\nblindly kicked at the door and stepped into the night.\nWhen the door slammed shut Roberds locked it. Peterson slumped in the\nchair.\n\"Do you mean that, Chief? About taking the ship yourself?\"\n\"True enough.\" Roberds cast an anxious glance at the partly closed\ndoor, lowered his voice. \"It'll cost me my job, but that girl in there\nhas to be taken to a hospital quickly! And it's her luck to be landed\non a planet that doesn't boast even one! So it's Earth ... or she\ndies. I'd feel a lot better too if we could get Gladney to a hospital,\nI'm not too confident of that patching job.\" He pulled a pipe from a\njacket pocket. \"So, might as well kill two birds with one stone ... and\nthat wasn't meant to be funny!\"\nPeterson said nothing, sat watching the door.\n\"Rat has the right idea,\" Roberds continued, \"but I had already thought\nof it. About the bunks and lockers. Greaseball has been out there all\nnight tearing them out. We just\nmight\nbe able to hop by dawn ... and\nhell of a long, grinding hop it will be!\"\nThe nurse came out of the door.\n\"How is she?\" Roberds asked.\n\"Sleeping,\" Gray whispered. \"But sinking....\"\n\"We can take off at dawn, I think.\" He filled the pipe and didn't look\nat her. \"You'll have to spend most of the trip in a hammock.\"\n\"I can take it.\" Suddenly she smiled, wanly. \"I was with the Fleet. How\nlong will it take?\"\n\"Eight days, in\nthat\nship.\"\nRoberds lit his pipe, and carefully hid his emotions. He knew Peterson\nwas harboring the same thoughts. Eight days in space, in a small ship\nmeant for two, and built for planetary surface flights. Eight days in\nthat untrustworthy crate, hurtling to save the lives of that girl and\nGladney.\n\"Who was that ... man? The one you put out?\" Gray asked.\n\"We call him Rat,\" Roberds said.\nShe didn't ask why. She said: \"Why couldn't he pilot the ship, I mean?\nWhat is his record?\"\nPeterson opened his mouth.\n\"Shut up, Peterson!\" the Chief snapped. \"We don't talk about his record\naround here, Miss Gray. It's not a pretty thing to tell.\"\n\"Stow it, Chief,\" said Peterson. \"Miss Gray is no pantywaist.\" He\nturned to the nurse. \"Ever hear of the Sansan massacre?\"\nPatti Gray paled. \"Yes,\" she whispered. \"Was Rat in that?\"\nRoberds shook his head. \"He didn't take part in it. But Rat was\nattached to a very important office at the time, the outpost watch.\nAnd when Mad Barry Sansan and his gang of thugs swooped down on the\nGanymedean colony, there was no warning. Our friend Rat was AWOL.\n\"As to who he is ... well, just one of those freaks from up around\nCentauria somewhere. He's been hanging around all the fields and dumps\non Mars a long time, finally landed up here.\"\n\"But,\" protested Miss Gray, \"I don't understand? I always thought that\nleaving one's post under such circumstances meant execution.\"\nThe Chief Consul nodded. \"It does, usually. But this was a freak case.\nIt would take hours to explain. However, I'll just sum it up in one\nword: politics. Politics, with which Rat had no connection saved him.\"\nThe girl shook her head, more in sympathy than condemnation.\n\"Are you expecting the others in soon?\" she asked. \"It wouldn't be\nright to leave Peterson.\"\n\"They will be in, in a day or two. Peterson will beat it over to Base\nstation for repairs, and to notify Earth we're coming. He'll be all\nright.\"\nAbruptly she stood up. \"Goodnight gentlemen. Call me if I'm needed.\"\nRoberds nodded acknowledgement. The door to the side room closed behind\nher. Peterson hauled his chair over to the desk. He sniffed the air.\n\"Damned rat!\" he whispered harshly. \"They ought to make a law forcing\nhim to wear dark glasses!\"\nRoberds smiled wearily. \"His eyes do get a man, don't they?\"\n\"I'd like to burn 'em out!\" Peterson snarled.\nRat helped Greaseball fill the water tanks to capacity with fuel,\nchecked the concentrated rations and grunted.\nGreaseball looked over the interior and chuckled. \"The boss said strip\nher, and strip her I did. All right, Rat, outside.\" He followed the\nCentaurian out, and pulled the ladder away from the lip of the lock.\nThe two walked across the strip of sandy soil to the office building.\nOn tiptoes, Greaseball poked his head through the door panel. \"All set.\"\nRoberds nodded at him. \"Stick with it!\" and jerked a thumb at Rat\noutside. Grease nodded understanding.\n\"Okay, Rat, you can go to bed now.\" He dropped the ladder against the\nwall and sat on it. \"Good night.\" He watched Rat walk slowly away.\nSwinging down the path towards his own rambling shack, Rat caught a\nsibilant whisper. Pausing, undecided, he heard it again.\n\"Here ... can you see me?\" A white clad arm waved in the gloom. Rat\nregarded the arm in the window. Another impatient gesture, and he\nstepped to the sill.\n\"Yes?\"\u2014in the softest of whispers. The voices of the men in droning\nconversation drifted in. \"What you want?\"\nNothing but silence for a few hanging seconds, and then: \"Can you pilot\nthat ship?\" Her voice was shaky.\nHe didn't answer, stared at her confused. He felt her fear as clearly\nas he detected it in her words.\n\"Well,\ncan\nyou?\" she demanded.\n\"Damn yes!\" he stated simply. \"It now necessary?\"\n\"Very! She is becoming worse. I'm afraid to wait until daylight.\nAnd ... well, we want\nyou\nto pilot it! She refuses to risk\nMr. Roberds' job. She favors you.\"\nRat stepped back, astonished. \"She?\"\nNurse Gray moved from the window and Rat saw the second form in the\nroom, a slight, quiet figure on a small cot. \"My patient,\" Nurse Gray\nexplained. \"She overheard our conversation awhile ago. Quick, please,\ncan you?\"\nRat looked at her and then at the girl on the cot. He vanished from the\nwindow. Almost immediately, he was back again.\n\"When?\" he whispered.\n\"As soon as possible. Yes. Do you know...?\" but he had gone again.\nNurse Gray found herself addressing blackness. On the point of turning,\nshe saw him back again.\n\"Blankets,\" he instructed. \"Wrap in blankets. Cold\u2014hot too. Wrap\ngood!\" And he was gone again. Gray blinked away the illusion he\ndisappeared upwards.\nShe ran over to the girl. \"Judith, if you want to back down, now is the\ntime. He'll be back in a moment.\"\n\"No!\" Judith moaned. \"No!\" Gray smiled in the darkness and began\nwrapping the blankets around her. A light tapping at the window\nannounced the return of Rat. The nurse pushed open the window wide, saw\nhim out there with arms upstretched.\n\"Grit your teeth and hold on! Here we go.\" She picked up the blanketed\ngirl in both arms and walked to the window. Rat took the girl easily as\nshe was swung out, the blackness hid them both. But he appeared again\ninstantly.\n\"Better lock window,\" he cautioned. \"Stall, if Boss call. Back\nsoon....\" and he was gone.\nTo Nurse Gray the fifteen minute wait seemed like hours, impatient\nagonizing hours of tight-lipped anxiety.\nFeet first, she swung through the window, clutching a small bag in her\nhands. She never touched ground. Rat whispered \"Hold tight!\" in her\near and the wind was abruptly yanked from her! The ground fell away\nin a dizzy rush, unseen but felt, in the night! Her feet scraped on\nsome projection, and she felt herself being lifted still higher. Wind\nreturned to her throat, and she breathed again.\n\"I'm sorry,\" she managed to get out, gaspingly. \"I wasn't expecting\nthat. I had forgotten you\u2014\"\n\"\u2014had wings,\" he finished and chuckled. \"So likewise Greaseball.\" The\npale office lights dropped away as they sped over the field. On the far\nhorizon, a tinge of dawn crept along the uneven terrain.\n\"Oh, the bag!\" she gasped. \"I've dropped it.\"\nHe chuckled again. \"Have got. You scare, I catch.\"\nShe didn't see the ship because of the wind in her eyes, but without\nwarning she plummeted down and her feet jarred on the lip of the lock.\n\"Inside. No noise, no light. Easy.\" But in spite of his warning she\ntripped in the darkness. He helped her from the floor and guided her to\nthe hammocks.\n\"Judith?\" she asked.\n\"Here. Beside you, trussed up so tight I can hardly breathe.\"\n\"No talk!\" Rat insisted. \"Much hush-hush needed. Other girl shipshape.\nYou make likewise.\" Forcibly he shoved her into a hammock. \"Wrap up\ntight. Straps tight. When we go, we go fast. Bang!\" And he left her.\n\"Hey! Where are you going now?\"\n\"To get Gladney. He sick too. Hush hush!\" His voice floated back.\n\"Where has he gone?\" Judith called.\n\"Back for another man. Remember the two miners who found us when we\ncrashed? The burly one fell off a rock-bank as they were bringing us\nin. Stove in his ribs pretty badly. The other has a broken arm ...\nhappened once while you were out. They wouldn't let me say anything for\nfear of worrying you.\"\nThe girl did not answer then and a hushed expectancy fell over the\nship. Somewhere aft a small motor was running. Wind whistled past the\nopen lock.\n\"I've caused plenty of trouble haven't I?\" she asked aloud, finally.\n\"This was certainly a fool stunt, and I'm guilty of a lot of fool\nstunts! I just didn't realize until now the\nwhy\nof that law.\"\n\"Don't talk so much,\" the nurse admonished. \"A lot of people have found\nout the\nwhy\nof that law the hard way, just as you are doing, and\nlived to remember it. Until hospitals are built on this forlorn world,\nhumans like you who haven't been properly conditioned will have to stay\nright at home.\"\n\"How about these men that live and work here?\"\n\"They never get here until they've been through the mill first.\nAdenoids, appendix', all the extra parts they can get along without.\"\n\"Well,\" Judith said. \"I've certainly learned my lesson!\"\nGray didn't answer, but from out of the darkness surrounding her came a\nsound remarkably resembling a snort.\n\"Gray?\" Judith asked fearfully.\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Hasn't the pilot been gone an awfully long time?\"\nRat himself provided the answer by alighting at the lip with a jar that\nshook the ship. He was breathing heavily and lugging something in his\narms. The burden groaned.\n\"Gladney!\" Nurse Gray exclaimed.\n\"I got.\" Rat confirmed. \"Yes, Gladney. Damn heavy, Gladney.\"\n\"But how?\" she demanded. \"What of Roberds and Peterson?\"\n\"Trick,\" he sniggered. \"I burn down my shack. Boss run out. I run in.\nVery simple.\" He packed Gladney into the remaining hammock and snapped\nbuckles.\n\"And Peterson?\" she prompted.\n\"Oh yes. Peterson. So sorry about Peterson. Had to fan him.\"\n\"\nFan\nhim? I don't understand.\"\n\"Fan. With chair. Everything all right. I apologized.\" Rat finished up\nand was walking back to the lock. They heard a slight rustling of wings\nas he padded away.\nHe was back instantly, duplicating his feat of a short time ago.\nCursing shouts were slung on the night air, and the deadly spang of\nbullets bounced on the hull! Some entered the lock. The Centaurian\nsnapped it shut. Chunks of lead continued to pound the ship. Rat leaped\nfor the pilot's chair, heavily, a wing drooping.\n\"You've been hurt!\" Gray cried. A small panel light outlined his\nfeatures. She tried to struggle up.\n\"Lie still! We go. Boss get wise.\" With lightning fingers he flicked\nseveral switches on the panel, turned to her. \"Hold belly. Zoom!\"\nGray folded her hands across her stomach and closed her eyes.\nRat unlocked the master level and shoved!\n\"Whew!\" Nurse Gray came back to throbbing awareness, the all too\nfamiliar feeling of a misplaced stomach attempting to force its\ncrowded way into her boots plaguing her. Rockets roared in the rear.\nShe loosened a few straps and twisted over. Judith was still out, her\nface tensed in pain. Gray bit her lip and twisted the other way. The\nCentaurian was grinning at her.\n\"Do you always leave in a hurry?\" she demanded, and instantly wished\nshe hadn't said it. He gave no outward sign.\n\"Long-time sleep,\" he announced. \"Four, five hours maybe.\" The chest\nstrap was lying loose at his side.\n\"That long!\" she was incredulous. \"I'm never out more than three\nhours!\" Unloosening more straps, she sat up, glanced at the control\npanel.\n\"Not taking time,\" he stated simply and pointed to a dial. Gray shook\nher head and looked at the others.\n\"That isn't doing either of them any good!\"\nRat nodded unhappily. \"What's her matter\u2014?\" pointing.\n\"Appendix. Something about this atmosphere sends it haywire. The thing\nitself isn't diseased, but it starts manufacturing poison. Patient dies\nin a week unless it is taken out.\"\n\"Don't know it,\" he said briefly.\n\"Do you mean to say you don't have an appendix?\" she demanded.\nRat folded his arms and considered this. \"Don't know. Maybe yes, maybe\nno. Where's it hurt?\"\nGray pointed out the location. The Centaurian considered this further\nand drifted into long contemplation. Watching him, Gray remembered his\neyes that night ... only\nlast\nnight ... in the office. Peterson had\nrefused to meet them. After awhile Rat came out of it.\n\"No,\" he waved. \"No appendix. Never nowhere appendix.\"\n\"Then Mother Nature has finally woke up!\" she exclaimed. \"But why do\nCentaurians rate it exclusively?\"\nRat ignored this and asked one of her. \"What you and her doing up\nthere?\" He pointed back and up, to where Mars obliterated the stars.\n\"You might call it a pleasure jaunt. She's only seventeen. We came over\nin a cruiser belonging to her father; it was rather large and easy to\nhandle. But the cruise ended when she lost control of the ship because\nof an attack of space-appendicitis. The rest you know.\"\n\"So you?\"\n\"So I'm a combination nurse, governess, guard and what have you. Or\nwill be until we get back. After this, I'll probably be looking for\nwork.\" She shivered.\n\"Cold?\" he inquired concernedly.\n\"On the contrary, I'm too warm.\" She started to remove the blanket. Rat\nthrew up a hand to stop her.\n\"Leave on! Hot out here.\"\n\"But I'm too hot now. I want to take it off!\"\n\"No. Leave on. Wool blanket. Keep in body heat, yes. Keep out cold,\nyes. Keep in, keep out, likewise. See?\"\nGray stared at him. \"I never thought of it that way before. Why of\ncourse! If it protects from one temperature, it will protect from\nanother. Isn't it silly of me not to know that?\" Heat pressing on her\nface accented the fact.\n\"What is your name?\" she asked. \"Your real one I mean.\"\nHe grinned. \"Big. You couldn't say it. Sound like Christmas and\nbottlenose together real fast. Just say Rat. Everybody does.\" His eyes\nswept the panel and flashed back to her. \"Your name Gray. Have a front\nname?\"\n\"Patti.\"\n\"Pretty, Patti.\"\n\"No, just Patti. Say, what's the matter with the cooling system?\"\n\"Damn punk,\" he said. \"This crate for surface work. No space. Cooling\nsystem groan, damn punk. Won't keep cool here.\"\n\"And ...\" she followed up, \"it will get warmer as we go out?\"\nRat turned back to his board in a brown study and carefully ignored\nher. Gray grasped an inkling of what the coming week could bring.\n\"But how about water?\" she demanded next. \"Is there enough?\"\nHe faced about. \"For her\u2014\" nodding to Judith, \"and him\u2014\" to Gladney,\n\"yes. Sparingly. Four hours every time, maybe.\" Back to Gray. \"You,\nme ... twice a day. Too bad.\" His eyes drifted aft to the tank of\nwater. She followed. \"One tank water. All the rest fuel. Too bad, too\nbad. We get thirsty I think.\"\nThey did get thirsty, soon. A damnable hot thirst accented by\nthe knowledge that water was precious, a thirst increased by a\ndried-up-in-the-mouth sensation. Their first drink was strangely\nbitter; tragically disappointing. Patti Gray suddenly swung upright in\nthe hammock and kicked her legs. She massaged her throat with a nervous\nhand, wiped damp hair from about her face.\n\"I have to have a drink.\"\nRat stared at her without answer.\n\"I said, I have to have a drink!\"\n\"Heard you.\"\n\"Well...?\"\n\"Well, nothing. Stall. Keep water longer.\"\nShe swung a vicious boot and missed by inches. Rat grinned, and made\nhis way aft, hand over hand. He treaded cautiously along the deck. \"Do\nlike this,\" he called over his shoulder. \"Gravity punk too. Back and\nunder, gravity.\" He waited until she joined him at the water tap.\nThey stood there glaring idiotically at each other.\nShe burst out laughing. \"They even threw the drinking cups out!\" Rat\ninched the handle grudgingly and she applied lips to the faucet.\n\"Faugh!\" Gray sprang back, forgot herself and lost her balance, sat\ndown on the deck and spat out the water. \"It's hot! It tastes like hell\nand it's hot! It must be fuel!\"\nRat applied his lips to the tap and sampled. Coming up with a mouthful\nhe swished it around on his tongue like mouthwash. Abruptly he\ncontrived a facial contortion between a grin and a grimace, and let\nsome of the water trickle from the edges of his mouth. He swallowed and\nit cost him something.\n\"No. I mean yes, I think. Water, no doubt. Yes. Fuel out, water in.\nSwish-swush. Dammit, Greaseball forget to wash tank!\"\n\"But what makes it so hot?\" She worked her mouth to dry-rinse the taste\nof the fuel.\n\"Ship get hot. Water on sun side. H-m-m-m-m-m-m.\"\n\"H-m-m-m-m-m-m-m what?\"\n\"Flip-flop.\" He could talk with his hands as well. \"Hot side over like\npancake.\" Rat hobbled over to the board and sat down. An experimental\nflick on a lever produced nothing. Another flick, this time followed by\na quivering jar. He contemplated the panel board while fastening his\nbelt.\n\"H-m-m-m-m-m-m,\" the lower lip protruded.\nGray protested. \"Oh, stop humming and do something! That wa\u2014\" the\nword was queerly torn from her throat, and a scream magically filled\nthe vacancy. Nurse Gray sat up and rubbed a painful spot that had\nsuddenly appeared on her arm. She found her nose bleeding and another\nnew, swelling bruise on the side of her head. Around her the place was\nempty. Bare.\nNo, not quite. A wispy something was hanging just out of sight in\nthe corner of the eye; the water tap was now moulded\nupward\n, beads\nglistening on its handle. The wispy thing caught her attention again\nand she looked up.\nTwo people, tightly wrapped and bound in hammocks, were staring down at\nher, amazed, swinging on their stomachs. Craning further, she saw Rat.\nHe was hanging upside down in the chair, grinning at her in reverse.\n\"Flip-flop,\" he laconically explained.\n\"For cripes sakes, Jehosaphat!\" Gladney groaned. \"Turn me over on my\nback! Do something!\" Gray stood on tiptoes and just could pivot the\nhammocks on their rope-axis.\n\"And now, please, just\nhow\ndo I get into mine?\" she bit at Rat.\nExistence dragged. Paradoxically, time dropped away like a cloak as\nthe sense of individual hours and minutes vanished, and into its place\ncrept a slow-torturing substitute. As the ship revolved, monotonously,\nfirst the ceiling and then the floor took on dullish, maddening\naspects, eyes ached continuously from staring at them time and again\nwithout surcease. The steady, drumming rockets crashed into the mind\nand the walls shrieked malevolently on the eyeballs. Dull, throbbing\nsameness of the poorly filtered air, a growing taint in the nostrils.\nDamp warm skin, reeking blankets. The taste of fuel in the mouth for\nrefreshment. Slowly mounting mental duress. And above all the drumming\nof the rockets.\nOnce, a sudden, frightening change of pitch in the rockets and a wild,\nsickening lurch. Meteor rain. Maddening, plunging swings to the far\nright and left, made without warning. A torn lip as a sudden lurch\ntears the faucet from her mouth. A shattered tooth.\n\"Sorry!\" Rat whispered.\n\"Shut up and drive!\" she cried.\n\"Patti ...\" Judith called out, in pain.\nPeace of mind followed peace of body into a forgotten limbo of lost\nthings, a slyly climbing madness directed at one another. Waspish\nwords uttered in pain, fatigue and temper. Fractiousness. A hot,\nconfined, stale hell. Sleep became a hollow mockery, as bad water\nand concentrated tablets brought on stomach pains to plague them.\nConsciousness punctured only by spasms of lethargy, shared to some\nextent by the invalids. Above all, crawling lassitude and incalescent\ntempers.\nRat watched the white, drawn face swing in the hammock beside him. And\nhis hands never faltered on the controls.\nNever a slackening of the terrific pace; abnormal speed, gruelling\ndrive ... drive ... drive. Fear. Tantalizing fear made worse because\nRat couldn't understand. Smothered moaning that ate at his nerves.\nGrim-faced, sleep-wracked, belted to the chair, driving!\n\"How many days? How many days!\" Gray begged of him thousands of times\nuntil the very repetition grated on her eardrums. \"How many days?\"\nHis only answer was an inhuman snarl, and the cruel blazing of those\ninhuman eyes.\nShe fell face first to the floor. \"I can't keep it up!\" she cried. The\nsound of her voice rolled along the hot steel deck. \"I cant! I cant!\"\nA double handful of tepid water was thrown in her face. \"Get up!\" Rat\nstood over her, face twisted, his body hunched. \"Get up!\" She stared at\nhim, dazed. He kicked her. \"Get up!\" The tepid water ran off her face\nand far away she heard Judith calling.... She forced herself up. Rat\nwas back in the chair.\nGladney unexpectedly exploded. He had been awake for a long time,\nwatching Rat at the board. Wrenching loose a chest strap he attempted\nto sit up.\n\"Rat! Damn you Rat, listen to me!\nWhen're you going to start braking\n,\nRat?\"\n\"I hear you.\" He turned on Gladney with dulled eyes. \"Lie down. You\nsick.\"\n\"I'll be damned if I'm going to lie here and let you drive us to Orion!\nWe must be near the half-way line! When are you going to start braking?\"\n\"Not brake,\" Rat answered sullenly. \"No, not brake.\"\n\"\nNot brake?\n\" Gladney screamed and sat bolt upright. Nurse Gray jumped\nfor him. \"Are you crazy, you skinny rat?\" Gray secured a hold on his\nshoulders and forced him down. \"You gotta brake! Don't you understand\nthat? You have to, you vacuum-skull!\" Gray was pleading with him to\nshut-up like a good fellow. He appealed to her. \"He's gotta brake! Make\nhim!\"\n\"He has a good point there, Rat,\" she spoke up. \"What about this\nhalf-way line?\"\nHe turned to her with a weary ghost of the old smile on his face. \"We\npassed line. Three days ago, maybe.\" A shrug of shoulders.\n\"Passed!\" Gray and Gladney exclaimed in unison.\n\"You catch on quick,\" Rat nodded. \"This six day, don't you know?\"\nGladney sank back, exhausted. The nurse crept over to the pilot.\n\"Getting your figures mixed, aren't you?\"\nRat shook his head and said nothing.\n\"But Roberds said eight days, and he\u2014\"\n\"\u2014he on Mars. I here. Boss nuts, too sad. He drive, it be eight days.\nNow only six.\" He cast a glance at Judith and found her eyes closed.\n\"Six days, no brake. No.\"\n\"I see your point, and appreciate it,\" Gray cut in. \"But now what? This\ndeceleration business ... there is a whole lot I don't know, but some\nthings I do!\"\nRat refused the expected answer. \"Land tonight, I think. Never been to\nEarth before. Somebody meet us, I think.\"\n\"You can bet your leather boots somebody will meet us!\" Gladney cried.\nGray turned to him. \"The Chief'll have the whole planet waiting for\nyou\n!\" He laughed with real satisfaction. \"Oh yes, Rat, they'll be\nsomebody waiting for us all right.\" And then he added: \"If we land.\"\n\"Oh, we land.\" Rat confided, glad to share a secret.\n\"Yeah,\" Gladney grated. \"But in how many little pieces?\"\n\"I've never been to Earth before. Nice, I think.\" Patti Gray caught\nsomething new in the tone and stared at him. Gladney must have noticed\nit, too.\nThe Centaurian moved sideways and pointed. Gray placed her eyes in the\nvacated position.\n\"Earth!\" she shouted.\n\"Quite. Nice. Do me a favor?\"\n\"Just name it!\"\n\"Not drink long time. Some water?\"\nGray nodded and went to the faucet. The drumming seemed remote, the\ntension vanished. She was an uncommonly long time in returning, at last\nshe appeared beside him, outstretched hands dry.\n\"There isn't any left, Rat.\"\nRat batted his tired eyes expressively. \"Tasted punk,\" he grinned at\nher.\nShe sat down on the floor suddenly and buried her face.\n\"Rat,\" she said presently, \"I want to ask you something, rather\npersonal? Your ... name. 'Rat'? Roberds told me something about your\nrecord. But ... please tell me, Rat. You didn't know the attack was\ncoming, did you?\"\nHe grinned again and waggled his head at her. \"No. Who tell Rat?\"\nSuddenly he was deadly serious as he spoke to her. \"Rat a.w.o.l., go\nout to help sick man alone in desert. Rat leave post. Not time send\ncall through. Come back with man, find horrible thing happen.\"\n\"But why didn't you explain?\"\nHe grinned again. \"Who believe? Sick man die soon after.\"\nGladney sat up. He had heard the conversation between the two. \"You're\nright, Rat. No one would have believed you then, and no one will now.\nYou've been safe enough on Mars, but the police will nab you as soon as\nyou get out of the ship.\"\n\"They can't!\" cried Patti Gray. \"They can't hurt him after what he's\ndone now.\"\nThe Centaurian grinned in a cynical way.\n\"Police not get me, Gladney. Gladney's memory damn punk, I think. Earth\npretty nice place, maybe. But not for Rat.\"\nGladney stared at him for minutes. Then: \"Say, I get it ... you're\u2014\"\n\"Shut up!\" Rat cut him off sharply. \"You talk too much.\" He cast a\nglance at Nurse Gray and then threw a meaning look at Gladney.\n", "summary": "The story begins on a ship that has landed on Ganymede, a planet that does not have a hospital. The ship is loaded with a woman named Judith, a nurse, a governess, a guard, and a man named Mr. Roberds. The woman is named Gladney, and she has been on a six-month vacation with her husband, Robert, and their ship, a small ship meant for two, and built for planetary surface flights. She had been on the ship for eight days before she lost control of the ship because of an attack of space-appendicitis. She was rescued by the ship's pilot, a Ganymer named Rat, and he was able to save her and her husband by piloting a surface rocket in which to escape. The story ends with the two of them on the surface of the planet, where they are attacked by a horde of monsters and unable to leave.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}

BOND\nIsobar and his squeeze-pipes were the bane of\nthe Moon Station's existence. But there came\nthe day when his comrades found that the worth\nof a man lies sometimes in his nuisance value.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories March 1943.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nThe audiophone buzzed thrice\u2014one long, followed by two shorts\u2014and\nIsobar Jones pressed the stud activating its glowing scanner-disc.\n\"Hummm?\" he said absent-mindedly.\nThe selenoplate glowed faintly, and the image of the Dome Commander\nappeared.\n\"Report ready, Jones?\"\n\"Almost,\" acknowledged Isobar gloomily. \"It prob'ly ain't right,\nthough. How anybody can be expected to get\nanything\nright on this\ndagnabbed hunk o' green cheese\u2014\"\n\"Send it up,\" interrupted Colonel Eagan, \"as soon as you can. Sparks is\nmaking Terra contact now. That is all.\"\n\"That ain't all!\" declared Isobar indignantly. \"How about my bag\u2014?\"\nIt\nwas all\n, so far as the D.C. was concerned. Isobar was talking\nto himself. The plate dulled. Isobar said, \"Nuts!\" and returned to\nhis duties. He jotted neat ditto marks under the word \"Clear\" which,\nsix months ago, he had placed beneath the column headed:\nCond. of\nObs.\nHe noted the proper figures under the headings\nSun Spots\n:\nMax\nFreq.\n\u2014\nMin. Freq.\n; then he sketched careful curves in blue and red\nink upon the Mercator projection of Earth which was his daily work\nsheet.\nThis done, he drew a clean sheet of paper out of his desk drawer,\nfrowned thoughtfully at the tabulated results of his observations, and\nbegan writing.\n\"\nWeather forecast for Terra\n,\" he wrote, his pen making scratching\nsounds.\nThe audiophone rasped again. Isobar jabbed the stud and answered\nwithout looking.\n\"O.Q.,\" he said wearily. \"O.Q. I told you it would be ready in a couple\no' minutes. Keep your pants on!\"\n\"I\u2014er\u2014I beg your pardon, Isobar?\" queried a mild voice.\nIsobar started. His sallow cheeks achieved a sickly salmon hue. He\nblinked nervously.\n\"Oh, jumpin' jimminy!\" he gulped. \"\nYou\n, Miss Sally! Golly\u2014'scuse me!\nI didn't realize\u2014\"\nThe Dome Commander's niece giggled.\n\"That's all right, Isobar. I just called to ask you about the weather\nin Oceania Sector 4B next week. I've got a swimming date at Waikiki,\nbut I won't make the shuttle unless the weather's going to be nice.\"\n\"It is,\" promised Isobar. \"It'll be swell all weekend, Miss Sally.\nFine sunshiny weather. You can go.\"\n\"That's wonderful. Thanks so much, Isobar.\"\n\"Don't mention it, ma'am,\" said Isobar, and returned to his work.\nSouth America. Africa. Asia. Pan-Europa. Swiftly he outlined the\nmeteorological prospects for each sector. He enjoyed this part of his\njob. As he wrote forecasts for each area, in his mind's eye he saw\nhimself enjoying such pastimes as each geographical division's terrain\nrendered possible.\nIf home is where the heart is, Horatio Jones\u2014known better as \"Isobar\"\nto his associates at the Experimental Dome on Luna\u2014was a long, long\nway from home. His lean, gangling frame was immured, and had been for\nsix tedious Earth months, beneath the\nimpervite\nhemisphere of Lunar\nIII\u2014that frontier outpost which served as a rocket refueling station,\nteleradio transmission point and meteorological base.\n\"Six solid months! Six sad, dreary months!\" thought Isobar, \"Locked up\nin an airtight Dome like\u2014like a goldfish in a glass bowl!\" Sunlight?\nOh, sure! But filtered through ultraviolet wave-traps so it could not\nburn, it left the skin pale and lustreless and clammy as the belly of a\ntoad. Fresh air? Pooh! Nothing but that everlasting sickening, scented,\nreoxygenated stuff gushing from atmo-conditioning units.\nExcitement? Adventure? The romance he had been led to expect when he\nsigned on for frontier service? Bah! Only a weary, monotonous, routine\nexistence.\n\"A pain!\" declared Isobar Jones. \"That's what it is; a pain in the\nstummick. Not even allowed to\u2014Yeah?\"\nIt was Sparks, audioing from the Dome's transmission turret. He said,\n\"Hyah, Jonesy! How comes with the report?\"\n\"Done,\" said Isobar. \"I was just gettin' the sheets together for you.\"\n\"O.Q. But just bring\nit\n. Nothing else.\"\nIsobar bridled.\n\"I don't know what you're talkin' about.\"\n\"Oh, no? Well, I'm talking about that squawk-filled doodlesack of\nyours, sonny boy. Don't bring that bag-full of noise up here with you.\"\nIsobar said defiantly, \"It ain't a doodlesack. It's a bagpipe. And I\nguess I can play it if I want to\u2014\"\n\"Not,\" said Sparks emphatically, \"in\nmy\ncubby! I've got sensitive\neardrums. Well, stir your stumps! I've got to get the report rolling\nquick today. Big doings up here.\"\n\"Yeah? What?\"\n\"Well, it's Roberts and Brown\u2014\"\n\"What about 'em?\"\n\"They've gone Outside to make foundation repairs.\"\n\"Lucky stiffs!\" commented Isobar ruefully.\n\"Lucky, no. Stiffs, maybe\u2014if they should meet any Grannies. Well,\nscoot along. I'm on the ether in four point sixteen minutes.\"\n\"Be right up,\" promised Isobar, and, sheets in hand, he ambled from his\ncloistered cell toward the central section of the Dome.\nHe didn't leave Sparks' turret after the sheets were delivered.\nInstead, he hung around, fidgeting so obtrusively that Riley finally\nturned to him in sheer exasperation.\n\"Sweet snakes of Saturn, Jonesy, what's the trouble? Bugs in your\nbritches?\"\nIsobar said, \"H-huh? Oh, you mean\u2014Oh, thanks, no! I just thought mebbe\nyou wouldn't mind if I\u2014well\u2014er\u2014\"\n\"I get it!\" Sparks grinned. \"Want to play peekaboo while the contact's\nopen, eh? Well, O.Q. Watch the birdie!\"\nHe twisted dials, adjusted verniers, fingered a host of\nincomprehensible keys. Current hummed and howled. Then a plate before\nhim cleared, and the voice of the Earth operator came in, enunciating\nwith painstaking clarity:\n\"Earth answering Luna. Earth answering Luna's call. Can you hear me,\nLuna? Can you hear\u2014?\"\n\"I can not only hear you,\" snorted Riley, \"I can see you and smell you,\nas well. Stop hamming it, stupid! You're lousing up the earth!\"\nThe now-visible face of the Earth radioman drew into a grimace of\ndispleasure.\n\"Oh, it's\nyou\n? Funny man, eh? Funny man Riley?\"\n\"Sure,\" said Riley agreeably. \"I'm a scream. Four-alarm Riley,\nthe cosmic comedian\u2014didn't you know? Flick on your dictacoder,\noyster-puss; here's the weather report.\" He read it. \"'\nWeather\nforecast for Terra, week of May 15-21\n\u2014'\"\n\"Ask him,\" whispered Isobar eagerly. \"Sparks, don't forget to ask him!\"\nRiley motioned for silence, but nodded. He finished the weather report,\nentered the Dome Commander's log upon the Home Office records, and\ndictated a short entry from the Luna Biological Commission. Then:\n\"That is all,\" he concluded.\n\"O.Q.,\" verified the other radioman. Isobar writhed anxiously, prodded\nRiley's shoulder.\n\"Ask him, Sparks! Go on ask him!\"\n\"Oh, cut jets, will you?\" snapped Sparks. The Terra operator looked\nstartled.\n\"How's that? I didn't say a word\u2014\"\n\"Don't be a dope,\" said Sparks, \"you dope! I wasn't talking to you.\nI'm entertaining a visitor, a refugee from a cuckoo clock. Look, do me\na favor, chum? Can you twist your mike around so it's pointing out a\nwindow?\"\n\"What? Why\u2014why, yes, but\u2014\"\n\"Without buts,\" said Sparks grumpily. \"Yours not to reason why; yours\nbut to do or don't. Will you do it?\"\n\"Well, sure. But I don't understand\u2014\" The silver platter which had\nmirrored the radioman's face clouded as the Earth operator twirled the\ninconoscope. Walls and desks of an ordinary broadcasting office spun\nbriefly into view; then the plate reflected a glimpse of an Earthly\nlandscape. Soft blue sky warmed by an atmosphere-shielded sun ... green\ntrees firmly rooted in still-greener grass ... flowers ... birds ...\npeople....\n\"Enough?\" asked Sparks.\nIsobar Jones awakened from his trance, eyes dulling. Reluctantly he\nnodded. Riley stared at him strangely, almost gently. To the other\nradioman, \"O.Q., pal,\" he said. \"Cut!\"\n\"Cut!\" agreed the other. The plate blanked out.\n\"Thanks, Sparks,\" said Isobar.\n\"Nothing,\" shrugged Riley \"\nHe twisted\nthe mike; not me. But\u2014how come\nyou always want to take a squint at Earth when the circuit's open,\nJonesy? Homesick?\"\n\"Sort of,\" admitted Isobar guiltily.\n\"Well, hell, aren't we all? But we can't leave here for another six\nmonths at least. Not till our tricks are up. I should think it'd only\nmake you feel worse to see Earth.\"\n\"It ain't Earth I'm homesick for,\" explained Isobar. \"It's\u2014well, it's\nthe things that go with it. I mean things like grass and flowers and\ntrees.\"\nSparks grinned; a mirthless, lopsided grin.\n\"We've got\nthem\nright here on Luna. Go look out the tower window,\nJonesy. The Dome's nestled smack in the middle of the prettiest,\ngreenest little valley you ever saw.\"\n\"I know,\" complained Isobar. \"And that's what makes it even worse. All\nthat pretty, soft, green stuff Outside\u2014and we ain't allowed to go out\nin it. Sometimes I get so mad I'd like to\u2014\"\n\"To,\" interrupted a crisp voice, \"what?\"\nIsobar spun, flushing; his eyes dropped before those of Dome Commander\nEagan. He squirmed.\n\"N-nothing, sir. I was only saying\u2014\"\n\"I heard you, Jones. And please let me hear no more of such talk, sir!\nIt is strictly forbidden for anyone to go Outside except in cases of\nabsolute necessity. Such labor as caused Patrolmen Brown and Roberts to\ngo, for example\u2014\"\n\"Any word from them yet, sir?\" asked Sparks eagerly.\n\"Not yet. But we're expecting them to return at any minute now. Jones!\nWhere are\nyou\ngoing?\"\n\"Why\u2014why, just back to my quarters, sir.\"\n\"That's what I thought. And what did you plan to do there?\"\nIsobar said stubbornly, \"Well, I sort of figured I'd amuse myself for a\nwhile\u2014\"\n\"I thought that, too. And with\nwhat\n, pray, Jones?\"\n\"With the only dratted thing,\" said Isobar, suddenly petulant, \"that\ngives me any fun around this dagnabbed place! With my bagpipe.\"\nCommander Eagan said, \"You'd better find some new way of amusing\nyourself, Jones. Have you read General Order 17?\"\nIsobar said, \"I seen it. But if you think\u2014\"\n\"It says,\" stated Eagan deliberately, \"'\nIn order that work or rest\nperiods of the Dome's staff may not be disturbed, it is hereby ordered\nthat the playing or practicing of all or any musical instruments must\nbe discontinued immediately. By order of the Dome Commander\n,' That\nmeans you, Jones!\"\n\"But, dingbust it!\" keened Isobar, \"it don't disturb nobody for me to\nplay my bagpipes! I know these lunks around here don't appreciate good\nmusic, so I always go in my office and lock the door after me\u2014\"\n\"But the Dome,\" pointed out Commander Eagan, \"has an air-conditioning\nsystem which can't be shut off. The ungodly moans of\nyour\u2014er\u2014so-called musical instrument can be heard through the entire\nstructure.\"\nHe suddenly seemed to gain stature.\n\"No, Jones, this order is final! You cannot disrupt our entire\norganization for your own\u2014er\u2014amusement.\"\n\"But\u2014\" said Isobar.\n\"No!\"\nIsobar wriggled desperately. Life on Luna was sorry enough already.\nIf now they took from him the last remaining solace he had, the last\namusement which lightened his moments of freedom\u2014\n\"Look, Commander!\" he pleaded, \"I tell you what I'll do. I won't bother\nnobody. I'll go Outside and play it\u2014\"\n\"Outside!\" Eagan stared at him incredulously. \"Are you mad? How about\nthe Grannies?\"\nIsobar knew all about the Grannies. The only mobile form of life\nfound by space-questing man on Earth's satellite, their name was an\nabbreviation of the descriptive one applied to them by the first Lunar\nexployers: Granitebacks. This was no exaggeration; if anything, it was\nan understatement. For the Grannies, though possessed of certain low\nintelligence, had quickly proven themselves a deadly, unyielding and\nimplacable foe.\nWorse yet, they were an enemy almost indestructible! No man had ever\nyet brought to Earth laboratories the carcass of a Grannie; science\nwas completely baffled in its endeavors to explain the composition of\nGraniteback physiology\u2014but it was known, from bitter experience, that\nthe carapace or exoskeleton of the Grannies was formed of something\nharder than steel, diamond, or battleplate! This flesh could be\npenetrated by no weapon known to man; neither by steel nor flame,\nby electronic nor ionic wave, nor by the lethal, newly discovered\natomo-needle dispenser.\nAll this Isobar knew about the Grannies. Yet:\n\"They ain't been any Grannies seen around the Dome,\" he said, \"for\na 'coon's age. Anyhow, if I seen any comin', I could run right back\ninside\u2014\"\n\"No!\" said Commander Eagan flatly. \"Absolutely,\nno\n! I have no time\nfor such nonsense. You know the orders\u2014obey them! And now, gentlemen,\ngood afternoon!\"\nHe left. Sparks turned to Isobar, grinning.\n\"Well,\" he said, \"one man's fish\u2014hey, Jonesy? Too bad you can't play\nyour doodlesack any more, but frankly, I'm just as glad. Of all the\nawful screeching wails\u2014\"\nBut Isobar Jones, generally mild and gentle, was now in a perfect\nfury. His pale eyes blazed, he stomped his foot on the floor, and from\nhis lips poured a stream of such angry invective that Riley looked\nstartled. Words that, to Isobar, were the utter dregs of violent\nprofanity.\n\"Oh, dagnab it!\" fumed Isobar Jones. \"Oh, tarnation and dingbust!\nOh\u2014\nfiddlesticks\n!\"\nII\n\"And so,\" chuckled Riley, \"he left, bubbling like a kettle on a red-hot\noven. But, boy! was he ever mad! Just about ready to bust, he was.\"\nSome minutes had passed since Isobar had left; Riley was talking to Dr.\nLoesch, head of the Dome's Physics Research Division. The older man\nnodded commiseratingly.\n\"It is funny, yes,\" he agreed, \"but at the same time it is not\naltogether amusing. I feel sorry for him. He is a very unhappy man, our\npoor Isobar.\"\n\"Yeah, I know,\" said Riley, \"but, hell, we all get a little bit\nhomesick now and then. He ought to learn to\u2014\"\n\"Excuse me, my boy,\" interrupted the aged physicist, his voice gentle,\n\"it is not mere homesickness that troubles our friend. It is something\ndeeper, much more vital and serious. It is what my people call:\nweltschmertz\n. There is no accurate translation in English. It means\n'world sickness,' or better, 'world weariness'\u2014something like that but\nintensified a thousandfold.\n\"It is a deeply-rooted mental condition, sometimes a dangerous frame\nof mind. Under its grip, men do wild things. Hating the world on which\nthey find themselves, they rebel in curious ways. Suicide ... mad acts\nof valor ... deeds of cunning or knavery....\"\n\"You mean,\" demanded Sparks anxiously, \"Isobar ain't got all his\nbuttons?\"\n\"Not that exactly. He is perfectly sane. But he is in a dark morass\nof despair. He may try\nanything\nto retrieve his lost happiness, rid\nhis soul of its dark oppression. His world-sickness is like a crying\nhunger\u2014By the way, where is he now?\"\n\"Below, I guess. In his quarters.\"\n\"Ah, good! Perhaps he is sleeping. Let us hope so. In slumber he will\nfind peace and forgetfulness.\"\nBut Dr. Loesch would have been far less sanguine had some power the\n\"giftie gi'en\" him of watching Isobar Jones at that moment.\nIsobar was not asleep. Far from it. Wide awake and very much astir, he\nwas acting in a singularly sinister role: that of a slinking, furtive\nculprit.\nReturning to his private cubicle after his conversation with Dome\nCommander Eagan, he had stalked straightway to the cabinet wherein was\nencased his precious set of bagpipes. These he had taken from their\npegs, gazed upon defiantly, and fondled with almost parental affection.\n\"So I can't play you, huh?\" he muttered darkly. \"It disturbs the peace\no' the dingfounded, dumblasted Dome staff, does it? Well, we'll\nsee\nabout that!\"\nAnd tucking the bag under his arm, he had cautiously slipped from the\nroom, down little-used corridors, and now he stood before the huge\nimpervite\ngates which were the entrance to the Dome and the doorway\nto Outside.\nOn all save those occasions when a spacecraft landed in the cradle\nadjacent the gateway, these portals were doubly locked and barred. But\ntoday they had been unbolted that the two maintenance men might venture\nout. And since it was quite possible that Brown and Roberts might have\nto get inside in a hurry, their bolts remained drawn. Sole guardian of\nthe entrance was a very bored Junior Patrolman.\nUp to this worthy strode Isobar Jones, confident and assured, exuding\nan aura of propriety.\n\"Very well, Wilkins,\" he said. \"I'll take over now. You may go to the\nmeeting.\"\nWilkins looked at him bewilderedly.\n\"Huh? Whuzzat, Mr. Jones?\"\nIsobar's eyebrows arched.\n\"You mean you haven't been notified?\"\n\"Notified of\nwhat\n?\"\n\"Why, the general council of all Patrolmen! Weren't you told that I\nwould take your place here while you reported to G.H.Q.?\"\n\"I ain't,\" puzzled Wilkins, \"heard nothing about it. Maybe I ought to\ncall the office, maybe?\"\nAnd he moved the wall-audio. But Isobar said swiftly. \"That\u2014er\u2014won't\nbe necessary, Wilkins. My orders were plain enough. Now, you just run\nalong. I'll watch this entrance for you.\"\n\"We-e-ell,\" said Wilkins, \"if you say so. Orders is orders. But keep a\nsharp eye out, Mister Jones, in case Roberts and Brown should come back\nsudden-like.\"\n\"I will,\" promised Isobar, \"don't worry.\"\nWilkins moved away. Isobar waited until the Patrolman was completely\nout of sight. Then swiftly he pulled open the massive gate, slipped\nthrough, and closed it behind him.\nA flood of warmth, exhilarating after the constantly regulated\ntemperature of the Dome, descended upon him. Fresh air, thin, but\nfragrant with the scent of growing things, made his pulses stir with\njoyous abandon. He was Outside! He was Outside, in good sunlight, at\nlast! After six long and dreary months!\nRaptly, blissfully, all thought of caution tossed to the gentle breezes\nthat ruffled his sparse hair, Isobar Jones stepped forward into the\nlunar valley....\nHow long he wandered thus, carefree and utterly content, he could not\nafterward say. It seemed like minutes; it must have been longer. He\nonly knew that the grass was green beneath his feet, the trees were a\nlacy network through which warm sunlight filtered benevolently, the\nchirrupings of small insects and the rustling whisper of the breezes\nformed a tiny symphony of happiness through which he moved as one\ncharmed.\nIt did not occur to him that he had wandered too far from the Dome's\nentrance until, strolling through an enchanting flower-decked glade, he\nwas startled to hear\u2014off to his right\u2014the sharp, explosive bark of a\nHaemholtz ray pistol.\nHe whirled, staring about him wildly, and discovered that though his\nmeandering had kept him near the Dome, he had unconsciously followed\nits hemispherical perimeter to a point nearly two miles from the\nGateway. By the placement of ports and windows, Isobar was able to\njudge his location perfectly; he was opposite that portion of the\nstructure which housed Sparks' radio turret.\nAnd the shooting? That could only be\u2014\nHe did not have to name its reason, even to himself. For at that\nmoment, there came racing around the curve of the Dome a pair of\nfigures, Patrolmen clad in fatigue drab. Roberts and Brown. Roberts was\nstaggering, one foot dragged awkwardly as he ran; Brown's left arm,\nbloodstained from shoulder to elbow, hung limply at his side, but in\nhis good right fist he held a spitting Haemholtz with which he tried to\ncover his comrade's sluggish retreat.\nAnd behind these two, grim, grey, gaunt figures that moved with\nastonishing speed despite their massive bulk, came three ... six ... a\ndozen of those lunarites whom all men feared. The Grannies!\nIII\nSimultaneously with his recognition of the pair, Joe Roberts saw him. A\ngasp of relief escaped the wounded man.\n\"Jones! Thank the Lord! Then you picked up our cry for help? Quick,\nman\u2014where is it? Theres not a moment to waste!\"\n\"W-where,\" faltered Isobar feebly, \"is\nwhat\n?\"\n\"The tank, of course! Didn't you hear our telecast? We can't possibly\nmake it back to the gate without an armored car. My foot's broken,\nand\u2014\" Roberts stopped suddenly, an abrupt horror in his eyes. \"You\ndon't have one! You're here\nalone\n! Then you didn't pick up our call?\nBut, why\u2014?\"\n\"Never mind that,\" snapped Isobar, \"now!\" Placid by nature, he could\nmove when urgency drove. His quick mind saw the immediateness of their\nperil. Unarmed, he could not help the Patrolmen fight a delaying action\nagainst their foes, nor could he hasten their retreat. Anyway, weapons\nwere useless, and time was of the essence. There was but one temporary\nway of staving off disaster. \"Over here ... this tree! Quick! Up you\ngo! Give him a lift, Brown\u2014There! That's the stuff!\"\nHe was the last to scramble up the gnarled bole to a tentative leafy\nsanctuary. He had barely gained the security of the lowermost bough\nwhen a thundering crash resounded, the sturdy trunk trembled beneath\nhis clutch. Stony claws gouged yellow parallels in the bark scant\ninches beneath one kicking foot, then the Granny fell back with a thud.\nThe Graniteback was\nnot\na climber. It was far too ungainly, much too\nweighty for that.\nRoberts said weakly, \"Th-thanks, Jonesy! That was a close call.\"\n\"That goes for me, too, Jonesy,\" added Brown from an upper bough.\n\"But I'm afraid you just delayed matters. This tree's O.Q. as long\nas it lasts, but\u2014\" He stared down upon the gathering knot of\nGrannies unhappily\u2014\"it's not going to last long with that bunch of\nsuperdreadnaughts working out on it! Hold tight, fellows! Here they\ncome!\"\nFor the Grannies, who had huddled for a moment as if in telepathic\nconsultation, now joined forces, turned, and as one body charged\nheadlong toward the tree. The unified force of their attack was like\nthe shattering impact of a battering ram. Bark rasped and gritted\nbeneath the besieged men's hands, dry leaves and twigs pelted about\nthem in a tiny rain, tormented fibrous sinews groaned as the aged\nforest monarch shuddered in agony.\nDesperately they clung to their perches. Though the great tree bent, it\ndid not break. But when it stopped trembling, it was canted drunkenly\nto one side, and the erstwhile solid earth about its base was broken\nand cracked\u2014revealing fleshy tentacles uprooted from ancient moorings!\nBrown stared at this evidence of the Grannies' power with\nterror-fascinated eyes. His voice was none too firm.\n\"Lord! Piledrivers! A couple more like that\u2014\"\nIsobar nodded. He knew what falling into the clutch of the Grannies\nmeant. He had once seen the grisly aftermath of a Graniteback feast.\nEven now their adversaries had drawn back for a second attack. A sudden\nidea struck him. A straw of hope at which he grasped feverishly.\n\"You telecast a message to the Dome? Help should be on the way by now.\nIf we can just hold out\u2014\"\nBut Roberts shook his head.\n\"We sent a message, Jonesy, but I don't think it got through. I've just\nbeen looking at my portable. It seems to be busted. Happened when they\nfirst attacked us, I guess. I tripped and fell on it.\"\nIsobar's last hope flickered out.\n\"Then I\u2014I guess it won't be long now,\" he mourned. \"If we could have\nonly got a message through, they would have sent out an armored car to\npick us up. But as it is\u2014\"\nBrown's shrug displayed a bravado he did not feel.\n\"Well, that's the way it goes. We knew what we were risking when we\nvolunteered to come Outside. This damn moon! It'll never be worth\na plugged credit until men find some way to fight those murderous\nstones-on-legs!\"\nRoberts said, \"That's right. But what are\nyou\ndoing out here, Isobar?\nAnd why, for Pete's sake, the bagpipes?\"\n\"Oh\u2014the pipes?\" Isobar flushed painfully. He had almost forgotten\nhis original reason for adventuring Outside, had quite forgotten\nhis instrument, and was now rather amazed to discover that somehow\nthroughout all the excitement he had held onto it. \"Why, I just\nhappened to\u2014Oh!\nthe pipes!\n\"\n\"Hold on!\" roared Roberts. His warning came just in time. Once more,\nthe three tree-sitters shook like dried peas in a pod as their leafy\nrefuge trembled before the locomotive onslaught of the lunar beasts.\nThis time the already-exposed roots strained and lifted, several\nsnapped; when the Grannies again withdrew, complacently unaware that\nthe \"lethal ray\" of Brown's Haemholtz was wasting itself upon their\nadamant hides in futile fury, the tree was bent at a precarious angle.\nBrown sobbed, not with fear but with impotent anger, and in a gesture\nof enraged desperation, hurled his now-empty weapon at the retreating\nGrannies.\n\"No good! Not a damn bit of good! Oh, if there was only some way of\nfighting those filthy things\u2014\"\nBut Isobar Jones had a one-track mind. \"The pipes!\" he cried again,\nexcitedly. \"That's the answer!\" And he drew the instrument into playing\nposition, bag cuddled beneath one arm-pit, drones stiffly erect over\nhis shoulder, blow-pipe at his lips. His cheeks puffed, his breath\nexpelled. The giant lung swelled, the chaunter emitted its distinctive,\nfearsome, \"\nKaa-aa-o-o-o-oro-oong!\n\"\nRoberts moaned.\n\"Oh, Lord! A guy can't even die in peace!\"\nAnd Brown stared at him hopelessly.\n\"It's no use, Isobar. You trying to scare them off? They have no sense\nof hearing. That's been proven\u2014\"\nIsobar took his lips from the reed to explain.\n\"It's not that. I'm trying to rouse the boys in the Dome. We're right\nopposite the atmosphere-conditioning-unit. See that grilled duct over\nthere? That's an inhalation-vent. The portable transmitter's out of\norder, and our voices ain't strong enough to carry into the Dome\u2014but\nthe sound of these pipes is! And Commander Eagan told me just a short\nwhile ago that the sound of the pipes carries all over the building!\n\"If they hear this, they'll get mad because I'm disobeyin' orders.\nThey'll start lookin' for me. If they can't find me inside, maybe\nthey'll look Outside. See that window? That's Sparks' turret. If we can\nmake him look out here\u2014\"\n\"\nStop talking!\n\" roared Roberts. \"Stop talking, guy, and start\nblowing! I think you've got something there. Anyhow, it's our last\nhope.\nBlow!\n\"\n\"And quick!\" appended Brown. \"For here they come!\"\nIsobar played, blew with all his might, while the Grannies raged below.\nHe meant the Grannies. Again they were huddling for attack, once more,\na solid phalanx of indestructible, granite flesh, they were smashing\ndown upon the tree.\n\"\nHaa-a-roong!\n\" blew Isobar Jones.\nIV\nAnd\u2014even he could not have foreseen the astounding results of\nhis piping! What happened next was as astonishing as it was\nincomprehensible. For as the pipes, filled now and primed to burst into\nwhatever substitute for melody they were prodded into, wailed into\naction\u2014the Grannies' rush came to an abrupt halt!\nAs one, they stopped cold in their tracks and turned dull, colorless,\nquestioning eyes upward into the tree whence came this weird and\nvibrant droning!\nSo stunned with surprise was Isobar that his grip on the pipes relaxed,\nhis lips almost slipped from the reed. But Brown's delighted bellow\nlifted his paralysis.\n\"Sacred rings of Saturn-look! They\nlike\nit! Keep playing, Jonesy!\nPlay, boy, like you never played before!\"\nAnd Roberts roared, above the skirling of the\npiobaireachd\ninto\nwhich Isobar had instinctively swung, \"Music hath charms to soothe the\nsavage beast! Then we were wrong. They\ncan\nhear, after all! See that?\nThey're lying down to listen\u2014like so many lambs! Keep playing, Isobar!\nFor once in my life I'm glad to hear that lovely, wonderful music!\"\nIsobar needed no urging. He, too, had noted how the Grannies' attack\nhad stopped, how every last one of the gaunt grey beasts had suddenly,\nquietly, almost happily, dropped to its haunches at the base of the\ntree.\nThere was no doubt about it; the Grannies\nliked\nthis music. Eyes\nraptly fixed, unblinking, unwavering, they froze into postures of\ngentle beatitude. One stirred once, dangerously, as for a moment Isobar\npaused to catch his breath, but Isobar hastily lipped the blow-pipe\nwith redoubled eagerness, and the Granny relapsed into quietude.\nFollowed then what, under somewhat different circumstances, should have\nbeen a piper's dream. For Isobar had an audience which would not\u2014and\nin two cases\ndared\nnot\u2014allow him to stop playing. And to this\naudience he played over and over again his entire repertoire. Marches,\nflings, dances\u2014the stirring\nRhoderik Dhu\nand the lilting\nLassies\nO'Skye\n, the mournful\nCoghiegh nha Shie\nwhose keening is like the\nsound of a sobbing nation.\nThe Cock o' the North\n, he played, and\nMironton\n...\nWee Flow'r o'\nDee\nand\nMacArthur's March\n...\nLa Cucuracha\nand\u2014\nAnd his lungs were parched, his lips dry as swabs of cotton. Blood\npounded through his temples, throbbing in time to the drone of the\nchaunter, and a dark mist gathered before his eyes. He tore the\nblow-pipe from his lips, gasped,\n\"Keep playing!\" came the dim, distant howl of Johnny Brown. \"Just a few\nminutes longer, Jonesy! Relief is on the way. Sparks saw us from his\nturret window five minutes ago!\"\nAnd Isobar played on. How, or what, he did not know. The memory of\nthose next few minutes was never afterward clear in his mind. All he\nknew was that above the skirling drone of his pipes there came another\nsound, the metallic clanking of a man-made machine ... an armored tank,\nsent from the Dome to rescue the beleaguered trio.\nHe was conscious, then, of a friendly voice shouting words of\nencouragement, of Joe Roberts calling a warning to those below.\n\"Careful, boys! Drive the tank right up beneath us so we can hop in and\nget out of here! Watch the Grannies\u2014they'll be after us the minute\nIsobar stops playing!\"\nThen the answer from below. The fantastic answer in Sparks' familiar\nvoice. The answer that caused the bagpipes to slip from Isobar's\nfingers as Isobar Jones passed out in a dead faint:\n\"After you? Those Grannies? Hell's howling acres\u2014\nthose Grannies are\nstone dead\n!\"\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nTROUBLE ON TYCHO\nBy NELSON S.

Isobar was talking\nto himself. The plate dulled. Isobar said, \"Nuts!\" and returned to\nhis duties. He jotted neat ditto marks under the word \"Clear\" which,\nsix months ago, he had placed beneath the column headed:\nCond. of\nObs.\nHe noted the proper figures under the headings\nSun Spots\n:\nMax\nFreq.\n\u2014\nMin. Freq.\n; then he sketched careful curves in blue and red\nink upon the Mercator projection of Earth which was his daily work\nsheet.\nThis done, he drew a clean sheet of paper out of his desk drawer,\nfrowned thoughtfully at the tabulated results of his observations, and\nbegan writing.\n\"\nWeather forecast for Terra\n,\" he wrote, his pen making scratching\nsounds.\nThe audiophone rasped again. Isobar jabbed the stud and answered\nwithout looking.\n\"O.Q.,\" he said wearily. \"O.Q. I told you it would be ready in a couple\no' minutes. Keep your pants on!\"\n\"I\u2014er\u2014I beg your pardon, Isobar?\" queried a mild voice.\nIsobar started. His sallow cheeks achieved a sickly salmon hue. He\nblinked nervously.\n\"Oh, jumpin' jimminy!\" he gulped. \"\nYou\n, Miss Sally! Golly\u2014'scuse me!\nI didn't realize\u2014\"\nThe Dome Commander's niece giggled.\n\"That's all right, Isobar. I just called to ask you about the weather\nin Oceania Sector 4B next week. I've got a swimming date at Waikiki,\nbut I won't make the shuttle unless the weather's going to be nice.\"\n\"It is,\" promised Isobar. \"It'll be swell all weekend, Miss Sally.\nFine sunshiny weather. You can go.\"\n\"That's wonderful. Thanks so much, Isobar.\"\n\"Don't mention it, ma'am,\" said Isobar, and returned to his work.\nSouth America. Africa. Asia. Pan-Europa. Swiftly he outlined the\nmeteorological prospects for each sector. He enjoyed this part of his\njob. As he wrote forecasts for each area, in his mind's eye he saw\nhimself enjoying such pastimes as each geographical division's terrain\nrendered possible.\nIf home is where the heart is, Horatio Jones\u2014known better as \"Isobar\"\nto his associates at the Experimental Dome on Luna\u2014was a long, long\nway from home. His lean, gangling frame was immured, and had been for\nsix tedious Earth months, beneath the\nimpervite\nhemisphere of Lunar\nIII\u2014that frontier outpost which served as a rocket refueling station,\nteleradio transmission point and meteorological base.\n\"Six solid months! Six sad, dreary months!\" thought Isobar, \"Locked up\nin an airtight Dome like\u2014like a goldfish in a glass bowl!\" Sunlight?\nOh, sure! But filtered through ultraviolet wave-traps so it could not\nburn, it left the skin pale and lustreless and clammy as the belly of a\ntoad. Fresh air? Pooh! Nothing but that everlasting sickening, scented,\nreoxygenated stuff gushing from atmo-conditioning units.\nExcitement? Adventure? The romance he had been led to expect when he\nsigned on for frontier service? Bah! Only a weary, monotonous, routine\nexistence.\n\"A pain!\" declared Isobar Jones. \"That's what it is; a pain in the\nstummick. Not even allowed to\u2014Yeah?\"\nIt was Sparks, audioing from the Dome's transmission turret. He said,\n\"Hyah, Jonesy! How comes with the report?\"\n\"Done,\" said Isobar. \"I was just gettin' the sheets together for you.\"\n\"O.Q. But just bring\nit\n. Nothing else.\"\nIsobar bridled.\n\"I don't know what you're talkin' about.\"\n\"Oh, no? Well, I'm talking about that squawk-filled doodlesack of\nyours, sonny boy. Don't bring that bag-full of noise up here with you.\"\nIsobar said defiantly, \"It ain't a doodlesack. It's a bagpipe. And I\nguess I can play it if I want to\u2014\"\n\"Not,\" said Sparks emphatically, \"in\nmy\ncubby! I've got sensitive\neardrums. Well, stir your stumps! I've got to get the report rolling\nquick today. Big doings up here.\"\n\"Yeah? What?\"\n\"Well, it's Roberts and Brown\u2014\"\n\"What about 'em?\"\n\"They've gone Outside to make foundation repairs.\"\n\"Lucky stiffs!\" commented Isobar ruefully.\n\"Lucky, no. Stiffs, maybe\u2014if they should meet any Grannies. Well,\nscoot along. I'm on the ether in four point sixteen minutes.\"\n\"Be right up,\" promised Isobar, and, sheets in hand, he ambled from his\ncloistered cell toward the central section of the Dome.\nHe didn't leave Sparks' turret after the sheets were delivered.\nInstead, he hung around, fidgeting so obtrusively that Riley finally\nturned to him in sheer exasperation.\n\"Sweet snakes of Saturn, Jonesy, what's the trouble? Bugs in your\nbritches?\"\nIsobar said, \"H-huh? Oh, you mean\u2014Oh, thanks, no! I just thought mebbe\nyou wouldn't mind if I\u2014well\u2014er\u2014\"\n\"I get it!\" Sparks grinned. \"Want to play peekaboo while the contact's\nopen, eh? Well, O.Q. Watch the birdie!\"\nHe twisted dials, adjusted verniers, fingered a host of\nincomprehensible keys. Current hummed and howled. Then a plate before\nhim cleared, and the voice of the Earth operator came in, enunciating\nwith painstaking clarity:\n\"Earth answering Luna. Earth answering Luna's call. Can you hear me,\nLuna? Can you hear\u2014?\"\n\"I can not only hear you,\" snorted Riley, \"I can see you and smell you,\nas well. Stop hamming it, stupid! You're lousing up the earth!\"\nThe now-visible face of the Earth radioman drew into a grimace of\ndispleasure.\n\"Oh, it's\nyou\n? Funny man, eh? Funny man Riley?\"\n\"Sure,\" said Riley agreeably. \"I'm a scream. Four-alarm Riley,\nthe cosmic comedian\u2014didn't you know? Flick on your dictacoder,\noyster-puss; here's the weather report.\" He read it. \"'\nWeather\nforecast for Terra, week of May 15-21\n\u2014'\"\n\"Ask him,\" whispered Isobar eagerly. \"Sparks, don't forget to ask him!\"\nRiley motioned for silence, but nodded. He finished the weather report,\nentered the Dome Commander's log upon the Home Office records, and\ndictated a short entry from the Luna Biological Commission. Then:\n\"That is all,\" he concluded.\n\"O.Q.,\" verified the other radioman. Isobar writhed anxiously, prodded\nRiley's shoulder.\n\"Ask him, Sparks! Go on ask him!\"\n\"Oh, cut jets, will you?\" snapped Sparks. The Terra operator looked\nstartled.\n\"How's that? I didn't say a word\u2014\"\n\"Don't be a dope,\" said Sparks, \"you dope! I wasn't talking to you.\nI'm entertaining a visitor, a refugee from a cuckoo clock. Look, do me\na favor, chum? Can you twist your mike around so it's pointing out a\nwindow?\"\n\"What? Why\u2014why, yes, but\u2014\"\n\"Without buts,\" said Sparks grumpily. \"Yours not to reason why; yours\nbut to do or don't. Will you do it?\"\n\"Well, sure. But I don't understand\u2014\" The silver platter which had\nmirrored the radioman's face clouded as the Earth operator twirled the\ninconoscope. Walls and desks of an ordinary broadcasting office spun\nbriefly into view; then the plate reflected a glimpse of an Earthly\nlandscape. Soft blue sky warmed by an atmosphere-shielded sun ... green\ntrees firmly rooted in still-greener grass ... flowers ... birds ...\npeople....\n\"Enough?\" asked Sparks.\nIsobar Jones awakened from his trance, eyes dulling. Reluctantly he\nnodded. Riley stared at him strangely, almost gently. To the other\nradioman, \"O.Q., pal,\" he said. \"Cut!\"\n\"Cut!\" agreed the other. The plate blanked out.\n\"Thanks, Sparks,\" said Isobar.\n\"Nothing,\" shrugged Riley \"\nHe twisted\nthe mike; not me. But\u2014how come\nyou always want to take a squint at Earth when the circuit's open,\nJonesy? Homesick?\"\n\"Sort of,\" admitted Isobar guiltily.\n\"Well, hell, aren't we all? But we can't leave here for another six\nmonths at least. Not till our tricks are up. I should think it'd only\nmake you feel worse to see Earth.\"\n\"It ain't Earth I'm homesick for,\" explained Isobar. \"It's\u2014well, it's\nthe things that go with it. I mean things like grass and flowers and\ntrees.\"\nSparks grinned; a mirthless, lopsided grin.\n\"We've got\nthem\nright here on Luna. Go look out the tower window,\nJonesy. The Dome's nestled smack in the middle of the prettiest,\ngreenest little valley you ever saw.\"\n\"I know,\" complained Isobar. \"And that's what makes it even worse. All\nthat pretty, soft, green stuff Outside\u2014and we ain't allowed to go out\nin it. Sometimes I get so mad I'd like to\u2014\"\n\"To,\" interrupted a crisp voice, \"what?\"\nIsobar spun, flushing; his eyes dropped before those of Dome Commander\nEagan. He squirmed.\n\"N-nothing, sir. I was only saying\u2014\"\n\"I heard you, Jones. And please let me hear no more of such talk, sir!\nIt is strictly forbidden for anyone to go Outside except in cases of\nabsolute necessity. Such labor as caused Patrolmen Brown and Roberts to\ngo, for example\u2014\"\n\"Any word from them yet, sir?\" asked Sparks eagerly.\n\"Not yet. But we're expecting them to return at any minute now. Jones!\nWhere are\nyou\ngoing?\"\n\"Why\u2014why, just back to my quarters, sir.\"\n\"That's what I thought. And what did you plan to do there?\"\nIsobar said stubbornly, \"Well, I sort of figured I'd amuse myself for a\nwhile\u2014\"\n\"I thought that, too. And with\nwhat\n, pray, Jones?\"\n\"With the only dratted thing,\" said Isobar, suddenly petulant, \"that\ngives me any fun around this dagnabbed place! With my bagpipe.\"\nCommander Eagan said, \"You'd better find some new way of amusing\nyourself, Jones. Have you read General Order 17?\"\nIsobar said, \"I seen it. But if you think\u2014\"\n\"It says,\" stated Eagan deliberately, \"'\nIn order that work or rest\nperiods of the Dome's staff may not be disturbed, it is hereby ordered\nthat the playing or practicing of all or any musical instruments must\nbe discontinued immediately. By order of the Dome Commander\n,' That\nmeans you, Jones!\"\n\"But, dingbust it!\" keened Isobar, \"it don't disturb nobody for me to\nplay my bagpipes! I know these lunks around here don't appreciate good\nmusic, so I always go in my office and lock the door after me\u2014\"\n\"But the Dome,\" pointed out Commander Eagan, \"has an air-conditioning\nsystem which can't be shut off. The ungodly moans of\nyour\u2014er\u2014so-called musical instrument can be heard through the entire\nstructure.\"\nHe suddenly seemed to gain stature.\n\"No, Jones, this order is final! You cannot disrupt our entire\norganization for your own\u2014er\u2014amusement.\"\n\"But\u2014\" said Isobar.\n\"No!\"\nIsobar wriggled desperately. Life on Luna was sorry enough already.\nIf now they took from him the last remaining solace he had, the last\namusement which lightened his moments of freedom\u2014\n\"Look, Commander!\" he pleaded, \"I tell you what I'll do. I won't bother\nnobody. I'll go Outside and play it\u2014\"\n\"Outside!\" Eagan stared at him incredulously. \"Are you mad? How about\nthe Grannies?\"\nIsobar knew all about the Grannies. The only mobile form of life\nfound by space-questing man on Earth's satellite, their name was an\nabbreviation of the descriptive one applied to them by the first Lunar\nexployers: Granitebacks. This was no exaggeration; if anything, it was\nan understatement. For the Grannies, though possessed of certain low\nintelligence, had quickly proven themselves a deadly, unyielding and\nimplacable foe.\nWorse yet, they were an enemy almost indestructible! No man had ever\nyet brought to Earth laboratories the carcass of a Grannie; science\nwas completely baffled in its endeavors to explain the composition of\nGraniteback physiology\u2014but it was known, from bitter experience, that\nthe carapace or exoskeleton of the Grannies was formed of something\nharder than steel, diamond, or battleplate! This flesh could be\npenetrated by no weapon known to man; neither by steel nor flame,\nby electronic nor ionic wave, nor by the lethal, newly discovered\natomo-needle dispenser.\nAll this Isobar knew about the Grannies. Yet:\n\"They ain't been any Grannies seen around the Dome,\" he said, \"for\na 'coon's age. Anyhow, if I seen any comin', I could run right back\ninside\u2014\"\n\"No!\" said Commander Eagan flatly. \"Absolutely,\nno\n! I have no time\nfor such nonsense. You know the orders\u2014obey them! And now, gentlemen,\ngood afternoon!\"\nHe left. Sparks turned to Isobar, grinning.\n\"Well,\" he said, \"one man's fish\u2014hey, Jonesy? Too bad you can't play\nyour doodlesack any more, but frankly, I'm just as glad. Of all the\nawful screeching wails\u2014\"\nBut Isobar Jones, generally mild and gentle, was now in a perfect\nfury. His pale eyes blazed, he stomped his foot on the floor, and from\nhis lips poured a stream of such angry invective that Riley looked\nstartled. Words that, to Isobar, were the utter dregs of violent\nprofanity.\n\"Oh, dagnab it!\" fumed Isobar Jones. \"Oh, tarnation and dingbust!\nOh\u2014\nfiddlesticks\n!\"\nII\n\"And so,\" chuckled Riley, \"he left, bubbling like a kettle on a red-hot\noven. But, boy! was he ever mad! Just about ready to bust, he was.\"\nSome minutes had passed since Isobar had left; Riley was talking to Dr.\nLoesch, head of the Dome's Physics Research Division. The older man\nnodded commiseratingly.\n\"It is funny, yes,\" he agreed, \"but at the same time it is not\naltogether amusing. I feel sorry for him. He is a very unhappy man, our\npoor Isobar.\"\n\"Yeah, I know,\" said Riley, \"but, hell, we all get a little bit\nhomesick now and then. He ought to learn to\u2014\"\n\"Excuse me, my boy,\" interrupted the aged physicist, his voice gentle,\n\"it is not mere homesickness that troubles our friend. It is something\ndeeper, much more vital and serious. It is what my people call:\nweltschmertz\n. There is no accurate translation in English. It means\n'world sickness,' or better, 'world weariness'\u2014something like that but\nintensified a thousandfold.\n\"It is a deeply-rooted mental condition, sometimes a dangerous frame\nof mind. Under its grip, men do wild things. Hating the world on which\nthey find themselves, they rebel in curious ways. Suicide ... mad acts\nof valor ... deeds of cunning or knavery....\"\n\"You mean,\" demanded Sparks anxiously, \"Isobar ain't got all his\nbuttons?\"\n\"Not that exactly. He is perfectly sane. But he is in a dark morass\nof despair. He may try\nanything\nto retrieve his lost happiness, rid\nhis soul of its dark oppression. His world-sickness is like a crying\nhunger\u2014By the way, where is he now?\"\n\"Below, I guess. In his quarters.\"\n\"Ah, good! Perhaps he is sleeping. Let us hope so. In slumber he will\nfind peace and forgetfulness.\"\nBut Dr. Loesch would have been far less sanguine had some power the\n\"giftie gi'en\" him of watching Isobar Jones at that moment.\nIsobar was not asleep. Far from it. Wide awake and very much astir, he\nwas acting in a singularly sinister role: that of a slinking, furtive\nculprit.\nReturning to his private cubicle after his conversation with Dome\nCommander Eagan, he had stalked straightway to the cabinet wherein was\nencased his precious set of bagpipes. These he had taken from their\npegs, gazed upon defiantly, and fondled with almost parental affection.\n\"So I can't play you, huh?\" he muttered darkly. \"It disturbs the peace\no' the dingfounded, dumblasted Dome staff, does it? Well, we'll\nsee\nabout that!\"\nAnd tucking the bag under his arm, he had cautiously slipped from the\nroom, down little-used corridors, and now he stood before the huge\nimpervite\ngates which were the entrance to the Dome and the doorway\nto Outside.\nOn all save those occasions when a spacecraft landed in the cradle\nadjacent the gateway, these portals were doubly locked and barred. But\ntoday they had been unbolted that the two maintenance men might venture\nout. And since it was quite possible that Brown and Roberts might have\nto get inside in a hurry, their bolts remained drawn. Sole guardian of\nthe entrance was a very bored Junior Patrolman.\nUp to this worthy strode Isobar Jones, confident and assured, exuding\nan aura of propriety.\n\"Very well, Wilkins,\" he said. \"I'll take over now. You may go to the\nmeeting.\"\nWilkins looked at him bewilderedly.\n\"Huh? Whuzzat, Mr. Jones?\"\nIsobar's eyebrows arched.\n\"You mean you haven't been notified?\"\n\"Notified of\nwhat\n?\"\n\"Why, the general council of all Patrolmen! Weren't you told that I\nwould take your place here while you reported to G.H.Q.?\"\n\"I ain't,\" puzzled Wilkins, \"heard nothing about it. Maybe I ought to\ncall the office, maybe?\"\nAnd he moved the wall-audio. But Isobar said swiftly. \"That\u2014er\u2014won't\nbe necessary, Wilkins. My orders were plain enough. Now, you just run\nalong. I'll watch this entrance for you.\"\n\"We-e-ell,\" said Wilkins, \"if you say so. Orders is orders. But keep a\nsharp eye out, Mister Jones, in case Roberts and Brown should come back\nsudden-like.\"\n\"I will,\" promised Isobar, \"don't worry.\"\nWilkins moved away. Isobar waited until the Patrolman was completely\nout of sight. Then swiftly he pulled open the massive gate, slipped\nthrough, and closed it behind him.\nA flood of warmth, exhilarating after the constantly regulated\ntemperature of the Dome, descended upon him. Fresh air, thin, but\nfragrant with the scent of growing things, made his pulses stir with\njoyous abandon. He was Outside! He was Outside, in good sunlight, at\nlast! After six long and dreary months!\nRaptly, blissfully, all thought of caution tossed to the gentle breezes\nthat ruffled his sparse hair, Isobar Jones stepped forward into the\nlunar valley....\nHow long he wandered thus, carefree and utterly content, he could not\nafterward say. It seemed like minutes; it must have been longer. He\nonly knew that the grass was green beneath his feet, the trees were a\nlacy network through which warm sunlight filtered benevolently, the\nchirrupings of small insects and the rustling whisper of the breezes\nformed a tiny symphony of happiness through which he moved as one\ncharmed.\nIt did not occur to him that he had wandered too far from the Dome's\nentrance until, strolling through an enchanting flower-decked glade, he\nwas startled to hear\u2014off to his right\u2014the sharp, explosive bark of a\nHaemholtz ray pistol.\nHe whirled, staring about him wildly, and discovered that though his\nmeandering had kept him near the Dome, he had unconsciously followed\nits hemispherical perimeter to a point nearly two miles from the\nGateway. By the placement of ports and windows, Isobar was able to\njudge his location perfectly; he was opposite that portion of the\nstructure which housed Sparks' radio turret.\nAnd the shooting? That could only be\u2014\nHe did not have to name its reason, even to himself. For at that\nmoment, there came racing around the curve of the Dome a pair of\nfigures, Patrolmen clad in fatigue drab. Roberts and Brown. Roberts was\nstaggering, one foot dragged awkwardly as he ran; Brown's left arm,\nbloodstained from shoulder to elbow, hung limply at his side, but in\nhis good right fist he held a spitting Haemholtz with which he tried to\ncover his comrade's sluggish retreat.\nAnd behind these two, grim, grey, gaunt figures that moved with\nastonishing speed despite their massive bulk, came three ... six ... a\ndozen of those lunarites whom all men feared. The Grannies!\nIII\nSimultaneously with his recognition of the pair, Joe Roberts saw him. A\ngasp of relief escaped the wounded man.\n\"Jones! Thank the Lord! Then you picked up our cry for help? Quick,\nman\u2014where is it? Theres not a moment to waste!\"\n\"W-where,\" faltered Isobar feebly, \"is\nwhat\n?\"\n\"The tank, of course! Didn't you hear our telecast? We can't possibly\nmake it back to the gate without an armored car. My foot's broken,\nand\u2014\" Roberts stopped suddenly, an abrupt horror in his eyes. \"You\ndon't have one! You're here\nalone\n! Then you didn't pick up our call?\nBut, why\u2014?\"\n\"Never mind that,\" snapped Isobar, \"now!\" Placid by nature, he could\nmove when urgency drove. His quick mind saw the immediateness of their\nperil. Unarmed, he could not help the Patrolmen fight a delaying action\nagainst their foes, nor could he hasten their retreat. Anyway, weapons\nwere useless, and time was of the essence. There was but one temporary\nway of staving off disaster. \"Over here ... this tree! Quick! Up you\ngo! Give him a lift, Brown\u2014There! That's the stuff!\"\nHe was the last to scramble up the gnarled bole to a tentative leafy\nsanctuary. He had barely gained the security of the lowermost bough\nwhen a thundering crash resounded, the sturdy trunk trembled beneath\nhis clutch. Stony claws gouged yellow parallels in the bark scant\ninches beneath one kicking foot, then the Granny fell back with a thud.\nThe Graniteback was\nnot\na climber. It was far too ungainly, much too\nweighty for that.\nRoberts said weakly, \"Th-thanks, Jonesy! That was a close call.\"\n\"That goes for me, too, Jonesy,\" added Brown from an upper bough.\n\"But I'm afraid you just delayed matters. This tree's O.Q. as long\nas it lasts, but\u2014\" He stared down upon the gathering knot of\nGrannies unhappily\u2014\"it's not going to last long with that bunch of\nsuperdreadnaughts working out on it! Hold tight, fellows! Here they\ncome!\"\nFor the Grannies, who had huddled for a moment as if in telepathic\nconsultation, now joined forces, turned, and as one body charged\nheadlong toward the tree. The unified force of their attack was like\nthe shattering impact of a battering ram. Bark rasped and gritted\nbeneath the besieged men's hands, dry leaves and twigs pelted about\nthem in a tiny rain, tormented fibrous sinews groaned as the aged\nforest monarch shuddered in agony.\nDesperately they clung to their perches. Though the great tree bent, it\ndid not break. But when it stopped trembling, it was canted drunkenly\nto one side, and the erstwhile solid earth about its base was broken\nand cracked\u2014revealing fleshy tentacles uprooted from ancient moorings!\nBrown stared at this evidence of the Grannies' power with\nterror-fascinated eyes. His voice was none too firm.\n\"Lord! Piledrivers! A couple more like that\u2014\"\nIsobar nodded. He knew what falling into the clutch of the Grannies\nmeant. He had once seen the grisly aftermath of a Graniteback feast.\nEven now their adversaries had drawn back for a second attack. A sudden\nidea struck him. A straw of hope at which he grasped feverishly.\n\"You telecast a message to the Dome? Help should be on the way by now.\nIf we can just hold out\u2014\"\nBut Roberts shook his head.\n\"We sent a message, Jonesy, but I don't think it got through. I've just\nbeen looking at my portable. It seems to be busted. Happened when they\nfirst attacked us, I guess. I tripped and fell on it.\"\nIsobar's last hope flickered out.\n\"Then I\u2014I guess it won't be long now,\" he mourned. \"If we could have\nonly got a message through, they would have sent out an armored car to\npick us up. But as it is\u2014\"\nBrown's shrug displayed a bravado he did not feel.\n\"Well, that's the way it goes. We knew what we were risking when we\nvolunteered to come Outside. This damn moon! It'll never be worth\na plugged credit until men find some way to fight those murderous\nstones-on-legs!\"\nRoberts said, \"That's right. But what are\nyou\ndoing out here, Isobar?\nAnd why, for Pete's sake, the bagpipes?\"\n\"Oh\u2014the pipes?\" Isobar flushed painfully. He had almost forgotten\nhis original reason for adventuring Outside, had quite forgotten\nhis instrument, and was now rather amazed to discover that somehow\nthroughout all the excitement he had held onto it. \"Why, I just\nhappened to\u2014Oh!\nthe pipes!\n\"\n\"Hold on!\" roared Roberts. His warning came just in time. Once more,\nthe three tree-sitters shook like dried peas in a pod as their leafy\nrefuge trembled before the locomotive onslaught of the lunar beasts.\nThis time the already-exposed roots strained and lifted, several\nsnapped; when the Grannies again withdrew, complacently unaware that\nthe \"lethal ray\" of Brown's Haemholtz was wasting itself upon their\nadamant hides in futile fury, the tree was bent at a precarious angle.\nBrown sobbed, not with fear but with impotent anger, and in a gesture\nof enraged desperation, hurled his now-empty weapon at the retreating\nGrannies.\n\"No good! Not a damn bit of good! Oh, if there was only some way of\nfighting those filthy things\u2014\"\nBut Isobar Jones had a one-track mind. \"The pipes!\" he cried again,\nexcitedly. \"That's the answer!\" And he drew the instrument into playing\nposition, bag cuddled beneath one arm-pit, drones stiffly erect over\nhis shoulder, blow-pipe at his lips. His cheeks puffed, his breath\nexpelled. The giant lung swelled, the chaunter emitted its distinctive,\nfearsome, \"\nKaa-aa-o-o-o-oro-oong!\n\"\nRoberts moaned.\n\"Oh, Lord! A guy can't even die in peace!\"\nAnd Brown stared at him hopelessly.\n\"It's no use, Isobar. You trying to scare them off? They have no sense\nof hearing. That's been proven\u2014\"\nIsobar took his lips from the reed to explain.\n\"It's not that. I'm trying to rouse the boys in the Dome. We're right\nopposite the atmosphere-conditioning-unit. See that grilled duct over\nthere? That's an inhalation-vent. The portable transmitter's out of\norder, and our voices ain't strong enough to carry into the Dome\u2014but\nthe sound of these pipes is! And Commander Eagan told me just a short\nwhile ago that the sound of the pipes carries all over the building!\n\"If they hear this, they'll get mad because I'm disobeyin' orders.\nThey'll start lookin' for me. If they can't find me inside, maybe\nthey'll look Outside. See that window? That's Sparks' turret. If we can\nmake him look out here\u2014\"\n\"\nStop talking!\n\" roared Roberts. \"Stop talking, guy, and start\nblowing! I think you've got something there. Anyhow, it's our last\nhope.\nBlow!\n\"\n\"And quick!\" appended Brown. \"For here they come!\"\nIsobar played, blew with all his might, while the Grannies raged below.\nHe meant the Grannies. Again they were huddling for attack, once more,\na solid phalanx of indestructible, granite flesh, they were smashing\ndown upon the tree.\n\"\nHaa-a-roong!\n\" blew Isobar Jones.\nIV\nAnd\u2014even he could not have foreseen the astounding results of\nhis piping! What happened next was as astonishing as it was\nincomprehensible. For as the pipes, filled now and primed to burst into\nwhatever substitute for melody they were prodded into, wailed into\naction\u2014the Grannies' rush came to an abrupt halt!\nAs one, they stopped cold in their tracks and turned dull, colorless,\nquestioning eyes upward into the tree whence came this weird and\nvibrant droning!\nSo stunned with surprise was Isobar that his grip on the pipes relaxed,\nhis lips almost slipped from the reed. But Brown's delighted bellow\nlifted his paralysis.\n\"Sacred rings of Saturn-look! They\nlike\nit! Keep playing, Jonesy!\nPlay, boy, like you never played before!\"\nAnd Roberts roared, above the skirling of the\npiobaireachd\ninto\nwhich Isobar had instinctively swung, \"Music hath charms to soothe the\nsavage beast! Then we were wrong. They\ncan\nhear, after all! See that?\nThey're lying down to listen\u2014like so many lambs! Keep playing, Isobar!\nFor once in my life I'm glad to hear that lovely, wonderful music!\"\nIsobar needed no urging. He, too, had noted how the Grannies' attack\nhad stopped, how every last one of the gaunt grey beasts had suddenly,\nquietly, almost happily, dropped to its haunches at the base of the\ntree.\nThere was no doubt about it; the Grannies\nliked\nthis music. Eyes\nraptly fixed, unblinking, unwavering, they froze into postures of\ngentle beatitude. One stirred once, dangerously, as for a moment Isobar\npaused to catch his breath, but Isobar hastily lipped the blow-pipe\nwith redoubled eagerness, and the Granny relapsed into quietude.\nFollowed then what, under somewhat different circumstances, should have\nbeen a piper's dream. For Isobar had an audience which would not\u2014and\nin two cases\ndared\nnot\u2014allow him to stop playing. And to this\naudience he played over and over again his entire repertoire. Marches,\nflings, dances\u2014the stirring\nRhoderik Dhu\nand the lilting\nLassies\nO'Skye\n, the mournful\nCoghiegh nha Shie\nwhose keening is like the\nsound of a sobbing nation.\nThe Cock o' the North\n, he played, and\nMironton\n...\nWee Flow'r o'\nDee\nand\nMacArthur's March\n...\nLa Cucuracha\nand\u2014\nAnd his lungs were parched, his lips dry as swabs of cotton. Blood\npounded through his temples, throbbing in time to the drone of the\nchaunter, and a dark mist gathered before his eyes. He tore the\nblow-pipe from his lips, gasped,\n\"Keep playing!\" came the dim, distant howl of Johnny Brown. \"Just a few\nminutes longer, Jonesy! Relief is on the way. Sparks saw us from his\nturret window five minutes ago!\"\nAnd Isobar played on. How, or what, he did not know. The memory of\nthose next few minutes was never afterward clear in his mind. All he\nknew was that above the skirling drone of his pipes there came another\nsound, the metallic clanking of a man-made machine ... an armored tank,\nsent from the Dome to rescue the beleaguered trio.\nHe was conscious, then, of a friendly voice shouting words of\nencouragement, of Joe Roberts calling a warning to those below.\n\"Careful, boys! Drive the tank right up beneath us so we can hop in and\nget out of here! Watch the Grannies\u2014they'll be after us the minute\nIsobar stops playing!\"\nThen the answer from below. The fantastic answer in Sparks' familiar\nvoice. The answer that caused the bagpipes to slip from Isobar's\nfingers as Isobar Jones passed out in a dead faint:\n\"After you? Those Grannies? Hell's howling acres\u2014\nthose Grannies are\nstone dead\n!\"\n", "summary": "Isobar Jones is the Dome Commander of the Lunar outpost. He is responsible for monitoring the weather in Oceania Sector 4B and providing meteorological reports for each sector. He has been doing this for six months, and is pleased with the good weather he is seeing. He calls Earth to ask about the weather for the next week, and the meteorological officer, Colonel Eagan, tells him that the weather is supposed to be fine. He asks Isobar to report back in a couple of minutes. He goes to his office to write his report, and he notes that the sun is shining in the area where he is observing. He notes that it is supposed be fine all weekend, but he is worried about the upcoming shuttle mission to Earth. He returns to his desk, and his wife, Miss Sally, calls him. She tells him about the terrible air quality in the region, and she asks him to report to the Regional Headquarters. He tells her that he will be gone for the weekend, and that he has to go to Waikiki for a swim. He leaves her a message, and when he returns, he is greeted by the Lunar Desk Officer, Colonel Burns. Burns tells him to go check on the meteorology report, but Isob is already gone. He heads to the control room, where he receives a call from the Regional Office of Meteorology. The Regional Office is concerned that the air quality is very bad, and asks Isebar to check the air pressure. He checks the air conditioner, and it is very low. He then goes to the rest of the room, and finds a large pile of papers. He looks through them, and notes that there is a report on the table. He finds a report that is very unfavorable, and then goes out to eat. He notices that the room is very small, and there is only one chair. He sits down, and a woman comes in and asks him if he is okay. She is the granddaughter of the current dome commander, and her name is Sally. She asks him why he is on the moon, and Isobars to her. He explains that he is the new dome commander. She then asks him about his job, and how he is doing. He says that he does not like the job, but that he enjoys it. She says that she is glad he is happy, and they go out for lunch together. He mentions that he loves her, and Sally says that her grandfather is a great cook. He kisses her and they leave. He walks out of the restaurant, and as he leaves, he notices that there are two men in the restaurant. He turns around, and one of them is Colonel Egan. He informs him that he had been working on the Moon for six weeks. He orders a meal, and after he eats, he goes to check on his report. He sees that the food is very good, but the other man is a foreigner. He tries to give him a cigarette, but it burns his hand. He quickly leaves.", "faithfulness": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, null]}

Isobar was talking\nto himself. The plate dulled. Isobar said, \"Nuts!\" and returned to\nhis duties. He jotted neat ditto marks under the word \"Clear\" which,\nsix months ago, he had placed beneath the column headed:\nCond. of\nObs.\nHe noted the proper figures under the headings\nSun Spots\n:\nMax\nFreq.\n\u2014\nMin. Freq.\n; then he sketched careful curves in blue and red\nink upon the Mercator projection of Earth which was his daily work\nsheet.\nThis done, he drew a clean sheet of paper out of his desk drawer,\nfrowned thoughtfully at the tabulated results of his observations, and\nbegan writing.\n\"\nWeather forecast for Terra\n,\" he wrote, his pen making scratching\nsounds.\nThe audiophone rasped again. Isobar jabbed the stud and answered\nwithout looking.\n\"O.Q.,\" he said wearily. \"O.Q. I told you it would be ready in a couple\no' minutes. Keep your pants on!\"\n\"I\u2014er\u2014I beg your pardon, Isobar?\" queried a mild voice.\nIsobar started. His sallow cheeks achieved a sickly salmon hue.

You can go.\"\n\"That's wonderful. Thanks so much, Isobar.\"\n\"Don't mention it, ma'am,\" said Isobar, and returned to his work.\nSouth America. Africa. Asia. Pan-Europa. Swiftly he outlined the\nmeteorological prospects for each sector. He enjoyed this part of his\njob. As he wrote forecasts for each area, in his mind's eye he saw\nhimself enjoying such pastimes as each geographical division's terrain\nrendered possible.\nIf home is where the heart is, Horatio Jones\u2014known better as \"Isobar\"\nto his associates at the Experimental Dome on Luna\u2014was a long, long\nway from home. His lean, gangling frame was immured, and had been for\nsix tedious Earth months, beneath the\nimpervite\nhemisphere of Lunar\nIII\u2014that frontier outpost which served as a rocket refueling station,\nteleradio transmission point and meteorological base.\n\"Six solid months! Six sad, dreary months!\" thought Isobar, \"Locked up\nin an airtight Dome like\u2014like a goldfish in a glass bowl!\" Sunlight?\nOh, sure! But filtered through ultraviolet wave-traps so it could not\nburn, it left the skin pale and lustreless and clammy as the belly of a\ntoad. Fresh air? Pooh! Nothing but that everlasting sickening, scented,\nreoxygenated stuff gushing from atmo-conditioning units.\nExcitement? Adventure? The romance he had been led to expect when he\nsigned on for frontier service? Bah! Only a weary, monotonous, routine\nexistence.\n\"A pain!\" declared Isobar Jones. \"That's what it is; a pain in the\nstummick. Not even allowed to\u2014Yeah?\"\nIt was Sparks, audioing from the Dome's transmission turret. He said,\n\"Hyah, Jonesy! How comes with the report?\"\n\"Done,\" said Isobar. \"I was just gettin' the sheets together for you.\"\n\"O.Q. But just bring\nit\n. Nothing else.\"\nIsobar bridled.\n\"I don't know what you're talkin' about.\"\n\"Oh, no? Well, I'm talking about that squawk-filled doodlesack of\nyours, sonny boy. Don't bring that bag-full of noise up here with you.\"\nIsobar said defiantly, \"It ain't a doodlesack. It's a bagpipe. And I\nguess I can play it if I want to\u2014\"\n\"Not,\" said Sparks emphatically, \"in\nmy\ncubby! I've got sensitive\neardrums. Well, stir your stumps! I've got to get the report rolling\nquick today. Big doings up here.\"\n\"Yeah? What?\"\n\"Well, it's Roberts and Brown\u2014\"\n\"What about 'em?\"\n\"They've gone Outside to make foundation repairs.\"\n\"Lucky stiffs!\" commented Isobar ruefully.\n\"Lucky, no. Stiffs, maybe\u2014if they should meet any Grannies. Well,\nscoot along. I'm on the ether in four point sixteen minutes.\"\n\"Be right up,\" promised Isobar, and, sheets in hand, he ambled from his\ncloistered cell toward the central section of the Dome.\nHe didn't leave Sparks' turret after the sheets were delivered.\nInstead, he hung around, fidgeting so obtrusively that Riley finally\nturned to him in sheer exasperation.\n\"Sweet snakes of Saturn, Jonesy, what's the trouble? Bugs in your\nbritches?\"\nIsobar said, \"H-huh? Oh, you mean\u2014Oh, thanks, no! I just thought mebbe\nyou wouldn't mind if I\u2014well\u2014er\u2014\"\n\"I get it!\" Sparks grinned. \"Want to play peekaboo while the contact's\nopen, eh? Well, O.Q. Watch the birdie!\"\nHe twisted dials, adjusted verniers, fingered a host of\nincomprehensible keys. Current hummed and howled. Then a plate before\nhim cleared, and the voice of the Earth operator came in, enunciating\nwith painstaking clarity:\n\"Earth answering Luna. Earth answering Luna's call. Can you hear me,\nLuna? Can you hear\u2014?\"\n\"I can not only hear you,\" snorted Riley, \"I can see you and smell you,\nas well. Stop hamming it, stupid! You're lousing up the earth!\"\nThe now-visible face of the Earth radioman drew into a grimace of\ndispleasure.\n\"Oh, it's\nyou\n? Funny man, eh? Funny man Riley?\"\n\"Sure,\" said Riley agreeably. \"I'm a scream. Four-alarm Riley,\nthe cosmic comedian\u2014didn't you know? Flick on your dictacoder,\noyster-puss; here's the weather report.\" He read it. \"'\nWeather\nforecast for Terra, week of May 15-21\n\u2014'\"\n\"Ask him,\" whispered Isobar eagerly. \"Sparks, don't forget to ask him!\"\nRiley motioned for silence, but nodded. He finished the weather report,\nentered the Dome Commander's log upon the Home Office records, and\ndictated a short entry from the Luna Biological Commission. Then:\n\"That is all,\" he concluded.\n\"O.Q.,\" verified the other radioman. Isobar writhed anxiously, prodded\nRiley's shoulder.\n\"Ask him, Sparks! Go on ask him!\"\n\"Oh, cut jets, will you?\" snapped Sparks. The Terra operator looked\nstartled.\n\"How's that? I didn't say a word\u2014\"\n\"Don't be a dope,\" said Sparks, \"you dope! I wasn't talking to you.\nI'm entertaining a visitor, a refugee from a cuckoo clock. Look, do me\na favor, chum? Can you twist your mike around so it's pointing out a\nwindow?\"\n\"What? Why\u2014why, yes, but\u2014\"\n\"Without buts,\" said Sparks grumpily. \"Yours not to reason why; yours\nbut to do or don't. Will you do it?\"\n\"Well, sure. But I don't understand\u2014\" The silver platter which had\nmirrored the radioman's face clouded as the Earth operator twirled the\ninconoscope. Walls and desks of an ordinary broadcasting office spun\nbriefly into view; then the plate reflected a glimpse of an Earthly\nlandscape. Soft blue sky warmed by an atmosphere-shielded sun ... green\ntrees firmly rooted in still-greener grass ... flowers ... birds ...\npeople....\n\"Enough?\" asked Sparks.\nIsobar Jones awakened from his trance, eyes dulling. Reluctantly he\nnodded. Riley stared at him strangely, almost gently. To the other\nradioman, \"O.Q., pal,\" he said. \"Cut!\"\n\"Cut!\" agreed the other. The plate blanked out.\n\"Thanks, Sparks,\" said Isobar.\n\"Nothing,\" shrugged Riley \"\nHe twisted\nthe mike; not me. But\u2014how come\nyou always want to take a squint at Earth when the circuit's open,\nJonesy? Homesick?\"\n\"Sort of,\" admitted Isobar guiltily.\n\"Well, hell, aren't we all? But we can't leave here for another six\nmonths at least. Not till our tricks are up. I should think it'd only\nmake you feel worse to see Earth.\"\n\"It ain't Earth I'm homesick for,\" explained Isobar. \"It's\u2014well, it's\nthe things that go with it. I mean things like grass and flowers and\ntrees.\"\nSparks grinned; a mirthless, lopsided grin.\n\"We've got\nthem\nright here on Luna. Go look out the tower window,\nJonesy. The Dome's nestled smack in the middle of the prettiest,\ngreenest little valley you ever saw.\"\n\"I know,\" complained Isobar. \"And that's what makes it even worse. All\nthat pretty, soft, green stuff Outside\u2014and we ain't allowed to go out\nin it. Sometimes I get so mad I'd like to\u2014\"\n\"To,\" interrupted a crisp voice, \"what?\"\nIsobar spun, flushing; his eyes dropped before those of Dome Commander\nEagan. He squirmed.\n\"N-nothing, sir. I was only saying\u2014\"\n\"I heard you, Jones. And please let me hear no more of such talk, sir!\nIt is strictly forbidden for anyone to go Outside except in cases of\nabsolute necessity. Such labor as caused Patrolmen Brown and Roberts to\ngo, for example\u2014\"\n\"Any word from them yet, sir?\" asked Sparks eagerly.\n\"Not yet. But we're expecting them to return at any minute now. Jones!\nWhere are\nyou\ngoing?\"\n\"Why\u2014why, just back to my quarters, sir.\"\n\"That's what I thought. And what did you plan to do there?\"\nIsobar said stubbornly, \"Well, I sort of figured I'd amuse myself for a\nwhile\u2014\"\n\"I thought that, too. And with\nwhat\n, pray, Jones?\"\n\"With the only dratted thing,\" said Isobar, suddenly petulant, \"that\ngives me any fun around this dagnabbed place! With my bagpipe.\"\nCommander Eagan said, \"You'd better find some new way of amusing\nyourself, Jones. Have you read General Order 17?\"\nIsobar said, \"I seen it. But if you think\u2014\"\n\"It says,\" stated Eagan deliberately, \"'\nIn order that work or rest\nperiods of the Dome's staff may not be disturbed, it is hereby ordered\nthat the playing or practicing of all or any musical instruments must\nbe discontinued immediately. By order of the Dome Commander\n,' That\nmeans you, Jones!\"\n\"But, dingbust it!\" keened Isobar, \"it don't disturb nobody for me to\nplay my bagpipes! I know these lunks around here don't appreciate good\nmusic, so I always go in my office and lock the door after me\u2014\"\n\"But the Dome,\" pointed out Commander Eagan, \"has an air-conditioning\nsystem which can't be shut off. The ungodly moans of\nyour\u2014er\u2014so-called musical instrument can be heard through the entire\nstructure.\"\nHe suddenly seemed to gain stature.\n\"No, Jones, this order is final! You cannot disrupt our entire\norganization for your own\u2014er\u2014amusement.\"\n\"But\u2014\" said Isobar.\n\"No!\"\nIsobar wriggled desperately. Life on Luna was sorry enough already.\nIf now they took from him the last remaining solace he had, the last\namusement which lightened his moments of freedom\u2014\n\"Look, Commander!\" he pleaded, \"I tell you what I'll do. I won't bother\nnobody. I'll go Outside and play it\u2014\"\n\"Outside!\" Eagan stared at him incredulously. \"Are you mad? How about\nthe Grannies?\"\nIsobar knew all about the Grannies. The only mobile form of life\nfound by space-questing man on Earth's satellite, their name was an\nabbreviation of the descriptive one applied to them by the first Lunar\nexployers: Granitebacks. This was no exaggeration; if anything, it was\nan understatement. For the Grannies, though possessed of certain low\nintelligence, had quickly proven themselves a deadly, unyielding and\nimplacable foe.\nWorse yet, they were an enemy almost indestructible! No man had ever\nyet brought to Earth laboratories the carcass of a Grannie; science\nwas completely baffled in its endeavors to explain the composition of\nGraniteback physiology\u2014but it was known, from bitter experience, that\nthe carapace or exoskeleton of the Grannies was formed of something\nharder than steel, diamond, or battleplate! This flesh could be\npenetrated by no weapon known to man; neither by steel nor flame,\nby electronic nor ionic wave, nor by the lethal, newly discovered\natomo-needle dispenser.\nAll this Isobar knew about the Grannies. Yet:\n\"They ain't been any Grannies seen around the Dome,\" he said, \"for\na 'coon's age. Anyhow, if I seen any comin', I could run right back\ninside\u2014\"\n\"No!\" said Commander Eagan flatly. \"Absolutely,\nno\n! I have no time\nfor such nonsense. You know the orders\u2014obey them! And now, gentlemen,\ngood afternoon!\"\nHe left. Sparks turned to Isobar, grinning.\n\"Well,\" he said, \"one man's fish\u2014hey, Jonesy? Too bad you can't play\nyour doodlesack any more, but frankly, I'm just as glad. Of all the\nawful screeching wails\u2014\"\nBut Isobar Jones, generally mild and gentle, was now in a perfect\nfury. His pale eyes blazed, he stomped his foot on the floor, and from\nhis lips poured a stream of such angry invective that Riley looked\nstartled. Words that, to Isobar, were the utter dregs of violent\nprofanity.\n\"Oh, dagnab it!\" fumed Isobar Jones. \"Oh, tarnation and dingbust!\nOh\u2014\nfiddlesticks\n!\"\nII\n\"And so,\" chuckled Riley, \"he left, bubbling like a kettle on a red-hot\noven. But, boy! was he ever mad! Just about ready to bust, he was.\"\nSome minutes had passed since Isobar had left; Riley was talking to Dr.\nLoesch, head of the Dome's Physics Research Division. The older man\nnodded commiseratingly.\n\"It is funny, yes,\" he agreed, \"but at the same time it is not\naltogether amusing. I feel sorry for him. He is a very unhappy man, our\npoor Isobar.\"\n\"Yeah, I know,\" said Riley, \"but, hell, we all get a little bit\nhomesick now and then. He ought to learn to\u2014\"\n\"Excuse me, my boy,\" interrupted the aged physicist, his voice gentle,\n\"it is not mere homesickness that troubles our friend. It is something\ndeeper, much more vital and serious. It is what my people call:\nweltschmertz\n. There is no accurate translation in English. It means\n'world sickness,' or better, 'world weariness'\u2014something like that but\nintensified a thousandfold.\n\"It is a deeply-rooted mental condition, sometimes a dangerous frame\nof mind. Under its grip, men do wild things. Hating the world on which\nthey find themselves, they rebel in curious ways. Suicide ... mad acts\nof valor ... deeds of cunning or knavery....\"\n\"You mean,\" demanded Sparks anxiously, \"Isobar ain't got all his\nbuttons?\"\n\"Not that exactly. He is perfectly sane. But he is in a dark morass\nof despair. He may try\nanything\nto retrieve his lost happiness, rid\nhis soul of its dark oppression. His world-sickness is like a crying\nhunger\u2014By the way, where is he now?\"\n\"Below, I guess. In his quarters.\"\n\"Ah, good! Perhaps he is sleeping. Let us hope so. In slumber he will\nfind peace and forgetfulness.\"\nBut Dr. Loesch would have been far less sanguine had some power the\n\"giftie gi'en\" him of watching Isobar Jones at that moment.\nIsobar was not asleep. Far from it. Wide awake and very much astir, he\nwas acting in a singularly sinister role: that of a slinking, furtive\nculprit.\nReturning to his private cubicle after his conversation with Dome\nCommander Eagan, he had stalked straightway to the cabinet wherein was\nencased his precious set of bagpipes. These he had taken from their\npegs, gazed upon defiantly, and fondled with almost parental affection.\n\"So I can't play you, huh?\" he muttered darkly. \"It disturbs the peace\no' the dingfounded, dumblasted Dome staff, does it? Well, we'll\nsee\nabout that!\"\nAnd tucking the bag under his arm, he had cautiously slipped from the\nroom, down little-used corridors, and now he stood before the huge\nimpervite\ngates which were the entrance to the Dome and the doorway\nto Outside.\nOn all save those occasions when a spacecraft landed in the cradle\nadjacent the gateway, these portals were doubly locked and barred. But\ntoday they had been unbolted that the two maintenance men might venture\nout. And since it was quite possible that Brown and Roberts might have\nto get inside in a hurry, their bolts remained drawn. Sole guardian of\nthe entrance was a very bored Junior Patrolman.\nUp to this worthy strode Isobar Jones, confident and assured, exuding\nan aura of propriety.\n\"Very well, Wilkins,\" he said. \"I'll take over now. You may go to the\nmeeting.\"\nWilkins looked at him bewilderedly.\n\"Huh? Whuzzat, Mr. Jones?\"\nIsobar's eyebrows arched.\n\"You mean you haven't been notified?\"\n\"Notified of\nwhat\n?\"\n\"Why, the general council of all Patrolmen! Weren't you told that I\nwould take your place here while you reported to G.H.Q.?\"\n\"I ain't,\" puzzled Wilkins, \"heard nothing about it. Maybe I ought to\ncall the office, maybe?\"\nAnd he moved the wall-audio. But Isobar said swiftly. \"That\u2014er\u2014won't\nbe necessary, Wilkins. My orders were plain enough. Now, you just run\nalong. I'll watch this entrance for you.\"\n\"We-e-ell,\" said Wilkins, \"if you say so. Orders is orders. But keep a\nsharp eye out, Mister Jones, in case Roberts and Brown should come back\nsudden-like.\"\n\"I will,\" promised Isobar, \"don't worry.\"\nWilkins moved away. Isobar waited until the Patrolman was completely\nout of sight. Then swiftly he pulled open the massive gate, slipped\nthrough, and closed it behind him.\nA flood of warmth, exhilarating after the constantly regulated\ntemperature of the Dome, descended upon him. Fresh air, thin, but\nfragrant with the scent of growing things, made his pulses stir with\njoyous abandon. He was Outside! He was Outside, in good sunlight, at\nlast! After six long and dreary months!\nRaptly, blissfully, all thought of caution tossed to the gentle breezes\nthat ruffled his sparse hair, Isobar Jones stepped forward into the\nlunar valley....\nHow long he wandered thus, carefree and utterly content, he could not\nafterward say. It seemed like minutes; it must have been longer. He\nonly knew that the grass was green beneath his feet, the trees were a\nlacy network through which warm sunlight filtered benevolently, the\nchirrupings of small insects and the rustling whisper of the breezes\nformed a tiny symphony of happiness through which he moved as one\ncharmed.\nIt did not occur to him that he had wandered too far from the Dome's\nentrance until, strolling through an enchanting flower-decked glade, he\nwas startled to hear\u2014off to his right\u2014the sharp, explosive bark of a\nHaemholtz ray pistol.\nHe whirled, staring about him wildly, and discovered that though his\nmeandering had kept him near the Dome, he had unconsciously followed\nits hemispherical perimeter to a point nearly two miles from the\nGateway. By the placement of ports and windows, Isobar was able to\njudge his location perfectly; he was opposite that portion of the\nstructure which housed Sparks' radio turret.\nAnd the shooting? That could only be\u2014\nHe did not have to name its reason, even to himself. For at that\nmoment, there came racing around the curve of the Dome a pair of\nfigures, Patrolmen clad in fatigue drab. Roberts and Brown. Roberts was\nstaggering, one foot dragged awkwardly as he ran; Brown's left arm,\nbloodstained from shoulder to elbow, hung limply at his side, but in\nhis good right fist he held a spitting Haemholtz with which he tried to\ncover his comrade's sluggish retreat.\nAnd behind these two, grim, grey, gaunt figures that moved with\nastonishing speed despite their massive bulk, came three ... six ... a\ndozen of those lunarites whom all men feared. The Grannies!\nIII\nSimultaneously with his recognition of the pair, Joe Roberts saw him. A\ngasp of relief escaped the wounded man.\n\"Jones! Thank the Lord! Then you picked up our cry for help? Quick,\nman\u2014where is it? Theres not a moment to waste!\"\n\"W-where,\" faltered Isobar feebly, \"is\nwhat\n?\"\n\"The tank, of course! Didn't you hear our telecast? We can't possibly\nmake it back to the gate without an armored car. My foot's broken,\nand\u2014\" Roberts stopped suddenly, an abrupt horror in his eyes. \"You\ndon't have one! You're here\nalone\n! Then you didn't pick up our call?\nBut, why\u2014?\"\n\"Never mind that,\" snapped Isobar, \"now!\" Placid by nature, he could\nmove when urgency drove. His quick mind saw the immediateness of their\nperil. Unarmed, he could not help the Patrolmen fight a delaying action\nagainst their foes, nor could he hasten their retreat. Anyway, weapons\nwere useless, and time was of the essence. There was but one temporary\nway of staving off disaster. \"Over here ... this tree! Quick! Up you\ngo! Give him a lift, Brown\u2014There! That's the stuff!\"\nHe was the last to scramble up the gnarled bole to a tentative leafy\nsanctuary. He had barely gained the security of the lowermost bough\nwhen a thundering crash resounded, the sturdy trunk trembled beneath\nhis clutch. Stony claws gouged yellow parallels in the bark scant\ninches beneath one kicking foot, then the Granny fell back with a thud.\nThe Graniteback was\nnot\na climber. It was far too ungainly, much too\nweighty for that.\nRoberts said weakly, \"Th-thanks, Jonesy! That was a close call.\"\n\"That goes for me, too, Jonesy,\" added Brown from an upper bough.\n\"But I'm afraid you just delayed matters. This tree's O.Q. as long\nas it lasts, but\u2014\" He stared down upon the gathering knot of\nGrannies unhappily\u2014\"it's not going to last long with that bunch of\nsuperdreadnaughts working out on it! Hold tight, fellows! Here they\ncome!\"\nFor the Grannies, who had huddled for a moment as if in telepathic\nconsultation, now joined forces, turned, and as one body charged\nheadlong toward the tree. The unified force of their attack was like\nthe shattering impact of a battering ram. Bark rasped and gritted\nbeneath the besieged men's hands, dry leaves and twigs pelted about\nthem in a tiny rain, tormented fibrous sinews groaned as the aged\nforest monarch shuddered in agony.\nDesperately they clung to their perches. Though the great tree bent, it\ndid not break. But when it stopped trembling, it was canted drunkenly\nto one side, and the erstwhile solid earth about its base was broken\nand cracked\u2014revealing fleshy tentacles uprooted from ancient moorings!\nBrown stared at this evidence of the Grannies' power with\nterror-fascinated eyes. His voice was none too firm.\n\"Lord! Piledrivers! A couple more like that\u2014\"\nIsobar nodded. He knew what falling into the clutch of the Grannies\nmeant. He had once seen the grisly aftermath of a Graniteback feast.\nEven now their adversaries had drawn back for a second attack. A sudden\nidea struck him. A straw of hope at which he grasped feverishly.\n\"You telecast a message to the Dome? Help should be on the way by now.\nIf we can just hold out\u2014\"\nBut Roberts shook his head.\n\"We sent a message, Jonesy, but I don't think it got through. I've just\nbeen looking at my portable. It seems to be busted. Happened when they\nfirst attacked us, I guess. I tripped and fell on it.\"\nIsobar's last hope flickered out.\n\"Then I\u2014I guess it won't be long now,\" he mourned. \"If we could have\nonly got a message through, they would have sent out an armored car to\npick us up. But as it is\u2014\"\nBrown's shrug displayed a bravado he did not feel.\n\"Well, that's the way it goes. We knew what we were risking when we\nvolunteered to come Outside. This damn moon! It'll never be worth\na plugged credit until men find some way to fight those murderous\nstones-on-legs!\"\nRoberts said, \"That's right. But what are\nyou\ndoing out here, Isobar?\nAnd why, for Pete's sake, the bagpipes?\"\n\"Oh\u2014the pipes?\" Isobar flushed painfully. He had almost forgotten\nhis original reason for adventuring Outside, had quite forgotten\nhis instrument, and was now rather amazed to discover that somehow\nthroughout all the excitement he had held onto it. \"Why, I just\nhappened to\u2014Oh!\nthe pipes!\n\"\n\"Hold on!\" roared Roberts. His warning came just in time. Once more,\nthe three tree-sitters shook like dried peas in a pod as their leafy\nrefuge trembled before the locomotive onslaught of the lunar beasts.\nThis time the already-exposed roots strained and lifted, several\nsnapped; when the Grannies again withdrew, complacently unaware that\nthe \"lethal ray\" of Brown's Haemholtz was wasting itself upon their\nadamant hides in futile fury, the tree was bent at a precarious angle.\nBrown sobbed, not with fear but with impotent anger, and in a gesture\nof enraged desperation, hurled his now-empty weapon at the retreating\nGrannies.\n\"No good! Not a damn bit of good! Oh, if there was only some way of\nfighting those filthy things\u2014\"\nBut Isobar Jones had a one-track mind. \"The pipes!\" he cried again,\nexcitedly. \"That's the answer!\" And he drew the instrument into playing\nposition, bag cuddled beneath one arm-pit, drones stiffly erect over\nhis shoulder, blow-pipe at his lips. His cheeks puffed, his breath\nexpelled. The giant lung swelled, the chaunter emitted its distinctive,\nfearsome, \"\nKaa-aa-o-o-o-oro-oong!\n\"\nRoberts moaned.\n\"Oh, Lord! A guy can't even die in peace!\"\nAnd Brown stared at him hopelessly.\n\"It's no use, Isobar. You trying to scare them off? They have no sense\nof hearing. That's been proven\u2014\"\nIsobar took his lips from the reed to explain.\n\"It's not that. I'm trying to rouse the boys in the Dome. We're right\nopposite the atmosphere-conditioning-unit. See that grilled duct over\nthere? That's an inhalation-vent. The portable transmitter's out of\norder, and our voices ain't strong enough to carry into the Dome\u2014but\nthe sound of these pipes is! And Commander Eagan told me just a short\nwhile ago that the sound of the pipes carries all over the building!\n\"If they hear this, they'll get mad because I'm disobeyin' orders.\nThey'll start lookin' for me. If they can't find me inside, maybe\nthey'll look Outside. See that window? That's Sparks' turret. If we can\nmake him look out here\u2014\"\n\"\nStop talking!\n\" roared Roberts. \"Stop talking, guy, and start\nblowing! I think you've got something there. Anyhow, it's our last\nhope.\nBlow!\n\"\n\"And quick!\" appended Brown. \"For here they come!\"\nIsobar played, blew with all his might, while the Grannies raged below.\nHe meant the Grannies. Again they were huddling for attack, once more,\na solid phalanx of indestructible, granite flesh, they were smashing\ndown upon the tree.\n\"\nHaa-a-roong!\n\" blew Isobar Jones.\nIV\nAnd\u2014even he could not have foreseen the astounding results of\nhis piping! What happened next was as astonishing as it was\nincomprehensible. For as the pipes, filled now and primed to burst into\nwhatever substitute for melody they were prodded into, wailed into\naction\u2014the Grannies' rush came to an abrupt halt!\nAs one, they stopped cold in their tracks and turned dull, colorless,\nquestioning eyes upward into the tree whence came this weird and\nvibrant droning!\nSo stunned with surprise was Isobar that his grip on the pipes relaxed,\nhis lips almost slipped from the reed. But Brown's delighted bellow\nlifted his paralysis.\n\"Sacred rings of Saturn-look! They\nlike\nit! Keep playing, Jonesy!\nPlay, boy, like you never played before!\"\nAnd Roberts roared, above the skirling of the\npiobaireachd\ninto\nwhich Isobar had instinctively swung, \"Music hath charms to soothe the\nsavage beast! Then we were wrong. They\ncan\nhear, after all! See that?\nThey're lying down to listen\u2014like so many lambs! Keep playing, Isobar!\nFor once in my life I'm glad to hear that lovely, wonderful music!\"\nIsobar needed no urging. He, too, had noted how the Grannies' attack\nhad stopped, how every last one of the gaunt grey beasts had suddenly,\nquietly, almost happily, dropped to its haunches at the base of the\ntree.\nThere was no doubt about it; the Grannies\nliked\nthis music. Eyes\nraptly fixed, unblinking, unwavering, they froze into postures of\ngentle beatitude. One stirred once, dangerously, as for a moment Isobar\npaused to catch his breath, but Isobar hastily lipped the blow-pipe\nwith redoubled eagerness, and the Granny relapsed into quietude.\nFollowed then what, under somewhat different circumstances, should have\nbeen a piper's dream. For Isobar had an audience which would not\u2014and\nin two cases\ndared\nnot\u2014allow him to stop playing. And to this\naudience he played over and over again his entire repertoire. Marches,\nflings, dances\u2014the stirring\nRhoderik Dhu\nand the lilting\nLassies\nO'Skye\n, the mournful\nCoghiegh nha Shie\nwhose keening is like the\nsound of a sobbing nation.\nThe Cock o' the North\n, he played, and\nMironton\n...\nWee Flow'r o'\nDee\nand\nMacArthur's March\n...\nLa Cucuracha\nand\u2014\nAnd his lungs were parched, his lips dry as swabs of cotton. Blood\npounded through his temples, throbbing in time to the drone of the\nchaunter, and a dark mist gathered before his eyes. He tore the\nblow-pipe from his lips, gasped,\n\"Keep playing!\" came the dim, distant howl of Johnny Brown. \"Just a few\nminutes longer, Jonesy! Relief is on the way. Sparks saw us from his\nturret window five minutes ago!\"\nAnd Isobar played on. How, or what, he did not know. The memory of\nthose next few minutes was never afterward clear in his mind. All he\nknew was that above the skirling drone of his pipes there came another\nsound, the metallic clanking of a man-made machine ... an armored tank,\nsent from the Dome to rescue the beleaguered trio.\nHe was conscious, then, of a friendly voice shouting words of\nencouragement, of Joe Roberts calling a warning to those below.\n\"Careful, boys! Drive the tank right up beneath us so we can hop in and\nget out of here! Watch the Grannies\u2014they'll be after us the minute\nIsobar stops playing!\"\nThen the answer from below. The fantastic answer in Sparks' familiar\nvoice. The answer that caused the bagpipes to slip from Isobar's\nfingers as Isobar Jones passed out in a dead faint:\n\"After you? Those Grannies?

BOND\nIsobar and his squeeze-pipes were the bane of\nthe Moon Station's existence. But there came\nthe day when his comrades found that the worth\nof a man lies sometimes in his nuisance value.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories March 1943.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nThe audiophone buzzed thrice\u2014one long, followed by two shorts\u2014and\nIsobar Jones pressed the stud activating its glowing scanner-disc.\n\"Hummm?\" he said absent-mindedly.\nThe selenoplate glowed faintly, and the image of the Dome Commander\nappeared.\n\"Report ready, Jones?\"\n\"Almost,\" acknowledged Isobar gloomily. \"It prob'ly ain't right,\nthough. How anybody can be expected to get\nanything\nright on this\ndagnabbed hunk o' green cheese\u2014\"\n\"Send it up,\" interrupted Colonel Eagan, \"as soon as you can. Sparks is\nmaking Terra contact now. That is all.\"\n\"That ain't all!\" declared Isobar indignantly. \"How about my bag\u2014?\"\nIt\nwas all\n, so far as the D.C. was concerned. Isobar was talking\nto himself. The plate dulled. Isobar said, \"Nuts!\" and returned to\nhis duties. He jotted neat ditto marks under the word \"Clear\" which,\nsix months ago, he had placed beneath the column headed:\nCond. of\nObs.\nHe noted the proper figures under the headings\nSun Spots\n:\nMax\nFreq.\n\u2014\nMin. Freq.\n; then he sketched careful curves in blue and red\nink upon the Mercator projection of Earth which was his daily work\nsheet.\nThis done, he drew a clean sheet of paper out of his desk drawer,\nfrowned thoughtfully at the tabulated results of his observations, and\nbegan writing.\n\"\nWeather forecast for Terra\n,\" he wrote, his pen making scratching\nsounds.\nThe audiophone rasped again. Isobar jabbed the stud and answered\nwithout looking.\n\"O.Q.,\" he said wearily. \"O.Q. I told you it would be ready in a couple\no' minutes. Keep your pants on!\"\n\"I\u2014er\u2014I beg your pardon, Isobar?\" queried a mild voice.\nIsobar started. His sallow cheeks achieved a sickly salmon hue. He\nblinked nervously.\n\"Oh, jumpin' jimminy!\" he gulped. \"\nYou\n, Miss Sally! Golly\u2014'scuse me!\nI didn't realize\u2014\"\nThe Dome Commander's niece giggled.\n\"That's all right, Isobar. I just called to ask you about the weather\nin Oceania Sector 4B next week. I've got a swimming date at Waikiki,\nbut I won't make the shuttle unless the weather's going to be nice.\"\n\"It is,\" promised Isobar. \"It'll be swell all weekend, Miss Sally.\nFine sunshiny weather. You can go.\"\n\"That's wonderful. Thanks so much, Isobar.\"\n\"Don't mention it, ma'am,\" said Isobar, and returned to his work.\nSouth America. Africa. Asia. Pan-Europa. Swiftly he outlined the\nmeteorological prospects for each sector. He enjoyed this part of his\njob. As he wrote forecasts for each area, in his mind's eye he saw\nhimself enjoying such pastimes as each geographical division's terrain\nrendered possible.\nIf home is where the heart is, Horatio Jones\u2014known better as \"Isobar\"\nto his associates at the Experimental Dome on Luna\u2014was a long, long\nway from home. His lean, gangling frame was immured, and had been for\nsix tedious Earth months, beneath the\nimpervite\nhemisphere of Lunar\nIII\u2014that frontier outpost which served as a rocket refueling station,\nteleradio transmission point and meteorological base.\n\"Six solid months! Six sad, dreary months!\" thought Isobar, \"Locked up\nin an airtight Dome like\u2014like a goldfish in a glass bowl!\" Sunlight?\nOh, sure! But filtered through ultraviolet wave-traps so it could not\nburn, it left the skin pale and lustreless and clammy as the belly of a\ntoad. Fresh air? Pooh! Nothing but that everlasting sickening, scented,\nreoxygenated stuff gushing from atmo-conditioning units.\nExcitement? Adventure? The romance he had been led to expect when he\nsigned on for frontier service? Bah! Only a weary, monotonous, routine\nexistence.\n\"A pain!\" declared Isobar Jones. \"That's what it is; a pain in the\nstummick. Not even allowed to\u2014Yeah?\"\nIt was Sparks, audioing from the Dome's transmission turret. He said,\n\"Hyah, Jonesy! How comes with the report?\"\n\"Done,\" said Isobar. \"I was just gettin' the sheets together for you.\"\n\"O.Q. But just bring\nit\n. Nothing else.\"\nIsobar bridled.\n\"I don't know what you're talkin' about.\"\n\"Oh, no? Well, I'm talking about that squawk-filled doodlesack of\nyours, sonny boy. Don't bring that bag-full of noise up here with you.\"\nIsobar said defiantly, \"It ain't a doodlesack. It's a bagpipe. And I\nguess I can play it if I want to\u2014\"\n\"Not,\" said Sparks emphatically, \"in\nmy\ncubby! I've got sensitive\neardrums. Well, stir your stumps! I've got to get the report rolling\nquick today. Big doings up here.\"\n\"Yeah? What?\"\n\"Well, it's Roberts and Brown\u2014\"\n\"What about 'em?\"\n\"They've gone Outside to make foundation repairs.\"\n\"Lucky stiffs!\" commented Isobar ruefully.\n\"Lucky, no. Stiffs, maybe\u2014if they should meet any Grannies. Well,\nscoot along. I'm on the ether in four point sixteen minutes.\"\n\"Be right up,\" promised Isobar, and, sheets in hand, he ambled from his\ncloistered cell toward the central section of the Dome.\nHe didn't leave Sparks' turret after the sheets were delivered.\nInstead, he hung around, fidgeting so obtrusively that Riley finally\nturned to him in sheer exasperation.\n\"Sweet snakes of Saturn, Jonesy, what's the trouble? Bugs in your\nbritches?\"\nIsobar said, \"H-huh? Oh, you mean\u2014Oh, thanks, no! I just thought mebbe\nyou wouldn't mind if I\u2014well\u2014er\u2014\"\n\"I get it!\" Sparks grinned. \"Want to play peekaboo while the contact's\nopen, eh? Well, O.Q. Watch the birdie!\"\nHe twisted dials, adjusted verniers, fingered a host of\nincomprehensible keys. Current hummed and howled. Then a plate before\nhim cleared, and the voice of the Earth operator came in, enunciating\nwith painstaking clarity:\n\"Earth answering Luna. Earth answering Luna's call. Can you hear me,\nLuna? Can you hear\u2014?\"\n\"I can not only hear you,\" snorted Riley, \"I can see you and smell you,\nas well. Stop hamming it, stupid! You're lousing up the earth!\"\nThe now-visible face of the Earth radioman drew into a grimace of\ndispleasure.\n\"Oh, it's\nyou\n? Funny man, eh? Funny man Riley?\"\n\"Sure,\" said Riley agreeably. \"I'm a scream. Four-alarm Riley,\nthe cosmic comedian\u2014didn't you know? Flick on your dictacoder,\noyster-puss; here's the weather report.\" He read it. \"'\nWeather\nforecast for Terra, week of May 15-21\n\u2014'\"\n\"Ask him,\" whispered Isobar eagerly. \"Sparks, don't forget to ask him!\"\nRiley motioned for silence, but nodded. He finished the weather report,\nentered the Dome Commander's log upon the Home Office records, and\ndictated a short entry from the Luna Biological Commission. Then:\n\"That is all,\" he concluded.\n\"O.Q.,\" verified the other radioman. Isobar writhed anxiously, prodded\nRiley's shoulder.\n\"Ask him, Sparks! Go on ask him!\"\n\"Oh, cut jets, will you?\" snapped Sparks. The Terra operator looked\nstartled.\n\"How's that? I didn't say a word\u2014\"\n\"Don't be a dope,\" said Sparks, \"you dope! I wasn't talking to you.\nI'm entertaining a visitor, a refugee from a cuckoo clock. Look, do me\na favor, chum? Can you twist your mike around so it's pointing out a\nwindow?\"\n\"What? Why\u2014why, yes, but\u2014\"\n\"Without buts,\" said Sparks grumpily. \"Yours not to reason why; yours\nbut to do or don't. Will you do it?\"\n\"Well, sure. But I don't understand\u2014\" The silver platter which had\nmirrored the radioman's face clouded as the Earth operator twirled the\ninconoscope. Walls and desks of an ordinary broadcasting office spun\nbriefly into view; then the plate reflected a glimpse of an Earthly\nlandscape. Soft blue sky warmed by an atmosphere-shielded sun ... green\ntrees firmly rooted in still-greener grass ... flowers ... birds ...\npeople....\n\"Enough?\" asked Sparks.\nIsobar Jones awakened from his trance, eyes dulling. Reluctantly he\nnodded. Riley stared at him strangely, almost gently. To the other\nradioman, \"O.Q., pal,\" he said. \"Cut!\"\n\"Cut!\" agreed the other. The plate blanked out.\n\"Thanks, Sparks,\" said Isobar.\n\"Nothing,\" shrugged Riley \"\nHe twisted\nthe mike; not me. But\u2014how come\nyou always want to take a squint at Earth when the circuit's open,\nJonesy? Homesick?\"\n\"Sort of,\" admitted Isobar guiltily.\n\"Well, hell, aren't we all? But we can't leave here for another six\nmonths at least. Not till our tricks are up. I should think it'd only\nmake you feel worse to see Earth.\"\n\"It ain't Earth I'm homesick for,\" explained Isobar. \"It's\u2014well, it's\nthe things that go with it. I mean things like grass and flowers and\ntrees.\"\nSparks grinned; a mirthless, lopsided grin.\n\"We've got\nthem\nright here on Luna. Go look out the tower window,\nJonesy. The Dome's nestled smack in the middle of the prettiest,\ngreenest little valley you ever saw.\"\n\"I know,\" complained Isobar. \"And that's what makes it even worse. All\nthat pretty, soft, green stuff Outside\u2014and we ain't allowed to go out\nin it. Sometimes I get so mad I'd like to\u2014\"\n\"To,\" interrupted a crisp voice, \"what?\"\nIsobar spun, flushing; his eyes dropped before those of Dome Commander\nEagan. He squirmed.\n\"N-nothing, sir. I was only saying\u2014\"\n\"I heard you, Jones. And please let me hear no more of such talk, sir!\nIt is strictly forbidden for anyone to go Outside except in cases of\nabsolute necessity. Such labor as caused Patrolmen Brown and Roberts to\ngo, for example\u2014\"\n\"Any word from them yet, sir?\" asked Sparks eagerly.\n\"Not yet. But we're expecting them to return at any minute now. Jones!\nWhere are\nyou\ngoing?\"\n\"Why\u2014why, just back to my quarters, sir.\"\n\"That's what I thought. And what did you plan to do there?\"\nIsobar said stubbornly, \"Well, I sort of figured I'd amuse myself for a\nwhile\u2014\"\n\"I thought that, too. And with\nwhat\n, pray, Jones?\"\n\"With the only dratted thing,\" said Isobar, suddenly petulant, \"that\ngives me any fun around this dagnabbed place! With my bagpipe.\"\nCommander Eagan said, \"You'd better find some new way of amusing\nyourself, Jones. Have you read General Order 17?\"\nIsobar said, \"I seen it. But if you think\u2014\"\n\"It says,\" stated Eagan deliberately, \"'\nIn order that work or rest\nperiods of the Dome's staff may not be disturbed, it is hereby ordered\nthat the playing or practicing of all or any musical instruments must\nbe discontinued immediately. By order of the Dome Commander\n,' That\nmeans you, Jones!\"\n\"But, dingbust it!\" keened Isobar, \"it don't disturb nobody for me to\nplay my bagpipes! I know these lunks around here don't appreciate good\nmusic, so I always go in my office and lock the door after me\u2014\"\n\"But the Dome,\" pointed out Commander Eagan, \"has an air-conditioning\nsystem which can't be shut off. The ungodly moans of\nyour\u2014er\u2014so-called musical instrument can be heard through the entire\nstructure.\"\nHe suddenly seemed to gain stature.\n\"No, Jones, this order is final! You cannot disrupt our entire\norganization for your own\u2014er\u2014amusement.\"\n\"But\u2014\" said Isobar.\n\"No!\"\nIsobar wriggled desperately. Life on Luna was sorry enough already.\nIf now they took from him the last remaining solace he had, the last\namusement which lightened his moments of freedom\u2014\n\"Look, Commander!\" he pleaded, \"I tell you what I'll do. I won't bother\nnobody. I'll go Outside and play it\u2014\"\n\"Outside!\" Eagan stared at him incredulously. \"Are you mad? How about\nthe Grannies?\"\nIsobar knew all about the Grannies. The only mobile form of life\nfound by space-questing man on Earth's satellite, their name was an\nabbreviation of the descriptive one applied to them by the first Lunar\nexployers: Granitebacks. This was no exaggeration; if anything, it was\nan understatement. For the Grannies, though possessed of certain low\nintelligence, had quickly proven themselves a deadly, unyielding and\nimplacable foe.\nWorse yet, they were an enemy almost indestructible! No man had ever\nyet brought to Earth laboratories the carcass of a Grannie; science\nwas completely baffled in its endeavors to explain the composition of\nGraniteback physiology\u2014but it was known, from bitter experience, that\nthe carapace or exoskeleton of the Grannies was formed of something\nharder than steel, diamond, or battleplate! This flesh could be\npenetrated by no weapon known to man; neither by steel nor flame,\nby electronic nor ionic wave, nor by the lethal, newly discovered\natomo-needle dispenser.\nAll this Isobar knew about the Grannies. Yet:\n\"They ain't been any Grannies seen around the Dome,\" he said, \"for\na 'coon's age. Anyhow, if I seen any comin', I could run right back\ninside\u2014\"\n\"No!\" said Commander Eagan flatly. \"Absolutely,\nno\n! I have no time\nfor such nonsense. You know the orders\u2014obey them! And now, gentlemen,\ngood afternoon!\"\nHe left. Sparks turned to Isobar, grinning.\n\"Well,\" he said, \"one man's fish\u2014hey, Jonesy? Too bad you can't play\nyour doodlesack any more, but frankly, I'm just as glad. Of all the\nawful screeching wails\u2014\"\nBut Isobar Jones, generally mild and gentle, was now in a perfect\nfury. His pale eyes blazed, he stomped his foot on the floor, and from\nhis lips poured a stream of such angry invective that Riley looked\nstartled. Words that, to Isobar, were the utter dregs of violent\nprofanity.\n\"Oh, dagnab it!\" fumed Isobar Jones. \"Oh, tarnation and dingbust!\nOh\u2014\nfiddlesticks\n!\"\nII\n\"And so,\" chuckled Riley, \"he left, bubbling like a kettle on a red-hot\noven. But, boy! was he ever mad! Just about ready to bust, he was.\"\nSome minutes had passed since Isobar had left; Riley was talking to Dr.\nLoesch, head of the Dome's Physics Research Division. The older man\nnodded commiseratingly.\n\"It is funny, yes,\" he agreed, \"but at the same time it is not\naltogether amusing. I feel sorry for him. He is a very unhappy man, our\npoor Isobar.\"\n\"Yeah, I know,\" said Riley, \"but, hell, we all get a little bit\nhomesick now and then. He ought to learn to\u2014\"\n\"Excuse me, my boy,\" interrupted the aged physicist, his voice gentle,\n\"it is not mere homesickness that troubles our friend. It is something\ndeeper, much more vital and serious. It is what my people call:\nweltschmertz\n. There is no accurate translation in English. It means\n'world sickness,' or better, 'world weariness'\u2014something like that but\nintensified a thousandfold.\n\"It is a deeply-rooted mental condition, sometimes a dangerous frame\nof mind. Under its grip, men do wild things. Hating the world on which\nthey find themselves, they rebel in curious ways. Suicide ... mad acts\nof valor ... deeds of cunning or knavery....\"\n\"You mean,\" demanded Sparks anxiously, \"Isobar ain't got all his\nbuttons?\"\n\"Not that exactly. He is perfectly sane. But he is in a dark morass\nof despair. He may try\nanything\nto retrieve his lost happiness, rid\nhis soul of its dark oppression. His world-sickness is like a crying\nhunger\u2014By the way, where is he now?\"\n\"Below, I guess. In his quarters.\"\n\"Ah, good! Perhaps he is sleeping. Let us hope so. In slumber he will\nfind peace and forgetfulness.\"\nBut Dr. Loesch would have been far less sanguine had some power the\n\"giftie gi'en\" him of watching Isobar Jones at that moment.\nIsobar was not asleep. Far from it. Wide awake and very much astir, he\nwas acting in a singularly sinister role: that of a slinking, furtive\nculprit.\nReturning to his private cubicle after his conversation with Dome\nCommander Eagan, he had stalked straightway to the cabinet wherein was\nencased his precious set of bagpipes. These he had taken from their\npegs, gazed upon defiantly, and fondled with almost parental affection.\n\"So I can't play you, huh?\" he muttered darkly. \"It disturbs the peace\no' the dingfounded, dumblasted Dome staff, does it? Well, we'll\nsee\nabout that!\"\nAnd tucking the bag under his arm, he had cautiously slipped from the\nroom, down little-used corridors, and now he stood before the huge\nimpervite\ngates which were the entrance to the Dome and the doorway\nto Outside.\nOn all save those occasions when a spacecraft landed in the cradle\nadjacent the gateway, these portals were doubly locked and barred. But\ntoday they had been unbolted that the two maintenance men might venture\nout. And since it was quite possible that Brown and Roberts might have\nto get inside in a hurry, their bolts remained drawn. Sole guardian of\nthe entrance was a very bored Junior Patrolman.\nUp to this worthy strode Isobar Jones, confident and assured, exuding\nan aura of propriety.\n\"Very well, Wilkins,\" he said. \"I'll take over now. You may go to the\nmeeting.\"\nWilkins looked at him bewilderedly.\n\"Huh? Whuzzat, Mr. Jones?\"\nIsobar's eyebrows arched.\n\"You mean you haven't been notified?\"\n\"Notified of\nwhat\n?\"\n\"Why, the general council of all Patrolmen! Weren't you told that I\nwould take your place here while you reported to G.H.Q.?\"\n\"I ain't,\" puzzled Wilkins, \"heard nothing about it. Maybe I ought to\ncall the office, maybe?\"\nAnd he moved the wall-audio. But Isobar said swiftly. \"That\u2014er\u2014won't\nbe necessary, Wilkins. My orders were plain enough. Now, you just run\nalong. I'll watch this entrance for you.\"\n\"We-e-ell,\" said Wilkins, \"if you say so. Orders is orders. But keep a\nsharp eye out, Mister Jones, in case Roberts and Brown should come back\nsudden-like.\"\n\"I will,\" promised Isobar, \"don't worry.\"\nWilkins moved away. Isobar waited until the Patrolman was completely\nout of sight. Then swiftly he pulled open the massive gate, slipped\nthrough, and closed it behind him.\nA flood of warmth, exhilarating after the constantly regulated\ntemperature of the Dome, descended upon him. Fresh air, thin, but\nfragrant with the scent of growing things, made his pulses stir with\njoyous abandon. He was Outside! He was Outside, in good sunlight, at\nlast! After six long and dreary months!\nRaptly, blissfully, all thought of caution tossed to the gentle breezes\nthat ruffled his sparse hair, Isobar Jones stepped forward into the\nlunar valley....\nHow long he wandered thus, carefree and utterly content, he could not\nafterward say. It seemed like minutes; it must have been longer. He\nonly knew that the grass was green beneath his feet, the trees were a\nlacy network through which warm sunlight filtered benevolently, the\nchirrupings of small insects and the rustling whisper of the breezes\nformed a tiny symphony of happiness through which he moved as one\ncharmed.\nIt did not occur to him that he had wandered too far from the Dome's\nentrance until, strolling through an enchanting flower-decked glade, he\nwas startled to hear\u2014off to his right\u2014the sharp, explosive bark of a\nHaemholtz ray pistol.\nHe whirled, staring about him wildly, and discovered that though his\nmeandering had kept him near the Dome, he had unconsciously followed\nits hemispherical perimeter to a point nearly two miles from the\nGateway. By the placement of ports and windows, Isobar was able to\njudge his location perfectly; he was opposite that portion of the\nstructure which housed Sparks' radio turret.\nAnd the shooting? That could only be\u2014\nHe did not have to name its reason, even to himself. For at that\nmoment, there came racing around the curve of the Dome a pair of\nfigures, Patrolmen clad in fatigue drab. Roberts and Brown. Roberts was\nstaggering, one foot dragged awkwardly as he ran; Brown's left arm,\nbloodstained from shoulder to elbow, hung limply at his side, but in\nhis good right fist he held a spitting Haemholtz with which he tried to\ncover his comrade's sluggish retreat.\nAnd behind these two, grim, grey, gaunt figures that moved with\nastonishing speed despite their massive bulk, came three ... six ... a\ndozen of those lunarites whom all men feared. The Grannies!\nIII\nSimultaneously with his recognition of the pair, Joe Roberts saw him. A\ngasp of relief escaped the wounded man.\n\"Jones! Thank the Lord! Then you picked up our cry for help? Quick,\nman\u2014where is it? Theres not a moment to waste!\"\n\"W-where,\" faltered Isobar feebly, \"is\nwhat\n?\"\n\"The tank, of course! Didn't you hear our telecast? We can't possibly\nmake it back to the gate without an armored car. My foot's broken,\nand\u2014\" Roberts stopped suddenly, an abrupt horror in his eyes. \"You\ndon't have one! You're here\nalone\n! Then you didn't pick up our call?\nBut, why\u2014?\"\n\"Never mind that,\" snapped Isobar, \"now!\" Placid by nature, he could\nmove when urgency drove. His quick mind saw the immediateness of their\nperil. Unarmed, he could not help the Patrolmen fight a delaying action\nagainst their foes, nor could he hasten their retreat. Anyway, weapons\nwere useless, and time was of the essence. There was but one temporary\nway of staving off disaster. \"Over here ... this tree! Quick! Up you\ngo! Give him a lift, Brown\u2014There! That's the stuff!\"\nHe was the last to scramble up the gnarled bole to a tentative leafy\nsanctuary. He had barely gained the security of the lowermost bough\nwhen a thundering crash resounded, the sturdy trunk trembled beneath\nhis clutch. Stony claws gouged yellow parallels in the bark scant\ninches beneath one kicking foot, then the Granny fell back with a thud.\nThe Graniteback was\nnot\na climber. It was far too ungainly, much too\nweighty for that.\nRoberts said weakly, \"Th-thanks, Jonesy! That was a close call.\"\n\"That goes for me, too, Jonesy,\" added Brown from an upper bough.\n\"But I'm afraid you just delayed matters. This tree's O.Q. as long\nas it lasts, but\u2014\" He stared down upon the gathering knot of\nGrannies unhappily\u2014\"it's not going to last long with that bunch of\nsuperdreadnaughts working out on it! Hold tight, fellows! Here they\ncome!\"\nFor the Grannies, who had huddled for a moment as if in telepathic\nconsultation, now joined forces, turned, and as one body charged\nheadlong toward the tree. The unified force of their attack was like\nthe shattering impact of a battering ram. Bark rasped and gritted\nbeneath the besieged men's hands, dry leaves and twigs pelted about\nthem in a tiny rain, tormented fibrous sinews groaned as the aged\nforest monarch shuddered in agony.\nDesperately they clung to their perches. Though the great tree bent, it\ndid not break. But when it stopped trembling, it was canted drunkenly\nto one side, and the erstwhile solid earth about its base was broken\nand cracked\u2014revealing fleshy tentacles uprooted from ancient moorings!\nBrown stared at this evidence of the Grannies' power with\nterror-fascinated eyes. His voice was none too firm.\n\"Lord! Piledrivers! A couple more like that\u2014\"\nIsobar nodded. He knew what falling into the clutch of the Grannies\nmeant. He had once seen the grisly aftermath of a Graniteback feast.\nEven now their adversaries had drawn back for a second attack. A sudden\nidea struck him. A straw of hope at which he grasped feverishly.\n\"You telecast a message to the Dome? Help should be on the way by now.\nIf we can just hold out\u2014\"\nBut Roberts shook his head.\n\"We sent a message, Jonesy, but I don't think it got through. I've just\nbeen looking at my portable. It seems to be busted. Happened when they\nfirst attacked us, I guess. I tripped and fell on it.\"\nIsobar's last hope flickered out.\n\"Then I\u2014I guess it won't be long now,\" he mourned. \"If we could have\nonly got a message through, they would have sent out an armored car to\npick us up. But as it is\u2014\"\nBrown's shrug displayed a bravado he did not feel.\n\"Well, that's the way it goes. We knew what we were risking when we\nvolunteered to come Outside. This damn moon! It'll never be worth\na plugged credit until men find some way to fight those murderous\nstones-on-legs!\"\nRoberts said, \"That's right. But what are\nyou\ndoing out here, Isobar?\nAnd why, for Pete's sake, the bagpipes?\"\n\"Oh\u2014the pipes?\" Isobar flushed painfully. He had almost forgotten\nhis original reason for adventuring Outside, had quite forgotten\nhis instrument, and was now rather amazed to discover that somehow\nthroughout all the excitement he had held onto it. \"Why, I just\nhappened to\u2014Oh!\nthe pipes!\n\"\n\"Hold on!\" roared Roberts. His warning came just in time. Once more,\nthe three tree-sitters shook like dried peas in a pod as their leafy\nrefuge trembled before the locomotive onslaught of the lunar beasts.\nThis time the already-exposed roots strained and lifted, several\nsnapped; when the Grannies again withdrew, complacently unaware that\nthe \"lethal ray\" of Brown's Haemholtz was wasting itself upon their\nadamant hides in futile fury, the tree was bent at a precarious angle.\nBrown sobbed, not with fear but with impotent anger, and in a gesture\nof enraged desperation, hurled his now-empty weapon at the retreating\nGrannies.\n\"No good! Not a damn bit of good! Oh, if there was only some way of\nfighting those filthy things\u2014\"\nBut Isobar Jones had a one-track mind. \"The pipes!\" he cried again,\nexcitedly. \"That's the answer!\" And he drew the instrument into playing\nposition, bag cuddled beneath one arm-pit, drones stiffly erect over\nhis shoulder, blow-pipe at his lips. His cheeks puffed, his breath\nexpelled. The giant lung swelled, the chaunter emitted its distinctive,\nfearsome, \"\nKaa-aa-o-o-o-oro-oong!\n\"\nRoberts moaned.\n\"Oh, Lord! A guy can't even die in peace!\"\nAnd Brown stared at him hopelessly.\n\"It's no use, Isobar. You trying to scare them off? They have no sense\nof hearing. That's been proven\u2014\"\nIsobar took his lips from the reed to explain.\n\"It's not that. I'm trying to rouse the boys in the Dome. We're right\nopposite the atmosphere-conditioning-unit. See that grilled duct over\nthere? That's an inhalation-vent. The portable transmitter's out of\norder, and our voices ain't strong enough to carry into the Dome\u2014but\nthe sound of these pipes is! And Commander Eagan told me just a short\nwhile ago that the sound of the pipes carries all over the building!\n\"If they hear this, they'll get mad because I'm disobeyin' orders.\nThey'll start lookin' for me. If they can't find me inside, maybe\nthey'll look Outside. See that window? That's Sparks' turret. If we can\nmake him look out here\u2014\"\n\"\nStop talking!\n\" roared Roberts. \"Stop talking, guy, and start\nblowing! I think you've got something there. Anyhow, it's our last\nhope.\nBlow!\n\"\n\"And quick!\" appended Brown. \"For here they come!\"\nIsobar played, blew with all his might, while the Grannies raged below.\nHe meant the Grannies. Again they were huddling for attack, once more,\na solid phalanx of indestructible, granite flesh, they were smashing\ndown upon the tree.\n\"\nHaa-a-roong!\n\" blew Isobar Jones.\nIV\nAnd\u2014even he could not have foreseen the astounding results of\nhis piping! What happened next was as astonishing as it was\nincomprehensible. For as the pipes, filled now and primed to burst into\nwhatever substitute for melody they were prodded into, wailed into\naction\u2014the Grannies' rush came to an abrupt halt!\nAs one, they stopped cold in their tracks and turned dull, colorless,\nquestioning eyes upward into the tree whence came this weird and\nvibrant droning!\nSo stunned with surprise was Isobar that his grip on the pipes relaxed,\nhis lips almost slipped from the reed. But Brown's delighted bellow\nlifted his paralysis.\n\"Sacred rings of Saturn-look! They\nlike\nit! Keep playing, Jonesy!\nPlay, boy, like you never played before!\"\nAnd Roberts roared, above the skirling of the\npiobaireachd\ninto\nwhich Isobar had instinctively swung, \"Music hath charms to soothe the\nsavage beast! Then we were wrong. They\ncan\nhear, after all! See that?\nThey're lying down to listen\u2014like so many lambs! Keep playing, Isobar!\nFor once in my life I'm glad to hear that lovely, wonderful music!\"\nIsobar needed no urging. He, too, had noted how the Grannies' attack\nhad stopped, how every last one of the gaunt grey beasts had suddenly,\nquietly, almost happily, dropped to its haunches at the base of the\ntree.\nThere was no doubt about it; the Grannies\nliked\nthis music. Eyes\nraptly fixed, unblinking, unwavering, they froze into postures of\ngentle beatitude. One stirred once, dangerously, as for a moment Isobar\npaused to catch his breath, but Isobar hastily lipped the blow-pipe\nwith redoubled eagerness, and the Granny relapsed into quietude.\nFollowed then what, under somewhat different circumstances, should have\nbeen a piper's dream. For Isobar had an audience which would not\u2014and\nin two cases\ndared\nnot\u2014allow him to stop playing. And to this\naudience he played over and over again his entire repertoire. Marches,\nflings, dances\u2014the stirring\nRhoderik Dhu\nand the lilting\nLassies\nO'Skye\n, the mournful\nCoghiegh nha Shie\nwhose keening is like the\nsound of a sobbing nation.\nThe Cock o' the North\n, he played, and\nMironton\n...\nWee Flow'r o'\nDee\nand\nMacArthur's March\n...\nLa Cucuracha\nand\u2014\nAnd his lungs were parched, his lips dry as swabs of cotton. Blood\npounded through his temples, throbbing in time to the drone of the\nchaunter, and a dark mist gathered before his eyes. He tore the\nblow-pipe from his lips, gasped,\n\"Keep playing!\" came the dim, distant howl of Johnny Brown. \"Just a few\nminutes longer, Jonesy! Relief is on the way. Sparks saw us from his\nturret window five minutes ago!\"\nAnd Isobar played on. How, or what, he did not know. The memory of\nthose next few minutes was never afterward clear in his mind. All he\nknew was that above the skirling drone of his pipes there came another\nsound, the metallic clanking of a man-made machine ... an armored tank,\nsent from the Dome to rescue the beleaguered trio.\nHe was conscious, then, of a friendly voice shouting words of\nencouragement, of Joe Roberts calling a warning to those below.\n\"Careful, boys! Drive the tank right up beneath us so we can hop in and\nget out of here! Watch the Grannies\u2014they'll be after us the minute\nIsobar stops playing!\"\nThen the answer from below. The fantastic answer in Sparks' familiar\nvoice. The answer that caused the bagpipes to slip from Isobar's\nfingers as Isobar Jones passed out in a dead faint:\n\"After you? Those Grannies? Hell's howling acres\u2014\nthose Grannies are\nstone dead\n!\"\n", "summary": "Horatio Jones, better known as \"Isobar\" to his associates at the Experimental Dome on Luna, has been gone from his home for six months. His absence has affected his work, his relationships, and his ability to enjoy the simple things in life. When he returns to the dome, he is greeted by his superior, Dr. Loesch, who tells him that he has been watching him for a long time. He is worried that he is losing his mind due to the lack of oxygen in his body, but he is determined to find a way to help his people. He leaves his office and heads to the laboratory, where he meets with his colleague, Eagan, who is also worried about Isobar's well-being. They discuss the weather forecast for the week of May 15-21, and when they return to the office, they are met by their superior, who orders them to lock themselves in their office.   When they leave, they go to the control room, where they receive a call from the meteorological station, informing them that a spacecraft has landed in the cradle adjacent to their dome. They go to investigate the situation, and they find a tank containing a large quantity of radioactive material. When they enter the tank, they find that it is filled with greenish fluid, which turns out to be chlorine gas. They realize that they have been poisoned by the radiation in the tank. They try to leave, but they are unable to do so. They return to their office, and the next day, they receive another call, this time from their supervisor, Mr. Freq. He tells them that they are being attacked by hostile forces, and that they must leave the dome immediately. They leave, and as they are leaving, they hear a voice calling out for them. They turn around, and it is the voice of the meteorologist, who informs them that the hostile forces have already attacked their dome and that the only way out is through the gateway. They rush to the gateway, but when they get there, they see that it has been locked and barred. They enter the dome again, and this time they find the bodies of two men, who have been captured by the hostile invaders. They begin to run, but one of the men is able to escape and run away. They find the body of the man, and he is unconscious. He wakes up in a hospital, and a doctor informs him that the man has been in a coma for three months. He has a history of lung-rot, which causes him to be unable to function properly. The doctor also tells him about a disease called \"world-sickness\", which causes people to wander away from their homes and wander into unfamiliar areas. The story ends with the doctor explaining that the disease is caused by a mutation in the brain.", "faithfulness": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}

The\nshuttered glow of Burshis' Stumble Inn was only a few yards off to his\nright, but even that lodestone failed before the novel interest of a\nship about to ground in the one-time Port of Ten Thousand Ships.\nNow he made out the flicker of the braking drive a mile or so\noverhead, and presently soft motor thunder came down to blanket the\nalmost lightless city with sound. A beam swayed through the throbbing\ndarkness, caught the descending ship and held it, a small gleaming\nminnow slipping through the dark heavens. A faint glow rose from Pi\nMesa, where the spaceport lay above the city, as a runway lighted\nup\u2014draining the last reserves of the city's stored power, but draining\nthem gladly now that, in those autumn days of the historic year 819,\nrelief was in sight.\nRyd shrugged limply; the play was meaningless to him. He turned to\nshuffle down the inviting ramp into the glowing interior of Burshis'\ndive.\nThe place was crowded with men and smoke. Perhaps half the former were\nasleep, on tables or on the floor; but for the few places like Burshis'\nwhich were still open under the power shortage, many would have frozen,\nthese days, in the chilly nights at fourteen thousand feet. For\nDynamopolis sprawled atop the world, now as in the old days when it had\nbeen built to be the power center of North America.\nThe rocket blasts crescendoed and died up on Pi Mesa as Ryd wedged\nhimself with difficulty into the group along the bar. If anyone\nrecognized him, they showed it only by looking fixedly at something\nelse. Only Burshis Yuns kept his static smile and nodded with\nsurprising friendliness at Ryd's pinched, old-young face.\nRyd was startled by the nod. Burshis finished serving another customer\nand maneuvered down the stained chrome-and-synthyl bar. Ryd was\nheartened.\n\"Say, Burshis,\" he started nervously, as the bulky man halted with his\nback to him. But Burshis turned, still smiling, shaking his head so\nthat his jowls quivered.\n\"No loans,\" he said flatly. \"But just one on the house, Ryd.\"\nThe drink almost spilled itself in Ryd's hand. Clutching it\nconvulsively, he made his eyes narrow and said suspiciously, \"What you\nsetting 'em up for, Burshis? It's the first time since\u2014\"\nBurshis' smile stayed put. He said affably, \"Didn't you hear that ship\nthat just came down on the Mesa? That was the ship from Mars\u2014the\nescort they were sending with the power cylinder. The power's coming\nin again.\" He turned to greet a coin-tapping newcomer, added over his\nshoulder: \"You know what that means, Ryd. Some life around here again.\nJobs for all the bums in this town\u2014even for you.\"\nHe left Ryd frowning, thinking fuzzily. A warming gulp seemed to clear\nhis head. Jobs. So they thought they could put that over on him again,\nhuh? Well, he'd show them. He was smart; he was a damn good helio\nman\u2014no, that had been ten years ago. But now he was out of the habit\nof working, anyway. No job for Ryd Randl. They gave him one once and\nthen took it away. He drank still more deeply.\nThe man on Ryd's immediate right leaned toward him. He laid a hand on\nhis arm, gripping it hard, and said quietly: \"So you're Ryd Randl.\"\nRyd had a bad moment before he saw that the face wasn't that of any\nplain-clothes man he knew. For that matter, it didn't belong to anybody\nhe had ever known\u2014an odd, big-boned face, strikingly ugly, with a\nbeak-nose that was yet not too large for the hard jaw or too bleak for\nthe thin mouth below it. An expensive transparent hat slanted over the\nface, and from its iridescent shadows gleamed eyes that were alert and\nalmost frighteningly black. Ryd noted that the man wore a dark-gray\ncellotex of a sort rarely seen in joints like Burshis'.\n\"Suppose we step outside, Ryd. I'd like to talk to you.\"\n\"What's the idea?\" demanded Ryd, his small store of natural courage\nfloated to the top by alcohol.\nThe other seemed to realize that he was getting ahead of himself.\nHe leaned back slightly, drew a deep breath, and said slowly and\ndistinctly. \"Would you care to make some money, my friend?\"\n\"\nHuh?\nWhy, yeh\u2014I guess so\u2014\"\n\"Then come with me.\" The hand still on his arm was insistent. In his\ndaze, Ryd let himself be drawn away from the bar into the sluggish\ncrowd; then he suddenly remembered his unfinished drink, and made\nfrantic gestures. Deliberately misunderstanding, the tall stranger\nfumbled briefly, tossed a coin on the counter-top, and hustled Ryd out,\npast the blue-and-gold-lit\nmeloderge\nthat was softly pouring out its\nendlessly changing music, through the swinging doors into the dark.\nOutside, between lightless buildings, the still cold closed in on\nthem. They kept walking\u2014so fast that Ryd began to lose his breath,\nlong-accustomed though his lungs were to the high, thin air.\n\"So you're Ryd Randl,\" repeated the stranger after a moment's silence.\n\"I might have known you. But I'd almost given up finding you tonight.\"\nRyd tried feebly to wrench free, stumbled. \"Look,\" he gasped. \"If\nyou're a cop, say so!\"\nThe other laughed shortly. \"No. I'm just a man about to offer you a\nchance. For a come-back, Ryd\u2014a chance to live again.... My name\u2014you\ncan call me Mury.\"\nRyd was voiceless. Something seemed increasingly ominous about the\ntall, spare man at his side. He wished himself back in Burshis' with\nhis first free drink in a month. The thought of it brought tears to his\neyes.\n\"How long have you been out of a job, Ryd?\"\n\"Nine ... ten years. Say, what's it to you?\"\n\"And why, Ryd?\"\n\"Why...? Look, mister, I was a helio operator.\" He hunched his narrow\nshoulders and spread his hands in an habitual gesture of defeat. \"Damn\ngood one, too\u2014I was a foreman ten years ago. But I don't have the\nphysique for Mars\u2014I might just have made it\nthen\n, but I thought the\nplant was going to open again and\u2014\"\nAnd that was it. The almost airless Martian sky, with its burning\nactinic rays, is so favorable for the use of the helio-dynamic engine.\nAnd after the middle of the eighth century, robot labor gave Mars its\nfull economic independence\u2014and domination. For power is\u2014power; and\nthere is the Restriction Act to keep men on Earth even if more than two\nin ten could live healthily on the outer world.\n\"Ten years ago,\" Mury nodded as if satisfied. \"That must have been the\nPower Company of North America\u2014the main plant by Dynamopolis itself,\nthat shut down in December, 809. They were the last to close down\noutside the military bases in the Kun Lun.\"\nRyd was pacing beside him now. He felt a queer upsurge of confidence in\nthis strange man; for too long he had met no sympathy and all too few\nmen who talked his language. He burst out: \"They wouldn't take me, damn\nthem! Said my record wasn't good enough for them. That is, I didn't\nhave a drag with any of the Poligerents.\"\n\"I know all about your record,\" said Mury softly.\nRyd's suspicions came back abruptly, and he reverted to his old\nkicked-dog manner. \"How do you know? And what's it to you?\"\nAll at once, Mury came to a stop, and swung around to face him\nsquarely, hard eyes compelling. They were on an overpass, not far\nfrom where the vast, almost wholly deserted offices of the Triplanet\nFreighting Company sprawled over a square mile of city. A half-smile\ntwisted Mury's thin lips.\n\"Don't misunderstand me, Ryd\u2014you mean nothing at all to me as an\nindividual. But you're one of a vast mass of men for whom I am\nworking\u2014the billions caught in the net of a corrupt government and\nsold as an economic prey to the ruthless masters of Mars. This, after\nthey've borne all the hardships of a year of embargo, have offered\ntheir hands willingly to the rebuilding of decadent Earth, only to\nbe refused by the weak leaders who can neither defy the enemy nor\ncapitulate frankly to him.\"\nRyd was dazed. His mind had never been constructed to cope with such\nideas and the past few years had not improved its capabilities. \"Are\nyou talking about the power cylinder?\" he demanded blurrily.\nMury cast a glance toward the Milky Way as if to descry the Martian\ncargo projectile somewhere up among its countless lights. He said\nsimply, \"Yes.\"\n\"I don't get it,\" mumbled Ryd, frowning. He found words that he had\nheard somewhere a day or so before, in some bar or flophouse: \"The\npower cylinder is going to be the salvation of Earth. It's a shot in\nthe arm\u2014no, right in the heart of Earth industry, here in Dynamopolis.\nIt will turn the wheels and light the cities and\u2014\"\n\"To hell with that!\" snapped Mury, suddenly savage. His hands came up\nslightly, the fingers flexing; then dropped back to his sides. \"Don't\nyou know you're repeating damnable lies?\"\nRyd could only stare, cringing and bewildered. Mury went on with a\npassion shocking after his smooth calm:\n\"The power shell is aid, yes\u2014but with what a price! It's the thirty\npieces of silver for which the venal fools who rule our nations have\nsold the whole planet to Mars. Because they lack the courage and\nvision to retool Earth's plants and factories for the inescapable\nconflict, they're selling us out\u2014making Earth, the first home of man,\na colony of the Red Planet. Do you know what Earth is to the great\nMartian land-owners?\nDo you?\n\" He paused out of breath; then finished\nvenomously, \"Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper\nthan robots\u2014cheap as\nslaves\n!\"\n\"What about it?\" gulped Ryd, drawing away from the fanatic. \"What you\nwant\nme\nto do about it?\"\nMury took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders. His face was\nonce more bleakly impassive; only the mouth was an ugly line. \"We're\ngoing to do something about it, you and I. Tonight. Now.\"\nRyd was nearly sober. And wholly terrified. He got out chokingly,\n\"What's that mean?\"\n\"The power shell\u2014isn't coming in as planned.\"\n\"You can't do that.\"\n\"\nWe\ncan,\" said Mury with a heavy accent on the first word. \"And there\nare fifty thousand credits in it for you, Ryd. Are you with us?\"\nSuspicion was chill reality now in Ryd's mind. And he knew one thing\ncertainly\u2014if he refused now to accompany Mury, he would be killed, by\nthis man or another of his kind. For the secret power known only as\nWe\nnever took chances. Whispered-of, terrible, and world-embracing,\ndesperate upshot of the times in its principles of dynamitism, war, and\npanclasm\u2014that was\nWe\n.\nThe question hung in the air for a long moment. Then Ryd, with\nan effort, said, \"Sure.\" A moment later it struck him that the\nmonosyllabic assent was suspicious; he added quickly, \"I got nothing to\nlose, see?\" It was, he realized, the cold truth.\n\"You won't lose,\" said Mury. He seemed to relax. But the menace with\nwhich he had clothed himself clung, as he turned back on the way they\nhad come.\nRyd followed dog-like, his feet in their worn shoes moving without his\nvolition. He was frightened. Out of his very fright came a longing to\nplacate Mury, assure him that he, Ryd, was on the same side whatever\nhappened....\nAfter some steps he stole a sidelong glance at his tall companion, and\nwhined, \"Where ... where we going now?\"\nMury paused in his long stride, removed a hand from a pocket of the\ngray topcoat that wrapped him as in somber thoughts. Wordlessly, he\npointed as Ryd had known he would\u2014toward where a pale man-made dawn\nseemed breaking over Pi Mesa.\nII\n\"One blow for freedom!\" said Mury with caught breath. His voice fell\nupon air scarcely stilled since the sodden thump of the blow that had\nkilled the guard.\nThe body lay between them, face down on the graveled way in the inky\nmoon-shadow. On one side Pi Mesa stretched away two hundred yards to\ndrop sharply into the night; on the other was the unlighted mass of the\nlong, continuous, low buildings that housed now unused fuel pumps and\nservicing equipment. Looking down at the dead huddle at his feet, a\nlittle stunned by the reality of this, Ryd knew that he was in it now.\nHe was caught in the machinery.\nMury hefted the length of steel in his hand once more, as if testing\nthe weight that had crushed a man's skull so easily. Then, with a short\nwrist-flip, he sent it flying into the dried weeds which had over-grown\nthe aero field on the mesa's rim during the summer months after State\norder had grounded all fliers in America.\n\"All right, Ryd,\" he said coolly. \"Trade clothes with this fellow. I've\nbrought you this far\u2014you're taking me the rest of the way.\"\nThe rest of the way.\nRyd was still panting, and his side was paining from the strenuous\nexertion of the long climb up the side of the mountain, far from the\nguarded highway. His fingers, numbed by the cold of the high, thin air,\nshook as he knelt and fumbled with the zippers of the dead guard's\nuniform. The belted gun, however, was heavy and oddly comforting as\nhe clumsily buckled it about his hips. He knew enough of weapons\nto recognize this as, not the usual paralyzer, but a flame pistol,\npowerful and deadly. He let his hand linger on its butt; then strong\nfingers tightened on his bony wrist, and he looked up with a start into\nthe sardonic black eyes of the Panclast.\n\"No use now for firearms,\" said Mury. \"All the guns we could carry\nwouldn't help us if we were caught out there. That gun is just a\nstage property for the little play we're going to give in about three\nminutes\u2014when you'll act a guardsman escorting me, a Poligerent of\nDynamopolis, aboard the towship\nShahrazad\n.\"\nFor a moment Ryd felt relief\u2014he had hazily imagined that Mury's hatred\nof Mars and all things Martian might have led him to try to sabotage\nthe Martian warship which lay somewhere on the runways beyond the long,\nlow buildings, and which would be closely guarded. But the towship\nwould also be guarded ... he shivered in the cold, dry night air.\nMury had melted into the shadow a few yards away. There was a light\nscraping, then a green flame sputtered, briefly lighting up his hands\nand face, and narrowing at once to a thin, singing needle of light.\nHe had turned a pocket electron torch against the lock-mechanism of a\nsmall, disused metal door.\nRyd watched in painful suspense. There was no sound in his ears save\nfor the hard, dry shrilling of the ray as it bit into the steel. It\nseemed to be crying:\nrun, run\n\u2014but he remembered the power that knew\nhow to punish better than the law, and stood still, shivering.\nThe lock gave way and the door slipped aside. A light went on inside,\nand Ryd's heart stopped, backfired, and started again, raggedly. The\nsame automatic mechanism that had turned the lights on had started the\nair-fresher, which picked up speed with a soft whine, sweeping out the\nlong-stale atmosphere. Mury motioned to Ryd to follow him in.\nIt was still musty in the narrow passage, between the closely-pressing\nwalls, beneath the great tubes and cable sheathings that fluted the\nceiling overhead. A stairway spiraled up on the right to the control\ncupola somewhere overhead; even in the airtight gallery a thin film\nof dust lay on every step. Up there were the meters and switches of\nthe disused terminal facilities of the spaceport; beyond the metal\ndoor marked CAUTION, just beyond the stairwell, lay the long runway\ndown which the ships of space had glided to be serviced, refueled, and\nlaunched into the sky once more by now dormant machines.\n\"Wait,\" said Mury succinctly; he vanished up the spiral stair, his\nlong legs taking two steps at a time. After an aching minute's silence,\nhe was back. All was clear as seen from the turret-windows overhead.\nThey emerged in shadow, hugging the wall. Almost a quarter of a mile to\nthe right the megalith of the Communications Tower, crowned with many\nlights where the signal-men sat godlike in its summit. Its floodlights\nshed a vast oval of light out over the mesa, where the mile-long\nrunways\u2014no longer polished mirror-like as in the days of Dynamopolis'\nglory\u2014stretched away into the darkness of the table land. A handful\nof odd ships\u2014mere remnant of the hundreds that Pi Mesa port had\nberthed\u2014huddled under the solenoid wickets, as if driven together by\nthe chill of the thin, knife-like wind that blew across the mesa.\nAs the two paced slowly across the runways, Ryd had a sense of\nprotective isolation in the vast impersonality of the spaceport.\nSurely, in this Titanic desolation of metal slabs and flat-roofed\nbuildings, dominated by the one great tower, total insignificance must\nmean safety for them.\nAnd indeed no guard challenged them. There were armed men watching\nfor all intruders out on the desert beyond the runways, but once\ninside, Ryd's borrowed blue seemed to serve as passport enough.\nNonetheless, the passport's knees were shaking when they stood at last,\ninconspicuous still, at the shadowed base of the Communications Tower.\nNot far off, a half-dozen dignitaries, huddled close together in the\nmidst of these Cyclopean man-made things that dwarfed their policies,\ntheir principles and ambitions, stood talking rather nervously with two\nofficers, aristocratically gaudy in the scarlet of the Martian Fleet.\nBlue-clad guardsmen of Earth watched from a distance\u2014watched boredly\nenough.\nAnd out on the steel-stripped tarmac, under the solenoid of Number\nTwo Runway, lay a towship, backed like a stegosaur with its massive\nmagnets\u2014the\nShahrazad\n, panting like a dragon amid rolling clouds of\nsteam. She was plainly ready to go into space. The bottom dropped out\nof Ryd's stomach before he realized that a warning at least must be\nsounded before the ship could lift. But that might come any moment now.\n\"Relax,\" said Mury in a low voice. \"Nothing's gone wrong. We'll be\naboard the\nShahrazad\nwhen she lifts.\" For a moment his black eyes\nshifted, hardening, toward Runway Four. The Martian warship lay there\nbeyond the solenoid, a spiteful hundred-foot swordfish of steel, with\nblind gunvalves, row on row, along its sleek sides and turret-blisters.\nIt had not yet been tugged onto the turntable; it could not be leaving\nagain very soon, though Earth weight was undoubtedly incommoding\nits crew. About it a few figures stood that were stiffly erect and\nimmobile, as tall as tall men. From head to toe they were scarlet.\n\"Robots!\" gasped Ryd, clutching his companion's arm convulsively.\n\"Martian soldier robots!\"\n\"They're unarmed, harmless. They aren't your police with built-in\nweapons. Only the humans are dangerous. But we've got to move. For\nGod's sake, take it easy.\"\nRyd licked dry lips. \"Are we going\u2014out into space?\"\n\"Where else?\" said Mury.\nThe official-looking individual in the expensive topcoat and sport hat\nhad reached the starboard airlock of the towship before anyone thought\nto question his authorization, escorted as he was by a blue-uniformed\nguardsman. When another sentry, pacing between runways a hundred yards\nfrom the squat space vessel, paused to wonder, it was\u2014as it came\nabout\u2014just a little too late.\nThe guard turned and swung briskly off to intercept the oddly-behaving\npair, hand crowding the butt of his pistol, for he was growing\nuneasy. His alarm mounted rapidly, till he nearly sprained an ankle\nin sprinting across the last of the two intervening runways, between\nthe solenoid wickets. Those metal arches, crowding one on the other\nin perspective, formed a tunnel that effectively shielded the\nShahrazad's\nairlocks from more distant view; the gang of notables\nattracted by the occasion was already being shepherded back to safety\nby the Communications guards, whose attention was thus well taken up.\nThe slight man in guardsman's blue glanced over his shoulder and\nvanished abruptly into the circular lock. His companion wheeled on the\ntopmost step, looking down with some irritation on his unhandsome face,\nbut with no apparent doubt of his command of the situation.\n\"Yes?\" he inquired frostily.\n\"What goes on here?\" snapped the guard, frowning at the tall figure\nsilhouetted against the glow in the airlock. \"The crew's signaled all\naboard and the ship lifts in two minutes. You ought to be\u2014\"\n\"I am Semul Mury, Poligerent for the City of Dynamopolis,\" interrupted\nthe tall man with asperity. \"The City is naturally interested in the\ndelivery of the power which will revivify our industries.\" He paused,\nsighed, shifting his weight to the next lower step of the gangway. \"I\nsuppose you'll want to re-check my credentials?\"\nThe guard was somewhat confused; a Poligerent, in ninth-century\nbureaucracy, was a force to be reckoned with. But he contrived to nod\nwith an appearance of brusqueness.\nFully expecting official papers, signed and garnished with all the\npompous seals of a chartered metropolis, the guard was dazed to receive\ninstead a terrific left-handed foul to the pit of the stomach, and as\nhe reeled dizzily, retching and clawing for his gun, to find that gun\nno longer holstered but in the hand of the self-styled Poligerent,\npointing at its licensed owner.\n\"I think,\" Mury said quietly, flexing his left wrist with care the\nwhile his right held the gun steady, \"that you'd better come aboard\nwith us.\"\nThe guard was not more cowardly than the run of politically-appointed\ncivic guardsmen. But a flame gun kills more frightfully than the\nancient electric chair. He complied, grasping the railing with both\nhands as he stumbled before Mury up the gangway\u2014for he was still very\nsick indeed, wholly apart from his bewilderment, which was enormous.\nAbove, Ryd Randl waited in the lock, flattened against the curved\nwall, white and jittering. The inner door was shut, an impenetrable\ncountersunk mirror of metal.\n\"Cover him, Ryd,\" ordered Mury flatly. In obedience Ryd lugged out\nthe heavy flame pistol and pointed it; his finger was dangerously\ntremulous on the firing lever. He moistened his lips to voice his\nfears; but Mury, pocketing the other gun, threw the three-way switch on\nthe side panel, the switch that should have controlled the inner lock.\nNothing happened.\n\"Oh, God. We're caught. We're trapped!\" The outer gangway had slid up,\nthe lock wheezed shut, forming an impenetrable crypt of niosteel.\nMury smiled with supernal calm. \"We won't be here long,\" he said.\nThen, to quiet Ryd's fears, he went on: \"The central control panel and\nthe three local switches inside, between, and outside the locks are\non the circuit in that order. Unless the locks were closed from the\nswitch just beyond the inner lock, that lock will open when the central\ncontrol panel is cut out in preparation for lifting.\"\nAlmost as he paused and drew breath, a light sprang out over the switch\nhe had closed and the inner lock swung silently free of its gaskets.\nRyd felt a trembling relief; but Mury's voice lashed out like a whip as\nhe slipped cat-like into the passage.\n\"Keep him covered. Back out of the lock.\"\nRyd backed\u2014the white, tense face of the prisoner holding his own\nnervous gaze\u2014and, almost out of the lock, stumbled over the metal\npressure rings. And the gun was out of his unsure grip, clattering\nsomewhere near his slithering feet, as he started to fall.\nHe saw the guardsman hurl himself forward; then he was flung spinning,\nback against the engine-room door. In a flash, even as he struggled\nto keep on his feet, he saw the man in the airlock coming up from a\ncrouch, shifting the pistol in his right hand to reach its firing\nlever; he saw Mury sidestep swiftly and throw the master control switch\noutside.\nThe inner lock whooshed shut, barely missing Ryd. At the same instant,\nthe flame gun lighted locks and passage with one terrific flash, and a\nscorched, discolored spot appeared on the beveled metal of the opposite\nlock a foot from Mury's right shoulder.\n\"You damned clumsy little fool\u2014\" said Mury with soft intensity. Then,\nwhile the air around the metal walls still buzzed and snapped with\nblue sparks, he whirled and went up the control-room gangway in two\nquick bounds. Even as he went the flame gun thundered again in the\nstarboard airlock.\nMury was just in time, for the pilot had been about to flash \"Ready\" to\nthe Communications Tower when the explosions had given him pause. But\nthe latter and his two companions were neither ready nor armed; clamped\nin their seats at the controls, already marked, they were helpless in\nan instant before the leveled menace of the gun. And the imprisoned\nguardsman, having wasted most of his charges, was helpless, too, in his\nlittle cell of steel.\n\"It's been tried before,\" said one of the masked men. He had a blond,\nyouthful thatch and a smooth healthy face below the mask, together with\nan astrogator's triangled stars which made him\nex officio\nthe brains\nof the vessel. \"Stealing a ship\u2014it can't be done any more.\"\n\"It's been done again,\" said Mury grimly. \"And you don't know the half\nof it. But\u2014you will. I'll need you. As for your friends\u2014\" The gun\nmuzzle shifted slightly to indicate the pilot and the engineer. \"Out of\nthose clamps. You're going to ride this out in the portside airlock.\"\nHe had to repeat the command, in tones that snapped with menace, before\nthey started with fumbling, rebellious hands to strip their armor from\nthemselves. The burly engineer was muttering phrases of obscene fervor;\nthe weedy young pilot was wild-eyed. The blond astrogator, sitting\nstill masked and apparently unmoved, demanded:\n\"What do you think you're trying to do?\"\n\"What do\nyou\nthink?\" demanded Mury in return. \"I'm taking the ship\ninto space. On schedule and on course\u2014to meet the power shell.\" The\nflame gun moved with a jerk. \"And as for you\u2014what's your name?\"\n\"Yet Arliess.\"\n\"You want to make the trip alive, don't you, Yet Arliess?\"\nThe young astrogator stared at him and at the gun through masking\ngoggles; then he sank into his seat with a slow shudder. \"Why, yes,\" he\nsaid as if in wonder, \"I do.\"\nIII\nShahrazad\ndrove steadily forward into deep space, vibrating slightly\nto the tremendous thrust of her powerful engines. The small, cramped\ncabin was stiflingly hot to the three armored men who sat before its\nbanked dials, watching their steady needles.\nRyd had blacked out, darkness washing into his eyes and consciousness\ndraining from his head, as the space ship had pitched out into\nemptiness over the end of the runway on Pi Mesa and Mury had cut in the\nmaindrive. Pressure greater than anything he had ever felt had crushed\nhim; his voice had been snatched from his lips by those terrible forces\nand lost beneath the opening thunder of the three-inch tubes. Up and\nup, while the acceleration climbed to seven gravities\u2014and Ryd had lost\nevery sensation, not to regain them until Earth was dropping away under\nthe towship's keel.\nA single gravity held them back and down in the tilted seats, and the\ncontrol panels seemed to curve half above them, their banks of lights\nconfused with the stars coldly through the great nose window. In the\ncontrol room all sounds impinged on a background made up of the insect\nhum of air-purifiers, the almost supersonic whine of the fast-spinning\ngyroscopes somewhere behind them, the deep continuous growl of the\nengines.\nMury's voice broke through that steady murmur, coming from Ryd's right.\n\"You can unfasten your anticlamps, Ryd,\" he said dryly. \"That doesn't\nmean you,\" to the young navigator, on his other hand as he sat in\nthe pilot's seat with his pressure-clamps thrown back and his gloved\nhands free to caress the multiplex controls before him. Clipped to the\nsloping dash at his left elbow was a loaded flame gun.\nRyd emerged, with much bungling, from his padded clamps, and shook his\nhead groggily as he ran a hand through his slightly thinning hair. He\nventured shakily, \"Where are we?\"\nMury smiled slightly. \"Only our astrogator,\" he indicated Arliess,\nstill masked and fettered, \"can tell you that with precision. I\nunderstand only enough of astrogational practice to make sure that he\nis holding to the course outlined on the log. For that matter ... he\nis an intelligent young man and if he were not blinded by notions of\nduty to an outworn system.... We are now somewhere near the orbit of\nthe Moon. Isn't that right, Arliess?\"\nThe other did not seem to hear; he sat staring blindly before him\nthrough his goggles at the slowly-changing chart, where cryptic lights\nburned, some moving like glowing paramecia along fine-traced luminous\ntracks.\nMury too sat silent and immobile for a minute or more. Then, abruptly,\nhe inclined his universal chair far to the right, and his long frame\nseemed to tense oddly. His finger stabbed out one of the sparks of\nlight.\n\"What's that, Arliess?\"\nThe astrogator broke his silence. \"A ship.\"\n\"I know that well enough. What ship?\"\n\"I supposed you had examined the log. It would have told you that\nthat's the liner\nAlborak\n, out of Aeropolis with a diplomatic mission\nfor Mars.\"\nMury shook his head regretfully. \"That won't wash, Arliess. Even if you\nsuppose her off course, no liner aspace ever carried a tenth of that\ndrive.\"\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" said Arliess. But his voice\nwas raw and unsteady.\n\"I'm talking about this. That ship is a warship, and it's looking for\nus\u2014will intercept us inside of twenty minutes at the most!\"\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nSaboteur of Space\nBy ROBERT ABERNATHY\nFresh power was coming to Earth, energy\nwhich would bring life to a dying planet.\nOnly two men stood in its way, one a cowardly\nrat, the other a murderous martyr; both pawns\nin a cosmic game where death moved his chessmen\nof fate\u2014and even the winner would lose.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Spring 1944.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nRyd Randl stood, slouching a little, in the darkened footway, and\nwatched the sky over Dynamopolis come alive with searchlights. The\nshuttered glow of Burshis' Stumble Inn was only a few yards off to his\nright, but even that lodestone failed before the novel interest of a\nship about to ground in the one-time Port of Ten Thousand Ships.\nNow he made out the flicker of the braking drive a mile or so\noverhead, and presently soft motor thunder came down to blanket the\nalmost lightless city with sound. A beam swayed through the throbbing\ndarkness, caught the descending ship and held it, a small gleaming\nminnow slipping through the dark heavens. A faint glow rose from Pi\nMesa, where the spaceport lay above the city, as a runway lighted\nup\u2014draining the last reserves of the city's stored power, but draining\nthem gladly now that, in those autumn days of the historic year 819,\nrelief was in sight.\nRyd shrugged limply; the play was meaningless to him. He turned to\nshuffle down the inviting ramp into the glowing interior of Burshis'\ndive.\nThe place was crowded with men and smoke. Perhaps half the former were\nasleep, on tables or on the floor; but for the few places like Burshis'\nwhich were still open under the power shortage, many would have frozen,\nthese days, in the chilly nights at fourteen thousand feet. For\nDynamopolis sprawled atop the world, now as in the old days when it had\nbeen built to be the power center of North America.\nThe rocket blasts crescendoed and died up on Pi Mesa as Ryd wedged\nhimself with difficulty into the group along the bar. If anyone\nrecognized him, they showed it only by looking fixedly at something\nelse. Only Burshis Yuns kept his static smile and nodded with\nsurprising friendliness at Ryd's pinched, old-young face.\nRyd was startled by the nod. Burshis finished serving another customer\nand maneuvered down the stained chrome-and-synthyl bar. Ryd was\nheartened.\n\"Say, Burshis,\" he started nervously, as the bulky man halted with his\nback to him. But Burshis turned, still smiling, shaking his head so\nthat his jowls quivered.\n\"No loans,\" he said flatly. \"But just one on the house, Ryd.\"\nThe drink almost spilled itself in Ryd's hand. Clutching it\nconvulsively, he made his eyes narrow and said suspiciously, \"What you\nsetting 'em up for, Burshis? It's the first time since\u2014\"\nBurshis' smile stayed put. He said affably, \"Didn't you hear that ship\nthat just came down on the Mesa? That was the ship from Mars\u2014the\nescort they were sending with the power cylinder. The power's coming\nin again.\" He turned to greet a coin-tapping newcomer, added over his\nshoulder: \"You know what that means, Ryd. Some life around here again.\nJobs for all the bums in this town\u2014even for you.\"\nHe left Ryd frowning, thinking fuzzily. A warming gulp seemed to clear\nhis head. Jobs. So they thought they could put that over on him again,\nhuh? Well, he'd show them. He was smart; he was a damn good helio\nman\u2014no, that had been ten years ago. But now he was out of the habit\nof working, anyway. No job for Ryd Randl. They gave him one once and\nthen took it away. He drank still more deeply.\nThe man on Ryd's immediate right leaned toward him. He laid a hand on\nhis arm, gripping it hard, and said quietly: \"So you're Ryd Randl.\"\nRyd had a bad moment before he saw that the face wasn't that of any\nplain-clothes man he knew. For that matter, it didn't belong to anybody\nhe had ever known\u2014an odd, big-boned face, strikingly ugly, with a\nbeak-nose that was yet not too large for the hard jaw or too bleak for\nthe thin mouth below it. An expensive transparent hat slanted over the\nface, and from its iridescent shadows gleamed eyes that were alert and\nalmost frighteningly black. Ryd noted that the man wore a dark-gray\ncellotex of a sort rarely seen in joints like Burshis'.\n\"Suppose we step outside, Ryd. I'd like to talk to you.\"\n\"What's the idea?\" demanded Ryd, his small store of natural courage\nfloated to the top by alcohol.\nThe other seemed to realize that he was getting ahead of himself.\nHe leaned back slightly, drew a deep breath, and said slowly and\ndistinctly. \"Would you care to make some money, my friend?\"\n\"\nHuh?\nWhy, yeh\u2014I guess so\u2014\"\n\"Then come with me.\" The hand still on his arm was insistent. In his\ndaze, Ryd let himself be drawn away from the bar into the sluggish\ncrowd; then he suddenly remembered his unfinished drink, and made\nfrantic gestures. Deliberately misunderstanding, the tall stranger\nfumbled briefly, tossed a coin on the counter-top, and hustled Ryd out,\npast the blue-and-gold-lit\nmeloderge\nthat was softly pouring out its\nendlessly changing music, through the swinging doors into the dark.\nOutside, between lightless buildings, the still cold closed in on\nthem. They kept walking\u2014so fast that Ryd began to lose his breath,\nlong-accustomed though his lungs were to the high, thin air.\n\"So you're Ryd Randl,\" repeated the stranger after a moment's silence.\n\"I might have known you. But I'd almost given up finding you tonight.\"\nRyd tried feebly to wrench free, stumbled. \"Look,\" he gasped. \"If\nyou're a cop, say so!\"\nThe other laughed shortly. \"No. I'm just a man about to offer you a\nchance. For a come-back, Ryd\u2014a chance to live again.... My name\u2014you\ncan call me Mury.\"\nRyd was voiceless. Something seemed increasingly ominous about the\ntall, spare man at his side. He wished himself back in Burshis' with\nhis first free drink in a month. The thought of it brought tears to his\neyes.\n\"How long have you been out of a job, Ryd?\"\n\"Nine ... ten years. Say, what's it to you?\"\n\"And why, Ryd?\"\n\"Why...? Look, mister, I was a helio operator.\" He hunched his narrow\nshoulders and spread his hands in an habitual gesture of defeat. \"Damn\ngood one, too\u2014I was a foreman ten years ago. But I don't have the\nphysique for Mars\u2014I might just have made it\nthen\n, but I thought the\nplant was going to open again and\u2014\"\nAnd that was it. The almost airless Martian sky, with its burning\nactinic rays, is so favorable for the use of the helio-dynamic engine.\nAnd after the middle of the eighth century, robot labor gave Mars its\nfull economic independence\u2014and domination. For power is\u2014power; and\nthere is the Restriction Act to keep men on Earth even if more than two\nin ten could live healthily on the outer world.\n\"Ten years ago,\" Mury nodded as if satisfied. \"That must have been the\nPower Company of North America\u2014the main plant by Dynamopolis itself,\nthat shut down in December, 809. They were the last to close down\noutside the military bases in the Kun Lun.\"\nRyd was pacing beside him now. He felt a queer upsurge of confidence in\nthis strange man; for too long he had met no sympathy and all too few\nmen who talked his language. He burst out: \"They wouldn't take me, damn\nthem! Said my record wasn't good enough for them. That is, I didn't\nhave a drag with any of the Poligerents.\"\n\"I know all about your record,\" said Mury softly.\nRyd's suspicions came back abruptly, and he reverted to his old\nkicked-dog manner. \"How do you know? And what's it to you?\"\nAll at once, Mury came to a stop, and swung around to face him\nsquarely, hard eyes compelling. They were on an overpass, not far\nfrom where the vast, almost wholly deserted offices of the Triplanet\nFreighting Company sprawled over a square mile of city. A half-smile\ntwisted Mury's thin lips.\n\"Don't misunderstand me, Ryd\u2014you mean nothing at all to me as an\nindividual. But you're one of a vast mass of men for whom I am\nworking\u2014the billions caught in the net of a corrupt government and\nsold as an economic prey to the ruthless masters of Mars. This, after\nthey've borne all the hardships of a year of embargo, have offered\ntheir hands willingly to the rebuilding of decadent Earth, only to\nbe refused by the weak leaders who can neither defy the enemy nor\ncapitulate frankly to him.\"\nRyd was dazed. His mind had never been constructed to cope with such\nideas and the past few years had not improved its capabilities. \"Are\nyou talking about the power cylinder?\" he demanded blurrily.\nMury cast a glance toward the Milky Way as if to descry the Martian\ncargo projectile somewhere up among its countless lights. He said\nsimply, \"Yes.\"\n\"I don't get it,\" mumbled Ryd, frowning. He found words that he had\nheard somewhere a day or so before, in some bar or flophouse: \"The\npower cylinder is going to be the salvation of Earth. It's a shot in\nthe arm\u2014no, right in the heart of Earth industry, here in Dynamopolis.\nIt will turn the wheels and light the cities and\u2014\"\n\"To hell with that!\" snapped Mury, suddenly savage. His hands came up\nslightly, the fingers flexing; then dropped back to his sides. \"Don't\nyou know you're repeating damnable lies?\"\nRyd could only stare, cringing and bewildered. Mury went on with a\npassion shocking after his smooth calm:\n\"The power shell is aid, yes\u2014but with what a price! It's the thirty\npieces of silver for which the venal fools who rule our nations have\nsold the whole planet to Mars. Because they lack the courage and\nvision to retool Earth's plants and factories for the inescapable\nconflict, they're selling us out\u2014making Earth, the first home of man,\na colony of the Red Planet. Do you know what Earth is to the great\nMartian land-owners?\nDo you?\n\" He paused out of breath; then finished\nvenomously, \"Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper\nthan robots\u2014cheap as\nslaves\n!\"\n\"What about it?\" gulped Ryd, drawing away from the fanatic. \"What you\nwant\nme\nto do about it?\"\nMury took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders. His face was\nonce more bleakly impassive; only the mouth was an ugly line. \"We're\ngoing to do something about it, you and I. Tonight. Now.\"\nRyd was nearly sober. And wholly terrified. He got out chokingly,\n\"What's that mean?\"\n\"The power shell\u2014isn't coming in as planned.\"\n\"You can't do that.\"\n\"\nWe\ncan,\" said Mury with a heavy accent on the first word. \"And there\nare fifty thousand credits in it for you, Ryd. Are you with us?\"\nSuspicion was chill reality now in Ryd's mind. And he knew one thing\ncertainly\u2014if he refused now to accompany Mury, he would be killed, by\nthis man or another of his kind. For the secret power known only as\nWe\nnever took chances. Whispered-of, terrible, and world-embracing,\ndesperate upshot of the times in its principles of dynamitism, war, and\npanclasm\u2014that was\nWe\n.\nThe question hung in the air for a long moment. Then Ryd, with\nan effort, said, \"Sure.\" A moment later it struck him that the\nmonosyllabic assent was suspicious; he added quickly, \"I got nothing to\nlose, see?\" It was, he realized, the cold truth.\n\"You won't lose,\" said Mury. He seemed to relax. But the menace with\nwhich he had clothed himself clung, as he turned back on the way they\nhad come.\nRyd followed dog-like, his feet in their worn shoes moving without his\nvolition. He was frightened. Out of his very fright came a longing to\nplacate Mury, assure him that he, Ryd, was on the same side whatever\nhappened....\nAfter some steps he stole a sidelong glance at his tall companion, and\nwhined, \"Where ... where we going now?\"\nMury paused in his long stride, removed a hand from a pocket of the\ngray topcoat that wrapped him as in somber thoughts. Wordlessly, he\npointed as Ryd had known he would\u2014toward where a pale man-made dawn\nseemed breaking over Pi Mesa.\nII\n\"One blow for freedom!\" said Mury with caught breath. His voice fell\nupon air scarcely stilled since the sodden thump of the blow that had\nkilled the guard.\nThe body lay between them, face down on the graveled way in the inky\nmoon-shadow. On one side Pi Mesa stretched away two hundred yards to\ndrop sharply into the night; on the other was the unlighted mass of the\nlong, continuous, low buildings that housed now unused fuel pumps and\nservicing equipment. Looking down at the dead huddle at his feet, a\nlittle stunned by the reality of this, Ryd knew that he was in it now.\nHe was caught in the machinery.\nMury hefted the length of steel in his hand once more, as if testing\nthe weight that had crushed a man's skull so easily. Then, with a short\nwrist-flip, he sent it flying into the dried weeds which had over-grown\nthe aero field on the mesa's rim during the summer months after State\norder had grounded all fliers in America.\n\"All right, Ryd,\" he said coolly. \"Trade clothes with this fellow. I've\nbrought you this far\u2014you're taking me the rest of the way.\"\nThe rest of the way.\nRyd was still panting, and his side was paining from the strenuous\nexertion of the long climb up the side of the mountain, far from the\nguarded highway. His fingers, numbed by the cold of the high, thin air,\nshook as he knelt and fumbled with the zippers of the dead guard's\nuniform. The belted gun, however, was heavy and oddly comforting as\nhe clumsily buckled it about his hips. He knew enough of weapons\nto recognize this as, not the usual paralyzer, but a flame pistol,\npowerful and deadly. He let his hand linger on its butt; then strong\nfingers tightened on his bony wrist, and he looked up with a start into\nthe sardonic black eyes of the Panclast.\n\"No use now for firearms,\" said Mury. \"All the guns we could carry\nwouldn't help us if we were caught out there. That gun is just a\nstage property for the little play we're going to give in about three\nminutes\u2014when you'll act a guardsman escorting me, a Poligerent of\nDynamopolis, aboard the towship\nShahrazad\n.\"\nFor a moment Ryd felt relief\u2014he had hazily imagined that Mury's hatred\nof Mars and all things Martian might have led him to try to sabotage\nthe Martian warship which lay somewhere on the runways beyond the long,\nlow buildings, and which would be closely guarded. But the towship\nwould also be guarded ... he shivered in the cold, dry night air.\nMury had melted into the shadow a few yards away. There was a light\nscraping, then a green flame sputtered, briefly lighting up his hands\nand face, and narrowing at once to a thin, singing needle of light.\nHe had turned a pocket electron torch against the lock-mechanism of a\nsmall, disused metal door.\nRyd watched in painful suspense. There was no sound in his ears save\nfor the hard, dry shrilling of the ray as it bit into the steel. It\nseemed to be crying:\nrun, run\n\u2014but he remembered the power that knew\nhow to punish better than the law, and stood still, shivering.\nThe lock gave way and the door slipped aside. A light went on inside,\nand Ryd's heart stopped, backfired, and started again, raggedly. The\nsame automatic mechanism that had turned the lights on had started the\nair-fresher, which picked up speed with a soft whine, sweeping out the\nlong-stale atmosphere. Mury motioned to Ryd to follow him in.\nIt was still musty in the narrow passage, between the closely-pressing\nwalls, beneath the great tubes and cable sheathings that fluted the\nceiling overhead. A stairway spiraled up on the right to the control\ncupola somewhere overhead; even in the airtight gallery a thin film\nof dust lay on every step. Up there were the meters and switches of\nthe disused terminal facilities of the spaceport; beyond the metal\ndoor marked CAUTION, just beyond the stairwell, lay the long runway\ndown which the ships of space had glided to be serviced, refueled, and\nlaunched into the sky once more by now dormant machines.\n\"Wait,\" said Mury succinctly; he vanished up the spiral stair, his\nlong legs taking two steps at a time. After an aching minute's silence,\nhe was back. All was clear as seen from the turret-windows overhead.\nThey emerged in shadow, hugging the wall. Almost a quarter of a mile to\nthe right the megalith of the Communications Tower, crowned with many\nlights where the signal-men sat godlike in its summit. Its floodlights\nshed a vast oval of light out over the mesa, where the mile-long\nrunways\u2014no longer polished mirror-like as in the days of Dynamopolis'\nglory\u2014stretched away into the darkness of the table land. A handful\nof odd ships\u2014mere remnant of the hundreds that Pi Mesa port had\nberthed\u2014huddled under the solenoid wickets, as if driven together by\nthe chill of the thin, knife-like wind that blew across the mesa.\nAs the two paced slowly across the runways, Ryd had a sense of\nprotective isolation in the vast impersonality of the spaceport.\nSurely, in this Titanic desolation of metal slabs and flat-roofed\nbuildings, dominated by the one great tower, total insignificance must\nmean safety for them.\nAnd indeed no guard challenged them. There were armed men watching\nfor all intruders out on the desert beyond the runways, but once\ninside, Ryd's borrowed blue seemed to serve as passport enough.\nNonetheless, the passport's knees were shaking when they stood at last,\ninconspicuous still, at the shadowed base of the Communications Tower.\nNot far off, a half-dozen dignitaries, huddled close together in the\nmidst of these Cyclopean man-made things that dwarfed their policies,\ntheir principles and ambitions, stood talking rather nervously with two\nofficers, aristocratically gaudy in the scarlet of the Martian Fleet.\nBlue-clad guardsmen of Earth watched from a distance\u2014watched boredly\nenough.\nAnd out on the steel-stripped tarmac, under the solenoid of Number\nTwo Runway, lay a towship, backed like a stegosaur with its massive\nmagnets\u2014the\nShahrazad\n, panting like a dragon amid rolling clouds of\nsteam. She was plainly ready to go into space. The bottom dropped out\nof Ryd's stomach before he realized that a warning at least must be\nsounded before the ship could lift. But that might come any moment now.\n\"Relax,\" said Mury in a low voice. \"Nothing's gone wrong. We'll be\naboard the\nShahrazad\nwhen she lifts.\" For a moment his black eyes\nshifted, hardening, toward Runway Four. The Martian warship lay there\nbeyond the solenoid, a spiteful hundred-foot swordfish of steel, with\nblind gunvalves, row on row, along its sleek sides and turret-blisters.\nIt had not yet been tugged onto the turntable; it could not be leaving\nagain very soon, though Earth weight was undoubtedly incommoding\nits crew. About it a few figures stood that were stiffly erect and\nimmobile, as tall as tall men. From head to toe they were scarlet.\n\"Robots!\" gasped Ryd, clutching his companion's arm convulsively.\n\"Martian soldier robots!\"\n\"They're unarmed, harmless. They aren't your police with built-in\nweapons. Only the humans are dangerous. But we've got to move. For\nGod's sake, take it easy.\"\nRyd licked dry lips. \"Are we going\u2014out into space?\"\n\"Where else?\" said Mury.\nThe official-looking individual in the expensive topcoat and sport hat\nhad reached the starboard airlock of the towship before anyone thought\nto question his authorization, escorted as he was by a blue-uniformed\nguardsman. When another sentry, pacing between runways a hundred yards\nfrom the squat space vessel, paused to wonder, it was\u2014as it came\nabout\u2014just a little too late.\nThe guard turned and swung briskly off to intercept the oddly-behaving\npair, hand crowding the butt of his pistol, for he was growing\nuneasy. His alarm mounted rapidly, till he nearly sprained an ankle\nin sprinting across the last of the two intervening runways, between\nthe solenoid wickets. Those metal arches, crowding one on the other\nin perspective, formed a tunnel that effectively shielded the\nShahrazad's\nairlocks from more distant view; the gang of notables\nattracted by the occasion was already being shepherded back to safety\nby the Communications guards, whose attention was thus well taken up.\nThe slight man in guardsman's blue glanced over his shoulder and\nvanished abruptly into the circular lock. His companion wheeled on the\ntopmost step, looking down with some irritation on his unhandsome face,\nbut with no apparent doubt of his command of the situation.\n\"Yes?\" he inquired frostily.\n\"What goes on here?\" snapped the guard, frowning at the tall figure\nsilhouetted against the glow in the airlock. \"The crew's signaled all\naboard and the ship lifts in two minutes. You ought to be\u2014\"\n\"I am Semul Mury, Poligerent for the City of Dynamopolis,\" interrupted\nthe tall man with asperity. \"The City is naturally interested in the\ndelivery of the power which will revivify our industries.\" He paused,\nsighed, shifting his weight to the next lower step of the gangway. \"I\nsuppose you'll want to re-check my credentials?\"\nThe guard was somewhat confused; a Poligerent, in ninth-century\nbureaucracy, was a force to be reckoned with. But he contrived to nod\nwith an appearance of brusqueness.\nFully expecting official papers, signed and garnished with all the\npompous seals of a chartered metropolis, the guard was dazed to receive\ninstead a terrific left-handed foul to the pit of the stomach, and as\nhe reeled dizzily, retching and clawing for his gun, to find that gun\nno longer holstered but in the hand of the self-styled Poligerent,\npointing at its licensed owner.\n\"I think,\" Mury said quietly, flexing his left wrist with care the\nwhile his right held the gun steady, \"that you'd better come aboard\nwith us.\"\nThe guard was not more cowardly than the run of politically-appointed\ncivic guardsmen. But a flame gun kills more frightfully than the\nancient electric chair. He complied, grasping the railing with both\nhands as he stumbled before Mury up the gangway\u2014for he was still very\nsick indeed, wholly apart from his bewilderment, which was enormous.\nAbove, Ryd Randl waited in the lock, flattened against the curved\nwall, white and jittering. The inner door was shut, an impenetrable\ncountersunk mirror of metal.\n\"Cover him, Ryd,\" ordered Mury flatly. In obedience Ryd lugged out\nthe heavy flame pistol and pointed it; his finger was dangerously\ntremulous on the firing lever. He moistened his lips to voice his\nfears; but Mury, pocketing the other gun, threw the three-way switch on\nthe side panel, the switch that should have controlled the inner lock.\nNothing happened.\n\"Oh, God. We're caught. We're trapped!\" The outer gangway had slid up,\nthe lock wheezed shut, forming an impenetrable crypt of niosteel.\nMury smiled with supernal calm. \"We won't be here long,\" he said.\nThen, to quiet Ryd's fears, he went on: \"The central control panel and\nthe three local switches inside, between, and outside the locks are\non the circuit in that order. Unless the locks were closed from the\nswitch just beyond the inner lock, that lock will open when the central\ncontrol panel is cut out in preparation for lifting.\"\nAlmost as he paused and drew breath, a light sprang out over the switch\nhe had closed and the inner lock swung silently free of its gaskets.\nRyd felt a trembling relief; but Mury's voice lashed out like a whip as\nhe slipped cat-like into the passage.\n\"Keep him covered. Back out of the lock.\"\nRyd backed\u2014the white, tense face of the prisoner holding his own\nnervous gaze\u2014and, almost out of the lock, stumbled over the metal\npressure rings. And the gun was out of his unsure grip, clattering\nsomewhere near his slithering feet, as he started to fall.\nHe saw the guardsman hurl himself forward; then he was flung spinning,\nback against the engine-room door. In a flash, even as he struggled\nto keep on his feet, he saw the man in the airlock coming up from a\ncrouch, shifting the pistol in his right hand to reach its firing\nlever; he saw Mury sidestep swiftly and throw the master control switch\noutside.\nThe inner lock whooshed shut, barely missing Ryd. At the same instant,\nthe flame gun lighted locks and passage with one terrific flash, and a\nscorched, discolored spot appeared on the beveled metal of the opposite\nlock a foot from Mury's right shoulder.\n\"You damned clumsy little fool\u2014\" said Mury with soft intensity. Then,\nwhile the air around the metal walls still buzzed and snapped with\nblue sparks, he whirled and went up the control-room gangway in two\nquick bounds. Even as he went the flame gun thundered again in the\nstarboard airlock.\nMury was just in time, for the pilot had been about to flash \"Ready\" to\nthe Communications Tower when the explosions had given him pause. But\nthe latter and his two companions were neither ready nor armed; clamped\nin their seats at the controls, already marked, they were helpless in\nan instant before the leveled menace of the gun. And the imprisoned\nguardsman, having wasted most of his charges, was helpless, too, in his\nlittle cell of steel.\n\"It's been tried before,\" said one of the masked men. He had a blond,\nyouthful thatch and a smooth healthy face below the mask, together with\nan astrogator's triangled stars which made him\nex officio\nthe brains\nof the vessel. \"Stealing a ship\u2014it can't be done any more.\"\n\"It's been done again,\" said Mury grimly. \"And you don't know the half\nof it. But\u2014you will. I'll need you. As for your friends\u2014\" The gun\nmuzzle shifted slightly to indicate the pilot and the engineer. \"Out of\nthose clamps. You're going to ride this out in the portside airlock.\"\nHe had to repeat the command, in tones that snapped with menace, before\nthey started with fumbling, rebellious hands to strip their armor from\nthemselves. The burly engineer was muttering phrases of obscene fervor;\nthe weedy young pilot was wild-eyed. The blond astrogator, sitting\nstill masked and apparently unmoved, demanded:\n\"What do you think you're trying to do?\"\n\"What do\nyou\nthink?\" demanded Mury in return. \"I'm taking the ship\ninto space. On schedule and on course\u2014to meet the power shell.\" The\nflame gun moved with a jerk. \"And as for you\u2014what's your name?\"\n\"Yet Arliess.\"\n\"You want to make the trip alive, don't you, Yet Arliess?\"\nThe young astrogator stared at him and at the gun through masking\ngoggles; then he sank into his seat with a slow shudder. \"Why, yes,\" he\nsaid as if in wonder, \"I do.\"\nIII\nShahrazad\ndrove steadily forward into deep space, vibrating slightly\nto the tremendous thrust of her powerful engines. The small, cramped\ncabin was stiflingly hot to the three armored men who sat before its\nbanked dials, watching their steady needles.\nRyd had blacked out, darkness washing into his eyes and consciousness\ndraining from his head, as the space ship had pitched out into\nemptiness over the end of the runway on Pi Mesa and Mury had cut in the\nmaindrive. Pressure greater than anything he had ever felt had crushed\nhim; his voice had been snatched from his lips by those terrible forces\nand lost beneath the opening thunder of the three-inch tubes. Up and\nup, while the acceleration climbed to seven gravities\u2014and Ryd had lost\nevery sensation, not to regain them until Earth was dropping away under\nthe towship's keel.\nA single gravity held them back and down in the tilted seats, and the\ncontrol panels seemed to curve half above them, their banks of lights\nconfused with the stars coldly through the great nose window. In the\ncontrol room all sounds impinged on a background made up of the insect\nhum of air-purifiers, the almost supersonic whine of the fast-spinning\ngyroscopes somewhere behind them, the deep continuous growl of the\nengines.\nMury's voice broke through that steady murmur, coming from Ryd's right.\n\"You can unfasten your anticlamps, Ryd,\" he said dryly. \"That doesn't\nmean you,\" to the young navigator, on his other hand as he sat in\nthe pilot's seat with his pressure-clamps thrown back and his gloved\nhands free to caress the multiplex controls before him. Clipped to the\nsloping dash at his left elbow was a loaded flame gun.\nRyd emerged, with much bungling, from his padded clamps, and shook his\nhead groggily as he ran a hand through his slightly thinning hair. He\nventured shakily, \"Where are we?\"\nMury smiled slightly. \"Only our astrogator,\" he indicated Arliess,\nstill masked and fettered, \"can tell you that with precision. I\nunderstand only enough of astrogational practice to make sure that he\nis holding to the course outlined on the log. For that matter ... he\nis an intelligent young man and if he were not blinded by notions of\nduty to an outworn system.... We are now somewhere near the orbit of\nthe Moon. Isn't that right, Arliess?\"\nThe other did not seem to hear; he sat staring blindly before him\nthrough his goggles at the slowly-changing chart, where cryptic lights\nburned, some moving like glowing paramecia along fine-traced luminous\ntracks.\nMury too sat silent and immobile for a minute or more. Then, abruptly,\nhe inclined his universal chair far to the right, and his long frame\nseemed to tense oddly. His finger stabbed out one of the sparks of\nlight.\n\"What's that, Arliess?\"\nThe astrogator broke his silence. \"A ship.\"\n\"I know that well enough. What ship?\"\n\"I supposed you had examined the log. It would have told you that\nthat's the liner\nAlborak\n, out of Aeropolis with a diplomatic mission\nfor Mars.\"\nMury shook his head regretfully. \"That won't wash, Arliess. Even if you\nsuppose her off course, no liner aspace ever carried a tenth of that\ndrive.\"\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" said Arliess. But his voice\nwas raw and unsteady.\n\"I'm talking about this. That ship is a warship, and it's looking for\nus\u2014will intercept us inside of twenty minutes at the most!\"\n", "summary": "R, who are sent to Earth to destroy the life on the planet by the ship from Mars.

The\nshuttered glow of Burshis' Stumble Inn was only a few yards off to his\nright, but even that lodestone failed before the novel interest of a\nship about to ground in the one-time Port of Ten Thousand Ships.\nNow he made out the flicker of the braking drive a mile or so\noverhead, and presently soft motor thunder came down to blanket the\nalmost lightless city with sound. A beam swayed through the throbbing\ndarkness, caught the descending ship and held it, a small gleaming\nminnow slipping through the dark heavens. A faint glow rose from Pi\nMesa, where the spaceport lay above the city, as a runway lighted\nup\u2014draining the last reserves of the city's stored power, but draining\nthem gladly now that, in those autumn days of the historic year 819,\nrelief was in sight.\nRyd shrugged limply; the play was meaningless to him. He turned to\nshuffle down the inviting ramp into the glowing interior of Burshis'\ndive.\nThe place was crowded with men and smoke. Perhaps half the former were\nasleep, on tables or on the floor; but for the few places like Burshis'\nwhich were still open under the power shortage, many would have frozen,\nthese days, in the chilly nights at fourteen thousand feet. For\nDynamopolis sprawled atop the world, now as in the old days when it had\nbeen built to be the power center of North America.\nThe rocket blasts crescendoed and died up on Pi Mesa as Ryd wedged\nhimself with difficulty into the group along the bar. If anyone\nrecognized him, they showed it only by looking fixedly at something\nelse. Only Burshis Yuns kept his static smile and nodded with\nsurprising friendliness at Ryd's pinched, old-young face.\nRyd was startled by the nod. Burshis finished serving another customer\nand maneuvered down the stained chrome-and-synthyl bar. Ryd was\nheartened.\n\"Say, Burshis,\" he started nervously, as the bulky man halted with his\nback to him. But Burshis turned, still smiling, shaking his head so\nthat his jowls quivered.\n\"No loans,\" he said flatly. \"But just one on the house, Ryd.\"\nThe drink almost spilled itself in Ryd's hand. Clutching it\nconvulsively, he made his eyes narrow and said suspiciously, \"What you\nsetting 'em up for, Burshis? It's the first time since\u2014\"\nBurshis' smile stayed put. He said affably, \"Didn't you hear that ship\nthat just came down on the Mesa? That was the ship from Mars\u2014the\nescort they were sending with the power cylinder. The power's coming\nin again.\" He turned to greet a coin-tapping newcomer, added over his\nshoulder: \"You know what that means, Ryd. Some life around here again.\nJobs for all the bums in this town\u2014even for you.\"\nHe left Ryd frowning, thinking fuzzily. A warming gulp seemed to clear\nhis head. Jobs. So they thought they could put that over on him again,\nhuh? Well, he'd show them. He was smart; he was a damn good helio\nman\u2014no, that had been ten years ago. But now he was out of the habit\nof working, anyway. No job for Ryd Randl. They gave him one once and\nthen took it away. He drank still more deeply.\nThe man on Ryd's immediate right leaned toward him. He laid a hand on\nhis arm, gripping it hard, and said quietly: \"So you're Ryd Randl.\"\nRyd had a bad moment before he saw that the face wasn't that of any\nplain-clothes man he knew. For that matter, it didn't belong to anybody\nhe had ever known\u2014an odd, big-boned face, strikingly ugly, with a\nbeak-nose that was yet not too large for the hard jaw or too bleak for\nthe thin mouth below it. An expensive transparent hat slanted over the\nface, and from its iridescent shadows gleamed eyes that were alert and\nalmost frighteningly black. Ryd noted that the man wore a dark-gray\ncellotex of a sort rarely seen in joints like Burshis'.\n\"Suppose we step outside, Ryd. I'd like to talk to you.\"\n\"What's the idea?\" demanded Ryd, his small store of natural courage\nfloated to the top by alcohol.\nThe other seemed to realize that he was getting ahead of himself.\nHe leaned back slightly, drew a deep breath, and said slowly and\ndistinctly. \"Would you care to make some money, my friend?\"\n\"\nHuh?\nWhy, yeh\u2014I guess so\u2014\"\n\"Then come with me.\" The hand still on his arm was insistent. In his\ndaze, Ryd let himself be drawn away from the bar into the sluggish\ncrowd; then he suddenly remembered his unfinished drink, and made\nfrantic gestures. Deliberately misunderstanding, the tall stranger\nfumbled briefly, tossed a coin on the counter-top, and hustled Ryd out,\npast the blue-and-gold-lit\nmeloderge\nthat was softly pouring out its\nendlessly changing music, through the swinging doors into the dark.\nOutside, between lightless buildings, the still cold closed in on\nthem. They kept walking\u2014so fast that Ryd began to lose his breath,\nlong-accustomed though his lungs were to the high, thin air.\n\"So you're Ryd Randl,\" repeated the stranger after a moment's silence.\n\"I might have known you. But I'd almost given up finding you tonight.\"\nRyd tried feebly to wrench free, stumbled. \"Look,\" he gasped. \"If\nyou're a cop, say so!\"\nThe other laughed shortly. \"No. I'm just a man about to offer you a\nchance. For a come-back, Ryd\u2014a chance to live again.... My name\u2014you\ncan call me Mury.\"\nRyd was voiceless. Something seemed increasingly ominous about the\ntall, spare man at his side. He wished himself back in Burshis' with\nhis first free drink in a month. The thought of it brought tears to his\neyes.\n\"How long have you been out of a job, Ryd?\"\n\"Nine ... ten years. Say, what's it to you?\"\n\"And why, Ryd?\"\n\"Why...? Look, mister, I was a helio operator.\" He hunched his narrow\nshoulders and spread his hands in an habitual gesture of defeat. \"Damn\ngood one, too\u2014I was a foreman ten years ago. But I don't have the\nphysique for Mars\u2014I might just have made it\nthen\n, but I thought the\nplant was going to open again and\u2014\"\nAnd that was it. The almost airless Martian sky, with its burning\nactinic rays, is so favorable for the use of the helio-dynamic engine.\nAnd after the middle of the eighth century, robot labor gave Mars its\nfull economic independence\u2014and domination. For power is\u2014power; and\nthere is the Restriction Act to keep men on Earth even if more than two\nin ten could live healthily on the outer world.\n\"Ten years ago,\" Mury nodded as if satisfied. \"That must have been the\nPower Company of North America\u2014the main plant by Dynamopolis itself,\nthat shut down in December, 809. They were the last to close down\noutside the military bases in the Kun Lun.\"\nRyd was pacing beside him now. He felt a queer upsurge of confidence in\nthis strange man; for too long he had met no sympathy and all too few\nmen who talked his language. He burst out: \"They wouldn't take me, damn\nthem! Said my record wasn't good enough for them. That is, I didn't\nhave a drag with any of the Poligerents.\"\n\"I know all about your record,\" said Mury softly.\nRyd's suspicions came back abruptly, and he reverted to his old\nkicked-dog manner. \"How do you know? And what's it to you?\"\nAll at once, Mury came to a stop, and swung around to face him\nsquarely, hard eyes compelling. They were on an overpass, not far\nfrom where the vast, almost wholly deserted offices of the Triplanet\nFreighting Company sprawled over a square mile of city. A half-smile\ntwisted Mury's thin lips.\n\"Don't misunderstand me, Ryd\u2014you mean nothing at all to me as an\nindividual. But you're one of a vast mass of men for whom I am\nworking\u2014the billions caught in the net of a corrupt government and\nsold as an economic prey to the ruthless masters of Mars. This, after\nthey've borne all the hardships of a year of embargo, have offered\ntheir hands willingly to the rebuilding of decadent Earth, only to\nbe refused by the weak leaders who can neither defy the enemy nor\ncapitulate frankly to him.\"\nRyd was dazed. His mind had never been constructed to cope with such\nideas and the past few years had not improved its capabilities. \"Are\nyou talking about the power cylinder?\" he demanded blurrily.\nMury cast a glance toward the Milky Way as if to descry the Martian\ncargo projectile somewhere up among its countless lights. He said\nsimply, \"Yes.\"\n\"I don't get it,\" mumbled Ryd, frowning. He found words that he had\nheard somewhere a day or so before, in some bar or flophouse: \"The\npower cylinder is going to be the salvation of Earth. It's a shot in\nthe arm\u2014no, right in the heart of Earth industry, here in Dynamopolis.\nIt will turn the wheels and light the cities and\u2014\"\n\"To hell with that!\" snapped Mury, suddenly savage. His hands came up\nslightly, the fingers flexing; then dropped back to his sides. \"Don't\nyou know you're repeating damnable lies?\"\nRyd could only stare, cringing and bewildered. Mury went on with a\npassion shocking after his smooth calm:\n\"The power shell is aid, yes\u2014but with what a price! It's the thirty\npieces of silver for which the venal fools who rule our nations have\nsold the whole planet to Mars. Because they lack the courage and\nvision to retool Earth's plants and factories for the inescapable\nconflict, they're selling us out\u2014making Earth, the first home of man,\na colony of the Red Planet. Do you know what Earth is to the great\nMartian land-owners?\nDo you?\n\" He paused out of breath; then finished\nvenomously, \"Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper\nthan robots\u2014cheap as\nslaves\n!\"\n\"What about it?\" gulped Ryd, drawing away from the fanatic. \"What you\nwant\nme\nto do about it?\"\nMury took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders. His face was\nonce more bleakly impassive; only the mouth was an ugly line. \"We're\ngoing to do something about it, you and I. Tonight. Now.\"\nRyd was nearly sober. And wholly terrified. He got out chokingly,\n\"What's that mean?\"\n\"The power shell\u2014isn't coming in as planned.\"\n\"You can't do that.\"\n\"\nWe\ncan,\" said Mury with a heavy accent on the first word. \"And there\nare fifty thousand credits in it for you, Ryd. Are you with us?\"\nSuspicion was chill reality now in Ryd's mind. And he knew one thing\ncertainly\u2014if he refused now to accompany Mury, he would be killed, by\nthis man or another of his kind. For the secret power known only as\nWe\nnever took chances. Whispered-of, terrible, and world-embracing,\ndesperate upshot of the times in its principles of dynamitism, war, and\npanclasm\u2014that was\nWe\n.\nThe question hung in the air for a long moment. Then Ryd, with\nan effort, said, \"Sure.\" A moment later it struck him that the\nmonosyllabic assent was suspicious; he added quickly, \"I got nothing to\nlose, see?\" It was, he realized, the cold truth.\n\"You won't lose,\" said Mury. He seemed to relax. But the menace with\nwhich he had clothed himself clung, as he turned back on the way they\nhad come.\nRyd followed dog-like, his feet in their worn shoes moving without his\nvolition. He was frightened. Out of his very fright came a longing to\nplacate Mury, assure him that he, Ryd, was on the same side whatever\nhappened....\nAfter some steps he stole a sidelong glance at his tall companion, and\nwhined, \"Where ... where we going now?\"\nMury paused in his long stride, removed a hand from a pocket of the\ngray topcoat that wrapped him as in somber thoughts. Wordlessly, he\npointed as Ryd had known he would\u2014toward where a pale man-made dawn\nseemed breaking over Pi Mesa.\nII\n\"One blow for freedom!\" said Mury with caught breath. His voice fell\nupon air scarcely stilled since the sodden thump of the blow that had\nkilled the guard.\nThe body lay between them, face down on the graveled way in the inky\nmoon-shadow. On one side Pi Mesa stretched away two hundred yards to\ndrop sharply into the night; on the other was the unlighted mass of the\nlong, continuous, low buildings that housed now unused fuel pumps and\nservicing equipment. Looking down at the dead huddle at his feet, a\nlittle stunned by the reality of this, Ryd knew that he was in it now.\nHe was caught in the machinery.\nMury hefted the length of steel in his hand once more, as if testing\nthe weight that had crushed a man's skull so easily. Then, with a short\nwrist-flip, he sent it flying into the dried weeds which had over-grown\nthe aero field on the mesa's rim during the summer months after State\norder had grounded all fliers in America.\n\"All right, Ryd,\" he said coolly. \"Trade clothes with this fellow. I've\nbrought you this far\u2014you're taking me the rest of the way.\"\nThe rest of the way.\nRyd was still panting, and his side was paining from the strenuous\nexertion of the long climb up the side of the mountain, far from the\nguarded highway. His fingers, numbed by the cold of the high, thin air,\nshook as he knelt and fumbled with the zippers of the dead guard's\nuniform. The belted gun, however, was heavy and oddly comforting as\nhe clumsily buckled it about his hips. He knew enough of weapons\nto recognize this as, not the usual paralyzer, but a flame pistol,\npowerful and deadly. He let his hand linger on its butt; then strong\nfingers tightened on his bony wrist, and he looked up with a start into\nthe sardonic black eyes of the Panclast.\n\"No use now for firearms,\" said Mury. \"All the guns we could carry\nwouldn't help us if we were caught out there. That gun is just a\nstage property for the little play we're going to give in about three\nminutes\u2014when you'll act a guardsman escorting me, a Poligerent of\nDynamopolis, aboard the towship\nShahrazad\n.\"\nFor a moment Ryd felt relief\u2014he had hazily imagined that Mury's hatred\nof Mars and all things Martian might have led him to try to sabotage\nthe Martian warship which lay somewhere on the runways beyond the long,\nlow buildings, and which would be closely guarded. But the towship\nwould also be guarded ... he shivered in the cold, dry night air.\nMury had melted into the shadow a few yards away. There was a light\nscraping, then a green flame sputtered, briefly lighting up his hands\nand face, and narrowing at once to a thin, singing needle of light.\nHe had turned a pocket electron torch against the lock-mechanism of a\nsmall, disused metal door.\nRyd watched in painful suspense. There was no sound in his ears save\nfor the hard, dry shrilling of the ray as it bit into the steel. It\nseemed to be crying:\nrun, run\n\u2014but he remembered the power that knew\nhow to punish better than the law, and stood still, shivering.\nThe lock gave way and the door slipped aside. A light went on inside,\nand Ryd's heart stopped, backfired, and started again, raggedly. The\nsame automatic mechanism that had turned the lights on had started the\nair-fresher, which picked up speed with a soft whine, sweeping out the\nlong-stale atmosphere. Mury motioned to Ryd to follow him in.\nIt was still musty in the narrow passage, between the closely-pressing\nwalls, beneath the great tubes and cable sheathings that fluted the\nceiling overhead. A stairway spiraled up on the right to the control\ncupola somewhere overhead; even in the airtight gallery a thin film\nof dust lay on every step. Up there were the meters and switches of\nthe disused terminal facilities of the spaceport; beyond the metal\ndoor marked CAUTION, just beyond the stairwell, lay the long runway\ndown which the ships of space had glided to be serviced, refueled, and\nlaunched into the sky once more by now dormant machines.\n\"Wait,\" said Mury succinctly; he vanished up the spiral stair, his\nlong legs taking two steps at a time. After an aching minute's silence,\nhe was back. All was clear as seen from the turret-windows overhead.\nThey emerged in shadow, hugging the wall. Almost a quarter of a mile to\nthe right the megalith of the Communications Tower, crowned with many\nlights where the signal-men sat godlike in its summit. Its floodlights\nshed a vast oval of light out over the mesa, where the mile-long\nrunways\u2014no longer polished mirror-like as in the days of Dynamopolis'\nglory\u2014stretched away into the darkness of the table land. A handful\nof odd ships\u2014mere remnant of the hundreds that Pi Mesa port had\nberthed\u2014huddled under the solenoid wickets, as if driven together by\nthe chill of the thin, knife-like wind that blew across the mesa.\nAs the two paced slowly across the runways, Ryd had a sense of\nprotective isolation in the vast impersonality of the spaceport.\nSurely, in this Titanic desolation of metal slabs and flat-roofed\nbuildings, dominated by the one great tower, total insignificance must\nmean safety for them.\nAnd indeed no guard challenged them. There were armed men watching\nfor all intruders out on the desert beyond the runways, but once\ninside, Ryd's borrowed blue seemed to serve as passport enough.\nNonetheless, the passport's knees were shaking when they stood at last,\ninconspicuous still, at the shadowed base of the Communications Tower.\nNot far off, a half-dozen dignitaries, huddled close together in the\nmidst of these Cyclopean man-made things that dwarfed their policies,\ntheir principles and ambitions, stood talking rather nervously with two\nofficers, aristocratically gaudy in the scarlet of the Martian Fleet.\nBlue-clad guardsmen of Earth watched from a distance\u2014watched boredly\nenough.\nAnd out on the steel-stripped tarmac, under the solenoid of Number\nTwo Runway, lay a towship, backed like a stegosaur with its massive\nmagnets\u2014the\nShahrazad\n, panting like a dragon amid rolling clouds of\nsteam. She was plainly ready to go into space. The bottom dropped out\nof Ryd's stomach before he realized that a warning at least must be\nsounded before the ship could lift. But that might come any moment now.\n\"Relax,\" said Mury in a low voice. \"Nothing's gone wrong. We'll be\naboard the\nShahrazad\nwhen she lifts.\" For a moment his black eyes\nshifted, hardening, toward Runway Four. The Martian warship lay there\nbeyond the solenoid, a spiteful hundred-foot swordfish of steel, with\nblind gunvalves, row on row, along its sleek sides and turret-blisters.\nIt had not yet been tugged onto the turntable; it could not be leaving\nagain very soon, though Earth weight was undoubtedly incommoding\nits crew. About it a few figures stood that were stiffly erect and\nimmobile, as tall as tall men. From head to toe they were scarlet.\n\"Robots!\" gasped Ryd, clutching his companion's arm convulsively.\n\"Martian soldier robots!\"\n\"They're unarmed, harmless. They aren't your police with built-in\nweapons. Only the humans are dangerous. But we've got to move. For\nGod's sake, take it easy.\"\nRyd licked dry lips. \"Are we going\u2014out into space?\"\n\"Where else?\" said Mury.\nThe official-looking individual in the expensive topcoat and sport hat\nhad reached the starboard airlock of the towship before anyone thought\nto question his authorization, escorted as he was by a blue-uniformed\nguardsman. When another sentry, pacing between runways a hundred yards\nfrom the squat space vessel, paused to wonder, it was\u2014as it came\nabout\u2014just a little too late.\nThe guard turned and swung briskly off to intercept the oddly-behaving\npair, hand crowding the butt of his pistol, for he was growing\nuneasy. His alarm mounted rapidly, till he nearly sprained an ankle\nin sprinting across the last of the two intervening runways, between\nthe solenoid wickets. Those metal arches, crowding one on the other\nin perspective, formed a tunnel that effectively shielded the\nShahrazad's\nairlocks from more distant view; the gang of notables\nattracted by the occasion was already being shepherded back to safety\nby the Communications guards, whose attention was thus well taken up.\nThe slight man in guardsman's blue glanced over his shoulder and\nvanished abruptly into the circular lock. His companion wheeled on the\ntopmost step, looking down with some irritation on his unhandsome face,\nbut with no apparent doubt of his command of the situation.\n\"Yes?\" he inquired frostily.\n\"What goes on here?\" snapped the guard, frowning at the tall figure\nsilhouetted against the glow in the airlock. \"The crew's signaled all\naboard and the ship lifts in two minutes. You ought to be\u2014\"\n\"I am Semul Mury, Poligerent for the City of Dynamopolis,\" interrupted\nthe tall man with asperity. \"The City is naturally interested in the\ndelivery of the power which will revivify our industries.\" He paused,\nsighed, shifting his weight to the next lower step of the gangway. \"I\nsuppose you'll want to re-check my credentials?\"\nThe guard was somewhat confused; a Poligerent, in ninth-century\nbureaucracy, was a force to be reckoned with. But he contrived to nod\nwith an appearance of brusqueness.\nFully expecting official papers, signed and garnished with all the\npompous seals of a chartered metropolis, the guard was dazed to receive\ninstead a terrific left-handed foul to the pit of the stomach, and as\nhe reeled dizzily, retching and clawing for his gun, to find that gun\nno longer holstered but in the hand of the self-styled Poligerent,\npointing at its licensed owner.\n\"I think,\" Mury said quietly, flexing his left wrist with care the\nwhile his right held the gun steady, \"that you'd better come aboard\nwith us.\"\nThe guard was not more cowardly than the run of politically-appointed\ncivic guardsmen. But a flame gun kills more frightfully than the\nancient electric chair. He complied, grasping the railing with both\nhands as he stumbled before Mury up the gangway\u2014for he was still very\nsick indeed, wholly apart from his bewilderment, which was enormous.\nAbove, Ryd Randl waited in the lock, flattened against the curved\nwall, white and jittering. The inner door was shut, an impenetrable\ncountersunk mirror of metal.\n\"Cover him, Ryd,\" ordered Mury flatly. In obedience Ryd lugged out\nthe heavy flame pistol and pointed it; his finger was dangerously\ntremulous on the firing lever. He moistened his lips to voice his\nfears; but Mury, pocketing the other gun, threw the three-way switch on\nthe side panel, the switch that should have controlled the inner lock.\nNothing happened.\n\"Oh, God. We're caught. We're trapped!\" The outer gangway had slid up,\nthe lock wheezed shut, forming an impenetrable crypt of niosteel.\nMury smiled with supernal calm. \"We won't be here long,\" he said.\nThen, to quiet Ryd's fears, he went on: \"The central control panel and\nthe three local switches inside, between, and outside the locks are\non the circuit in that order. Unless the locks were closed from the\nswitch just beyond the inner lock, that lock will open when the central\ncontrol panel is cut out in preparation for lifting.\"\nAlmost as he paused and drew breath, a light sprang out over the switch\nhe had closed and the inner lock swung silently free of its gaskets.\nRyd felt a trembling relief; but Mury's voice lashed out like a whip as\nhe slipped cat-like into the passage.\n\"Keep him covered. Back out of the lock.\"\nRyd backed\u2014the white, tense face of the prisoner holding his own\nnervous gaze\u2014and, almost out of the lock, stumbled over the metal\npressure rings. And the gun was out of his unsure grip, clattering\nsomewhere near his slithering feet, as he started to fall.\nHe saw the guardsman hurl himself forward; then he was flung spinning,\nback against the engine-room door. In a flash, even as he struggled\nto keep on his feet, he saw the man in the airlock coming up from a\ncrouch, shifting the pistol in his right hand to reach its firing\nlever; he saw Mury sidestep swiftly and throw the master control switch\noutside.\nThe inner lock whooshed shut, barely missing Ryd. At the same instant,\nthe flame gun lighted locks and passage with one terrific flash, and a\nscorched, discolored spot appeared on the beveled metal of the opposite\nlock a foot from Mury's right shoulder.\n\"You damned clumsy little fool\u2014\" said Mury with soft intensity. Then,\nwhile the air around the metal walls still buzzed and snapped with\nblue sparks, he whirled and went up the control-room gangway in two\nquick bounds. Even as he went the flame gun thundered again in the\nstarboard airlock.\nMury was just in time, for the pilot had been about to flash \"Ready\" to\nthe Communications Tower when the explosions had given him pause. But\nthe latter and his two companions were neither ready nor armed; clamped\nin their seats at the controls, already marked, they were helpless in\nan instant before the leveled menace of the gun. And the imprisoned\nguardsman, having wasted most of his charges, was helpless, too, in his\nlittle cell of steel.\n\"It's been tried before,\" said one of the masked men. He had a blond,\nyouthful thatch and a smooth healthy face below the mask, together with\nan astrogator's triangled stars which made him\nex officio\nthe brains\nof the vessel. \"Stealing a ship\u2014it can't be done any more.\"\n\"It's been done again,\" said Mury grimly. \"And you don't know the half\nof it. But\u2014you will. I'll need you. As for your friends\u2014\" The gun\nmuzzle shifted slightly to indicate the pilot and the engineer. \"Out of\nthose clamps. You're going to ride this out in the portside airlock.\"\nHe had to repeat the command, in tones that snapped with menace, before\nthey started with fumbling, rebellious hands to strip their armor from\nthemselves. The burly engineer was muttering phrases of obscene fervor;\nthe weedy young pilot was wild-eyed. The blond astrogator, sitting\nstill masked and apparently unmoved, demanded:\n\"What do you think you're trying to do?\"\n\"What do\nyou\nthink?\" demanded Mury in return. \"I'm taking the ship\ninto space. On schedule and on course\u2014to meet the power shell.\" The\nflame gun moved with a jerk. \"And as for you\u2014what's your name?\"\n\"Yet Arliess.\"\n\"You want to make the trip alive, don't you, Yet Arliess?\"\nThe young astrogator stared at him and at the gun through masking\ngoggles; then he sank into his seat with a slow shudder. \"Why, yes,\" he\nsaid as if in wonder, \"I do.\"\nIII\nShahrazad\ndrove steadily forward into deep space, vibrating slightly\nto the tremendous thrust of her powerful engines. The small, cramped\ncabin was stiflingly hot to the three armored men who sat before its\nbanked dials, watching their steady needles.\nRyd had blacked out, darkness washing into his eyes and consciousness\ndraining from his head, as the space ship had pitched out into\nemptiness over the end of the runway on Pi Mesa and Mury had cut in the\nmaindrive. Pressure greater than anything he had ever felt had crushed\nhim; his voice had been snatched from his lips by those terrible forces\nand lost beneath the opening thunder of the three-inch tubes. Up and\nup, while the acceleration climbed to seven gravities\u2014and Ryd had lost\nevery sensation, not to regain them until Earth was dropping away under\nthe towship's keel.\nA single gravity held them back and down in the tilted seats, and the\ncontrol panels seemed to curve half above them, their banks of lights\nconfused with the stars coldly through the great nose window. In the\ncontrol room all sounds impinged on a background made up of the insect\nhum of air-purifiers, the almost supersonic whine of the fast-spinning\ngyroscopes somewhere behind them, the deep continuous growl of the\nengines.\nMury's voice broke through that steady murmur, coming from Ryd's right.\n\"You can unfasten your anticlamps, Ryd,\" he said dryly. \"That doesn't\nmean you,\" to the young navigator, on his other hand as he sat in\nthe pilot's seat with his pressure-clamps thrown back and his gloved\nhands free to caress the multiplex controls before him. Clipped to the\nsloping dash at his left elbow was a loaded flame gun.\nRyd emerged, with much bungling, from his padded clamps, and shook his\nhead groggily as he ran a hand through his slightly thinning hair. He\nventured shakily, \"Where are we?\"\nMury smiled slightly. \"Only our astrogator,\" he indicated Arliess,\nstill masked and fettered, \"can tell you that with precision. I\nunderstand only enough of astrogational practice to make sure that he\nis holding to the course outlined on the log. For that matter ... he\nis an intelligent young man and if he were not blinded by notions of\nduty to an outworn system.... We are now somewhere near the orbit of\nthe Moon. Isn't that right, Arliess?\"\nThe other did not seem to hear; he sat staring blindly before him\nthrough his goggles at the slowly-changing chart, where cryptic lights\nburned, some moving like glowing paramecia along fine-traced luminous\ntracks.\nMury too sat silent and immobile for a minute or more. Then, abruptly,\nhe inclined his universal chair far to the right, and his long frame\nseemed to tense oddly. His finger stabbed out one of the sparks of\nlight.\n\"What's that, Arliess?\"\nThe astrogator broke his silence. \"A ship.\"\n\"I know that well enough. What ship?\"\n\"I supposed you had examined the log. It would have told you that\nthat's the liner\nAlborak\n, out of Aeropolis with a diplomatic mission\nfor Mars.\"\nMury shook his head regretfully. \"That won't wash, Arliess. Even if you\nsuppose her off course, no liner aspace ever carried a tenth of that\ndrive.\"\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" said Arliess. But his voice\nwas raw and unsteady.\n\"I'm talking about this. That ship is a warship, and it's looking for\nus\u2014will intercept us inside of twenty minutes at the most!\"\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nSaboteur of Space\nBy ROBERT ABERNATHY\nFresh power was coming to Earth, energy\nwhich would bring life to a dying planet.\nOnly two men stood in its way, one a cowardly\nrat, the other a murderous martyr; both pawns\nin a cosmic game where death moved his chessmen\nof fate\u2014and even the winner would lose.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Spring 1944.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nRyd Randl stood, slouching a little, in the darkened footway, and\nwatched the sky over Dynamopolis come alive with searchlights. The\nshuttered glow of Burshis' Stumble Inn was only a few yards off to his\nright, but even that lodestone failed before the novel interest of a\nship about to ground in the one-time Port of Ten Thousand Ships.\nNow he made out the flicker of the braking drive a mile or so\noverhead, and presently soft motor thunder came down to blanket the\nalmost lightless city with sound. A beam swayed through the throbbing\ndarkness, caught the descending ship and held it, a small gleaming\nminnow slipping through the dark heavens. A faint glow rose from Pi\nMesa, where the spaceport lay above the city, as a runway lighted\nup\u2014draining the last reserves of the city's stored power, but draining\nthem gladly now that, in those autumn days of the historic year 819,\nrelief was in sight.\nRyd shrugged limply; the play was meaningless to him. He turned to\nshuffle down the inviting ramp into the glowing interior of Burshis'\ndive.\nThe place was crowded with men and smoke. Perhaps half the former were\nasleep, on tables or on the floor; but for the few places like Burshis'\nwhich were still open under the power shortage, many would have frozen,\nthese days, in the chilly nights at fourteen thousand feet. For\nDynamopolis sprawled atop the world, now as in the old days when it had\nbeen built to be the power center of North America.\nThe rocket blasts crescendoed and died up on Pi Mesa as Ryd wedged\nhimself with difficulty into the group along the bar. If anyone\nrecognized him, they showed it only by looking fixedly at something\nelse. Only Burshis Yuns kept his static smile and nodded with\nsurprising friendliness at Ryd's pinched, old-young face.\nRyd was startled by the nod. Burshis finished serving another customer\nand maneuvered down the stained chrome-and-synthyl bar. Ryd was\nheartened.\n\"Say, Burshis,\" he started nervously, as the bulky man halted with his\nback to him. But Burshis turned, still smiling, shaking his head so\nthat his jowls quivered.\n\"No loans,\" he said flatly. \"But just one on the house, Ryd.\"\nThe drink almost spilled itself in Ryd's hand. Clutching it\nconvulsively, he made his eyes narrow and said suspiciously, \"What you\nsetting 'em up for, Burshis? It's the first time since\u2014\"\nBurshis' smile stayed put. He said affably, \"Didn't you hear that ship\nthat just came down on the Mesa? That was the ship from Mars\u2014the\nescort they were sending with the power cylinder. The power's coming\nin again.\" He turned to greet a coin-tapping newcomer, added over his\nshoulder: \"You know what that means, Ryd. Some life around here again.\nJobs for all the bums in this town\u2014even for you.\"\nHe left Ryd frowning, thinking fuzzily. A warming gulp seemed to clear\nhis head. Jobs. So they thought they could put that over on him again,\nhuh? Well, he'd show them. He was smart; he was a damn good helio\nman\u2014no, that had been ten years ago. But now he was out of the habit\nof working, anyway. No job for Ryd Randl. They gave him one once and\nthen took it away. He drank still more deeply.\nThe man on Ryd's immediate right leaned toward him. He laid a hand on\nhis arm, gripping it hard, and said quietly: \"So you're Ryd Randl.\"\nRyd had a bad moment before he saw that the face wasn't that of any\nplain-clothes man he knew. For that matter, it didn't belong to anybody\nhe had ever known\u2014an odd, big-boned face, strikingly ugly, with a\nbeak-nose that was yet not too large for the hard jaw or too bleak for\nthe thin mouth below it. An expensive transparent hat slanted over the\nface, and from its iridescent shadows gleamed eyes that were alert and\nalmost frighteningly black. Ryd noted that the man wore a dark-gray\ncellotex of a sort rarely seen in joints like Burshis'.\n\"Suppose we step outside, Ryd. I'd like to talk to you.\"\n\"What's the idea?\" demanded Ryd, his small store of natural courage\nfloated to the top by alcohol.\nThe other seemed to realize that he was getting ahead of himself.\nHe leaned back slightly, drew a deep breath, and said slowly and\ndistinctly. \"Would you care to make some money, my friend?\"\n\"\nHuh?\nWhy, yeh\u2014I guess so\u2014\"\n\"Then come with me.\" The hand still on his arm was insistent. In his\ndaze, Ryd let himself be drawn away from the bar into the sluggish\ncrowd; then he suddenly remembered his unfinished drink, and made\nfrantic gestures. Deliberately misunderstanding, the tall stranger\nfumbled briefly, tossed a coin on the counter-top, and hustled Ryd out,\npast the blue-and-gold-lit\nmeloderge\nthat was softly pouring out its\nendlessly changing music, through the swinging doors into the dark.\nOutside, between lightless buildings, the still cold closed in on\nthem. They kept walking\u2014so fast that Ryd began to lose his breath,\nlong-accustomed though his lungs were to the high, thin air.\n\"So you're Ryd Randl,\" repeated the stranger after a moment's silence.\n\"I might have known you. But I'd almost given up finding you tonight.\"\nRyd tried feebly to wrench free, stumbled. \"Look,\" he gasped. \"If\nyou're a cop, say so!\"\nThe other laughed shortly. \"No. I'm just a man about to offer you a\nchance. For a come-back, Ryd\u2014a chance to live again.... My name\u2014you\ncan call me Mury.\"\nRyd was voiceless. Something seemed increasingly ominous about the\ntall, spare man at his side. He wished himself back in Burshis' with\nhis first free drink in a month. The thought of it brought tears to his\neyes.\n\"How long have you been out of a job, Ryd?\"\n\"Nine ... ten years. Say, what's it to you?\"\n\"And why, Ryd?\"\n\"Why...? Look, mister, I was a helio operator.\" He hunched his narrow\nshoulders and spread his hands in an habitual gesture of defeat. \"Damn\ngood one, too\u2014I was a foreman ten years ago. But I don't have the\nphysique for Mars\u2014I might just have made it\nthen\n, but I thought the\nplant was going to open again and\u2014\"\nAnd that was it. The almost airless Martian sky, with its burning\nactinic rays, is so favorable for the use of the helio-dynamic engine.\nAnd after the middle of the eighth century, robot labor gave Mars its\nfull economic independence\u2014and domination. For power is\u2014power; and\nthere is the Restriction Act to keep men on Earth even if more than two\nin ten could live healthily on the outer world.\n\"Ten years ago,\" Mury nodded as if satisfied. \"That must have been the\nPower Company of North America\u2014the main plant by Dynamopolis itself,\nthat shut down in December, 809. They were the last to close down\noutside the military bases in the Kun Lun.\"\nRyd was pacing beside him now. He felt a queer upsurge of confidence in\nthis strange man; for too long he had met no sympathy and all too few\nmen who talked his language. He burst out: \"They wouldn't take me, damn\nthem! Said my record wasn't good enough for them. That is, I didn't\nhave a drag with any of the Poligerents.\"\n\"I know all about your record,\" said Mury softly.\nRyd's suspicions came back abruptly, and he reverted to his old\nkicked-dog manner. \"How do you know? And what's it to you?\"\nAll at once, Mury came to a stop, and swung around to face him\nsquarely, hard eyes compelling. They were on an overpass, not far\nfrom where the vast, almost wholly deserted offices of the Triplanet\nFreighting Company sprawled over a square mile of city. A half-smile\ntwisted Mury's thin lips.\n\"Don't misunderstand me, Ryd\u2014you mean nothing at all to me as an\nindividual. But you're one of a vast mass of men for whom I am\nworking\u2014the billions caught in the net of a corrupt government and\nsold as an economic prey to the ruthless masters of Mars. This, after\nthey've borne all the hardships of a year of embargo, have offered\ntheir hands willingly to the rebuilding of decadent Earth, only to\nbe refused by the weak leaders who can neither defy the enemy nor\ncapitulate frankly to him.\"\nRyd was dazed. His mind had never been constructed to cope with such\nideas and the past few years had not improved its capabilities. \"Are\nyou talking about the power cylinder?\" he demanded blurrily.\nMury cast a glance toward the Milky Way as if to descry the Martian\ncargo projectile somewhere up among its countless lights. He said\nsimply, \"Yes.\"\n\"I don't get it,\" mumbled Ryd, frowning. He found words that he had\nheard somewhere a day or so before, in some bar or flophouse: \"The\npower cylinder is going to be the salvation of Earth. It's a shot in\nthe arm\u2014no, right in the heart of Earth industry, here in Dynamopolis.\nIt will turn the wheels and light the cities and\u2014\"\n\"To hell with that!\" snapped Mury, suddenly savage. His hands came up\nslightly, the fingers flexing; then dropped back to his sides. \"Don't\nyou know you're repeating damnable lies?\"\nRyd could only stare, cringing and bewildered. Mury went on with a\npassion shocking after his smooth calm:\n\"The power shell is aid, yes\u2014but with what a price! It's the thirty\npieces of silver for which the venal fools who rule our nations have\nsold the whole planet to Mars. Because they lack the courage and\nvision to retool Earth's plants and factories for the inescapable\nconflict, they're selling us out\u2014making Earth, the first home of man,\na colony of the Red Planet. Do you know what Earth is to the great\nMartian land-owners?\nDo you?\n\" He paused out of breath; then finished\nvenomously, \"Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper\nthan robots\u2014cheap as\nslaves\n!\"\n\"What about it?\" gulped Ryd, drawing away from the fanatic. \"What you\nwant\nme\nto do about it?\"\nMury took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders. His face was\nonce more bleakly impassive; only the mouth was an ugly line. \"We're\ngoing to do something about it, you and I. Tonight. Now.\"\nRyd was nearly sober. And wholly terrified. He got out chokingly,\n\"What's that mean?\"\n\"The power shell\u2014isn't coming in as planned.\"\n\"You can't do that.\"\n\"\nWe\ncan,\" said Mury with a heavy accent on the first word. \"And there\nare fifty thousand credits in it for you, Ryd. Are you with us?\"\nSuspicion was chill reality now in Ryd's mind. And he knew one thing\ncertainly\u2014if he refused now to accompany Mury, he would be killed, by\nthis man or another of his kind. For the secret power known only as\nWe\nnever took chances. Whispered-of, terrible, and world-embracing,\ndesperate upshot of the times in its principles of dynamitism, war, and\npanclasm\u2014that was\nWe\n.\nThe question hung in the air for a long moment. Then Ryd, with\nan effort, said, \"Sure.\" A moment later it struck him that the\nmonosyllabic assent was suspicious; he added quickly, \"I got nothing to\nlose, see?\" It was, he realized, the cold truth.\n\"You won't lose,\" said Mury. He seemed to relax. But the menace with\nwhich he had clothed himself clung, as he turned back on the way they\nhad come.\nRyd followed dog-like, his feet in their worn shoes moving without his\nvolition. He was frightened. Out of his very fright came a longing to\nplacate Mury, assure him that he, Ryd, was on the same side whatever\nhappened....\nAfter some steps he stole a sidelong glance at his tall companion, and\nwhined, \"Where ... where we going now?\"\nMury paused in his long stride, removed a hand from a pocket of the\ngray topcoat that wrapped him as in somber thoughts. Wordlessly, he\npointed as Ryd had known he would\u2014toward where a pale man-made dawn\nseemed breaking over Pi Mesa.\nII\n\"One blow for freedom!\" said Mury with caught breath. His voice fell\nupon air scarcely stilled since the sodden thump of the blow that had\nkilled the guard.\nThe body lay between them, face down on the graveled way in the inky\nmoon-shadow. On one side Pi Mesa stretched away two hundred yards to\ndrop sharply into the night; on the other was the unlighted mass of the\nlong, continuous, low buildings that housed now unused fuel pumps and\nservicing equipment. Looking down at the dead huddle at his feet, a\nlittle stunned by the reality of this, Ryd knew that he was in it now.\nHe was caught in the machinery.\nMury hefted the length of steel in his hand once more, as if testing\nthe weight that had crushed a man's skull so easily. Then, with a short\nwrist-flip, he sent it flying into the dried weeds which had over-grown\nthe aero field on the mesa's rim during the summer months after State\norder had grounded all fliers in America.\n\"All right, Ryd,\" he said coolly. \"Trade clothes with this fellow. I've\nbrought you this far\u2014you're taking me the rest of the way.\"\nThe rest of the way.\nRyd was still panting, and his side was paining from the strenuous\nexertion of the long climb up the side of the mountain, far from the\nguarded highway. His fingers, numbed by the cold of the high, thin air,\nshook as he knelt and fumbled with the zippers of the dead guard's\nuniform. The belted gun, however, was heavy and oddly comforting as\nhe clumsily buckled it about his hips. He knew enough of weapons\nto recognize this as, not the usual paralyzer, but a flame pistol,\npowerful and deadly. He let his hand linger on its butt; then strong\nfingers tightened on his bony wrist, and he looked up with a start into\nthe sardonic black eyes of the Panclast.\n\"No use now for firearms,\" said Mury. \"All the guns we could carry\nwouldn't help us if we were caught out there. That gun is just a\nstage property for the little play we're going to give in about three\nminutes\u2014when you'll act a guardsman escorting me, a Poligerent of\nDynamopolis, aboard the towship\nShahrazad\n.\"\nFor a moment Ryd felt relief\u2014he had hazily imagined that Mury's hatred\nof Mars and all things Martian might have led him to try to sabotage\nthe Martian warship which lay somewhere on the runways beyond the long,\nlow buildings, and which would be closely guarded. But the towship\nwould also be guarded ... he shivered in the cold, dry night air.\nMury had melted into the shadow a few yards away. There was a light\nscraping, then a green flame sputtered, briefly lighting up his hands\nand face, and narrowing at once to a thin, singing needle of light.\nHe had turned a pocket electron torch against the lock-mechanism of a\nsmall, disused metal door.\nRyd watched in painful suspense. There was no sound in his ears save\nfor the hard, dry shrilling of the ray as it bit into the steel. It\nseemed to be crying:\nrun, run\n\u2014but he remembered the power that knew\nhow to punish better than the law, and stood still, shivering.\nThe lock gave way and the door slipped aside. A light went on inside,\nand Ryd's heart stopped, backfired, and started again, raggedly. The\nsame automatic mechanism that had turned the lights on had started the\nair-fresher, which picked up speed with a soft whine, sweeping out the\nlong-stale atmosphere. Mury motioned to Ryd to follow him in.\nIt was still musty in the narrow passage, between the closely-pressing\nwalls, beneath the great tubes and cable sheathings that fluted the\nceiling overhead. A stairway spiraled up on the right to the control\ncupola somewhere overhead; even in the airtight gallery a thin film\nof dust lay on every step. Up there were the meters and switches of\nthe disused terminal facilities of the spaceport; beyond the metal\ndoor marked CAUTION, just beyond the stairwell, lay the long runway\ndown which the ships of space had glided to be serviced, refueled, and\nlaunched into the sky once more by now dormant machines.\n\"Wait,\" said Mury succinctly; he vanished up the spiral stair, his\nlong legs taking two steps at a time. After an aching minute's silence,\nhe was back. All was clear as seen from the turret-windows overhead.\nThey emerged in shadow, hugging the wall. Almost a quarter of a mile to\nthe right the megalith of the Communications Tower, crowned with many\nlights where the signal-men sat godlike in its summit. Its floodlights\nshed a vast oval of light out over the mesa, where the mile-long\nrunways\u2014no longer polished mirror-like as in the days of Dynamopolis'\nglory\u2014stretched away into the darkness of the table land. A handful\nof odd ships\u2014mere remnant of the hundreds that Pi Mesa port had\nberthed\u2014huddled under the solenoid wickets, as if driven together by\nthe chill of the thin, knife-like wind that blew across the mesa.\nAs the two paced slowly across the runways, Ryd had a sense of\nprotective isolation in the vast impersonality of the spaceport.\nSurely, in this Titanic desolation of metal slabs and flat-roofed\nbuildings, dominated by the one great tower, total insignificance must\nmean safety for them.\nAnd indeed no guard challenged them. There were armed men watching\nfor all intruders out on the desert beyond the runways, but once\ninside, Ryd's borrowed blue seemed to serve as passport enough.\nNonetheless, the passport's knees were shaking when they stood at last,\ninconspicuous still, at the shadowed base of the Communications Tower.\nNot far off, a half-dozen dignitaries, huddled close together in the\nmidst of these Cyclopean man-made things that dwarfed their policies,\ntheir principles and ambitions, stood talking rather nervously with two\nofficers, aristocratically gaudy in the scarlet of the Martian Fleet.\nBlue-clad guardsmen of Earth watched from a distance\u2014watched boredly\nenough.\nAnd out on the steel-stripped tarmac, under the solenoid of Number\nTwo Runway, lay a towship, backed like a stegosaur with its massive\nmagnets\u2014the\nShahrazad\n, panting like a dragon amid rolling clouds of\nsteam. She was plainly ready to go into space. The bottom dropped out\nof Ryd's stomach before he realized that a warning at least must be\nsounded before the ship could lift. But that might come any moment now.\n\"Relax,\" said Mury in a low voice. \"Nothing's gone wrong. We'll be\naboard the\nShahrazad\nwhen she lifts.\" For a moment his black eyes\nshifted, hardening, toward Runway Four. The Martian warship lay there\nbeyond the solenoid, a spiteful hundred-foot swordfish of steel, with\nblind gunvalves, row on row, along its sleek sides and turret-blisters.\nIt had not yet been tugged onto the turntable; it could not be leaving\nagain very soon, though Earth weight was undoubtedly incommoding\nits crew. About it a few figures stood that were stiffly erect and\nimmobile, as tall as tall men. From head to toe they were scarlet.\n\"Robots!\" gasped Ryd, clutching his companion's arm convulsively.\n\"Martian soldier robots!\"\n\"They're unarmed, harmless. They aren't your police with built-in\nweapons. Only the humans are dangerous. But we've got to move. For\nGod's sake, take it easy.\"\nRyd licked dry lips. \"Are we going\u2014out into space?\"\n\"Where else?\" said Mury.\nThe official-looking individual in the expensive topcoat and sport hat\nhad reached the starboard airlock of the towship before anyone thought\nto question his authorization, escorted as he was by a blue-uniformed\nguardsman. When another sentry, pacing between runways a hundred yards\nfrom the squat space vessel, paused to wonder, it was\u2014as it came\nabout\u2014just a little too late.\nThe guard turned and swung briskly off to intercept the oddly-behaving\npair, hand crowding the butt of his pistol, for he was growing\nuneasy. His alarm mounted rapidly, till he nearly sprained an ankle\nin sprinting across the last of the two intervening runways, between\nthe solenoid wickets. Those metal arches, crowding one on the other\nin perspective, formed a tunnel that effectively shielded the\nShahrazad's\nairlocks from more distant view; the gang of notables\nattracted by the occasion was already being shepherded back to safety\nby the Communications guards, whose attention was thus well taken up.\nThe slight man in guardsman's blue glanced over his shoulder and\nvanished abruptly into the circular lock. His companion wheeled on the\ntopmost step, looking down with some irritation on his unhandsome face,\nbut with no apparent doubt of his command of the situation.\n\"Yes?\" he inquired frostily.\n\"What goes on here?\" snapped the guard, frowning at the tall figure\nsilhouetted against the glow in the airlock. \"The crew's signaled all\naboard and the ship lifts in two minutes. You ought to be\u2014\"\n\"I am Semul Mury, Poligerent for the City of Dynamopolis,\" interrupted\nthe tall man with asperity. \"The City is naturally interested in the\ndelivery of the power which will revivify our industries.\" He paused,\nsighed, shifting his weight to the next lower step of the gangway. \"I\nsuppose you'll want to re-check my credentials?\"\nThe guard was somewhat confused; a Poligerent, in ninth-century\nbureaucracy, was a force to be reckoned with. But he contrived to nod\nwith an appearance of brusqueness.\nFully expecting official papers, signed and garnished with all the\npompous seals of a chartered metropolis, the guard was dazed to receive\ninstead a terrific left-handed foul to the pit of the stomach, and as\nhe reeled dizzily, retching and clawing for his gun, to find that gun\nno longer holstered but in the hand of the self-styled Poligerent,\npointing at its licensed owner.\n\"I think,\" Mury said quietly, flexing his left wrist with care the\nwhile his right held the gun steady, \"that you'd better come aboard\nwith us.\"\nThe guard was not more cowardly than the run of politically-appointed\ncivic guardsmen. But a flame gun kills more frightfully than the\nancient electric chair. He complied, grasping the railing with both\nhands as he stumbled before Mury up the gangway\u2014for he was still very\nsick indeed, wholly apart from his bewilderment, which was enormous.\nAbove, Ryd Randl waited in the lock, flattened against the curved\nwall, white and jittering. The inner door was shut, an impenetrable\ncountersunk mirror of metal.\n\"Cover him, Ryd,\" ordered Mury flatly. In obedience Ryd lugged out\nthe heavy flame pistol and pointed it; his finger was dangerously\ntremulous on the firing lever. He moistened his lips to voice his\nfears; but Mury, pocketing the other gun, threw the three-way switch on\nthe side panel, the switch that should have controlled the inner lock.\nNothing happened.\n\"Oh, God. We're caught. We're trapped!\" The outer gangway had slid up,\nthe lock wheezed shut, forming an impenetrable crypt of niosteel.\nMury smiled with supernal calm. \"We won't be here long,\" he said.\nThen, to quiet Ryd's fears, he went on: \"The central control panel and\nthe three local switches inside, between, and outside the locks are\non the circuit in that order. Unless the locks were closed from the\nswitch just beyond the inner lock, that lock will open when the central\ncontrol panel is cut out in preparation for lifting.\"\nAlmost as he paused and drew breath, a light sprang out over the switch\nhe had closed and the inner lock swung silently free of its gaskets.\nRyd felt a trembling relief; but Mury's voice lashed out like a whip as\nhe slipped cat-like into the passage.\n\"Keep him covered. Back out of the lock.\"\nRyd backed\u2014the white, tense face of the prisoner holding his own\nnervous gaze\u2014and, almost out of the lock, stumbled over the metal\npressure rings. And the gun was out of his unsure grip, clattering\nsomewhere near his slithering feet, as he started to fall.\nHe saw the guardsman hurl himself forward; then he was flung spinning,\nback against the engine-room door. In a flash, even as he struggled\nto keep on his feet, he saw the man in the airlock coming up from a\ncrouch, shifting the pistol in his right hand to reach its firing\nlever; he saw Mury sidestep swiftly and throw the master control switch\noutside.\nThe inner lock whooshed shut, barely missing Ryd. At the same instant,\nthe flame gun lighted locks and passage with one terrific flash, and a\nscorched, discolored spot appeared on the beveled metal of the opposite\nlock a foot from Mury's right shoulder.\n\"You damned clumsy little fool\u2014\" said Mury with soft intensity. Then,\nwhile the air around the metal walls still buzzed and snapped with\nblue sparks, he whirled and went up the control-room gangway in two\nquick bounds. Even as he went the flame gun thundered again in the\nstarboard airlock.\nMury was just in time, for the pilot had been about to flash \"Ready\" to\nthe Communications Tower when the explosions had given him pause. But\nthe latter and his two companions were neither ready nor armed; clamped\nin their seats at the controls, already marked, they were helpless in\nan instant before the leveled menace of the gun. And the imprisoned\nguardsman, having wasted most of his charges, was helpless, too, in his\nlittle cell of steel.\n\"It's been tried before,\" said one of the masked men. He had a blond,\nyouthful thatch and a smooth healthy face below the mask, together with\nan astrogator's triangled stars which made him\nex officio\nthe brains\nof the vessel. \"Stealing a ship\u2014it can't be done any more.\"\n\"It's been done again,\" said Mury grimly. \"And you don't know the half\nof it. But\u2014you will. I'll need you. As for your friends\u2014\" The gun\nmuzzle shifted slightly to indicate the pilot and the engineer. \"Out of\nthose clamps. You're going to ride this out in the portside airlock.\"\nHe had to repeat the command, in tones that snapped with menace, before\nthey started with fumbling, rebellious hands to strip their armor from\nthemselves. The burly engineer was muttering phrases of obscene fervor;\nthe weedy young pilot was wild-eyed. The blond astrogator, sitting\nstill masked and apparently unmoved, demanded:\n\"What do you think you're trying to do?\"\n\"What do\nyou\nthink?\" demanded Mury in return. \"I'm taking the ship\ninto space. On schedule and on course\u2014to meet the power shell.\" The\nflame gun moved with a jerk. \"And as for you\u2014what's your name?\"\n\"Yet Arliess.\"\n\"You want to make the trip alive, don't you, Yet Arliess?\"\nThe young astrogator stared at him and at the gun through masking\ngoggles; then he sank into his seat with a slow shudder. \"Why, yes,\" he\nsaid as if in wonder, \"I do.\"\nIII\nShahrazad\ndrove steadily forward into deep space, vibrating slightly\nto the tremendous thrust of her powerful engines. The small, cramped\ncabin was stiflingly hot to the three armored men who sat before its\nbanked dials, watching their steady needles.\nRyd had blacked out, darkness washing into his eyes and consciousness\ndraining from his head, as the space ship had pitched out into\nemptiness over the end of the runway on Pi Mesa and Mury had cut in the\nmaindrive. Pressure greater than anything he had ever felt had crushed\nhim; his voice had been snatched from his lips by those terrible forces\nand lost beneath the opening thunder of the three-inch tubes. Up and\nup, while the acceleration climbed to seven gravities\u2014and Ryd had lost\nevery sensation, not to regain them until Earth was dropping away under\nthe towship's keel.\nA single gravity held them back and down in the tilted seats, and the\ncontrol panels seemed to curve half above them, their banks of lights\nconfused with the stars coldly through the great nose window. In the\ncontrol room all sounds impinged on a background made up of the insect\nhum of air-purifiers, the almost supersonic whine of the fast-spinning\ngyroscopes somewhere behind them, the deep continuous growl of the\nengines.\nMury's voice broke through that steady murmur, coming from Ryd's right.\n\"You can unfasten your anticlamps, Ryd,\" he said dryly. \"That doesn't\nmean you,\" to the young navigator, on his other hand as he sat in\nthe pilot's seat with his pressure-clamps thrown back and his gloved\nhands free to caress the multiplex controls before him. Clipped to the\nsloping dash at his left elbow was a loaded flame gun.\nRyd emerged, with much bungling, from his padded clamps, and shook his\nhead groggily as he ran a hand through his slightly thinning hair. He\nventured shakily, \"Where are we?\"\nMury smiled slightly. \"Only our astrogator,\" he indicated Arliess,\nstill masked and fettered, \"can tell you that with precision. I\nunderstand only enough of astrogational practice to make sure that he\nis holding to the course outlined on the log. For that matter ... he\nis an intelligent young man and if he were not blinded by notions of\nduty to an outworn system.... We are now somewhere near the orbit of\nthe Moon. Isn't that right, Arliess?\"\nThe other did not seem to hear; he sat staring blindly before him\nthrough his goggles at the slowly-changing chart, where cryptic lights\nburned, some moving like glowing paramecia along fine-traced luminous\ntracks.\nMury too sat silent and immobile for a minute or more. Then, abruptly,\nhe inclined his universal chair far to the right, and his long frame\nseemed to tense oddly. His finger stabbed out one of the sparks of\nlight.\n\"What's that, Arliess?\"\nThe astrogator broke his silence. \"A ship.\"\n\"I know that well enough. What ship?\"\n\"I supposed you had examined the log. It would have told you that\nthat's the liner\nAlborak\n, out of Aeropolis with a diplomatic mission\nfor Mars.\"\nMury shook his head regretfully. \"That won't wash, Arliess. Even if you\nsuppose her off course, no liner aspace ever carried a tenth of that\ndrive.\"\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" said Arliess. But his voice\nwas raw and unsteady.\n\"I'm talking about this. That ship is a warship, and it's looking for\nus\u2014will intercept us inside of twenty minutes at the most!\"\n", "summary": "Mury, the head of the Triplanet Freighting Company, and Ryd, his right-hand man, are on a mission to deliver a cargo ship to Mars. Mury has been tasked with delivering the cargo to Mars, but Ryd refuses to go along because he is afraid of Mury\u2019s violent intentions. When Mury threatens to kill Ryd if he does not go along, Ryd protests that he is on the same side as Mury, and that he would rather die than go along with his plan. As they approach the city, Mury orders Ryd to follow him to the control room. Ryd does not want to go, but Mury tells him that he has to go because the cargo ship is about to crash. When Ryd tries to argue with Mury about the gravity of the ship, he is punched in the face by Mury. When they reach the control center, they find that the ship is not loaded onto the turntable, but instead is being towed onto the ship. They realize that they are in trouble because the ship they are on is not being loaded on the right way, and they have to find a way to get it off the planet. They find a ladder that leads up to a control cupola, where they find a control panel. They use the controls on the control panel to make their way to the upper levels of the building. Once inside, they see that there is a lock on the inner door. They try to get through it, but it is locked, so they use a knife to cut through the lock. They exit the building and walk down a spiral stairway into a cavernous room. There is a control room on the far side of the room, and there is an airtight gallery with a thin film of dust on every step. The control room has a panel that Mury uses to set off the alarms.   Ryd and Mury return to their office, where Mury informs Ryd that they have found a ship that has crashed on Mars. The ship is the one that landed on Earth ten years ago, and the Martians have been offering Earth labor to retool their plants and factories for the inescapable conflict. The Martians claim that Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper than robots, and are willing to sell Earth to the Earthmen in return for the labor.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}

BOND\nThey were marooned on Titan, their ship wrecked,\nthe radio smashed. Yet they had to exist, had\nto build a new life on a hostile world. And the\nman who assumed command was Gregory Malcolm, the\nbespectacled secretary\u2014whose only adventures\nhad come through the pages of a book.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Spring 1944.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nSparks snapped off the switches and followed him to the door of the\nradio turret. Sparks was a stunted, usually-grinning, little redhead\nnamed Hannigan. But he wasn't grinning now. He laid an anxious hand on\nGreg's arm. \"If I was you,\" he said, \"if I was you, Malcolm, I don't\nthink I'd say nothing to the boss about this. Not just yet, anyhow.\"\nGreg said, \"Why not?\"\nSparks spluttered and fussed and made heavy weather of answering.\n\"Well, for one thing, it ain't important. It would only worry him. And\nthen there's the womenfolks, they scare easy. Which of course they\nain't no cause to. Atmospherics don't mean nothing. I've rode out\nworse storms than this\u2014plenty of times. And in worse crates than the\nCarefree\n.\"\nGreg studied him carefully from behind trim plasta-rimmed spectacles.\nHe drew a deep breath. He said levelly, \"So it's\nthat\nbad, eh,\nSparks?\"\n\"What bad? I just told you\u2014\"\n\"I know. Sparks, I'm not a professional spaceman. But I've studied\nastrogation as few Earthlubbers have. It's been my hobby for years. And\nI think I know what we're up against.\n\"We hit a warp-eddy last night. We've been trapped in a vortex for\nmore than eight hours. Lord only knows how many hundreds of thousands\nof miles we've been borne off our course. And now we've blasted into a\nsuper-ionized belt of atmospherics. Your radio signals are blanketed.\nYou can't get signals in or out. We're a deaf-mute speck of metal being\nwhirled headlong through space. Isn't that it?\"\n\"I don't know what\u2014\" began Sparks hotly. Then he stopped, studied his\ncompanion thoughtfully, nodded. \"O.Q.,\" he confessed, \"that's it. But\nwe ain't licked yet. We got three good men on the bridge. Townsend ...\nGraves ... Langhorn. They'll pull out of this if anybody can. And they\nain't no sense in scaring the Old Man and his family.\"\n\"I won't tell them,\" said Greg. \"I won't tell them unless I have to.\nBut between you and me, what are the odds against us, Sparks?\"\nThe radioman shrugged.\n\"Who knows? Vortices are unpredictable. Maybe the damn thing will toss\nus out on the very spot it picked us up. Maybe it will give us the old\nchuckeroo a million miles the other side of Pluto. Maybe it will crack\nus up on an asteroid or satellite. No way of telling till it happens.\"\n\"And the controls?\"\n\"As useless,\" said Sparks, \"as a cow in a cyclone.\"\n\"So?\"\n\"We sit tight,\" said Sparks succinctly, \"and hope.\"\nMalcolm nodded quietly. He took off his spectacles, breathed on them,\nwiped them, replaced them. He was tall and fair; in his neat, crisply\npressed business suit he appeared even slimmer than he was. But there\nwas no nervousness in his movements. He moved measuredly. \"Well,\" he\nsaid, \"that appears to be that. I'm going up to the dining dome.\"\nSparks stared at him querulously.\n\"You're a queer duck, Malcolm. I don't think you've got a nerve in your\nbody.\"\n\"Nerves are a luxury I can't afford,\" replied Greg. \"If anything\nhappens\u2014and if there's time to do so\u2014let me know.\" He paused at the\ndoor. \"Good luck,\" he said.\n\"Clear ether!\" said Sparks mechanically. He stared after the other man\nwonderingly for a long moment, then went back to his control banks,\nshaking his head and muttering.\nGregory Malcolm climbed down the Jacob's-ladder and strode briskly\nthrough the labyrinthine corridors that were the entrails of the\nspace yacht\nCarefree\n. He paused once to peer through a\nperilens\nset into the ship's port plates. It was a weird sight that met his\ngaze. Not space, ebony-black and bejewelled with a myriad flaming\nsplotches of color; not the old, familiar constellations treading\ntheir ever-lasting, inexorable paths about the perimeter of Sol's\ntiny universe, but a shimmering webwork of light, so tortured-violet\nthat the eyes ached to look upon it. This was the mad typhoon of\nspace-atmospherics through which the\nCarefree\nwas now being twisted,\ntopsy-turvy, toward a nameless goal.\nHe moved on, approaching at last the quartzite-paned observation\nrotunda which was the dining dome of the ship.\nHis footsteps slowed as he composed himself to face those within. As\nhe hesitated in the dimly-lighted passage, a trick of lights on glass\nmirrored to him the room beyond. He could see the others while they\nwere as yet unaware of his presence. Their voices reached him clearly.\nJ. Foster Andrews, his employer and the employer of the ten thousand\nor more men and women who worked for Galactic Metals Corporation,\ndominated the head of the table. He was a plump, impatient little\nNapoleon. Opposite him, calm, graceful, serene, tastefully garbed and\nelaborately coiffured even here in deep space, three weeks from the\nnearest beauty shop, sat his wife, Enid.\nOn Andrews' right sat his sister, Maud. Not young, features plain as a\nmud fence, but charming despite her age and homeliness simply because\nof her eyes; puckish, shrewdly intelligent eyes, constantly aglint with\nsuppressed humor at\u2014guessed Greg\u2014the amusing foibles and frailties of\nthose about her.\nShe gave her breakfast the enthusiastic attention of one too old and\nshapeless to be concerned with such folderol as calories and dietetics,\npausing only from time to time to share smidgeons of food with a\nwatery-eyed scrap of white, curly fluff beside her chair. Her pet\npoodle, whom she called by the opprobrious title of \"Cuddles.\"\nOn J. Foster's left sat his daughter, Crystal. She it was who caused\nGregory Malcolm's staid, respectable heart to give a little lurch as\nhe glimpsed her reflected vision\u2014all gold and crimson and cream\u2014in\nthe glistening walls. If Crystal was her name, so, too, was crystal her\nloveliness.\nBut\u2014Greg shook his head\u2014but she was not for him. She was already\npledged to the young man seated beside her. Ralph Breadon. He turned\nto murmur something to her as Greg watched; Greg saw and admired and\ndisliked his rangy height, his sturdy, well-knit strength, the rich\nbrownness of his skin, his hair, his eyes.\nThe sound of his own name startled Greg.\n\"Malcolm!\" called the man at the head of the table. \"Malcolm! Now where\nin blazes is he, anyhow?\" he demanded of no one in particular, everyone\nin general. He spooned a dab of liquid gold from a Limoges preserve\njar, tongued it suspiciously, frowned. \"Bitter!\" he complained.\n\"It's the very\nbest\nMartian honey,\" said his wife.\n\"Drylands clover,\" added Crystal.\n\"It's still bitter,\" said J. Foster petulantly.\nHis sister sniffed. \"Nonsense! It's delightful.\"\n\"I say it's bitter,\" repeated Andrews sulkily. And lifted his voice\nagain. \"\nMalcolm!\nWhere\nare\nyou?\"\n\"You called me, sir?\" said Malcolm, moving into the room. He nodded\npolitely to the others. \"Good morning, Mrs. Andrews ... Miss\nAndrews ... Mr. Breadon....\"\n\"Oh, sit down!\" snapped J. Foster. \"Sit down here and stop bobbing your\nhead like a teetotum! Had your breakfast? The honey's no good; it's\nbitter.\" He glared at his sister challengingly. \"Where have you been,\nanyway? What kind of secretary are you? Have you been up to the radio\nturret? How's the market today? Is Galactic up or down?\"\nMalcolm said, \"I don't know, sir.\"\n\"Fine! Fine!\" Andrews rattled on automatically before the words\nregistered. Then he started, his face turning red. \"Eh? What's that?\nDon't know! What do you mean, you don't know? I pay you to\u2014\"\n\"There's no transmission, sir,\" said Greg quietly.\n\"No trans\u2014nonsense! Of course there's transmission! I put a million\ncredits into this ship. Finest space-yacht ever built. Latest equipment\nthroughout. Sparks is drunk, that's what you mean! Well, you hop right\nup there and\u2014\"\nMaud Andrews put down her fork with a clatter. \"Oh, for goodness sakes,\nJonathan, shut up and give the boy time to explain! He's standing\nthere with his mouth gaping like a rain-spout, trying to get a word in\nedgewise! What's the trouble, Gregory?\" She turned to Greg, as Jonathan\nFoster Andrews wheezed into startled silence. \"\nThat?\n\"\nShe glanced at the quartzite dome, beyond which the veil of iridescence\nwove and cross-wove and shimmered like a pallid aurora.\nGreg nodded. \"Yes, Miss Andrews.\"\nEnid Andrews spoke languidly from the other end of the table.\n\"But what is it, Gregory? A local phenomenon?\"\n\"You might call it that,\" said Greg, selecting his words cautiously.\n\"It's an ionized field into which we've blasted. It\u2014it\u2014shouldn't stay\nwith us long. But while it persists, our radio will be blanketed out.\"\nBreadon's chestnut head came up suddenly, sharply.\n\"Ionization! That means atmosphere!\"\nGreg said, \"Yes.\"\n\"And an atmosphere means a body in space somewhere near\u2014\" Breadon\nstopped, bit his lip before the appeal in Malcolm's eyes, tried to pass\nit off easily. \"Oh, well\u2014a change of scenery, what?\"\nBut the moment of alarm in his voice had not passed unnoticed. Crystal\nAndrews spoke for all of them, her voice preternaturally quiet.\n\"You're hiding something, Malcolm. What is it? Is there\u2014danger?\"\nBut Greg didn't have to answer that question. From the doorway a harsh,\ndefiantly strident voice answered for him. The voice of Bert Andrews,\nCrystal's older brother.\n\"Danger? You're damn right there's danger! What's the matter with\nyou folks\u2014are you all deaf, dumb and blind? We've been caught in a\nspace-vortex for hours. Now we're in the H-layer of a planet we can't\neven see\u2014and in fifteen minutes or fifteen seconds we may all be\nsmashed as flat as pancakes!\"\nThe proclamation brought them out of their chairs. Greg's heart sank;\nhis vain plea, \"Mr. Andrews\u2014\" was lost in the medley of Crystal's\nsudden gasp, Enid Andrews' short, choking scream, J. Foster's bellowing\nroar at his only son.\n\"Bert\u2014you're drunk!\"\nBert weaved precariously from the doorway, laughed in his father's face.\n\"Sure I'm drunk! Why not? If you're smart you'll get drunk, too. The\nwhole damn lot of you!\" He flicked a derisive hand toward Greg. \"You\ntoo, Boy Scout! What were you trying to do\u2014hide the bad news from\nthem? Well, it's no use. Everybody might as well know the worst. We're\ngone gooses ... geeses ... aw, what the hell! Dead ducks!\" He fell\ninto a chair, sprawled there laughing mirthlessly with fear riding the\ntoo-high notes of his laughter.\nJ. Foster turned to his secretary slowly. His ire had faded; there was\nonly deep concern in his voice.\n\"Is he telling the truth, Malcolm?\"\nGreg said soberly, \"Partly, sir. He's overstating the danger\u2014but\nthere is danger. We are caught in a space-vortex, and as Mr.\nBreadon realized, the presence of these ionics means we're in the\nHeaviside-layer of some heavenly body. But we may not crack up.\"\nMaud Andrews glanced at him shrewdly.\n\"Is there anything we can do?\"\n\"Not a thing. The officers on the bridge are doing everything possible.\"\n\"In that case,\" said the older woman, \"we might as well finish our\nbreakfast. Here, Cuddles! Come to momsy!\" She sat down again. Greg\nlooked at her admiringly. Ralph Breadon stroked his brown jaw. He said,\n\"The life-skiffs?\"\n\"A last resort,\" said Greg. \"Sparks promised he'd let me know if it\nwere necessary. We'll hope it's not\u2014\"\nBut it was a vain hope, vainly spoken in the last, vain moment. For\neven as he phrased the hopeful words, came the sound of swift, racing\nfootsteps up the corridor. Into the dining dome burst Hannigan, eyes\nhot with excitement. And his cry dispelled Greg's final hopes for\nsafety.\n\"Everybody\u2014the Number Four life-skiff\u2014\nquick\n! We've been caught in a\ngrav-drag and we're going to crash!\"\nII\nThose next hectic moments were never afterward very clear in Greg\nMalcolm's memory. He had a confused recollection of hearing Sparks'\nwarning punctuated by a loud, shrill scream which he vaguely identified\nas emanating from Mrs. Andrews' throat ... he was conscious of feeling,\nsuddenly, beneath his feet the sickening, quickening lurch of a ship\nout of control, gripped by gravitational forces beyond its power to\nallay ... he recalled his own voice dinning in his ears as, incredibly,\nwith Sparks, he took command of the hasty flight from the dining dome\ndown the corridor to the aft ramp, up the ramp, across girdered beams\nin the super-structure to the small, independently motored rocket-skiff\ncradled there.\nHe was aware, too, of strangely disconnected incidents happening around\nhim, he being a part of them but seeming to be only a disinterested\nspectator to their strangeness. Of his forcing Maud Andrews toward\nthe door of the dome ... of her pushing back against him with all the\nweight of her body ... of her irate voice, \"Cuddles! I forgot him!\"\nThen the shrill excited yapping of the poodle cradled against her as\nthey charged on down the corridor.\nJ. Foster waddling beside him, tugging at his arm, panting, \"The\nofficers?\" and his own unfelt assurance. \"They can take care of\nthemselves. It's a general 'bandon ship.\" Enid Andrews stumbling over\nthe hem of a filmy peignoir ... himself bending to lift her boldly and\nbodily, sweating palms feeling the warm animal heat of her excited\nbody hot beneath them ... Crystal Andrews stopping suddenly, crying,\n\"'Tina!\" ... and Hannigan's reply, \"Your maid? I woke her. She's in the\nlife-skiff.\" Bert Andrews stopping suddenly, being sick in the middle\nof the corridor, his drunkenness losing itself in the thick, sure\nnausea of the ever-increasing unsteadiness beneath their feet.\nThen the life-skiff, the clang of metal as Hannigan slammed the\nport behind the last of them, the fumbling for a lock-stud, the\nquick, grateful pant of the miniature hypos, and a weird feeling of\nweightlessness, rushingness, hurtlingness as his eardrums throbbed and\nhis mouth tasted brassy and bloody with the fierce velocity of their\nescape.\nSense and meaning returned only when all this ended. As one waking from\na nightmare dream, Greg Malcolm returned to a world he could recognize.\nA tiny world, encased within the walls of a forty-foot life-skiff. A\nworld peopled too scantily. Andrews, his wife and sister, his son and\ndaughter; 'Tina Laney, the maid; Breadon, Hannigan, young Tommy O'Doul,\nthe cabin-boy (though where he had come from, or when, Greg did not\nknow). And himself. In a life-skiff. In space.\nSomewhere in space. He looked through the\nperilens\n. What he saw then\nhe might better never have seen. For that shimmering pink-ochre veil\nhad wisped away, now, and in the clean, cold, bitter-clear light of a\ndistant sun he watched the death-dive of the yacht\nCarefree\n.\nLike a vast silver top, spinning heedlessly, wildly, it streaked toward\na mottled gray and green, brown and dun, hard and crushing-brutal\nterrain below. Still at its helm stood someone, for even in that last\ndreadful moment burst from its nose-jets a ruddy mushroom of flame that\ntried to, but could not, brake the dizzy fall.\nFor an instant Greg's eyes, stingingly blinded and wet, thought they\nglimpsed a wee black mote dancing from the bowels of the\nCarefree\n; a\nmote that might be another skiff like their own. But he could not be\nsure, and then the\nCarefree\nwas accelerating with such violence and\nspeed that the eye could see it only as a flaming silver lance against\nthe ugly earth-carcase beneath, and then it struck and a carmine bud of\nflame burst and flowered for an instant, and that was all....\nAnd Greg Malcolm turned from the\nperilens\n, shaken.\nHannigan said, \"It's over?\" and Greg nodded.\nHannigan said, \"The other skiffs? Did they break free, or were they\ncaught?\"\n\"I don't know. I couldn't see for sure.\"\n\"You must have seen. Are we the only ones?\"\n\"I couldn't see for sure. Maybe. Maybe not.\"\nThen a body scrambled forward, pressing through the tightness of other\nhuddled bodies, and there was a hand upon his elbow. \"I'll take over\nnow, Malcolm.\"\nIt was Ralph Breadon. Gregory looked at him slowly, uncomprehendingly\nat first. His hand was reluctant to leave the guiding-gear of the\nsmall ship which was, now, all that remained to them of civilization\nand civilization's wondrous accomplishments. He had not realized until\nthis moment that for a while ... for a short, eager, pulse-quickening\nwhile ... on his alertness, in his hands, had depended the destinies\nof ten men and women. But he knew, suddenly and completely, that it\nwas for this single moment his whole lifetime had waited. It was for\nthis brief moment of command that some intuition, some instinct greater\nthan knowledge, had prepared him. This was why he, an Earthlubber, had\nstudied astrogation, made a hobby of the empire of the stars. That he\nmight be fitted to command when all others failed. And now\u2014\nAnd now the moment was past, and he was once again Gregory Malcolm,\nmild, lean, pale, bespectacled secretary to J. Foster Andrews. And the\nman at his side was Ralph Breadon, socialite and gentleman sportsman,\ntrained pilot. And in Malcolm the habit of obedience was strong....\n\"Very well, sir,\" he said. And he turned over the controls.\nWhat happened then was unfortunate. It might just as well have happened\nto Malcolm, though afterward no one could ever say with certainty.\nHowever that was, either by carelessness or malfortune or inefficiency,\nonce-thwarted disaster struck again at the little party on the\nlife-skiff. At the instant Breadon's hand seized the controls the skiff\njerked suddenly as though struck with a ponderous fist, its throbbing\nmotors choked and snarled in a high, rising crescendo of torment that\nlost itself in supersonic heights, and the ship that had been drifting\neasily and under control to the planet beneath now dipped viciously.\nThe misfortune was that too many huddled in the tiny space understood\nthe operation of the life-skiff, and what must be done instantly. And\nthat neither pilot was as yet in control of the ship. Breadon's hand\nleaped for the Dixie rod, so, too, did Malcolm's\u2014and across both their\nbodies came the arm of Sparks Hannigan, searching the controls.\nIn the scramble someone's sleeve brushed the banks of control-keys. The\nmotors, killed, soughed into silence. The ship rocked into a spin. Greg\ncried out, his voice a strange harshness in his ears; Breadon cursed;\none of the women bleated fearfully.\nThen Breadon, still cursing, fought all hands from the controls but his\nown. And the man was not without courage. For all could see plainly,\nin the illumined\nperilens\n, how near to swift death that moment of\nuncertainty had led them. The skiff, which an instant before had been\nhigh in the stratosphere of this unknown planet ... or satellite\nor whatever it might be ... was now flashing toward hard ground at\nlightning speed.\nOnly a miracle, Greg knew, could save them now. An impulse spun his\nhead, he looked at Crystal Andrews. There was no fear in her eyes. Just\na hotness and an inexplicable anger. Beside her was the other girl, the\nmaid, 'Tina; she was frankly afraid. Her teeth were clenched in her\nnether lip, and her eyes were wide and anxious, but she did not cry out.\nOnly a miracle could save them now. But Breadon's hands performed\nthat miracle; his quick, nerveless, trained hands. A stud here ...\na lever there ... a swift wrenching toss of the shoulders. His face\ntwisted back over his shoulder, and his straining lips pulled taut\nand bloodless away from his teeth. \"Hold tight, folks! We're going to\nbounce\u2014\"\nThen they struck!\nBut they struck glancingly, as Breadon had hoped, and planned for,\nand gambled on. They struck and bounced. The frail craft shivered\nand groaned in metal agony, jarred across harsh soil, bounced again,\nsettled, nosed over and rocked to a standstill. Somewhere forward\nsomething snapped with a shrill, high\nping!\nof stress; somewhere aft\nwas the metallic flap-clanging of broken gear trailing behind them. But\nthey were safe.\nBreath, held so long that he could not remember its inhalation, escaped\nGreg's lungs in a long sigh. \"Nice work, Mr. Breadon!\" he cried. \"Oh,\nnice work!\"\nBut surprisingly, savagely, Breadon turned on him.\n\"It would have been\nbetter\nwork, Malcolm, if you'd kept your damned\nhands off the controls! Now see what you've done? Smashed up our skiff!\nOur only\u2014\"\n\"He didn't do it!\" piped the shrill voice of Tommy O'Doul. \"You done it\nyourself, Mr. Breadon. Your sleeve. It caught the switch.\"\n\"Quiet!\" Breadon, cheeks flushed, reached out smartly, stilled\nthe youngster's defense with a swift, ungentle slap. \"And you,\nMalcolm\u2014after this, do as you're told, and don't try to assume\nresponsibilities too great for you. All right, everybody. Let's get out\nand see how bad the damage is.\"\nInstinctively Greg had surged a half step forward as Breadon silenced\nthe cabin boy. Now old habit and common-sense halted him. He's\noverwrought, he reasoned. We're all excited and on edge. We've been to\nBedlam. Our nerves are shot. In a little while we'll all be back to\nnormal.\nHe said quietly, \"Very well, Mr. Breadon.\" And he climbed from the\nbroken skiff.\nHannigan said, \"Looks bad, don't it?\"\n\"Very,\" said Malcolm. He fingered a shard of loose metal flapping like\na fin from the stern of the skiff. \"Not hopeless, though. There should\nbe an acetylene torch in the tool locker. With that\u2014\"\n\"You ought to of poked him,\" said Hannigan.\n\"What? Oh, you mean\u2014?\"\n\"Yeah. The kid was right, you know. He done it.\"\n\"His sleeve, you mean. Well, it was an accident,\" said Greg. \"It could\nhave happened to anyone. And he made a good landing. Considering\neverything. Anyhow\u2014\" Again he was Gregory Malcolm, serious-faced,\nefficient secretary. \"Anyhow, we have been thrust into an extremely\nprecarious circumstance. It would be silly to take umbrage at a man's\nnervous anger. We must have no quarreling, no bickering\u2014\"\n\"Umbrage!\" snorted Sparks. \"Bickering! They're big words. I ain't sure\nI know what they mean. I ain't exactly sure they mean\nanything\n.\" He\nglanced at Greg oddly. \"You're a queer jasper, Malcolm. Back there\non the ship, I figured you for a sort of a stuffed-shirt. Yes-man to\nthe boss. And then in the show-down, you come through like a movie\nhero\u2014for a little while. Then you let that Breadon guy give you the\nspur without a squawk\u2014\"\nMalcolm adjusted his plasta-rimmed spectacles. He said, almost\nstubbornly, \"Our situation is grave. There must be no bickering.\"\n\"Bickering your Aunt Jenny! What do you call that?\"\nSparks jerked a contemptuous thumb toward the group from which they\nwere separated. Upon disembarking, only Greg and Sparks had moved to\nmake a careful examination of their damaged craft. The others, more\nor less under the direction of Breadon, were making gestures toward\nremoving certain necessaries from the skiff. Their efforts, slight and\nuncertain as they were, had already embroiled them in argument.\nThe gist of their argument, so far as Greg Malcolm could determine, was\nthat everyone wanted \"something\" to be done, but no two could agree as\nto just what that something was, and no one seemed to have any bursting\ndesire to participate in actual physical labor.\nJ. Foster Andrews, all traces of his former panic and confusion fled,\nwas planted firmly, Napoleonically, some few yards from the open port\nof the life-skiff, barking impatient orders at little Tommy O'Doul\nwho\u2014as Greg watched\u2014stumbled from the port bearing a huge armload of\nedibles.\n'Tina, the maid, was in a frenzy of motion, trying to administer to the\ncomplaints and demands of Mrs. Andrews (whose immaculate hair-do had\nsuffered in the frenetic minutes of their flight) and Crystal Andrews\n(who knew perfectly well there were sweaters in the life-skiff) and\nMiss Maud (who wanted a can of prepared dog-food and a can-opener\nimmediately, and look at poor Cuddles, momsy's 'ittle pet was\nso\nhungry)!\nBert Andrews was sulkily insisting that it was nonsense to leave the\nwarmth and security of the skiff anyway, and he wished he had a drink,\nwhile the harassed, self-appointed commander of the refugee corps was\nshouting at whomever happened, at any given moment, to capture his\ndivided and completely frantic attention. His orders were masterpieces\nof confusion, developing around one premise that the castaway crew\nshould immediately set up a camp. Where, how, or with what nonexistent\nequipment, Breadon did not venture to say.\n\"You see what I mean?\" demanded Sparks disgustedly.\nGreg Malcolm saw. He also saw other things. That their landing-spot,\nwhile excellent for its purpose, was not by any manner of means an\nideal campsite. It was a small, flat basin of sandy soil, rimmed by\nshallow mountains. His gaze sought these hills, looked approvingly on\ntheir greenness, upon the multitude of dark pock-marks dotting them.\nThese caves, were they not the habitations of potential enemies, might\nwell become the sanctuaries of spacewrecked men.\nHe saw, also, a thin ribbon of silver sheering the face of the northern\nhills. His gaze, rising still skyward, saw other things\u2014\nHe nodded. He knew, now, where they were. Or approximately. There was\nbut one planet in the solar system which boasted such a phenomenon. The\napparent distance of the Sun, judged by its diminished disc, argued\nhis judgment to be correct. The fact that they had surged through an\natmospheric belt for some length of time before finally meeting with\ndisaster.\n\"Titan,\" he said. \"Hyperion possibly. But probably Titan.\"\nSparks' gaze, following Greg's upward, contracted in an expression of\ndismay.\n\"Dirty cow! You mean that's where we are?\"\n\"I believe so. There's Saturn, our mother planet, looming above us as\nlarge as a dinner plate. And the grav-drag here is almost Earth norm.\nTitan has a 3,000 mile diameter. That, combined with the Saturnian\ntractile constant, would give us a strong pull.\"\nSparks wailed, \"But Titan! Great morning, Malcolm, nobody ever comes\nto Titan! There ain't no mines here, no colonies, no\u2014\" He stopped\nsuddenly, his eyes widening yet farther. \"And, hey\u2014this place is\ndangerous\n! There are\u2014\"\n\"I know it,\" said Greg swiftly, quietly. \"Shut up, Sparks. No use\ntelling the others. If they don't guess it themselves, what they don't\nknow won't alarm them. We've got to do something, though. Get ourselves\norganized into a defensive community. That's the only way\u2014\"\nRalph Breadon's sharp, dictatorial voice interrupted him. \"Well,\nMalcolm, stop soldiering and make yourself useful!\"\nAnd J. Foster, not to have his authority usurped, supplemented the\norder. \"Yes, Malcolm, let's get going! No time for day-dreaming, my\nman. We want action!\"\nSparks said, \"Maybe you'll get it now, fatty!\" under his breath, and\nlooked at Malcolm hopefully. But his companion merely nodded, moved\nforward toward the others, quietly obedient to the command.\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said.\nHannigan groaned and followed him.\nIII\nBreadon said, \"All right, Tommy, dump them here. I have a few words to\nsay.\" He glanced about him pompously. \"Now, folks, naturally we want\nto get away from here as soon as possible. Therefore I delegate you,\nSparks, to immediately get a message off. An SOS to the nearest space\ncruiser.\"\nHannigan grinned. It was not a pleasant grin. He took his time\nanswering. He spat thoughtfully on the ground before him, lifted his\nhead. He said, \"A message, huh?\"\n\"That's what I said.\"\n\"And what'll I send it with?\" drawled Sparks. \"Tom-toms?\"\nBreadon flushed darkly.\n\"I believe the life-skiff was equipped with a radio? And theoretically\nyou are a radio operator?\"\n\"Finest radio money can buy!\" interpolated J. Foster Andrews proudly.\n\"Put a million credits into the\nCarefree\n. Best equipment throughout.\"\nSparks looked from one to another of them, grinned insolently. \"You're\nboth right. I\nam\na radio operator, and there\nwas\na radio. But we\ncrashed, remember? On account of some dope's sleeve got caught in the\nmaster switch\u2014\"\n\"That will do!\" snapped Breadon angrily. He stared at the bandy-legged\nlittle redhead. \"You mean the radio was broken?\"\n\"It wasn't helped none. The tubes was made out of glass, and glass\ndon't bounce so good.\"\nGreg Malcolm said thoughtfully, \"Sparks, can't you fix it?\"\n\"Well, mebbe. But not in five minutes. Maybe not in five years. I won't\nknow till I get going on it.\"\nBreadon frowned.\n\"I'll handle this, Malcolm,\" he crisped. Again to the radioman, \"Well,\nyou get to work on it immediately. And as soon as you get it fixed,\nsend out an SOS advising the patrol where we are\u2014\"\n\"Speaking of which,\" insinuated Sparks, \"where are we?\"\nBreadon glared at him wrathfully.\n\"Why\u2014why on one of the satellites of Saturn, of course. Any fool can\nsee that!\"\n\"O.Q. But does any fool know which one? Or shall I tell you it's Titan?\nAnd when you know that, then what? Titan wasn't named that on account\nof it was a pimple. It's a big place. What'll I tell the Patrol?\nSOS.\nStranded in the middle of we-don't-know-where, somewhere on Titan,\nmaybe.\nThey'll be hunting for us till we've got whiskers down to our\nknees.\"\nBreadon's irate look vanished. He looked stricken. He said, \"I\u2014I don't\nknow. We have a compass\u2014\"\nOnce again it was Gregory Malcolm who entered into the conversation. He\nhad been toying, almost absentmindedly, with a funnel taken from the\nskiff's stores. Into this he had poured a small portion of water; his\nright forefinger was pressed to the bottom of the tube, closing it. He\nsaid, \"I can answer part of that question now. Enough to cut the search\nin half, anyway. We're in the northern hemisphere of the satellite.\"\nMaud Andrews looked at him sharply as if noticing him for the first\ntime in her life.\n\"How,\" she asked, \"did you know that, Malcolm?\"\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nWanderers of the Wolf Moon\nBy NELSON S. BOND\nThey were marooned on Titan, their ship wrecked,\nthe radio smashed. Yet they had to exist, had\nto build a new life on a hostile world. And the\nman who assumed command was Gregory Malcolm, the\nbespectacled secretary\u2014whose only adventures\nhad come through the pages of a book.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Spring 1944.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nSparks snapped off the switches and followed him to the door of the\nradio turret. Sparks was a stunted, usually-grinning, little redhead\nnamed Hannigan. But he wasn't grinning now. He laid an anxious hand on\nGreg's arm. \"If I was you,\" he said, \"if I was you, Malcolm, I don't\nthink I'd say nothing to the boss about this. Not just yet, anyhow.\"\nGreg said, \"Why not?\"\nSparks spluttered and fussed and made heavy weather of answering.\n\"Well, for one thing, it ain't important. It would only worry him. And\nthen there's the womenfolks, they scare easy. Which of course they\nain't no cause to. Atmospherics don't mean nothing. I've rode out\nworse storms than this\u2014plenty of times. And in worse crates than the\nCarefree\n.\"\nGreg studied him carefully from behind trim plasta-rimmed spectacles.\nHe drew a deep breath. He said levelly, \"So it's\nthat\nbad, eh,\nSparks?\"\n\"What bad? I just told you\u2014\"\n\"I know. Sparks, I'm not a professional spaceman. But I've studied\nastrogation as few Earthlubbers have. It's been my hobby for years. And\nI think I know what we're up against.\n\"We hit a warp-eddy last night. We've been trapped in a vortex for\nmore than eight hours. Lord only knows how many hundreds of thousands\nof miles we've been borne off our course. And now we've blasted into a\nsuper-ionized belt of atmospherics. Your radio signals are blanketed.\nYou can't get signals in or out. We're a deaf-mute speck of metal being\nwhirled headlong through space. Isn't that it?\"\n\"I don't know what\u2014\" began Sparks hotly. Then he stopped, studied his\ncompanion thoughtfully, nodded. \"O.Q.,\" he confessed, \"that's it. But\nwe ain't licked yet. We got three good men on the bridge. Townsend ...\nGraves ... Langhorn. They'll pull out of this if anybody can. And they\nain't no sense in scaring the Old Man and his family.\"\n\"I won't tell them,\" said Greg. \"I won't tell them unless I have to.\nBut between you and me, what are the odds against us, Sparks?\"\nThe radioman shrugged.\n\"Who knows? Vortices are unpredictable. Maybe the damn thing will toss\nus out on the very spot it picked us up. Maybe it will give us the old\nchuckeroo a million miles the other side of Pluto. Maybe it will crack\nus up on an asteroid or satellite. No way of telling till it happens.\"\n\"And the controls?\"\n\"As useless,\" said Sparks, \"as a cow in a cyclone.\"\n\"So?\"\n\"We sit tight,\" said Sparks succinctly, \"and hope.\"\nMalcolm nodded quietly. He took off his spectacles, breathed on them,\nwiped them, replaced them. He was tall and fair; in his neat, crisply\npressed business suit he appeared even slimmer than he was. But there\nwas no nervousness in his movements. He moved measuredly. \"Well,\" he\nsaid, \"that appears to be that. I'm going up to the dining dome.\"\nSparks stared at him querulously.\n\"You're a queer duck, Malcolm. I don't think you've got a nerve in your\nbody.\"\n\"Nerves are a luxury I can't afford,\" replied Greg. \"If anything\nhappens\u2014and if there's time to do so\u2014let me know.\" He paused at the\ndoor. \"Good luck,\" he said.\n\"Clear ether!\" said Sparks mechanically. He stared after the other man\nwonderingly for a long moment, then went back to his control banks,\nshaking his head and muttering.\nGregory Malcolm climbed down the Jacob's-ladder and strode briskly\nthrough the labyrinthine corridors that were the entrails of the\nspace yacht\nCarefree\n. He paused once to peer through a\nperilens\nset into the ship's port plates. It was a weird sight that met his\ngaze. Not space, ebony-black and bejewelled with a myriad flaming\nsplotches of color; not the old, familiar constellations treading\ntheir ever-lasting, inexorable paths about the perimeter of Sol's\ntiny universe, but a shimmering webwork of light, so tortured-violet\nthat the eyes ached to look upon it. This was the mad typhoon of\nspace-atmospherics through which the\nCarefree\nwas now being twisted,\ntopsy-turvy, toward a nameless goal.\nHe moved on, approaching at last the quartzite-paned observation\nrotunda which was the dining dome of the ship.\nHis footsteps slowed as he composed himself to face those within. As\nhe hesitated in the dimly-lighted passage, a trick of lights on glass\nmirrored to him the room beyond. He could see the others while they\nwere as yet unaware of his presence. Their voices reached him clearly.\nJ. Foster Andrews, his employer and the employer of the ten thousand\nor more men and women who worked for Galactic Metals Corporation,\ndominated the head of the table. He was a plump, impatient little\nNapoleon. Opposite him, calm, graceful, serene, tastefully garbed and\nelaborately coiffured even here in deep space, three weeks from the\nnearest beauty shop, sat his wife, Enid.\nOn Andrews' right sat his sister, Maud. Not young, features plain as a\nmud fence, but charming despite her age and homeliness simply because\nof her eyes; puckish, shrewdly intelligent eyes, constantly aglint with\nsuppressed humor at\u2014guessed Greg\u2014the amusing foibles and frailties of\nthose about her.\nShe gave her breakfast the enthusiastic attention of one too old and\nshapeless to be concerned with such folderol as calories and dietetics,\npausing only from time to time to share smidgeons of food with a\nwatery-eyed scrap of white, curly fluff beside her chair. Her pet\npoodle, whom she called by the opprobrious title of \"Cuddles.\"\nOn J. Foster's left sat his daughter, Crystal. She it was who caused\nGregory Malcolm's staid, respectable heart to give a little lurch as\nhe glimpsed her reflected vision\u2014all gold and crimson and cream\u2014in\nthe glistening walls. If Crystal was her name, so, too, was crystal her\nloveliness.\nBut\u2014Greg shook his head\u2014but she was not for him. She was already\npledged to the young man seated beside her. Ralph Breadon. He turned\nto murmur something to her as Greg watched; Greg saw and admired and\ndisliked his rangy height, his sturdy, well-knit strength, the rich\nbrownness of his skin, his hair, his eyes.\nThe sound of his own name startled Greg.\n\"Malcolm!\" called the man at the head of the table. \"Malcolm! Now where\nin blazes is he, anyhow?\" he demanded of no one in particular, everyone\nin general. He spooned a dab of liquid gold from a Limoges preserve\njar, tongued it suspiciously, frowned. \"Bitter!\" he complained.\n\"It's the very\nbest\nMartian honey,\" said his wife.\n\"Drylands clover,\" added Crystal.\n\"It's still bitter,\" said J. Foster petulantly.\nHis sister sniffed. \"Nonsense! It's delightful.\"\n\"I say it's bitter,\" repeated Andrews sulkily. And lifted his voice\nagain. \"\nMalcolm!\nWhere\nare\nyou?\"\n\"You called me, sir?\" said Malcolm, moving into the room. He nodded\npolitely to the others. \"Good morning, Mrs. Andrews ... Miss\nAndrews ... Mr. Breadon....\"\n\"Oh, sit down!\" snapped J. Foster. \"Sit down here and stop bobbing your\nhead like a teetotum! Had your breakfast? The honey's no good; it's\nbitter.\" He glared at his sister challengingly. \"Where have you been,\nanyway? What kind of secretary are you? Have you been up to the radio\nturret? How's the market today? Is Galactic up or down?\"\nMalcolm said, \"I don't know, sir.\"\n\"Fine! Fine!\" Andrews rattled on automatically before the words\nregistered. Then he started, his face turning red. \"Eh? What's that?\nDon't know! What do you mean, you don't know? I pay you to\u2014\"\n\"There's no transmission, sir,\" said Greg quietly.\n\"No trans\u2014nonsense! Of course there's transmission! I put a million\ncredits into this ship. Finest space-yacht ever built. Latest equipment\nthroughout. Sparks is drunk, that's what you mean! Well, you hop right\nup there and\u2014\"\nMaud Andrews put down her fork with a clatter. \"Oh, for goodness sakes,\nJonathan, shut up and give the boy time to explain! He's standing\nthere with his mouth gaping like a rain-spout, trying to get a word in\nedgewise! What's the trouble, Gregory?\" She turned to Greg, as Jonathan\nFoster Andrews wheezed into startled silence. \"\nThat?\n\"\nShe glanced at the quartzite dome, beyond which the veil of iridescence\nwove and cross-wove and shimmered like a pallid aurora.\nGreg nodded. \"Yes, Miss Andrews.\"\nEnid Andrews spoke languidly from the other end of the table.\n\"But what is it, Gregory? A local phenomenon?\"\n\"You might call it that,\" said Greg, selecting his words cautiously.\n\"It's an ionized field into which we've blasted. It\u2014it\u2014shouldn't stay\nwith us long. But while it persists, our radio will be blanketed out.\"\nBreadon's chestnut head came up suddenly, sharply.\n\"Ionization! That means atmosphere!\"\nGreg said, \"Yes.\"\n\"And an atmosphere means a body in space somewhere near\u2014\" Breadon\nstopped, bit his lip before the appeal in Malcolm's eyes, tried to pass\nit off easily. \"Oh, well\u2014a change of scenery, what?\"\nBut the moment of alarm in his voice had not passed unnoticed. Crystal\nAndrews spoke for all of them, her voice preternaturally quiet.\n\"You're hiding something, Malcolm. What is it? Is there\u2014danger?\"\nBut Greg didn't have to answer that question. From the doorway a harsh,\ndefiantly strident voice answered for him. The voice of Bert Andrews,\nCrystal's older brother.\n\"Danger? You're damn right there's danger! What's the matter with\nyou folks\u2014are you all deaf, dumb and blind? We've been caught in a\nspace-vortex for hours. Now we're in the H-layer of a planet we can't\neven see\u2014and in fifteen minutes or fifteen seconds we may all be\nsmashed as flat as pancakes!\"\nThe proclamation brought them out of their chairs. Greg's heart sank;\nhis vain plea, \"Mr. Andrews\u2014\" was lost in the medley of Crystal's\nsudden gasp, Enid Andrews' short, choking scream, J. Foster's bellowing\nroar at his only son.\n\"Bert\u2014you're drunk!\"\nBert weaved precariously from the doorway, laughed in his father's face.\n\"Sure I'm drunk! Why not? If you're smart you'll get drunk, too. The\nwhole damn lot of you!\" He flicked a derisive hand toward Greg. \"You\ntoo, Boy Scout! What were you trying to do\u2014hide the bad news from\nthem? Well, it's no use. Everybody might as well know the worst. We're\ngone gooses ... geeses ... aw, what the hell! Dead ducks!\" He fell\ninto a chair, sprawled there laughing mirthlessly with fear riding the\ntoo-high notes of his laughter.\nJ. Foster turned to his secretary slowly. His ire had faded; there was\nonly deep concern in his voice.\n\"Is he telling the truth, Malcolm?\"\nGreg said soberly, \"Partly, sir. He's overstating the danger\u2014but\nthere is danger. We are caught in a space-vortex, and as Mr.\nBreadon realized, the presence of these ionics means we're in the\nHeaviside-layer of some heavenly body. But we may not crack up.\"\nMaud Andrews glanced at him shrewdly.\n\"Is there anything we can do?\"\n\"Not a thing. The officers on the bridge are doing everything possible.\"\n\"In that case,\" said the older woman, \"we might as well finish our\nbreakfast. Here, Cuddles! Come to momsy!\" She sat down again. Greg\nlooked at her admiringly. Ralph Breadon stroked his brown jaw. He said,\n\"The life-skiffs?\"\n\"A last resort,\" said Greg. \"Sparks promised he'd let me know if it\nwere necessary. We'll hope it's not\u2014\"\nBut it was a vain hope, vainly spoken in the last, vain moment. For\neven as he phrased the hopeful words, came the sound of swift, racing\nfootsteps up the corridor. Into the dining dome burst Hannigan, eyes\nhot with excitement. And his cry dispelled Greg's final hopes for\nsafety.\n\"Everybody\u2014the Number Four life-skiff\u2014\nquick\n! We've been caught in a\ngrav-drag and we're going to crash!\"\nII\nThose next hectic moments were never afterward very clear in Greg\nMalcolm's memory. He had a confused recollection of hearing Sparks'\nwarning punctuated by a loud, shrill scream which he vaguely identified\nas emanating from Mrs. Andrews' throat ... he was conscious of feeling,\nsuddenly, beneath his feet the sickening, quickening lurch of a ship\nout of control, gripped by gravitational forces beyond its power to\nallay ... he recalled his own voice dinning in his ears as, incredibly,\nwith Sparks, he took command of the hasty flight from the dining dome\ndown the corridor to the aft ramp, up the ramp, across girdered beams\nin the super-structure to the small, independently motored rocket-skiff\ncradled there.\nHe was aware, too, of strangely disconnected incidents happening around\nhim, he being a part of them but seeming to be only a disinterested\nspectator to their strangeness. Of his forcing Maud Andrews toward\nthe door of the dome ... of her pushing back against him with all the\nweight of her body ... of her irate voice, \"Cuddles! I forgot him!\"\nThen the shrill excited yapping of the poodle cradled against her as\nthey charged on down the corridor.\nJ. Foster waddling beside him, tugging at his arm, panting, \"The\nofficers?\" and his own unfelt assurance. \"They can take care of\nthemselves. It's a general 'bandon ship.\" Enid Andrews stumbling over\nthe hem of a filmy peignoir ... himself bending to lift her boldly and\nbodily, sweating palms feeling the warm animal heat of her excited\nbody hot beneath them ... Crystal Andrews stopping suddenly, crying,\n\"'Tina!\" ... and Hannigan's reply, \"Your maid? I woke her. She's in the\nlife-skiff.\" Bert Andrews stopping suddenly, being sick in the middle\nof the corridor, his drunkenness losing itself in the thick, sure\nnausea of the ever-increasing unsteadiness beneath their feet.\nThen the life-skiff, the clang of metal as Hannigan slammed the\nport behind the last of them, the fumbling for a lock-stud, the\nquick, grateful pant of the miniature hypos, and a weird feeling of\nweightlessness, rushingness, hurtlingness as his eardrums throbbed and\nhis mouth tasted brassy and bloody with the fierce velocity of their\nescape.\nSense and meaning returned only when all this ended. As one waking from\na nightmare dream, Greg Malcolm returned to a world he could recognize.\nA tiny world, encased within the walls of a forty-foot life-skiff. A\nworld peopled too scantily. Andrews, his wife and sister, his son and\ndaughter; 'Tina Laney, the maid; Breadon, Hannigan, young Tommy O'Doul,\nthe cabin-boy (though where he had come from, or when, Greg did not\nknow). And himself. In a life-skiff. In space.\nSomewhere in space. He looked through the\nperilens\n. What he saw then\nhe might better never have seen. For that shimmering pink-ochre veil\nhad wisped away, now, and in the clean, cold, bitter-clear light of a\ndistant sun he watched the death-dive of the yacht\nCarefree\n.\nLike a vast silver top, spinning heedlessly, wildly, it streaked toward\na mottled gray and green, brown and dun, hard and crushing-brutal\nterrain below. Still at its helm stood someone, for even in that last\ndreadful moment burst from its nose-jets a ruddy mushroom of flame that\ntried to, but could not, brake the dizzy fall.\nFor an instant Greg's eyes, stingingly blinded and wet, thought they\nglimpsed a wee black mote dancing from the bowels of the\nCarefree\n; a\nmote that might be another skiff like their own. But he could not be\nsure, and then the\nCarefree\nwas accelerating with such violence and\nspeed that the eye could see it only as a flaming silver lance against\nthe ugly earth-carcase beneath, and then it struck and a carmine bud of\nflame burst and flowered for an instant, and that was all....\nAnd Greg Malcolm turned from the\nperilens\n, shaken.\nHannigan said, \"It's over?\" and Greg nodded.\nHannigan said, \"The other skiffs? Did they break free, or were they\ncaught?\"\n\"I don't know. I couldn't see for sure.\"\n\"You must have seen. Are we the only ones?\"\n\"I couldn't see for sure. Maybe. Maybe not.\"\nThen a body scrambled forward, pressing through the tightness of other\nhuddled bodies, and there was a hand upon his elbow. \"I'll take over\nnow, Malcolm.\"\nIt was Ralph Breadon. Gregory looked at him slowly, uncomprehendingly\nat first. His hand was reluctant to leave the guiding-gear of the\nsmall ship which was, now, all that remained to them of civilization\nand civilization's wondrous accomplishments. He had not realized until\nthis moment that for a while ... for a short, eager, pulse-quickening\nwhile ... on his alertness, in his hands, had depended the destinies\nof ten men and women. But he knew, suddenly and completely, that it\nwas for this single moment his whole lifetime had waited. It was for\nthis brief moment of command that some intuition, some instinct greater\nthan knowledge, had prepared him. This was why he, an Earthlubber, had\nstudied astrogation, made a hobby of the empire of the stars. That he\nmight be fitted to command when all others failed. And now\u2014\nAnd now the moment was past, and he was once again Gregory Malcolm,\nmild, lean, pale, bespectacled secretary to J. Foster Andrews. And the\nman at his side was Ralph Breadon, socialite and gentleman sportsman,\ntrained pilot. And in Malcolm the habit of obedience was strong....\n\"Very well, sir,\" he said. And he turned over the controls.\nWhat happened then was unfortunate. It might just as well have happened\nto Malcolm, though afterward no one could ever say with certainty.\nHowever that was, either by carelessness or malfortune or inefficiency,\nonce-thwarted disaster struck again at the little party on the\nlife-skiff. At the instant Breadon's hand seized the controls the skiff\njerked suddenly as though struck with a ponderous fist, its throbbing\nmotors choked and snarled in a high, rising crescendo of torment that\nlost itself in supersonic heights, and the ship that had been drifting\neasily and under control to the planet beneath now dipped viciously.\nThe misfortune was that too many huddled in the tiny space understood\nthe operation of the life-skiff, and what must be done instantly. And\nthat neither pilot was as yet in control of the ship. Breadon's hand\nleaped for the Dixie rod, so, too, did Malcolm's\u2014and across both their\nbodies came the arm of Sparks Hannigan, searching the controls.\nIn the scramble someone's sleeve brushed the banks of control-keys. The\nmotors, killed, soughed into silence. The ship rocked into a spin. Greg\ncried out, his voice a strange harshness in his ears; Breadon cursed;\none of the women bleated fearfully.\nThen Breadon, still cursing, fought all hands from the controls but his\nown. And the man was not without courage. For all could see plainly,\nin the illumined\nperilens\n, how near to swift death that moment of\nuncertainty had led them. The skiff, which an instant before had been\nhigh in the stratosphere of this unknown planet ... or satellite\nor whatever it might be ... was now flashing toward hard ground at\nlightning speed.\nOnly a miracle, Greg knew, could save them now. An impulse spun his\nhead, he looked at Crystal Andrews. There was no fear in her eyes. Just\na hotness and an inexplicable anger. Beside her was the other girl, the\nmaid, 'Tina; she was frankly afraid. Her teeth were clenched in her\nnether lip, and her eyes were wide and anxious, but she did not cry out.\nOnly a miracle could save them now. But Breadon's hands performed\nthat miracle; his quick, nerveless, trained hands. A stud here ...\na lever there ... a swift wrenching toss of the shoulders. His face\ntwisted back over his shoulder, and his straining lips pulled taut\nand bloodless away from his teeth. \"Hold tight, folks! We're going to\nbounce\u2014\"\nThen they struck!\nBut they struck glancingly, as Breadon had hoped, and planned for,\nand gambled on. They struck and bounced. The frail craft shivered\nand groaned in metal agony, jarred across harsh soil, bounced again,\nsettled, nosed over and rocked to a standstill. Somewhere forward\nsomething snapped with a shrill, high\nping!\nof stress; somewhere aft\nwas the metallic flap-clanging of broken gear trailing behind them. But\nthey were safe.\nBreath, held so long that he could not remember its inhalation, escaped\nGreg's lungs in a long sigh. \"Nice work, Mr. Breadon!\" he cried. \"Oh,\nnice work!\"\nBut surprisingly, savagely, Breadon turned on him.\n\"It would have been\nbetter\nwork, Malcolm, if you'd kept your damned\nhands off the controls! Now see what you've done? Smashed up our skiff!\nOur only\u2014\"\n\"He didn't do it!\" piped the shrill voice of Tommy O'Doul. \"You done it\nyourself, Mr. Breadon. Your sleeve. It caught the switch.\"\n\"Quiet!\" Breadon, cheeks flushed, reached out smartly, stilled\nthe youngster's defense with a swift, ungentle slap. \"And you,\nMalcolm\u2014after this, do as you're told, and don't try to assume\nresponsibilities too great for you. All right, everybody. Let's get out\nand see how bad the damage is.\"\nInstinctively Greg had surged a half step forward as Breadon silenced\nthe cabin boy. Now old habit and common-sense halted him. He's\noverwrought, he reasoned. We're all excited and on edge. We've been to\nBedlam. Our nerves are shot. In a little while we'll all be back to\nnormal.\nHe said quietly, \"Very well, Mr. Breadon.\" And he climbed from the\nbroken skiff.\nHannigan said, \"Looks bad, don't it?\"\n\"Very,\" said Malcolm. He fingered a shard of loose metal flapping like\na fin from the stern of the skiff. \"Not hopeless, though. There should\nbe an acetylene torch in the tool locker. With that\u2014\"\n\"You ought to of poked him,\" said Hannigan.\n\"What? Oh, you mean\u2014?\"\n\"Yeah. The kid was right, you know. He done it.\"\n\"His sleeve, you mean. Well, it was an accident,\" said Greg. \"It could\nhave happened to anyone. And he made a good landing. Considering\neverything. Anyhow\u2014\" Again he was Gregory Malcolm, serious-faced,\nefficient secretary. \"Anyhow, we have been thrust into an extremely\nprecarious circumstance. It would be silly to take umbrage at a man's\nnervous anger. We must have no quarreling, no bickering\u2014\"\n\"Umbrage!\" snorted Sparks. \"Bickering! They're big words. I ain't sure\nI know what they mean. I ain't exactly sure they mean\nanything\n.\" He\nglanced at Greg oddly. \"You're a queer jasper, Malcolm. Back there\non the ship, I figured you for a sort of a stuffed-shirt. Yes-man to\nthe boss. And then in the show-down, you come through like a movie\nhero\u2014for a little while. Then you let that Breadon guy give you the\nspur without a squawk\u2014\"\nMalcolm adjusted his plasta-rimmed spectacles. He said, almost\nstubbornly, \"Our situation is grave. There must be no bickering.\"\n\"Bickering your Aunt Jenny! What do you call that?\"\nSparks jerked a contemptuous thumb toward the group from which they\nwere separated. Upon disembarking, only Greg and Sparks had moved to\nmake a careful examination of their damaged craft. The others, more\nor less under the direction of Breadon, were making gestures toward\nremoving certain necessaries from the skiff. Their efforts, slight and\nuncertain as they were, had already embroiled them in argument.\nThe gist of their argument, so far as Greg Malcolm could determine, was\nthat everyone wanted \"something\" to be done, but no two could agree as\nto just what that something was, and no one seemed to have any bursting\ndesire to participate in actual physical labor.\nJ. Foster Andrews, all traces of his former panic and confusion fled,\nwas planted firmly, Napoleonically, some few yards from the open port\nof the life-skiff, barking impatient orders at little Tommy O'Doul\nwho\u2014as Greg watched\u2014stumbled from the port bearing a huge armload of\nedibles.\n'Tina, the maid, was in a frenzy of motion, trying to administer to the\ncomplaints and demands of Mrs. Andrews (whose immaculate hair-do had\nsuffered in the frenetic minutes of their flight) and Crystal Andrews\n(who knew perfectly well there were sweaters in the life-skiff) and\nMiss Maud (who wanted a can of prepared dog-food and a can-opener\nimmediately, and look at poor Cuddles, momsy's 'ittle pet was\nso\nhungry)!\nBert Andrews was sulkily insisting that it was nonsense to leave the\nwarmth and security of the skiff anyway, and he wished he had a drink,\nwhile the harassed, self-appointed commander of the refugee corps was\nshouting at whomever happened, at any given moment, to capture his\ndivided and completely frantic attention. His orders were masterpieces\nof confusion, developing around one premise that the castaway crew\nshould immediately set up a camp. Where, how, or with what nonexistent\nequipment, Breadon did not venture to say.\n\"You see what I mean?\" demanded Sparks disgustedly.\nGreg Malcolm saw. He also saw other things. That their landing-spot,\nwhile excellent for its purpose, was not by any manner of means an\nideal campsite. It was a small, flat basin of sandy soil, rimmed by\nshallow mountains. His gaze sought these hills, looked approvingly on\ntheir greenness, upon the multitude of dark pock-marks dotting them.\nThese caves, were they not the habitations of potential enemies, might\nwell become the sanctuaries of spacewrecked men.\nHe saw, also, a thin ribbon of silver sheering the face of the northern\nhills. His gaze, rising still skyward, saw other things\u2014\nHe nodded. He knew, now, where they were. Or approximately. There was\nbut one planet in the solar system which boasted such a phenomenon. The\napparent distance of the Sun, judged by its diminished disc, argued\nhis judgment to be correct. The fact that they had surged through an\natmospheric belt for some length of time before finally meeting with\ndisaster.\n\"Titan,\" he said. \"Hyperion possibly. But probably Titan.\"\nSparks' gaze, following Greg's upward, contracted in an expression of\ndismay.\n\"Dirty cow! You mean that's where we are?\"\n\"I believe so. There's Saturn, our mother planet, looming above us as\nlarge as a dinner plate. And the grav-drag here is almost Earth norm.\nTitan has a 3,000 mile diameter. That, combined with the Saturnian\ntractile constant, would give us a strong pull.\"\nSparks wailed, \"But Titan! Great morning, Malcolm, nobody ever comes\nto Titan! There ain't no mines here, no colonies, no\u2014\" He stopped\nsuddenly, his eyes widening yet farther. \"And, hey\u2014this place is\ndangerous\n! There are\u2014\"\n\"I know it,\" said Greg swiftly, quietly. \"Shut up, Sparks. No use\ntelling the others. If they don't guess it themselves, what they don't\nknow won't alarm them. We've got to do something, though. Get ourselves\norganized into a defensive community. That's the only way\u2014\"\nRalph Breadon's sharp, dictatorial voice interrupted him. \"Well,\nMalcolm, stop soldiering and make yourself useful!\"\nAnd J. Foster, not to have his authority usurped, supplemented the\norder. \"Yes, Malcolm, let's get going! No time for day-dreaming, my\nman. We want action!\"\nSparks said, \"Maybe you'll get it now, fatty!\" under his breath, and\nlooked at Malcolm hopefully. But his companion merely nodded, moved\nforward toward the others, quietly obedient to the command.\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said.\nHannigan groaned and followed him.\nIII\nBreadon said, \"All right, Tommy, dump them here. I have a few words to\nsay.\" He glanced about him pompously. \"Now, folks, naturally we want\nto get away from here as soon as possible. Therefore I delegate you,\nSparks, to immediately get a message off. An SOS to the nearest space\ncruiser.\"\nHannigan grinned. It was not a pleasant grin. He took his time\nanswering. He spat thoughtfully on the ground before him, lifted his\nhead. He said, \"A message, huh?\"\n\"That's what I said.\"\n\"And what'll I send it with?\" drawled Sparks. \"Tom-toms?\"\nBreadon flushed darkly.\n\"I believe the life-skiff was equipped with a radio? And theoretically\nyou are a radio operator?\"\n\"Finest radio money can buy!\" interpolated J. Foster Andrews proudly.\n\"Put a million credits into the\nCarefree\n. Best equipment throughout.\"\nSparks looked from one to another of them, grinned insolently. \"You're\nboth right. I\nam\na radio operator, and there\nwas\na radio. But we\ncrashed, remember? On account of some dope's sleeve got caught in the\nmaster switch\u2014\"\n\"That will do!\" snapped Breadon angrily. He stared at the bandy-legged\nlittle redhead. \"You mean the radio was broken?\"\n\"It wasn't helped none. The tubes was made out of glass, and glass\ndon't bounce so good.\"\nGreg Malcolm said thoughtfully, \"Sparks, can't you fix it?\"\n\"Well, mebbe. But not in five minutes. Maybe not in five years. I won't\nknow till I get going on it.\"\nBreadon frowned.\n\"I'll handle this, Malcolm,\" he crisped. Again to the radioman, \"Well,\nyou get to work on it immediately. And as soon as you get it fixed,\nsend out an SOS advising the patrol where we are\u2014\"\n\"Speaking of which,\" insinuated Sparks, \"where are we?\"\nBreadon glared at him wrathfully.\n\"Why\u2014why on one of the satellites of Saturn, of course. Any fool can\nsee that!\"\n\"O.Q. But does any fool know which one? Or shall I tell you it's Titan?\nAnd when you know that, then what? Titan wasn't named that on account\nof it was a pimple. It's a big place. What'll I tell the Patrol?\nSOS.\nStranded in the middle of we-don't-know-where, somewhere on Titan,\nmaybe.\nThey'll be hunting for us till we've got whiskers down to our\nknees.\"\nBreadon's irate look vanished. He looked stricken. He said, \"I\u2014I don't\nknow. We have a compass\u2014\"\nOnce again it was Gregory Malcolm who entered into the conversation. He\nhad been toying, almost absentmindedly, with a funnel taken from the\nskiff's stores. Into this he had poured a small portion of water; his\nright forefinger was pressed to the bottom of the tube, closing it. He\nsaid, \"I can answer part of that question now. Enough to cut the search\nin half, anyway. We're in the northern hemisphere of the satellite.\"\nMaud Andrews looked at him sharply as if noticing him for the first\ntime in her life.\n\"How,\" she asked, \"did you know that, Malcolm?\"\n", "summary": "The who are on a mission to destroy the people of Titan. The story begins with a spaceman, Sparks, complaining about the state of the ship. He is then joined by his colleague, Gregory Malcolm, who is also complaining about how the ship is not doing well. The two men discuss the state the ship in and how they are trying to communicate with the people on Titan. They discuss the possibility of using a radio to communicate. They are then joined in the attack by the Vortices. The Vortice attack makes them lose all communication. They run out of air and are trapped in a small dome. They attempt to escape but are unable. They then run out. They find themselves in a cave with only a thin layer of air left. They begin to panic and run out, but are soon joined by the men. They manage to escape and run to the surface. They wake up in a large cave. They see that the Vortex attack them. They hear the men screaming and run outside. They make their way to the radio tower. They receive a transmission from the VV. They ask the men to help them. The men are able to communicate and make their escape. They return to the ship and find a large supply of supplies. They prepare to leave. They have to find a way to communicate since the Vve is a powerful weapon. They use a knife to cut through the plastic of the dome.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, null, 0, 0]}

And the\nman who assumed command was Gregory Malcolm, the\nbespectacled secretary\u2014whose only adventures\nhad come through the pages of a book.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Spring 1944.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nSparks snapped off the switches and followed him to the door of the\nradio turret. Sparks was a stunted, usually-grinning, little redhead\nnamed Hannigan. But he wasn't grinning now. He laid an anxious hand on\nGreg's arm. \"If I was you,\" he said, \"if I was you, Malcolm, I don't\nthink I'd say nothing to the boss about this. Not just yet, anyhow.\"\nGreg said, \"Why not?\"\nSparks spluttered and fussed and made heavy weather of answering.\n\"Well, for one thing, it ain't important. It would only worry him. And\nthen there's the womenfolks, they scare easy. Which of course they\nain't no cause to. Atmospherics don't mean nothing. I've rode out\nworse storms than this\u2014plenty of times. And in worse crates than the\nCarefree\n.\"\nGreg studied him carefully from behind trim plasta-rimmed spectacles.\nHe drew a deep breath. He said levelly, \"So it's\nthat\nbad, eh,\nSparks?\"\n\"What bad? I just told you\u2014\"\n\"I know. Sparks, I'm not a professional spaceman. But I've studied\nastrogation as few Earthlubbers have. It's been my hobby for years. And\nI think I know what we're up against.\n\"We hit a warp-eddy last night. We've been trapped in a vortex for\nmore than eight hours. Lord only knows how many hundreds of thousands\nof miles we've been borne off our course. And now we've blasted into a\nsuper-ionized belt of atmospherics. Your radio signals are blanketed.\nYou can't get signals in or out. We're a deaf-mute speck of metal being\nwhirled headlong through space. Isn't that it?\"\n\"I don't know what\u2014\" began Sparks hotly. Then he stopped, studied his\ncompanion thoughtfully, nodded. \"O.Q.,\" he confessed, \"that's it. But\nwe ain't licked yet. We got three good men on the bridge. Townsend ...\nGraves ... Langhorn. They'll pull out of this if anybody can. And they\nain't no sense in scaring the Old Man and his family.\"\n\"I won't tell them,\" said Greg. \"I won't tell them unless I have to.\nBut between you and me, what are the odds against us, Sparks?\"\nThe radioman shrugged.\n\"Who knows? Vortices are unpredictable. Maybe the damn thing will toss\nus out on the very spot it picked us up. Maybe it will give us the old\nchuckeroo a million miles the other side of Pluto. Maybe it will crack\nus up on an asteroid or satellite. No way of telling till it happens.\"\n\"And the controls?\"\n\"As useless,\" said Sparks, \"as a cow in a cyclone.\"\n\"So?\"\n\"We sit tight,\" said Sparks succinctly, \"and hope.\"\nMalcolm nodded quietly. He took off his spectacles, breathed on them,\nwiped them, replaced them. He was tall and fair; in his neat, crisply\npressed business suit he appeared even slimmer than he was. But there\nwas no nervousness in his movements. He moved measuredly. \"Well,\" he\nsaid, \"that appears to be that. I'm going up to the dining dome.\"\nSparks stared at him querulously.\n\"You're a queer duck, Malcolm. I don't think you've got a nerve in your\nbody.\"\n\"Nerves are a luxury I can't afford,\" replied Greg. \"If anything\nhappens\u2014and if there's time to do so\u2014let me know.\" He paused at the\ndoor. \"Good luck,\" he said.\n\"Clear ether!\" said Sparks mechanically. He stared after the other man\nwonderingly for a long moment, then went back to his control banks,\nshaking his head and muttering.\nGregory Malcolm climbed down the Jacob's-ladder and strode briskly\nthrough the labyrinthine corridors that were the entrails of the\nspace yacht\nCarefree\n. He paused once to peer through a\nperilens\nset into the ship's port plates. It was a weird sight that met his\ngaze. Not space, ebony-black and bejewelled with a myriad flaming\nsplotches of color; not the old, familiar constellations treading\ntheir ever-lasting, inexorable paths about the perimeter of Sol's\ntiny universe, but a shimmering webwork of light, so tortured-violet\nthat the eyes ached to look upon it. This was the mad typhoon of\nspace-atmospherics through which the\nCarefree\nwas now being twisted,\ntopsy-turvy, toward a nameless goal.\nHe moved on, approaching at last the quartzite-paned observation\nrotunda which was the dining dome of the ship.\nHis footsteps slowed as he composed himself to face those within. As\nhe hesitated in the dimly-lighted passage, a trick of lights on glass\nmirrored to him the room beyond. He could see the others while they\nwere as yet unaware of his presence. Their voices reached him clearly.\nJ. Foster Andrews, his employer and the employer of the ten thousand\nor more men and women who worked for Galactic Metals Corporation,\ndominated the head of the table. He was a plump, impatient little\nNapoleon. Opposite him, calm, graceful, serene, tastefully garbed and\nelaborately coiffured even here in deep space, three weeks from the\nnearest beauty shop, sat his wife, Enid.\nOn Andrews' right sat his sister, Maud. Not young, features plain as a\nmud fence, but charming despite her age and homeliness simply because\nof her eyes; puckish, shrewdly intelligent eyes, constantly aglint with\nsuppressed humor at\u2014guessed Greg\u2014the amusing foibles and frailties of\nthose about her.\nShe gave her breakfast the enthusiastic attention of one too old and\nshapeless to be concerned with such folderol as calories and dietetics,\npausing only from time to time to share smidgeons of food with a\nwatery-eyed scrap of white, curly fluff beside her chair. Her pet\npoodle, whom she called by the opprobrious title of \"Cuddles.\"\nOn J. Foster's left sat his daughter, Crystal. She it was who caused\nGregory Malcolm's staid, respectable heart to give a little lurch as\nhe glimpsed her reflected vision\u2014all gold and crimson and cream\u2014in\nthe glistening walls. If Crystal was her name, so, too, was crystal her\nloveliness.\nBut\u2014Greg shook his head\u2014but she was not for him. She was already\npledged to the young man seated beside her. Ralph Breadon. He turned\nto murmur something to her as Greg watched; Greg saw and admired and\ndisliked his rangy height, his sturdy, well-knit strength, the rich\nbrownness of his skin, his hair, his eyes.\nThe sound of his own name startled Greg.\n\"Malcolm!\" called the man at the head of the table. \"Malcolm! Now where\nin blazes is he, anyhow?\" he demanded of no one in particular, everyone\nin general. He spooned a dab of liquid gold from a Limoges preserve\njar, tongued it suspiciously, frowned. \"Bitter!\" he complained.\n\"It's the very\nbest\nMartian honey,\" said his wife.\n\"Drylands clover,\" added Crystal.\n\"It's still bitter,\" said J. Foster petulantly.\nHis sister sniffed. \"Nonsense! It's delightful.\"\n\"I say it's bitter,\" repeated Andrews sulkily. And lifted his voice\nagain. \"\nMalcolm!\nWhere\nare\nyou?\"\n\"You called me, sir?\" said Malcolm, moving into the room. He nodded\npolitely to the others. \"Good morning, Mrs. Andrews ... Miss\nAndrews ... Mr. Breadon....\"\n\"Oh, sit down!\" snapped J. Foster. \"Sit down here and stop bobbing your\nhead like a teetotum! Had your breakfast? The honey's no good; it's\nbitter.\" He glared at his sister challengingly. \"Where have you been,\nanyway? What kind of secretary are you? Have you been up to the radio\nturret? How's the market today? Is Galactic up or down?\"\nMalcolm said, \"I don't know, sir.\"\n\"Fine! Fine!\" Andrews rattled on automatically before the words\nregistered. Then he started, his face turning red. \"Eh? What's that?\nDon't know! What do you mean, you don't know? I pay you to\u2014\"\n\"There's no transmission, sir,\" said Greg quietly.\n\"No trans\u2014nonsense! Of course there's transmission! I put a million\ncredits into this ship. Finest space-yacht ever built. Latest equipment\nthroughout. Sparks is drunk, that's what you mean! Well, you hop right\nup there and\u2014\"\nMaud Andrews put down her fork with a clatter. \"Oh, for goodness sakes,\nJonathan, shut up and give the boy time to explain! He's standing\nthere with his mouth gaping like a rain-spout, trying to get a word in\nedgewise! What's the trouble, Gregory?\" She turned to Greg, as Jonathan\nFoster Andrews wheezed into startled silence. \"\nThat?\n\"\nShe glanced at the quartzite dome, beyond which the veil of iridescence\nwove and cross-wove and shimmered like a pallid aurora.\nGreg nodded. \"Yes, Miss Andrews.\"\nEnid Andrews spoke languidly from the other end of the table.\n\"But what is it, Gregory? A local phenomenon?\"\n\"You might call it that,\" said Greg, selecting his words cautiously.\n\"It's an ionized field into which we've blasted. It\u2014it\u2014shouldn't stay\nwith us long. But while it persists, our radio will be blanketed out.\"\nBreadon's chestnut head came up suddenly, sharply.\n\"Ionization! That means atmosphere!\"\nGreg said, \"Yes.\"\n\"And an atmosphere means a body in space somewhere near\u2014\" Breadon\nstopped, bit his lip before the appeal in Malcolm's eyes, tried to pass\nit off easily. \"Oh, well\u2014a change of scenery, what?\"\nBut the moment of alarm in his voice had not passed unnoticed. Crystal\nAndrews spoke for all of them, her voice preternaturally quiet.\n\"You're hiding something, Malcolm. What is it? Is there\u2014danger?\"\nBut Greg didn't have to answer that question. From the doorway a harsh,\ndefiantly strident voice answered for him. The voice of Bert Andrews,\nCrystal's older brother.\n\"Danger? You're damn right there's danger! What's the matter with\nyou folks\u2014are you all deaf, dumb and blind? We've been caught in a\nspace-vortex for hours. Now we're in the H-layer of a planet we can't\neven see\u2014and in fifteen minutes or fifteen seconds we may all be\nsmashed as flat as pancakes!\"\nThe proclamation brought them out of their chairs. Greg's heart sank;\nhis vain plea, \"Mr. Andrews\u2014\" was lost in the medley of Crystal's\nsudden gasp, Enid Andrews' short, choking scream, J. Foster's bellowing\nroar at his only son.\n\"Bert\u2014you're drunk!\"\nBert weaved precariously from the doorway, laughed in his father's face.\n\"Sure I'm drunk! Why not? If you're smart you'll get drunk, too. The\nwhole damn lot of you!\" He flicked a derisive hand toward Greg. \"You\ntoo, Boy Scout! What were you trying to do\u2014hide the bad news from\nthem? Well, it's no use. Everybody might as well know the worst. We're\ngone gooses ... geeses ... aw, what the hell! Dead ducks!\" He fell\ninto a chair, sprawled there laughing mirthlessly with fear riding the\ntoo-high notes of his laughter.\nJ. Foster turned to his secretary slowly. His ire had faded; there was\nonly deep concern in his voice.\n\"Is he telling the truth, Malcolm?\"\nGreg said soberly, \"Partly, sir. He's overstating the danger\u2014but\nthere is danger. We are caught in a space-vortex, and as Mr.\nBreadon realized, the presence of these ionics means we're in the\nHeaviside-layer of some heavenly body. But we may not crack up.\"\nMaud Andrews glanced at him shrewdly.\n\"Is there anything we can do?\"\n\"Not a thing. The officers on the bridge are doing everything possible.\"\n\"In that case,\" said the older woman, \"we might as well finish our\nbreakfast. Here, Cuddles! Come to momsy!\" She sat down again. Greg\nlooked at her admiringly. Ralph Breadon stroked his brown jaw. He said,\n\"The life-skiffs?\"\n\"A last resort,\" said Greg. \"Sparks promised he'd let me know if it\nwere necessary. We'll hope it's not\u2014\"\nBut it was a vain hope, vainly spoken in the last, vain moment. For\neven as he phrased the hopeful words, came the sound of swift, racing\nfootsteps up the corridor. Into the dining dome burst Hannigan, eyes\nhot with excitement. And his cry dispelled Greg's final hopes for\nsafety.\n\"Everybody\u2014the Number Four life-skiff\u2014\nquick\n! We've been caught in a\ngrav-drag and we're going to crash!\"\nII\nThose next hectic moments were never afterward very clear in Greg\nMalcolm's memory. He had a confused recollection of hearing Sparks'\nwarning punctuated by a loud, shrill scream which he vaguely identified\nas emanating from Mrs. Andrews' throat ... he was conscious of feeling,\nsuddenly, beneath his feet the sickening, quickening lurch of a ship\nout of control, gripped by gravitational forces beyond its power to\nallay ... he recalled his own voice dinning in his ears as, incredibly,\nwith Sparks, he took command of the hasty flight from the dining dome\ndown the corridor to the aft ramp, up the ramp, across girdered beams\nin the super-structure to the small, independently motored rocket-skiff\ncradled there.\nHe was aware, too, of strangely disconnected incidents happening around\nhim, he being a part of them but seeming to be only a disinterested\nspectator to their strangeness. Of his forcing Maud Andrews toward\nthe door of the dome ... of her pushing back against him with all the\nweight of her body ... of her irate voice, \"Cuddles! I forgot him!\"\nThen the shrill excited yapping of the poodle cradled against her as\nthey charged on down the corridor.\nJ. Foster waddling beside him, tugging at his arm, panting, \"The\nofficers?\" and his own unfelt assurance. \"They can take care of\nthemselves. It's a general 'bandon ship.\" Enid Andrews stumbling over\nthe hem of a filmy peignoir ... himself bending to lift her boldly and\nbodily, sweating palms feeling the warm animal heat of her excited\nbody hot beneath them ... Crystal Andrews stopping suddenly, crying,\n\"'Tina!\" ... and Hannigan's reply, \"Your maid? I woke her. She's in the\nlife-skiff.\" Bert Andrews stopping suddenly, being sick in the middle\nof the corridor, his drunkenness losing itself in the thick, sure\nnausea of the ever-increasing unsteadiness beneath their feet.\nThen the life-skiff, the clang of metal as Hannigan slammed the\nport behind the last of them, the fumbling for a lock-stud, the\nquick, grateful pant of the miniature hypos, and a weird feeling of\nweightlessness, rushingness, hurtlingness as his eardrums throbbed and\nhis mouth tasted brassy and bloody with the fierce velocity of their\nescape.\nSense and meaning returned only when all this ended. As one waking from\na nightmare dream, Greg Malcolm returned to a world he could recognize.\nA tiny world, encased within the walls of a forty-foot life-skiff. A\nworld peopled too scantily. Andrews, his wife and sister, his son and\ndaughter; 'Tina Laney, the maid; Breadon, Hannigan, young Tommy O'Doul,\nthe cabin-boy (though where he had come from, or when, Greg did not\nknow). And himself. In a life-skiff. In space.\nSomewhere in space. He looked through the\nperilens\n. What he saw then\nhe might better never have seen. For that shimmering pink-ochre veil\nhad wisped away, now, and in the clean, cold, bitter-clear light of a\ndistant sun he watched the death-dive of the yacht\nCarefree\n.\nLike a vast silver top, spinning heedlessly, wildly, it streaked toward\na mottled gray and green, brown and dun, hard and crushing-brutal\nterrain below. Still at its helm stood someone, for even in that last\ndreadful moment burst from its nose-jets a ruddy mushroom of flame that\ntried to, but could not, brake the dizzy fall.\nFor an instant Greg's eyes, stingingly blinded and wet, thought they\nglimpsed a wee black mote dancing from the bowels of the\nCarefree\n; a\nmote that might be another skiff like their own. But he could not be\nsure, and then the\nCarefree\nwas accelerating with such violence and\nspeed that the eye could see it only as a flaming silver lance against\nthe ugly earth-carcase beneath, and then it struck and a carmine bud of\nflame burst and flowered for an instant, and that was all....\nAnd Greg Malcolm turned from the\nperilens\n, shaken.\nHannigan said, \"It's over?\" and Greg nodded.\nHannigan said, \"The other skiffs? Did they break free, or were they\ncaught?\"\n\"I don't know. I couldn't see for sure.\"\n\"You must have seen. Are we the only ones?\"\n\"I couldn't see for sure. Maybe. Maybe not.\"\nThen a body scrambled forward, pressing through the tightness of other\nhuddled bodies, and there was a hand upon his elbow. \"I'll take over\nnow, Malcolm.\"\nIt was Ralph Breadon. Gregory looked at him slowly, uncomprehendingly\nat first. His hand was reluctant to leave the guiding-gear of the\nsmall ship which was, now, all that remained to them of civilization\nand civilization's wondrous accomplishments. He had not realized until\nthis moment that for a while ... for a short, eager, pulse-quickening\nwhile ... on his alertness, in his hands, had depended the destinies\nof ten men and women. But he knew, suddenly and completely, that it\nwas for this single moment his whole lifetime had waited. It was for\nthis brief moment of command that some intuition, some instinct greater\nthan knowledge, had prepared him. This was why he, an Earthlubber, had\nstudied astrogation, made a hobby of the empire of the stars. That he\nmight be fitted to command when all others failed. And now\u2014\nAnd now the moment was past, and he was once again Gregory Malcolm,\nmild, lean, pale, bespectacled secretary to J. Foster Andrews. And the\nman at his side was Ralph Breadon, socialite and gentleman sportsman,\ntrained pilot. And in Malcolm the habit of obedience was strong....\n\"Very well, sir,\" he said. And he turned over the controls.\nWhat happened then was unfortunate. It might just as well have happened\nto Malcolm, though afterward no one could ever say with certainty.\nHowever that was, either by carelessness or malfortune or inefficiency,\nonce-thwarted disaster struck again at the little party on the\nlife-skiff. At the instant Breadon's hand seized the controls the skiff\njerked suddenly as though struck with a ponderous fist, its throbbing\nmotors choked and snarled in a high, rising crescendo of torment that\nlost itself in supersonic heights, and the ship that had been drifting\neasily and under control to the planet beneath now dipped viciously.\nThe misfortune was that too many huddled in the tiny space understood\nthe operation of the life-skiff, and what must be done instantly. And\nthat neither pilot was as yet in control of the ship. Breadon's hand\nleaped for the Dixie rod, so, too, did Malcolm's\u2014and across both their\nbodies came the arm of Sparks Hannigan, searching the controls.\nIn the scramble someone's sleeve brushed the banks of control-keys. The\nmotors, killed, soughed into silence. The ship rocked into a spin. Greg\ncried out, his voice a strange harshness in his ears; Breadon cursed;\none of the women bleated fearfully.\nThen Breadon, still cursing, fought all hands from the controls but his\nown. And the man was not without courage. For all could see plainly,\nin the illumined\nperilens\n, how near to swift death that moment of\nuncertainty had led them. The skiff, which an instant before had been\nhigh in the stratosphere of this unknown planet ... or satellite\nor whatever it might be ... was now flashing toward hard ground at\nlightning speed.\nOnly a miracle, Greg knew, could save them now. An impulse spun his\nhead, he looked at Crystal Andrews. There was no fear in her eyes. Just\na hotness and an inexplicable anger. Beside her was the other girl, the\nmaid, 'Tina; she was frankly afraid. Her teeth were clenched in her\nnether lip, and her eyes were wide and anxious, but she did not cry out.\nOnly a miracle could save them now. But Breadon's hands performed\nthat miracle; his quick, nerveless, trained hands. A stud here ...\na lever there ... a swift wrenching toss of the shoulders. His face\ntwisted back over his shoulder, and his straining lips pulled taut\nand bloodless away from his teeth. \"Hold tight, folks! We're going to\nbounce\u2014\"\nThen they struck!\nBut they struck glancingly, as Breadon had hoped, and planned for,\nand gambled on. They struck and bounced. The frail craft shivered\nand groaned in metal agony, jarred across harsh soil, bounced again,\nsettled, nosed over and rocked to a standstill. Somewhere forward\nsomething snapped with a shrill, high\nping!\nof stress; somewhere aft\nwas the metallic flap-clanging of broken gear trailing behind them. But\nthey were safe.\nBreath, held so long that he could not remember its inhalation, escaped\nGreg's lungs in a long sigh. \"Nice work, Mr. Breadon!\" he cried. \"Oh,\nnice work!\"\nBut surprisingly, savagely, Breadon turned on him.\n\"It would have been\nbetter\nwork, Malcolm, if you'd kept your damned\nhands off the controls! Now see what you've done? Smashed up our skiff!\nOur only\u2014\"\n\"He didn't do it!\" piped the shrill voice of Tommy O'Doul. \"You done it\nyourself, Mr. Breadon. Your sleeve. It caught the switch.\"\n\"Quiet!\" Breadon, cheeks flushed, reached out smartly, stilled\nthe youngster's defense with a swift, ungentle slap. \"And you,\nMalcolm\u2014after this, do as you're told, and don't try to assume\nresponsibilities too great for you. All right, everybody. Let's get out\nand see how bad the damage is.\"\nInstinctively Greg had surged a half step forward as Breadon silenced\nthe cabin boy. Now old habit and common-sense halted him. He's\noverwrought, he reasoned. We're all excited and on edge. We've been to\nBedlam. Our nerves are shot. In a little while we'll all be back to\nnormal.\nHe said quietly, \"Very well, Mr. Breadon.\" And he climbed from the\nbroken skiff.\nHannigan said, \"Looks bad, don't it?\"\n\"Very,\" said Malcolm. He fingered a shard of loose metal flapping like\na fin from the stern of the skiff. \"Not hopeless, though. There should\nbe an acetylene torch in the tool locker. With that\u2014\"\n\"You ought to of poked him,\" said Hannigan.\n\"What? Oh, you mean\u2014?\"\n\"Yeah. The kid was right, you know. He done it.\"\n\"His sleeve, you mean. Well, it was an accident,\" said Greg. \"It could\nhave happened to anyone. And he made a good landing. Considering\neverything. Anyhow\u2014\" Again he was Gregory Malcolm, serious-faced,\nefficient secretary. \"Anyhow, we have been thrust into an extremely\nprecarious circumstance. It would be silly to take umbrage at a man's\nnervous anger. We must have no quarreling, no bickering\u2014\"\n\"Umbrage!\" snorted Sparks. \"Bickering! They're big words. I ain't sure\nI know what they mean. I ain't exactly sure they mean\nanything\n.\" He\nglanced at Greg oddly. \"You're a queer jasper, Malcolm. Back there\non the ship, I figured you for a sort of a stuffed-shirt. Yes-man to\nthe boss. And then in the show-down, you come through like a movie\nhero\u2014for a little while. Then you let that Breadon guy give you the\nspur without a squawk\u2014\"\nMalcolm adjusted his plasta-rimmed spectacles. He said, almost\nstubbornly, \"Our situation is grave. There must be no bickering.\"\n\"Bickering your Aunt Jenny! What do you call that?\"\nSparks jerked a contemptuous thumb toward the group from which they\nwere separated. Upon disembarking, only Greg and Sparks had moved to\nmake a careful examination of their damaged craft. The others, more\nor less under the direction of Breadon, were making gestures toward\nremoving certain necessaries from the skiff. Their efforts, slight and\nuncertain as they were, had already embroiled them in argument.\nThe gist of their argument, so far as Greg Malcolm could determine, was\nthat everyone wanted \"something\" to be done, but no two could agree as\nto just what that something was, and no one seemed to have any bursting\ndesire to participate in actual physical labor.\nJ. Foster Andrews, all traces of his former panic and confusion fled,\nwas planted firmly, Napoleonically, some few yards from the open port\nof the life-skiff, barking impatient orders at little Tommy O'Doul\nwho\u2014as Greg watched\u2014stumbled from the port bearing a huge armload of\nedibles.\n'Tina, the maid, was in a frenzy of motion, trying to administer to the\ncomplaints and demands of Mrs. Andrews (whose immaculate hair-do had\nsuffered in the frenetic minutes of their flight) and Crystal Andrews\n(who knew perfectly well there were sweaters in the life-skiff) and\nMiss Maud (who wanted a can of prepared dog-food and a can-opener\nimmediately, and look at poor Cuddles, momsy's 'ittle pet was\nso\nhungry)!\nBert Andrews was sulkily insisting that it was nonsense to leave the\nwarmth and security of the skiff anyway, and he wished he had a drink,\nwhile the harassed, self-appointed commander of the refugee corps was\nshouting at whomever happened, at any given moment, to capture his\ndivided and completely frantic attention. His orders were masterpieces\nof confusion, developing around one premise that the castaway crew\nshould immediately set up a camp. Where, how, or with what nonexistent\nequipment, Breadon did not venture to say.\n\"You see what I mean?\" demanded Sparks disgustedly.\nGreg Malcolm saw. He also saw other things. That their landing-spot,\nwhile excellent for its purpose, was not by any manner of means an\nideal campsite. It was a small, flat basin of sandy soil, rimmed by\nshallow mountains. His gaze sought these hills, looked approvingly on\ntheir greenness, upon the multitude of dark pock-marks dotting them.\nThese caves, were they not the habitations of potential enemies, might\nwell become the sanctuaries of spacewrecked men.\nHe saw, also, a thin ribbon of silver sheering the face of the northern\nhills. His gaze, rising still skyward, saw other things\u2014\nHe nodded. He knew, now, where they were. Or approximately. There was\nbut one planet in the solar system which boasted such a phenomenon. The\napparent distance of the Sun, judged by its diminished disc, argued\nhis judgment to be correct. The fact that they had surged through an\natmospheric belt for some length of time before finally meeting with\ndisaster.\n\"Titan,\" he said. \"Hyperion possibly. But probably Titan.\"\nSparks' gaze, following Greg's upward, contracted in an expression of\ndismay.\n\"Dirty cow! You mean that's where we are?\"\n\"I believe so. There's Saturn, our mother planet, looming above us as\nlarge as a dinner plate. And the grav-drag here is almost Earth norm.\nTitan has a 3,000 mile diameter. That, combined with the Saturnian\ntractile constant, would give us a strong pull.\"\nSparks wailed, \"But Titan! Great morning, Malcolm, nobody ever comes\nto Titan! There ain't no mines here, no colonies, no\u2014\" He stopped\nsuddenly, his eyes widening yet farther. \"And, hey\u2014this place is\ndangerous\n! There are\u2014\"\n\"I know it,\" said Greg swiftly, quietly. \"Shut up, Sparks. No use\ntelling the others. If they don't guess it themselves, what they don't\nknow won't alarm them. We've got to do something, though. Get ourselves\norganized into a defensive community. That's the only way\u2014\"\nRalph Breadon's sharp, dictatorial voice interrupted him. \"Well,\nMalcolm, stop soldiering and make yourself useful!\"\nAnd J. Foster, not to have his authority usurped, supplemented the\norder. \"Yes, Malcolm, let's get going! No time for day-dreaming, my\nman. We want action!\"\nSparks said, \"Maybe you'll get it now, fatty!\" under his breath, and\nlooked at Malcolm hopefully. But his companion merely nodded, moved\nforward toward the others, quietly obedient to the command.\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said.\nHannigan groaned and followed him.\nIII\nBreadon said, \"All right, Tommy, dump them here. I have a few words to\nsay.\" He glanced about him pompously. \"Now, folks, naturally we want\nto get away from here as soon as possible. Therefore I delegate you,\nSparks, to immediately get a message off. An SOS to the nearest space\ncruiser.\"\nHannigan grinned. It was not a pleasant grin. He took his time\nanswering. He spat thoughtfully on the ground before him, lifted his\nhead. He said, \"A message, huh?\"\n\"That's what I said.\"\n\"And what'll I send it with?\" drawled Sparks. \"Tom-toms?\"\nBreadon flushed darkly.\n\"I believe the life-skiff was equipped with a radio? And theoretically\nyou are a radio operator?\"\n\"Finest radio money can buy!\" interpolated J. Foster Andrews proudly.\n\"Put a million credits into the\nCarefree\n. Best equipment throughout.\"\nSparks looked from one to another of them, grinned insolently. \"You're\nboth right. I\nam\na radio operator, and there\nwas\na radio. But we\ncrashed, remember? On account of some dope's sleeve got caught in the\nmaster switch\u2014\"\n\"That will do!\" snapped Breadon angrily. He stared at the bandy-legged\nlittle redhead. \"You mean the radio was broken?\"\n\"It wasn't helped none. The tubes was made out of glass, and glass\ndon't bounce so good.\"\nGreg Malcolm said thoughtfully, \"Sparks, can't you fix it?\"\n\"Well, mebbe. But not in five minutes. Maybe not in five years. I won't\nknow till I get going on it.\"\nBreadon frowned.\n\"I'll handle this, Malcolm,\" he crisped. Again to the radioman, \"Well,\nyou get to work on it immediately. And as soon as you get it fixed,\nsend out an SOS advising the patrol where we are\u2014\"\n\"Speaking of which,\" insinuated Sparks, \"where are we?\"\nBreadon glared at him wrathfully.\n\"Why\u2014why on one of the satellites of Saturn, of course. Any fool can\nsee that!\"\n\"O.Q. But does any fool know which one? Or shall I tell you it's Titan?\nAnd when you know that, then what? Titan wasn't named that on account\nof it was a pimple. It's a big place. What'll I tell the Patrol?\nSOS.\nStranded in the middle of we-don't-know-where, somewhere on Titan,\nmaybe.\nThey'll be hunting for us till we've got whiskers down to our\nknees.\"\nBreadon's irate look vanished. He looked stricken. He said, \"I\u2014I don't\nknow. We have a compass\u2014\"\nOnce again it was Gregory Malcolm who entered into the conversation. He\nhad been toying, almost absentmindedly, with a funnel taken from the\nskiff's stores. Into this he had poured a small portion of water; his\nright forefinger was pressed to the bottom of the tube, closing it. He\nsaid, \"I can answer part of that question now. Enough to cut the search\nin half, anyway. We're in the northern hemisphere of the satellite.\"\nMaud Andrews looked at him sharply as if noticing him for the first\ntime in her life.\n\"How,\" she asked, \"did you know that, Malcolm?\"\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nWanderers of the Wolf Moon\nBy NELSON S. BOND\nThey were marooned on Titan, their ship wrecked,\nthe radio smashed. Yet they had to exist, had\nto build a new life on a hostile world. And the\nman who assumed command was Gregory Malcolm, the\nbespectacled secretary\u2014whose only adventures\nhad come through the pages of a book.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Spring 1944.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nSparks snapped off the switches and followed him to the door of the\nradio turret. Sparks was a stunted, usually-grinning, little redhead\nnamed Hannigan. But he wasn't grinning now. He laid an anxious hand on\nGreg's arm. \"If I was you,\" he said, \"if I was you, Malcolm, I don't\nthink I'd say nothing to the boss about this. Not just yet, anyhow.\"\nGreg said, \"Why not?\"\nSparks spluttered and fussed and made heavy weather of answering.\n\"Well, for one thing, it ain't important. It would only worry him. And\nthen there's the womenfolks, they scare easy. Which of course they\nain't no cause to. Atmospherics don't mean nothing. I've rode out\nworse storms than this\u2014plenty of times. And in worse crates than the\nCarefree\n.\"\nGreg studied him carefully from behind trim plasta-rimmed spectacles.\nHe drew a deep breath. He said levelly, \"So it's\nthat\nbad, eh,\nSparks?\"\n\"What bad? I just told you\u2014\"\n\"I know. Sparks, I'm not a professional spaceman. But I've studied\nastrogation as few Earthlubbers have. It's been my hobby for years. And\nI think I know what we're up against.\n\"We hit a warp-eddy last night. We've been trapped in a vortex for\nmore than eight hours. Lord only knows how many hundreds of thousands\nof miles we've been borne off our course. And now we've blasted into a\nsuper-ionized belt of atmospherics. Your radio signals are blanketed.\nYou can't get signals in or out. We're a deaf-mute speck of metal being\nwhirled headlong through space. Isn't that it?\"\n\"I don't know what\u2014\" began Sparks hotly. Then he stopped, studied his\ncompanion thoughtfully, nodded. \"O.Q.,\" he confessed, \"that's it. But\nwe ain't licked yet. We got three good men on the bridge. Townsend ...\nGraves ... Langhorn. They'll pull out of this if anybody can. And they\nain't no sense in scaring the Old Man and his family.\"\n\"I won't tell them,\" said Greg. \"I won't tell them unless I have to.\nBut between you and me, what are the odds against us, Sparks?\"\nThe radioman shrugged.\n\"Who knows? Vortices are unpredictable. Maybe the damn thing will toss\nus out on the very spot it picked us up. Maybe it will give us the old\nchuckeroo a million miles the other side of Pluto. Maybe it will crack\nus up on an asteroid or satellite. No way of telling till it happens.\"\n\"And the controls?\"\n\"As useless,\" said Sparks, \"as a cow in a cyclone.\"\n\"So?\"\n\"We sit tight,\" said Sparks succinctly, \"and hope.\"\nMalcolm nodded quietly. He took off his spectacles, breathed on them,\nwiped them, replaced them. He was tall and fair; in his neat, crisply\npressed business suit he appeared even slimmer than he was. But there\nwas no nervousness in his movements. He moved measuredly. \"Well,\" he\nsaid, \"that appears to be that. I'm going up to the dining dome.\"\nSparks stared at him querulously.\n\"You're a queer duck, Malcolm. I don't think you've got a nerve in your\nbody.\"\n\"Nerves are a luxury I can't afford,\" replied Greg. \"If anything\nhappens\u2014and if there's time to do so\u2014let me know.\" He paused at the\ndoor. \"Good luck,\" he said.\n\"Clear ether!\" said Sparks mechanically. He stared after the other man\nwonderingly for a long moment, then went back to his control banks,\nshaking his head and muttering.\nGregory Malcolm climbed down the Jacob's-ladder and strode briskly\nthrough the labyrinthine corridors that were the entrails of the\nspace yacht\nCarefree\n. He paused once to peer through a\nperilens\nset into the ship's port plates. It was a weird sight that met his\ngaze. Not space, ebony-black and bejewelled with a myriad flaming\nsplotches of color; not the old, familiar constellations treading\ntheir ever-lasting, inexorable paths about the perimeter of Sol's\ntiny universe, but a shimmering webwork of light, so tortured-violet\nthat the eyes ached to look upon it. This was the mad typhoon of\nspace-atmospherics through which the\nCarefree\nwas now being twisted,\ntopsy-turvy, toward a nameless goal.\nHe moved on, approaching at last the quartzite-paned observation\nrotunda which was the dining dome of the ship.\nHis footsteps slowed as he composed himself to face those within. As\nhe hesitated in the dimly-lighted passage, a trick of lights on glass\nmirrored to him the room beyond. He could see the others while they\nwere as yet unaware of his presence. Their voices reached him clearly.\nJ. Foster Andrews, his employer and the employer of the ten thousand\nor more men and women who worked for Galactic Metals Corporation,\ndominated the head of the table. He was a plump, impatient little\nNapoleon. Opposite him, calm, graceful, serene, tastefully garbed and\nelaborately coiffured even here in deep space, three weeks from the\nnearest beauty shop, sat his wife, Enid.\nOn Andrews' right sat his sister, Maud. Not young, features plain as a\nmud fence, but charming despite her age and homeliness simply because\nof her eyes; puckish, shrewdly intelligent eyes, constantly aglint with\nsuppressed humor at\u2014guessed Greg\u2014the amusing foibles and frailties of\nthose about her.\nShe gave her breakfast the enthusiastic attention of one too old and\nshapeless to be concerned with such folderol as calories and dietetics,\npausing only from time to time to share smidgeons of food with a\nwatery-eyed scrap of white, curly fluff beside her chair. Her pet\npoodle, whom she called by the opprobrious title of \"Cuddles.\"\nOn J. Foster's left sat his daughter, Crystal. She it was who caused\nGregory Malcolm's staid, respectable heart to give a little lurch as\nhe glimpsed her reflected vision\u2014all gold and crimson and cream\u2014in\nthe glistening walls. If Crystal was her name, so, too, was crystal her\nloveliness.\nBut\u2014Greg shook his head\u2014but she was not for him. She was already\npledged to the young man seated beside her. Ralph Breadon. He turned\nto murmur something to her as Greg watched; Greg saw and admired and\ndisliked his rangy height, his sturdy, well-knit strength, the rich\nbrownness of his skin, his hair, his eyes.\nThe sound of his own name startled Greg.\n\"Malcolm!\" called the man at the head of the table. \"Malcolm! Now where\nin blazes is he, anyhow?\" he demanded of no one in particular, everyone\nin general. He spooned a dab of liquid gold from a Limoges preserve\njar, tongued it suspiciously, frowned. \"Bitter!\" he complained.\n\"It's the very\nbest\nMartian honey,\" said his wife.\n\"Drylands clover,\" added Crystal.\n\"It's still bitter,\" said J. Foster petulantly.\nHis sister sniffed. \"Nonsense! It's delightful.\"\n\"I say it's bitter,\" repeated Andrews sulkily. And lifted his voice\nagain. \"\nMalcolm!\nWhere\nare\nyou?\"\n\"You called me, sir?\" said Malcolm, moving into the room. He nodded\npolitely to the others. \"Good morning, Mrs. Andrews ... Miss\nAndrews ... Mr. Breadon....\"\n\"Oh, sit down!\" snapped J. Foster. \"Sit down here and stop bobbing your\nhead like a teetotum! Had your breakfast? The honey's no good; it's\nbitter.\" He glared at his sister challengingly. \"Where have you been,\nanyway? What kind of secretary are you? Have you been up to the radio\nturret? How's the market today? Is Galactic up or down?\"\nMalcolm said, \"I don't know, sir.\"\n\"Fine! Fine!\" Andrews rattled on automatically before the words\nregistered. Then he started, his face turning red. \"Eh? What's that?\nDon't know! What do you mean, you don't know? I pay you to\u2014\"\n\"There's no transmission, sir,\" said Greg quietly.\n\"No trans\u2014nonsense! Of course there's transmission! I put a million\ncredits into this ship. Finest space-yacht ever built. Latest equipment\nthroughout. Sparks is drunk, that's what you mean! Well, you hop right\nup there and\u2014\"\nMaud Andrews put down her fork with a clatter. \"Oh, for goodness sakes,\nJonathan, shut up and give the boy time to explain! He's standing\nthere with his mouth gaping like a rain-spout, trying to get a word in\nedgewise! What's the trouble, Gregory?\" She turned to Greg, as Jonathan\nFoster Andrews wheezed into startled silence. \"\nThat?\n\"\nShe glanced at the quartzite dome, beyond which the veil of iridescence\nwove and cross-wove and shimmered like a pallid aurora.\nGreg nodded. \"Yes, Miss Andrews.\"\nEnid Andrews spoke languidly from the other end of the table.\n\"But what is it, Gregory? A local phenomenon?\"\n\"You might call it that,\" said Greg, selecting his words cautiously.\n\"It's an ionized field into which we've blasted. It\u2014it\u2014shouldn't stay\nwith us long. But while it persists, our radio will be blanketed out.\"\nBreadon's chestnut head came up suddenly, sharply.\n\"Ionization! That means atmosphere!\"\nGreg said, \"Yes.\"\n\"And an atmosphere means a body in space somewhere near\u2014\" Breadon\nstopped, bit his lip before the appeal in Malcolm's eyes, tried to pass\nit off easily. \"Oh, well\u2014a change of scenery, what?\"\nBut the moment of alarm in his voice had not passed unnoticed. Crystal\nAndrews spoke for all of them, her voice preternaturally quiet.\n\"You're hiding something, Malcolm. What is it? Is there\u2014danger?\"\nBut Greg didn't have to answer that question. From the doorway a harsh,\ndefiantly strident voice answered for him. The voice of Bert Andrews,\nCrystal's older brother.\n\"Danger? You're damn right there's danger! What's the matter with\nyou folks\u2014are you all deaf, dumb and blind? We've been caught in a\nspace-vortex for hours. Now we're in the H-layer of a planet we can't\neven see\u2014and in fifteen minutes or fifteen seconds we may all be\nsmashed as flat as pancakes!\"\nThe proclamation brought them out of their chairs. Greg's heart sank;\nhis vain plea, \"Mr. Andrews\u2014\" was lost in the medley of Crystal's\nsudden gasp, Enid Andrews' short, choking scream, J. Foster's bellowing\nroar at his only son.\n\"Bert\u2014you're drunk!\"\nBert weaved precariously from the doorway, laughed in his father's face.\n\"Sure I'm drunk! Why not? If you're smart you'll get drunk, too. The\nwhole damn lot of you!\" He flicked a derisive hand toward Greg. \"You\ntoo, Boy Scout! What were you trying to do\u2014hide the bad news from\nthem? Well, it's no use. Everybody might as well know the worst. We're\ngone gooses ... geeses ... aw, what the hell! Dead ducks!\" He fell\ninto a chair, sprawled there laughing mirthlessly with fear riding the\ntoo-high notes of his laughter.\nJ. Foster turned to his secretary slowly. His ire had faded; there was\nonly deep concern in his voice.\n\"Is he telling the truth, Malcolm?\"\nGreg said soberly, \"Partly, sir. He's overstating the danger\u2014but\nthere is danger. We are caught in a space-vortex, and as Mr.\nBreadon realized, the presence of these ionics means we're in the\nHeaviside-layer of some heavenly body. But we may not crack up.\"\nMaud Andrews glanced at him shrewdly.\n\"Is there anything we can do?\"\n\"Not a thing. The officers on the bridge are doing everything possible.\"\n\"In that case,\" said the older woman, \"we might as well finish our\nbreakfast. Here, Cuddles! Come to momsy!\" She sat down again. Greg\nlooked at her admiringly. Ralph Breadon stroked his brown jaw. He said,\n\"The life-skiffs?\"\n\"A last resort,\" said Greg. \"Sparks promised he'd let me know if it\nwere necessary. We'll hope it's not\u2014\"\nBut it was a vain hope, vainly spoken in the last, vain moment. For\neven as he phrased the hopeful words, came the sound of swift, racing\nfootsteps up the corridor. Into the dining dome burst Hannigan, eyes\nhot with excitement. And his cry dispelled Greg's final hopes for\nsafety.\n\"Everybody\u2014the Number Four life-skiff\u2014\nquick\n! We've been caught in a\ngrav-drag and we're going to crash!\"\nII\nThose next hectic moments were never afterward very clear in Greg\nMalcolm's memory. He had a confused recollection of hearing Sparks'\nwarning punctuated by a loud, shrill scream which he vaguely identified\nas emanating from Mrs. Andrews' throat ... he was conscious of feeling,\nsuddenly, beneath his feet the sickening, quickening lurch of a ship\nout of control, gripped by gravitational forces beyond its power to\nallay ... he recalled his own voice dinning in his ears as, incredibly,\nwith Sparks, he took command of the hasty flight from the dining dome\ndown the corridor to the aft ramp, up the ramp, across girdered beams\nin the super-structure to the small, independently motored rocket-skiff\ncradled there.\nHe was aware, too, of strangely disconnected incidents happening around\nhim, he being a part of them but seeming to be only a disinterested\nspectator to their strangeness. Of his forcing Maud Andrews toward\nthe door of the dome ... of her pushing back against him with all the\nweight of her body ... of her irate voice, \"Cuddles! I forgot him!\"\nThen the shrill excited yapping of the poodle cradled against her as\nthey charged on down the corridor.\nJ. Foster waddling beside him, tugging at his arm, panting, \"The\nofficers?\" and his own unfelt assurance. \"They can take care of\nthemselves. It's a general 'bandon ship.\" Enid Andrews stumbling over\nthe hem of a filmy peignoir ... himself bending to lift her boldly and\nbodily, sweating palms feeling the warm animal heat of her excited\nbody hot beneath them ... Crystal Andrews stopping suddenly, crying,\n\"'Tina!\" ... and Hannigan's reply, \"Your maid? I woke her. She's in the\nlife-skiff.\" Bert Andrews stopping suddenly, being sick in the middle\nof the corridor, his drunkenness losing itself in the thick, sure\nnausea of the ever-increasing unsteadiness beneath their feet.\nThen the life-skiff, the clang of metal as Hannigan slammed the\nport behind the last of them, the fumbling for a lock-stud, the\nquick, grateful pant of the miniature hypos, and a weird feeling of\nweightlessness, rushingness, hurtlingness as his eardrums throbbed and\nhis mouth tasted brassy and bloody with the fierce velocity of their\nescape.\nSense and meaning returned only when all this ended. As one waking from\na nightmare dream, Greg Malcolm returned to a world he could recognize.\nA tiny world, encased within the walls of a forty-foot life-skiff. A\nworld peopled too scantily. Andrews, his wife and sister, his son and\ndaughter; 'Tina Laney, the maid; Breadon, Hannigan, young Tommy O'Doul,\nthe cabin-boy (though where he had come from, or when, Greg did not\nknow). And himself. In a life-skiff. In space.\nSomewhere in space. He looked through the\nperilens\n. What he saw then\nhe might better never have seen. For that shimmering pink-ochre veil\nhad wisped away, now, and in the clean, cold, bitter-clear light of a\ndistant sun he watched the death-dive of the yacht\nCarefree\n.\nLike a vast silver top, spinning heedlessly, wildly, it streaked toward\na mottled gray and green, brown and dun, hard and crushing-brutal\nterrain below. Still at its helm stood someone, for even in that last\ndreadful moment burst from its nose-jets a ruddy mushroom of flame that\ntried to, but could not, brake the dizzy fall.\nFor an instant Greg's eyes, stingingly blinded and wet, thought they\nglimpsed a wee black mote dancing from the bowels of the\nCarefree\n; a\nmote that might be another skiff like their own. But he could not be\nsure, and then the\nCarefree\nwas accelerating with such violence and\nspeed that the eye could see it only as a flaming silver lance against\nthe ugly earth-carcase beneath, and then it struck and a carmine bud of\nflame burst and flowered for an instant, and that was all....\nAnd Greg Malcolm turned from the\nperilens\n, shaken.\nHannigan said, \"It's over?\" and Greg nodded.\nHannigan said, \"The other skiffs? Did they break free, or were they\ncaught?\"\n\"I don't know. I couldn't see for sure.\"\n\"You must have seen. Are we the only ones?\"\n\"I couldn't see for sure. Maybe. Maybe not.\"\nThen a body scrambled forward, pressing through the tightness of other\nhuddled bodies, and there was a hand upon his elbow. \"I'll take over\nnow, Malcolm.\"\nIt was Ralph Breadon. Gregory looked at him slowly, uncomprehendingly\nat first. His hand was reluctant to leave the guiding-gear of the\nsmall ship which was, now, all that remained to them of civilization\nand civilization's wondrous accomplishments. He had not realized until\nthis moment that for a while ... for a short, eager, pulse-quickening\nwhile ... on his alertness, in his hands, had depended the destinies\nof ten men and women. But he knew, suddenly and completely, that it\nwas for this single moment his whole lifetime had waited. It was for\nthis brief moment of command that some intuition, some instinct greater\nthan knowledge, had prepared him. This was why he, an Earthlubber, had\nstudied astrogation, made a hobby of the empire of the stars. That he\nmight be fitted to command when all others failed. And now\u2014\nAnd now the moment was past, and he was once again Gregory Malcolm,\nmild, lean, pale, bespectacled secretary to J. Foster Andrews. And the\nman at his side was Ralph Breadon, socialite and gentleman sportsman,\ntrained pilot. And in Malcolm the habit of obedience was strong....\n\"Very well, sir,\" he said. And he turned over the controls.\nWhat happened then was unfortunate. It might just as well have happened\nto Malcolm, though afterward no one could ever say with certainty.\nHowever that was, either by carelessness or malfortune or inefficiency,\nonce-thwarted disaster struck again at the little party on the\nlife-skiff. At the instant Breadon's hand seized the controls the skiff\njerked suddenly as though struck with a ponderous fist, its throbbing\nmotors choked and snarled in a high, rising crescendo of torment that\nlost itself in supersonic heights, and the ship that had been drifting\neasily and under control to the planet beneath now dipped viciously.\nThe misfortune was that too many huddled in the tiny space understood\nthe operation of the life-skiff, and what must be done instantly. And\nthat neither pilot was as yet in control of the ship. Breadon's hand\nleaped for the Dixie rod, so, too, did Malcolm's\u2014and across both their\nbodies came the arm of Sparks Hannigan, searching the controls.\nIn the scramble someone's sleeve brushed the banks of control-keys. The\nmotors, killed, soughed into silence. The ship rocked into a spin. Greg\ncried out, his voice a strange harshness in his ears; Breadon cursed;\none of the women bleated fearfully.\nThen Breadon, still cursing, fought all hands from the controls but his\nown. And the man was not without courage. For all could see plainly,\nin the illumined\nperilens\n, how near to swift death that moment of\nuncertainty had led them. The skiff, which an instant before had been\nhigh in the stratosphere of this unknown planet ... or satellite\nor whatever it might be ... was now flashing toward hard ground at\nlightning speed.\nOnly a miracle, Greg knew, could save them now. An impulse spun his\nhead, he looked at Crystal Andrews. There was no fear in her eyes. Just\na hotness and an inexplicable anger. Beside her was the other girl, the\nmaid, 'Tina; she was frankly afraid. Her teeth were clenched in her\nnether lip, and her eyes were wide and anxious, but she did not cry out.\nOnly a miracle could save them now. But Breadon's hands performed\nthat miracle; his quick, nerveless, trained hands. A stud here ...\na lever there ... a swift wrenching toss of the shoulders. His face\ntwisted back over his shoulder, and his straining lips pulled taut\nand bloodless away from his teeth. \"Hold tight, folks! We're going to\nbounce\u2014\"\nThen they struck!\nBut they struck glancingly, as Breadon had hoped, and planned for,\nand gambled on. They struck and bounced. The frail craft shivered\nand groaned in metal agony, jarred across harsh soil, bounced again,\nsettled, nosed over and rocked to a standstill. Somewhere forward\nsomething snapped with a shrill, high\nping!\nof stress; somewhere aft\nwas the metallic flap-clanging of broken gear trailing behind them. But\nthey were safe.\nBreath, held so long that he could not remember its inhalation, escaped\nGreg's lungs in a long sigh. \"Nice work, Mr. Breadon!\" he cried. \"Oh,\nnice work!\"\nBut surprisingly, savagely, Breadon turned on him.\n\"It would have been\nbetter\nwork, Malcolm, if you'd kept your damned\nhands off the controls! Now see what you've done? Smashed up our skiff!\nOur only\u2014\"\n\"He didn't do it!\" piped the shrill voice of Tommy O'Doul. \"You done it\nyourself, Mr. Breadon. Your sleeve. It caught the switch.\"\n\"Quiet!\" Breadon, cheeks flushed, reached out smartly, stilled\nthe youngster's defense with a swift, ungentle slap. \"And you,\nMalcolm\u2014after this, do as you're told, and don't try to assume\nresponsibilities too great for you. All right, everybody. Let's get out\nand see how bad the damage is.\"\nInstinctively Greg had surged a half step forward as Breadon silenced\nthe cabin boy. Now old habit and common-sense halted him. He's\noverwrought, he reasoned. We're all excited and on edge. We've been to\nBedlam. Our nerves are shot. In a little while we'll all be back to\nnormal.\nHe said quietly, \"Very well, Mr. Breadon.\" And he climbed from the\nbroken skiff.\nHannigan said, \"Looks bad, don't it?\"\n\"Very,\" said Malcolm. He fingered a shard of loose metal flapping like\na fin from the stern of the skiff. \"Not hopeless, though. There should\nbe an acetylene torch in the tool locker. With that\u2014\"\n\"You ought to of poked him,\" said Hannigan.\n\"What? Oh, you mean\u2014?\"\n\"Yeah. The kid was right, you know. He done it.\"\n\"His sleeve, you mean. Well, it was an accident,\" said Greg. \"It could\nhave happened to anyone. And he made a good landing. Considering\neverything. Anyhow\u2014\" Again he was Gregory Malcolm, serious-faced,\nefficient secretary. \"Anyhow, we have been thrust into an extremely\nprecarious circumstance. It would be silly to take umbrage at a man's\nnervous anger. We must have no quarreling, no bickering\u2014\"\n\"Umbrage!\" snorted Sparks. \"Bickering! They're big words. I ain't sure\nI know what they mean. I ain't exactly sure they mean\nanything\n.\" He\nglanced at Greg oddly. \"You're a queer jasper, Malcolm. Back there\non the ship, I figured you for a sort of a stuffed-shirt. Yes-man to\nthe boss. And then in the show-down, you come through like a movie\nhero\u2014for a little while. Then you let that Breadon guy give you the\nspur without a squawk\u2014\"\nMalcolm adjusted his plasta-rimmed spectacles. He said, almost\nstubbornly, \"Our situation is grave. There must be no bickering.\"\n\"Bickering your Aunt Jenny! What do you call that?\"\nSparks jerked a contemptuous thumb toward the group from which they\nwere separated. Upon disembarking, only Greg and Sparks had moved to\nmake a careful examination of their damaged craft. The others, more\nor less under the direction of Breadon, were making gestures toward\nremoving certain necessaries from the skiff. Their efforts, slight and\nuncertain as they were, had already embroiled them in argument.\nThe gist of their argument, so far as Greg Malcolm could determine, was\nthat everyone wanted \"something\" to be done, but no two could agree as\nto just what that something was, and no one seemed to have any bursting\ndesire to participate in actual physical labor.\nJ. Foster Andrews, all traces of his former panic and confusion fled,\nwas planted firmly, Napoleonically, some few yards from the open port\nof the life-skiff, barking impatient orders at little Tommy O'Doul\nwho\u2014as Greg watched\u2014stumbled from the port bearing a huge armload of\nedibles.\n'Tina, the maid, was in a frenzy of motion, trying to administer to the\ncomplaints and demands of Mrs. Andrews (whose immaculate hair-do had\nsuffered in the frenetic minutes of their flight) and Crystal Andrews\n(who knew perfectly well there were sweaters in the life-skiff) and\nMiss Maud (who wanted a can of prepared dog-food and a can-opener\nimmediately, and look at poor Cuddles, momsy's 'ittle pet was\nso\nhungry)!\nBert Andrews was sulkily insisting that it was nonsense to leave the\nwarmth and security of the skiff anyway, and he wished he had a drink,\nwhile the harassed, self-appointed commander of the refugee corps was\nshouting at whomever happened, at any given moment, to capture his\ndivided and completely frantic attention. His orders were masterpieces\nof confusion, developing around one premise that the castaway crew\nshould immediately set up a camp. Where, how, or with what nonexistent\nequipment, Breadon did not venture to say.\n\"You see what I mean?\" demanded Sparks disgustedly.\nGreg Malcolm saw. He also saw other things. That their landing-spot,\nwhile excellent for its purpose, was not by any manner of means an\nideal campsite. It was a small, flat basin of sandy soil, rimmed by\nshallow mountains. His gaze sought these hills, looked approvingly on\ntheir greenness, upon the multitude of dark pock-marks dotting them.\nThese caves, were they not the habitations of potential enemies, might\nwell become the sanctuaries of spacewrecked men.\nHe saw, also, a thin ribbon of silver sheering the face of the northern\nhills. His gaze, rising still skyward, saw other things\u2014\nHe nodded. He knew, now, where they were. Or approximately. There was\nbut one planet in the solar system which boasted such a phenomenon. The\napparent distance of the Sun, judged by its diminished disc, argued\nhis judgment to be correct. The fact that they had surged through an\natmospheric belt for some length of time before finally meeting with\ndisaster.\n\"Titan,\" he said. \"Hyperion possibly. But probably Titan.\"\nSparks' gaze, following Greg's upward, contracted in an expression of\ndismay.\n\"Dirty cow! You mean that's where we are?\"\n\"I believe so. There's Saturn, our mother planet, looming above us as\nlarge as a dinner plate. And the grav-drag here is almost Earth norm.\nTitan has a 3,000 mile diameter. That, combined with the Saturnian\ntractile constant, would give us a strong pull.\"\nSparks wailed, \"But Titan! Great morning, Malcolm, nobody ever comes\nto Titan! There ain't no mines here, no colonies, no\u2014\" He stopped\nsuddenly, his eyes widening yet farther. \"And, hey\u2014this place is\ndangerous\n! There are\u2014\"\n\"I know it,\" said Greg swiftly, quietly. \"Shut up, Sparks. No use\ntelling the others. If they don't guess it themselves, what they don't\nknow won't alarm them. We've got to do something, though. Get ourselves\norganized into a defensive community. That's the only way\u2014\"\nRalph Breadon's sharp, dictatorial voice interrupted him. \"Well,\nMalcolm, stop soldiering and make yourself useful!\"\nAnd J. Foster, not to have his authority usurped, supplemented the\norder. \"Yes, Malcolm, let's get going! No time for day-dreaming, my\nman. We want action!\"\nSparks said, \"Maybe you'll get it now, fatty!\" under his breath, and\nlooked at Malcolm hopefully. But his companion merely nodded, moved\nforward toward the others, quietly obedient to the command.\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said.\nHannigan groaned and followed him.\nIII\nBreadon said, \"All right, Tommy, dump them here. I have a few words to\nsay.\" He glanced about him pompously. \"Now, folks, naturally we want\nto get away from here as soon as possible. Therefore I delegate you,\nSparks, to immediately get a message off. An SOS to the nearest space\ncruiser.\"\nHannigan grinned. It was not a pleasant grin. He took his time\nanswering. He spat thoughtfully on the ground before him, lifted his\nhead. He said, \"A message, huh?\"\n\"That's what I said.\"\n\"And what'll I send it with?\" drawled Sparks. \"Tom-toms?\"\nBreadon flushed darkly.\n\"I believe the life-skiff was equipped with a radio? And theoretically\nyou are a radio operator?\"\n\"Finest radio money can buy!\" interpolated J. Foster Andrews proudly.\n\"Put a million credits into the\nCarefree\n. Best equipment throughout.\"\nSparks looked from one to another of them, grinned insolently. \"You're\nboth right. I\nam\na radio operator, and there\nwas\na radio. But we\ncrashed, remember? On account of some dope's sleeve got caught in the\nmaster switch\u2014\"\n\"That will do!\" snapped Breadon angrily. He stared at the bandy-legged\nlittle redhead. \"You mean the radio was broken?\"\n\"It wasn't helped none. The tubes was made out of glass, and glass\ndon't bounce so good.\"\nGreg Malcolm said thoughtfully, \"Sparks, can't you fix it?\"\n\"Well, mebbe. But not in five minutes. Maybe not in five years. I won't\nknow till I get going on it.\"\nBreadon frowned.\n\"I'll handle this, Malcolm,\" he crisped. Again to the radioman, \"Well,\nyou get to work on it immediately. And as soon as you get it fixed,\nsend out an SOS advising the patrol where we are\u2014\"\n\"Speaking of which,\" insinuated Sparks, \"where are we?\"\nBreadon glared at him wrathfully.\n\"Why\u2014why on one of the satellites of Saturn, of course. Any fool can\nsee that!\"\n\"O.Q. But does any fool know which one? Or shall I tell you it's Titan?\nAnd when you know that, then what? Titan wasn't named that on account\nof it was a pimple. It's a big place. What'll I tell the Patrol?\nSOS.\nStranded in the middle of we-don't-know-where, somewhere on Titan,\nmaybe.\nThey'll be hunting for us till we've got whiskers down to our\nknees.\"\nBreadon's irate look vanished. He looked stricken. He said, \"I\u2014I don't\nknow. We have a compass\u2014\"\nOnce again it was Gregory Malcolm who entered into the conversation. He\nhad been toying, almost absentmindedly, with a funnel taken from the\nskiff's stores. Into this he had poured a small portion of water; his\nright forefinger was pressed to the bottom of the tube, closing it. He\nsaid, \"I can answer part of that question now. Enough to cut the search\nin half, anyway. We're in the northern hemisphere of the satellite.\"\nMaud Andrews looked at him sharply as if noticing him for the first\ntime in her life.\n\"How,\" she asked, \"did you know that, Malcolm?\"\n", "summary": "The story begins with the captain of the spaceship, Gregory Malcolm, explaining to his crew that they have been attacked by a super-ionized belt of space-atmospherics. The crew is confused as to how they got caught in this situation and how they are going to get out of it. The captain explains that the ship has been struck by a meteoroid and is drifting off course. The ship is coming into contact with an unknown planet, and they are trying to find a way to get to it. As they get closer to the planet, they realize that they are losing weight as they get further away from the ship. They realize that the meteoroid is coming from the direction of their ship, and the captain is worried that they will drown if they don\u2019t find an oxygen source soon. He orders his crew to evacuate the ship and run to the nearest oxygen source, but they are unable to do so because the oxygen supply has run out. They have no idea how long they will be able to stay on the planet before the oxygen runs out, and there is no way to know how long it will be before the ship is able to reach them.   The captain\u2019s assistant, Sparks, tries to convince the rest of the crew to abandon ship and return to the ship, but is unsuccessful in doing so. He is then informed by the captain that there is a problem with the air quality on the surface of the planet they are on, and that they need to be evacuated immediately. He tells the captain to send a distress signal to Earth, but he is unable to transmit the message because the radio has been cut off. He then realizes that he has lost all communication with the ship due to the gravity of the atmosphere. He calls out for help, but no one responds. He decides to go to the observation dome to see if there is any way to help, and when he does, he sees a shimmering webwork of light in the room. He realizes that the light is a local phenomenon, but the captain does not want to believe it. He asks the captain if he is sure, and he is told that the only way to be sure is to send out an SOS message to Earth. When the captain tries to communicate with Earth, the radio is cut off, and it is revealed that he is in fact communicating with the Sun. He tries to explain the situation to the captain, but it is clear that the man does not understand what he is saying. He does not know if the man is the captain or the ship's engineer, and then the captain tells him that he does not believe he is the right one to be communicating with Earth.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}

Weaponless, his ship gone, he was\npinning his hopes on a girl\u2014who wanted him dead.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Spring 1945.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nStarrett Blade crouched in the rocks by the tiny Centaurian lake. It\nwas only about two or three hundred feet across, but probably thousands\nof feet deep. This lake, and hundreds of others like it, were the\nonly things to break the monotony of the flat, rocky surface of Alpha\nCentauri III\u2014called the most barren planet in space.\nTen minutes ago, Star Blade's ship had spun into the stagnant waters\nbefore him. An emergency release had flung the air-lock doors open, and\nthe air pressure had flung Star out. And now he was waiting for Devil\nGarrett to come down to the water's edge to search for him.\nFor eight years, Devil Garrett had been the top space pirate in the\nvoid. For a year, Star himself had personally been hunting him. And on\na tour over Alpha III, a Barden energy-beam had stabbed up at Blade's\nship, and Star Blade had crashed into the lake.\nThat Barden Beam had Star worried and puzzled. It took a million volts\nof power for a split-second flash of the beam. Garrett didn't have an\natomics plant on Alpha III\u2014if he had, escaping rays would point it\nout, no matter how well it was camouflaged. There was no water power,\nfor there was no running water. There were only the lakes ... and tidal\npower was out, for Alpha III had no moon.\nHowever, that could wait. Star slid the electron knife from his\nwater-proof sheath, gripped it firmly. He could hear quick footsteps as\na man came down the trail that led directly past his hiding place.\nIt wasn't Garrett, which was disappointing. But it was one of his men,\nand he was heavily armed. That didn't worry Star.\nHis fighting had earned Starrett Blade the nickname of \"Death Star.\"\nThe man walked to the water's edge, and peered out over the pool. He\nsaw the bubbles that were coming up from the sinking ship, and he\nnodded, grunted in satisfaction, and started to turn back.\nStar landed on him, knocking him sprawling on the rock. The pirate\njerked up an arm, holding the jet-gun.\nThe stabbing lance of blue fire cracked from the electron knife, dug\ninto the man's heart.\nStar tossed the dead pirate's cloak over his shoulders, and thrust both\nelectron blade and jet-gun into his belt. He straightened, and saw the\nleveled gun from the corner of his eye.\nHe got the jet in his right hand, the knife in his left, and went into\na dive that flipped him behind a rock. The three actions took only a\nsplit-second, and the blast from the jet-gun flaked rock where he had\nbeen standing.\nWhile a jet-gun is the most deadly weapon known, you have to press a\nloading stud to slide another blast-capsule into place. Death Star knew\nthis very well. So he knew he was safe in coming up from behind the\nspur of stone to fire his own gun.\nIf his reflexes hadn't been as quick as they were, he would have\nblasted the girl.\nHe stopped, and stood for a second, staring at the girl. She was\nsomething to invite stares, too. In the moment that lasted between her\nnext move, he had time to register that she was about five feet five\ntall, black-haired\u2014the kind of black hair that looks like silken spun\ndarkness\u2014dark-eyed, and possessing both a face and a form that would\nmake anyone stop and gulp.\nThen the moment of half-awed survey was over, and she leveled the jet\non him, and said in a trembling voice, \"Drop those weapons, or I'll\nblast you ...\npirate\n!\"\nDeath Star said, \"That jet-gun is empty. I can see the register on the\nmagazine. And I'm not a pirate. I'm Starrett Blade.\"\nThe useless jet-gun slid out of the girl's hand, and she gave a\nhalf-gasp. \"Starrett Blade! I\u2014I don't believe ...\" she broke off\nabruptly. \"So you're Death Star! A fine story for a hired killer, a\npirate.\"\nStar reddened. \"Look,\" he snapped, \"I don't know who's been talking to\nyou, but ...\" he whirled, and his hand whipped the jet-gun from his\nbelt. As he did so, the girl jerked up the jet-gun she had dropped, and\nflung it with all her strength. The blow landed on his arm and side,\nand paralyzed him long enough for the man who had leaped out behind him\nto land a stunning blow against his head. As Star went down, he dizzily\ncursed himself for becoming interested in the argument with the girl,\nso that he did not heed his reflexes in time ... and dimly, he wondered\nwhy it had seemed so important to convince the lovely dark-haired girl.\nThen a bit of the cosmos seemed to fall on Star's head, and he was\nhurled into blackness.\nAn eternity seemed to pass.\nDeep in the blackness, a light was born. It leaped toward him, a\nfar-away comet rocketing along, coming from some far, unknown corner\nof the galaxy. It became a flaming sun in a gray-green space, and\nstrangely, there seemed to be several odd planets circling about the\nsun. Some of them were vast pieces of queer electronic machinery. Some\nwere vague, villainous-looking men. One was the dark-haired girl, and\nthere was lovely contempt in her dark-star pools of eyes.\nThen into the midst of this queer universe, there swam a new planet. It\nwas the face of a man, and the man was Devil Garrett.\nThat brought Star up, out of his daze, onto his feet as though he had\nbeen doused with cold water. He stood there, not staring, just looking\nat Garrett.\nThe most famous killer in the void was big. He was six feet three, and\ntwice as strong as he looked. He wore a huge high-velocity jet-gun, and\na set of electron knives, all of the finest workmanship. He was sitting\non a laboratory chair of steel, and the chair bent slightly under his\ngreat weight.\nHe smiled at Star, and there was a touch of hell in the smile. He said,\n\"Ah, Mr. Garrett.\"\nStar's jaw dropped. \"Garrett? What do you\u2014\" he broke off. A glance at\nthe girl told him what the purpose was.\n\"Look, Mr. Devil Garrett,\" said the pirate, still smiling softly, \"Miss\nHinton is aware of your identity. There is no need to attempt to fool\nus.... I've known it was you ever since I flashed that beam at your\nship. And you needn't flatter yourself that the Devil's luck is going\nto hold out as far as you are concerned. For in a very short while,\nI'm going to have you executed ... before a stellar vision screen,\nconnected with Section Void Headquarters! I wish the authorities to see\nDevil Garrett die, so that I might collect the reward that is offered\non you!\"\nStar stood quiet, and looked straight into Garrett's eyes. After a\nminute of silence, Garrett's lips twisted into a smile, and he said\nmockingly, \"Well, pirate? What are you thinking of?\"\nStar said, in a low, cold voice, \"I'm thinking of putting an electron\nfire-blade into your face, Devil Garrett!\"\nGarrett laughed ... huge, rather evil, bluff laughter. The mirth of a\nperson who is both powerful and dangerous. And then the girl leaped\nforward, shaking with rage.\n\"You beast! Murderer! To accuse this man ... you fool, you might have\nbeen able to complete any scheme of escape you had, if you hadn't\ncalled yourself Starrett Blade! Mr. Blade....\" She gestured toward\nGarrett, who made a mocking, sardonic bow. \"... has given me ample\nproof that he is who he says! And this long before you came. He's shown\nme papers giving a description and showing a tri-dimension picture of\nyou....\"\nFire leaped in Star's eyes. \"Listen ...\" he snapped furiously, as he\nstarted to step forward. Then Garrett made a signal with his hand, and\nsomeone drove a fist against the base of Star's skull.\nWhen Star came to, he was in a cell of sorts. A man standing by the\ndoor told him that he was to be executed, \"... after Mr. Blade and the\nlady have eaten.\" Starrett swore at him, and the man went out, with a\nmocking \"Goodbye, Mr. Garrett!\"\nStar got up. His head spun, and he almost fell at first, but the daze\nleft in his head from the two blows quickly cleared away. He felt for\nvarious weapons which he had hidden about him ... and found them gone.\nGarrett's men had searched carefully.\nStar sat down, his head spinning more now from mystery than from\nphysical pain. He had to keep himself in a whole skin, of course. That\nwas most important right now. But other things were bothering him,\ntugging at his mind like waves slapping around a swamped ship, each\ntrying to shove it in a different direction.\nThere was the girl. Star wondered why she always leaped into his mind\nfirst. And there was the way Garrett was trying to leave the impression\nthat he was Blade, so that he could kill Blade as Garrett.\nObviously, the reason for that was the girl, Miss Hinton, Garrett had\ncalled her. She had been shown faked papers by Garrett, papers proving\nthat the two were ... were whatever Garrett had twisted the story into!\nStar clutched at his head. He was in a mess. He was going to be killed,\nand he was going to die without knowing the score. And he didn't like\nthat. Nor did he like dying as Star Blade shouldn't die; executed as\na \"wolf's-head\" pirate. The girl would be watching, and he felt as if\nthat would make it far worse.\nHis head came up, and he smiled flintily. He still had an ace card! One\nhand felt for it, and he shook his head slowly. It was a gamble ... but\nall the others had been found.\nBlade looked up quickly, as the door opened. Two men came into the\ncell, carrying jet-guns. They motioned Blade to his feet. \"Come on,\nBlade.\" One began, when the other hit him across the mouth.\n\"You fool!\" he hissed. \"You better not call him that; suppose that\ngirl was to hear it? Until the boss gets what he wants on Earth, that\ngirl has got to think that he's Blade! We're killing this guy as Devil\nGarrett! And a loud-mouthed fool like you ... look out!\"\nBlade had landed on the bickering men, and was grappling with the one\nwho had called him by name. As the other leaped forward, swinging a\nclubbing blow with a jet-gun, Star tripped one man into the corner, and\nducked under the gun. He hit the man in the stomach, drove a shoulder\nup under his arms, and smashed the man's face in with a series of sharp\nblows. The man went reeling backward across the room, and Star's hand\nleaped toward that \"ace card\" which he still held.\nDevil Garrett stepped in the door, and made a mock out of a courteous\nbow. As he did so, Star snarled in rage, but stood very still, for the\nelectron knife in Garrett's hand did not waver.\nGarrett gestured silently toward the door, and Star, equally silent,\nwalked over and out, at the point of the weapon.\nStar Blade stood before a transmitter, and thought about death.\nHe was very close to it. Garrett stood five yards away, a gun in\nhis hand, and the muzzle trained on Blade's chest. The gun was the\nuniversally used weapon of execution, an old projectile-firing weapon.\nStar did not doubt that Devil Garrett was an excellent shot with it.\nThe girl, very round-eyed and nervous, sat by Garrett. He had explained\nto her that Garrett was the type of pirate that it is law to kill, or\nhave executed, by anyone. Which was very true.\nA man stepped away from the transmitter, and nodded to Garrett. Star\nfelt a surge of hope, as he saw that it was a two-way transmitter. If\nthe image of an Interstellar Command headquarters was tuned in\u2014Garrett\nwould undoubtedly do it, if only to show the police that he had killed\nStarrett Blade\u2014then Garrett could not kill him and cut the beam in\ntime to prevent one of the police from giving a cry that would echo\nover the sub-space beam arriving almost instantly in this room, and let\nthe girl know that she had been tricked. And Garrett would not want\nthat. Not that it would matter to Starrett Blade.\nThen Star saw what kind of a transmitter it was, and he groaned. It\nwas not a Hineson Sub-space beamer ... it was an old-style transmitter\nwhich had different wave speeds, because of the different space-bridger\nunits in it.\nThe visual image would arrive many seconds before the sound did. Thus\nthe girl would not hear Garrett revealed, but would see only Blade's\ndeath. And then ... whatever Garrett had planned, Blade wished heartily\nthat he could have the chance to interfere.\nThe beam was coming in. Star saw the mists swimming on the screen\nchange, solidify into a figure ... the figure of District Commander\nWeddel seated at a desk. He saw Weddel's eyebrows rise, saw his lips\nmove\u2014then Garrett stepped over a pace, and Weddel saw him, saw the gun\nin his hand....\nThe police officer yelled, silently, and came to his feet, an\nexpression of shocked surprise on his face\u2014surprise, Blade thought\ndesperately, that the girl might interpret as shock at seeing Devil\nGarrett.\nWhich was right, in a way.\nThen, as Commander Weddel leapt to his feet, as Devil Garrett's\nfinger tightened on the trigger, as the girl sucked in her breath\ninvoluntarily, Star Blade scooped up a bit of metal\u2014a fork\u2014and flung\nit at the vision transmitter.\nNot at the screen. But at the equipment behind the dial-board. At a\ncertain small unit, which was almost covered by wires and braces for\nthe large tubes. And the fork struck it, bit deep, and caused result.\nResult in the form of a burned-out set. If television equipment can\ncurse, that set cursed them. Its spitting of sparks and blue electric\nflame mingled with a strange, high-pitched whine.\nIt was the diversion that caused Garrett to miss Star, which gave him\ntime to pull three or four of Garrett's men onto the floor with him.\nOne of the men drove the butt of a jet-gun into the side of Star's\nhead, and for the third time, he went very limp. The last thing he saw\nwas the girl.\nSomehow, the expression on her face was different from what it had\nbeen. He was searching for the difference, when the blow struck\nhim. Somewhere in the space that lies between consciousness and\nunconsciousness, he reflected bitterly that if he kept staring at the\ngirl when he should be fighting, he might not recover some day. This\nwas the third time that he had been knocked out that way. It was not\ngetting monotonous. He still felt it a novelty.\nStar awoke in the same prison cell, facing the wall away from the door.\nHe wondered if he were still alive, tried to move his head, and decided\nthat he wasn't. He didn't even get up or look around when he dimly\nheard the door being opened.\nBut when he heard the girl's voice, he came up and around very swiftly,\ndespite his head.\nIt was the girl all right. Even through the tumbled mists of his brain,\nhe could see that she was not a dream. And as he reeled and fell\nagainst the wall, she was beside him in a flash, her arm supporting him.\nAt first he tried to push himself erect, his head whirling with sick\ndizziness, and bewilderment. Through a twisting haze, he peered up at\nthe girl's face. It reflected a look that, amazingly, was one of\u2014with\nno other phrase to do\u2014compassion. Star half-sighed, and laid his head\non the girl's breast, and closed his eyes.\nIn a minute or two, she said tensely, \"Are you all right?\" Star looked\nup at her.\n\"I guess so. Here\u2014give a hand while I get my balance.\" She held him as\nhe tried a step or two, and then he straightened. \"I guess I'll be all\nright, now,\" he smiled. \"My head feels like\u2014say! How come you're doing\nthis? What made you change your mind? And who are you?\"\nShe said quickly, breathlessly, \"I know you're Star Blade, now. That\ntransmission set.... I can read lips! I\nknew\nwhat that officer was\nsaying! It was just as if I had\nheard\nhim say that ... that you were\nStarrett Blade and that man out there is Devil Garrett!\" she made a\nchoking sound. \"And I've been here, alone, for a month! For a month!\"\n\"A month? Huh\u2014please\u2014you...?\"\nStar took a breath, and started over. \"You.... Who\nare\nyou? What are\nyou doing here?\"\nShe said, \"I'm Anne Hinton. My father is Old John Hinton. Have you\nheard of him?\"\n\"Of course!\" said Star. \"He manufactures most of the equipment '\nBlade\nCosmian\n' uses. Weapons, Hineson Sub-Spacers, Star-Traveler craft ...\nthe ship I was in when Garrett brought me down was a Hinton craft. I\nshould have recognized the name. But go on. What\u2014\"\n\"Garrett communicated with dad, secretly. He posed as Starrett\nBlade, as you, and told dad that he was developing certain new power\nprocesses. And he is! He has a new\u2014or maybe it isn't so new\u2014way of\nelectrolyzing water to liberate hydrogen and oxygen.\"\n\"I think I understand,\" said Star quickly. \"When the oxygen and\nhydrogen are allowed to combine, and produce an explosion which drive\na turbine-generator. Then that could be hitched up to a cyclotron, and\neven the most barren of Alpha's lake-rock planets could be....\"\n\"No,\" she shook her head puzzledly. \"It's just electric power. He said\nthat atomics would release stray rays that would attract pirates.\"\n\"I know,\" Star nodded, abstractedly. \"I was thinking of another\napplication of it ... hmm. But say! What was Garrett after? I know that\nhe wouldn't do this just to get a secret process sold. He must have had\nanother plan behind it. Got any idea?\"\nAnne shook her head slowly. \"I don't know. I can't see....\"\n\"Perhaps I could help you?\" Devil Garrett asked smoothly from the door.\nStar whirled, thrust Anne behind him, but there was no way out. Garrett\nstood in the door, and there were men behind him. The jet in his hand\ncould kill both of the two at one shot. And they had no weapons to\nresist with.\nDevil Garrett stepped them out of the room, and down the corridor,\nthrough a large door Star had noticed at the end of the passage, and\ninto a huge room.\nIt must have been a thousand feet long, and half that wide. It was at\nleast a hundred yards deep. And it was almost filled with gigantic\nmachines.\nBetween the machinery, the spaces were almost filled with steel ladders\nand cat-walks. Crews of men swarmed over them. It was the largest mass\nof equipment Starrett had ever seen.\nHis eyes began to pick out details. Those huge vat-like things down\nat the far end, with the large cables running into them, and the\nmighty pumps connected to them ... they were probably the electrolysis\nchambers.\nAnd those great pipes, they must carry the hydrogen and oxygen from\nthe electro chambers to the large replicas of engines, which could be\nnothing else but the explosion chambers, where the gases were allowed\nto re-unite, and explode. And there by the giant engines, those must be\nturbines, which in turn connected with the vast-sized generators just\nunder the platforms on which they stood.\nStar Blade whistled softly through his teeth. A huge enterprise! It\ncould be ... but for a moment he had forgotten Devil Garrett.\nThe girl standing by his side, Star turned toward Garrett. \"Well?\"\nGarrett smiled his mocking grin. \"You grasp the principle, of course.\nBut let me show you ... you see those pipes that run from the turbines\nafter the wheels?\"\n\"Yes. They carry the gases off. Where do they lead?\"\n\"Into giant subterranean caverns beneath the surface!\" Garrett said.\n\"Now look over there, on the platforms across from us. Can you\nrecognize a Barden energy-beamer, Blade? Run by power from my little\nplant here, which is run by water from a thousand lakes!\n\"Just imagine, if you can, hundreds of those plants all over Alpha\nIII. And each one with dozens of high-powered Barden beams to protect\nit! And Hinton ray screens to protect us from radio-controlled rocket\nshells from space, or Barden Rays, or any other weapon of offence, or\nto warn if anyone lands on this planet!\" Garrett leaned forward, his\neyes aglow.\n\"Blade, I'll take over the few governing posts on this little planet,\nand I'll rule an entire world, a whole planet to myself! It'll be the\nfirst time in history! And it won't be the last. With the Hinton secret\npatents, the plans of all John Hinton's inventions and processes....\"\nStar twisted, and got his \"ace card\" out of its hiding place.\nIt was a jet weapon, little more than a jet-blast capsule for a\njet-gun. The sides were thicker and stronger, and there was a device\nfixed on it so it could be fired. Altogether, it was somewhat smaller\nthan an old-style fountain pen.\nHe twisted up from the floor, and moved faster than he had moved ever\nbefore. Star was famous for his speed and the quickness and alertness\nof his reflexes. He earned his fame a score of times over in that one\ninstant.\nAnd Devil Garrett died.\nThere was perhaps an eighth of a second between the staff of blue white\nfire from the tiny jet in Star's hand and the huge broadsword of fire\nfrom Garrett's gun. But in the split-second Star's fire knifed into\nGarrett's vitals, and Garrett gave a convulsive jerk, and fired even as\nhis muscles started the jerking movement.\nAnd the flame went over Star's head, singeing his scalp.\nOf the four men with Garrett, one let go of the struggling Anne, and\nswore as he snatched at an electron knife in his belt. Anne's hand\nhad already whipped the knife out, and without bothering to press the\nelectron stud, she buried the knife in his back.\nTwo of the remaining men whirled, and went for the door as though a\ndevil was after them. The other tried to get a jet-gun out. It was his\nfinal mistake. A blue lance from Anne's knife whipped close enough to\nhim to make him dodge, and then Star got his hand on Garrett's jet.\nThe other two men had, in their flight, taken a door which led, not\ninto the large corridor, but into a small room at one side, a room\nfilled with instruments and recording devices for the machinery in the\nroom below. Star leaped to the side of the door, and called, \"Are you\ngoing to come out, or am I coming in to get you?\"\nThere was a short silence, in which Anne heard one say hoarsely, \"He\ncan't get us ... we could get him if he came in the door.\"\n\"Oh, yes?\" was the answer. \"Do you know who that guy is? He's the one\nthey call 'Death Star.' I'm not facing Starrett Blade in a gun fight.\nYou can do what you like, but I'm leaving.\" Then he lifted his voice.\n\"Hey, Blade! I'm coming out. Don't shoot.\"\n\"Okay,\" threw back Star and the man appeared in the doorway, empty\nhands held high. After a second, the other joined him.\nAnne turned to Star. \"Now I know why they call you 'Death Star' Blade,\"\nshe said, and gestured toward the men who had surrendered, and the two\nwhom Starrett had shot down.\nHe mused there for a minute. Then Anne broke the silence with, \"Star,\nwhat are we going to do now? Garrett's men will be up here in a little\nwhile. We can't get to a sub-space beam. What are we going to do when\nthey come up to investigate?\"\nStarrett Blade laughed. \"Do? Well, we could turn them over to Commander\nWeddel!\"\n\"\nWhat?\n\"\nGrinning broadly, Star pointed, with a flourish, at the door. Anne\nspun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from the\ncorridor.\n\"Very simple,\" said Star across the lounge to Anne. \"When I smashed\nthe vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which is\nincluded in all sets. You know, a direction finder doesn't work, except\nin the liner-beam principle, in space, because of the diffusing effect\nof unrestricted cosmic rays.\"\n\"Yes, I knew that,\" said Anne. \"But how\u2014\"\nStarrett grinned again. \"A type of beam has been found which it is\nimpossible for cosmics to disturb. But you can't send messages on\nit, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit is\nbroken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is a\ndistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal\nis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity\ncruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He\nstopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See\nthese papers?\"\n\"Uh-huh. What are they, Star?\"\n\"They are the main plans of Devil Garrett's power plant, and they're\nthe one good thing he's ever done. These plans are going to bring the\nbarren, rocky Centauri planets to life!\"\nHe got up, and paced to the window, and stood there, looking out, and\nup through the plastic port. \"The planets of Centauri!\" he murmured\nsoftly. \"Seven circling Alpha alone. And all seven are barren, rocky,\nlevel except for the thousands of lakes ... lakes that are going to be\nthe life of Centauri!\"\nHe turned back to the window. \"And all because a pirate named Devil\nGarrett built a vast power plant to use to garner more power!\"\n\"You know, Anne, as a mockery, and a warning, I think I'll propose that\nthis planet be officially named ... 'Garrett'!\"\nShe looked up at him, and there was laughter bright in her eyes, and\ntugging at her mouth. \"Yes, there ought to be a reason,\" she murmured.\nStar wavered. She was so darn close.\nAfter a minute, she turned her head, and looked up at him. \"Star, how\nsoon will there be those gardens and woods you described? I mean,\nhow long before Garrett can be turned into that kind of world you\ndescribed?\"\n\"Why ... under pressure, we can do it in six months. Why?\"\n\"Not half quick enough,\" she murmured happily, \"but it'll have to do,\nStar.\" Laughing, she turned her face up to his. \"Have you ever thought\nthat planet Garrett will be wonderful for a honeymoon?\"\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nDEATH STAR\nBy TOM PACE\nTrapped by the most feared of space pirates\nDevil Garrett, Starrett Blade was fighting for\nhis life. Weaponless, his ship gone, he was\npinning his hopes on a girl\u2014who wanted him dead.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Spring 1945.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nStarrett Blade crouched in the rocks by the tiny Centaurian lake. It\nwas only about two or three hundred feet across, but probably thousands\nof feet deep. This lake, and hundreds of others like it, were the\nonly things to break the monotony of the flat, rocky surface of Alpha\nCentauri III\u2014called the most barren planet in space.\nTen minutes ago, Star Blade's ship had spun into the stagnant waters\nbefore him. An emergency release had flung the air-lock doors open, and\nthe air pressure had flung Star out. And now he was waiting for Devil\nGarrett to come down to the water's edge to search for him.\nFor eight years, Devil Garrett had been the top space pirate in the\nvoid. For a year, Star himself had personally been hunting him. And on\na tour over Alpha III, a Barden energy-beam had stabbed up at Blade's\nship, and Star Blade had crashed into the lake.\nThat Barden Beam had Star worried and puzzled. It took a million volts\nof power for a split-second flash of the beam. Garrett didn't have an\natomics plant on Alpha III\u2014if he had, escaping rays would point it\nout, no matter how well it was camouflaged. There was no water power,\nfor there was no running water. There were only the lakes ... and tidal\npower was out, for Alpha III had no moon.\nHowever, that could wait. Star slid the electron knife from his\nwater-proof sheath, gripped it firmly. He could hear quick footsteps as\na man came down the trail that led directly past his hiding place.\nIt wasn't Garrett, which was disappointing. But it was one of his men,\nand he was heavily armed. That didn't worry Star.\nHis fighting had earned Starrett Blade the nickname of \"Death Star.\"\nThe man walked to the water's edge, and peered out over the pool. He\nsaw the bubbles that were coming up from the sinking ship, and he\nnodded, grunted in satisfaction, and started to turn back.\nStar landed on him, knocking him sprawling on the rock. The pirate\njerked up an arm, holding the jet-gun.\nThe stabbing lance of blue fire cracked from the electron knife, dug\ninto the man's heart.\nStar tossed the dead pirate's cloak over his shoulders, and thrust both\nelectron blade and jet-gun into his belt. He straightened, and saw the\nleveled gun from the corner of his eye.\nHe got the jet in his right hand, the knife in his left, and went into\na dive that flipped him behind a rock. The three actions took only a\nsplit-second, and the blast from the jet-gun flaked rock where he had\nbeen standing.\nWhile a jet-gun is the most deadly weapon known, you have to press a\nloading stud to slide another blast-capsule into place. Death Star knew\nthis very well. So he knew he was safe in coming up from behind the\nspur of stone to fire his own gun.\nIf his reflexes hadn't been as quick as they were, he would have\nblasted the girl.\nHe stopped, and stood for a second, staring at the girl. She was\nsomething to invite stares, too. In the moment that lasted between her\nnext move, he had time to register that she was about five feet five\ntall, black-haired\u2014the kind of black hair that looks like silken spun\ndarkness\u2014dark-eyed, and possessing both a face and a form that would\nmake anyone stop and gulp.\nThen the moment of half-awed survey was over, and she leveled the jet\non him, and said in a trembling voice, \"Drop those weapons, or I'll\nblast you ...\npirate\n!\"\nDeath Star said, \"That jet-gun is empty. I can see the register on the\nmagazine. And I'm not a pirate. I'm Starrett Blade.\"\nThe useless jet-gun slid out of the girl's hand, and she gave a\nhalf-gasp. \"Starrett Blade! I\u2014I don't believe ...\" she broke off\nabruptly. \"So you're Death Star! A fine story for a hired killer, a\npirate.\"\nStar reddened. \"Look,\" he snapped, \"I don't know who's been talking to\nyou, but ...\" he whirled, and his hand whipped the jet-gun from his\nbelt. As he did so, the girl jerked up the jet-gun she had dropped, and\nflung it with all her strength. The blow landed on his arm and side,\nand paralyzed him long enough for the man who had leaped out behind him\nto land a stunning blow against his head. As Star went down, he dizzily\ncursed himself for becoming interested in the argument with the girl,\nso that he did not heed his reflexes in time ... and dimly, he wondered\nwhy it had seemed so important to convince the lovely dark-haired girl.\nThen a bit of the cosmos seemed to fall on Star's head, and he was\nhurled into blackness.\nAn eternity seemed to pass.\nDeep in the blackness, a light was born. It leaped toward him, a\nfar-away comet rocketing along, coming from some far, unknown corner\nof the galaxy. It became a flaming sun in a gray-green space, and\nstrangely, there seemed to be several odd planets circling about the\nsun. Some of them were vast pieces of queer electronic machinery. Some\nwere vague, villainous-looking men. One was the dark-haired girl, and\nthere was lovely contempt in her dark-star pools of eyes.\nThen into the midst of this queer universe, there swam a new planet. It\nwas the face of a man, and the man was Devil Garrett.\nThat brought Star up, out of his daze, onto his feet as though he had\nbeen doused with cold water. He stood there, not staring, just looking\nat Garrett.\nThe most famous killer in the void was big. He was six feet three, and\ntwice as strong as he looked. He wore a huge high-velocity jet-gun, and\na set of electron knives, all of the finest workmanship. He was sitting\non a laboratory chair of steel, and the chair bent slightly under his\ngreat weight.\nHe smiled at Star, and there was a touch of hell in the smile. He said,\n\"Ah, Mr. Garrett.\"\nStar's jaw dropped. \"Garrett? What do you\u2014\" he broke off. A glance at\nthe girl told him what the purpose was.\n\"Look, Mr. Devil Garrett,\" said the pirate, still smiling softly, \"Miss\nHinton is aware of your identity. There is no need to attempt to fool\nus.... I've known it was you ever since I flashed that beam at your\nship. And you needn't flatter yourself that the Devil's luck is going\nto hold out as far as you are concerned. For in a very short while,\nI'm going to have you executed ... before a stellar vision screen,\nconnected with Section Void Headquarters! I wish the authorities to see\nDevil Garrett die, so that I might collect the reward that is offered\non you!\"\nStar stood quiet, and looked straight into Garrett's eyes. After a\nminute of silence, Garrett's lips twisted into a smile, and he said\nmockingly, \"Well, pirate? What are you thinking of?\"\nStar said, in a low, cold voice, \"I'm thinking of putting an electron\nfire-blade into your face, Devil Garrett!\"\nGarrett laughed ... huge, rather evil, bluff laughter. The mirth of a\nperson who is both powerful and dangerous. And then the girl leaped\nforward, shaking with rage.\n\"You beast! Murderer! To accuse this man ... you fool, you might have\nbeen able to complete any scheme of escape you had, if you hadn't\ncalled yourself Starrett Blade! Mr. Blade....\" She gestured toward\nGarrett, who made a mocking, sardonic bow. \"... has given me ample\nproof that he is who he says! And this long before you came. He's shown\nme papers giving a description and showing a tri-dimension picture of\nyou....\"\nFire leaped in Star's eyes. \"Listen ...\" he snapped furiously, as he\nstarted to step forward. Then Garrett made a signal with his hand, and\nsomeone drove a fist against the base of Star's skull.\nWhen Star came to, he was in a cell of sorts. A man standing by the\ndoor told him that he was to be executed, \"... after Mr. Blade and the\nlady have eaten.\" Starrett swore at him, and the man went out, with a\nmocking \"Goodbye, Mr. Garrett!\"\nStar got up. His head spun, and he almost fell at first, but the daze\nleft in his head from the two blows quickly cleared away. He felt for\nvarious weapons which he had hidden about him ... and found them gone.\nGarrett's men had searched carefully.\nStar sat down, his head spinning more now from mystery than from\nphysical pain. He had to keep himself in a whole skin, of course. That\nwas most important right now. But other things were bothering him,\ntugging at his mind like waves slapping around a swamped ship, each\ntrying to shove it in a different direction.\nThere was the girl. Star wondered why she always leaped into his mind\nfirst. And there was the way Garrett was trying to leave the impression\nthat he was Blade, so that he could kill Blade as Garrett.\nObviously, the reason for that was the girl, Miss Hinton, Garrett had\ncalled her. She had been shown faked papers by Garrett, papers proving\nthat the two were ... were whatever Garrett had twisted the story into!\nStar clutched at his head. He was in a mess. He was going to be killed,\nand he was going to die without knowing the score. And he didn't like\nthat. Nor did he like dying as Star Blade shouldn't die; executed as\na \"wolf's-head\" pirate. The girl would be watching, and he felt as if\nthat would make it far worse.\nHis head came up, and he smiled flintily. He still had an ace card! One\nhand felt for it, and he shook his head slowly. It was a gamble ... but\nall the others had been found.\nBlade looked up quickly, as the door opened. Two men came into the\ncell, carrying jet-guns. They motioned Blade to his feet. \"Come on,\nBlade.\" One began, when the other hit him across the mouth.\n\"You fool!\" he hissed. \"You better not call him that; suppose that\ngirl was to hear it? Until the boss gets what he wants on Earth, that\ngirl has got to think that he's Blade! We're killing this guy as Devil\nGarrett! And a loud-mouthed fool like you ... look out!\"\nBlade had landed on the bickering men, and was grappling with the one\nwho had called him by name. As the other leaped forward, swinging a\nclubbing blow with a jet-gun, Star tripped one man into the corner, and\nducked under the gun. He hit the man in the stomach, drove a shoulder\nup under his arms, and smashed the man's face in with a series of sharp\nblows. The man went reeling backward across the room, and Star's hand\nleaped toward that \"ace card\" which he still held.\nDevil Garrett stepped in the door, and made a mock out of a courteous\nbow. As he did so, Star snarled in rage, but stood very still, for the\nelectron knife in Garrett's hand did not waver.\nGarrett gestured silently toward the door, and Star, equally silent,\nwalked over and out, at the point of the weapon.\nStar Blade stood before a transmitter, and thought about death.\nHe was very close to it. Garrett stood five yards away, a gun in\nhis hand, and the muzzle trained on Blade's chest. The gun was the\nuniversally used weapon of execution, an old projectile-firing weapon.\nStar did not doubt that Devil Garrett was an excellent shot with it.\nThe girl, very round-eyed and nervous, sat by Garrett. He had explained\nto her that Garrett was the type of pirate that it is law to kill, or\nhave executed, by anyone. Which was very true.\nA man stepped away from the transmitter, and nodded to Garrett. Star\nfelt a surge of hope, as he saw that it was a two-way transmitter. If\nthe image of an Interstellar Command headquarters was tuned in\u2014Garrett\nwould undoubtedly do it, if only to show the police that he had killed\nStarrett Blade\u2014then Garrett could not kill him and cut the beam in\ntime to prevent one of the police from giving a cry that would echo\nover the sub-space beam arriving almost instantly in this room, and let\nthe girl know that she had been tricked. And Garrett would not want\nthat. Not that it would matter to Starrett Blade.\nThen Star saw what kind of a transmitter it was, and he groaned. It\nwas not a Hineson Sub-space beamer ... it was an old-style transmitter\nwhich had different wave speeds, because of the different space-bridger\nunits in it.\nThe visual image would arrive many seconds before the sound did. Thus\nthe girl would not hear Garrett revealed, but would see only Blade's\ndeath. And then ... whatever Garrett had planned, Blade wished heartily\nthat he could have the chance to interfere.\nThe beam was coming in. Star saw the mists swimming on the screen\nchange, solidify into a figure ... the figure of District Commander\nWeddel seated at a desk. He saw Weddel's eyebrows rise, saw his lips\nmove\u2014then Garrett stepped over a pace, and Weddel saw him, saw the gun\nin his hand....\nThe police officer yelled, silently, and came to his feet, an\nexpression of shocked surprise on his face\u2014surprise, Blade thought\ndesperately, that the girl might interpret as shock at seeing Devil\nGarrett.\nWhich was right, in a way.\nThen, as Commander Weddel leapt to his feet, as Devil Garrett's\nfinger tightened on the trigger, as the girl sucked in her breath\ninvoluntarily, Star Blade scooped up a bit of metal\u2014a fork\u2014and flung\nit at the vision transmitter.\nNot at the screen. But at the equipment behind the dial-board. At a\ncertain small unit, which was almost covered by wires and braces for\nthe large tubes. And the fork struck it, bit deep, and caused result.\nResult in the form of a burned-out set. If television equipment can\ncurse, that set cursed them. Its spitting of sparks and blue electric\nflame mingled with a strange, high-pitched whine.\nIt was the diversion that caused Garrett to miss Star, which gave him\ntime to pull three or four of Garrett's men onto the floor with him.\nOne of the men drove the butt of a jet-gun into the side of Star's\nhead, and for the third time, he went very limp. The last thing he saw\nwas the girl.\nSomehow, the expression on her face was different from what it had\nbeen. He was searching for the difference, when the blow struck\nhim. Somewhere in the space that lies between consciousness and\nunconsciousness, he reflected bitterly that if he kept staring at the\ngirl when he should be fighting, he might not recover some day. This\nwas the third time that he had been knocked out that way. It was not\ngetting monotonous. He still felt it a novelty.\nStar awoke in the same prison cell, facing the wall away from the door.\nHe wondered if he were still alive, tried to move his head, and decided\nthat he wasn't. He didn't even get up or look around when he dimly\nheard the door being opened.\nBut when he heard the girl's voice, he came up and around very swiftly,\ndespite his head.\nIt was the girl all right. Even through the tumbled mists of his brain,\nhe could see that she was not a dream. And as he reeled and fell\nagainst the wall, she was beside him in a flash, her arm supporting him.\nAt first he tried to push himself erect, his head whirling with sick\ndizziness, and bewilderment. Through a twisting haze, he peered up at\nthe girl's face. It reflected a look that, amazingly, was one of\u2014with\nno other phrase to do\u2014compassion. Star half-sighed, and laid his head\non the girl's breast, and closed his eyes.\nIn a minute or two, she said tensely, \"Are you all right?\" Star looked\nup at her.\n\"I guess so. Here\u2014give a hand while I get my balance.\" She held him as\nhe tried a step or two, and then he straightened. \"I guess I'll be all\nright, now,\" he smiled. \"My head feels like\u2014say! How come you're doing\nthis? What made you change your mind? And who are you?\"\nShe said quickly, breathlessly, \"I know you're Star Blade, now. That\ntransmission set.... I can read lips! I\nknew\nwhat that officer was\nsaying! It was just as if I had\nheard\nhim say that ... that you were\nStarrett Blade and that man out there is Devil Garrett!\" she made a\nchoking sound. \"And I've been here, alone, for a month! For a month!\"\n\"A month? Huh\u2014please\u2014you...?\"\nStar took a breath, and started over. \"You.... Who\nare\nyou? What are\nyou doing here?\"\nShe said, \"I'm Anne Hinton. My father is Old John Hinton. Have you\nheard of him?\"\n\"Of course!\" said Star. \"He manufactures most of the equipment '\nBlade\nCosmian\n' uses. Weapons, Hineson Sub-Spacers, Star-Traveler craft ...\nthe ship I was in when Garrett brought me down was a Hinton craft. I\nshould have recognized the name. But go on. What\u2014\"\n\"Garrett communicated with dad, secretly. He posed as Starrett\nBlade, as you, and told dad that he was developing certain new power\nprocesses. And he is! He has a new\u2014or maybe it isn't so new\u2014way of\nelectrolyzing water to liberate hydrogen and oxygen.\"\n\"I think I understand,\" said Star quickly. \"When the oxygen and\nhydrogen are allowed to combine, and produce an explosion which drive\na turbine-generator. Then that could be hitched up to a cyclotron, and\neven the most barren of Alpha's lake-rock planets could be....\"\n\"No,\" she shook her head puzzledly. \"It's just electric power. He said\nthat atomics would release stray rays that would attract pirates.\"\n\"I know,\" Star nodded, abstractedly. \"I was thinking of another\napplication of it ... hmm. But say! What was Garrett after? I know that\nhe wouldn't do this just to get a secret process sold. He must have had\nanother plan behind it. Got any idea?\"\nAnne shook her head slowly. \"I don't know. I can't see....\"\n\"Perhaps I could help you?\" Devil Garrett asked smoothly from the door.\nStar whirled, thrust Anne behind him, but there was no way out. Garrett\nstood in the door, and there were men behind him. The jet in his hand\ncould kill both of the two at one shot. And they had no weapons to\nresist with.\nDevil Garrett stepped them out of the room, and down the corridor,\nthrough a large door Star had noticed at the end of the passage, and\ninto a huge room.\nIt must have been a thousand feet long, and half that wide. It was at\nleast a hundred yards deep. And it was almost filled with gigantic\nmachines.\nBetween the machinery, the spaces were almost filled with steel ladders\nand cat-walks. Crews of men swarmed over them. It was the largest mass\nof equipment Starrett had ever seen.\nHis eyes began to pick out details. Those huge vat-like things down\nat the far end, with the large cables running into them, and the\nmighty pumps connected to them ... they were probably the electrolysis\nchambers.\nAnd those great pipes, they must carry the hydrogen and oxygen from\nthe electro chambers to the large replicas of engines, which could be\nnothing else but the explosion chambers, where the gases were allowed\nto re-unite, and explode. And there by the giant engines, those must be\nturbines, which in turn connected with the vast-sized generators just\nunder the platforms on which they stood.\nStar Blade whistled softly through his teeth. A huge enterprise! It\ncould be ... but for a moment he had forgotten Devil Garrett.\nThe girl standing by his side, Star turned toward Garrett. \"Well?\"\nGarrett smiled his mocking grin. \"You grasp the principle, of course.\nBut let me show you ... you see those pipes that run from the turbines\nafter the wheels?\"\n\"Yes. They carry the gases off. Where do they lead?\"\n\"Into giant subterranean caverns beneath the surface!\" Garrett said.\n\"Now look over there, on the platforms across from us. Can you\nrecognize a Barden energy-beamer, Blade? Run by power from my little\nplant here, which is run by water from a thousand lakes!\n\"Just imagine, if you can, hundreds of those plants all over Alpha\nIII. And each one with dozens of high-powered Barden beams to protect\nit! And Hinton ray screens to protect us from radio-controlled rocket\nshells from space, or Barden Rays, or any other weapon of offence, or\nto warn if anyone lands on this planet!\" Garrett leaned forward, his\neyes aglow.\n\"Blade, I'll take over the few governing posts on this little planet,\nand I'll rule an entire world, a whole planet to myself! It'll be the\nfirst time in history! And it won't be the last. With the Hinton secret\npatents, the plans of all John Hinton's inventions and processes....\"\nStar twisted, and got his \"ace card\" out of its hiding place.\nIt was a jet weapon, little more than a jet-blast capsule for a\njet-gun. The sides were thicker and stronger, and there was a device\nfixed on it so it could be fired. Altogether, it was somewhat smaller\nthan an old-style fountain pen.\nHe twisted up from the floor, and moved faster than he had moved ever\nbefore. Star was famous for his speed and the quickness and alertness\nof his reflexes. He earned his fame a score of times over in that one\ninstant.\nAnd Devil Garrett died.\nThere was perhaps an eighth of a second between the staff of blue white\nfire from the tiny jet in Star's hand and the huge broadsword of fire\nfrom Garrett's gun. But in the split-second Star's fire knifed into\nGarrett's vitals, and Garrett gave a convulsive jerk, and fired even as\nhis muscles started the jerking movement.\nAnd the flame went over Star's head, singeing his scalp.\nOf the four men with Garrett, one let go of the struggling Anne, and\nswore as he snatched at an electron knife in his belt. Anne's hand\nhad already whipped the knife out, and without bothering to press the\nelectron stud, she buried the knife in his back.\nTwo of the remaining men whirled, and went for the door as though a\ndevil was after them. The other tried to get a jet-gun out. It was his\nfinal mistake. A blue lance from Anne's knife whipped close enough to\nhim to make him dodge, and then Star got his hand on Garrett's jet.\nThe other two men had, in their flight, taken a door which led, not\ninto the large corridor, but into a small room at one side, a room\nfilled with instruments and recording devices for the machinery in the\nroom below. Star leaped to the side of the door, and called, \"Are you\ngoing to come out, or am I coming in to get you?\"\nThere was a short silence, in which Anne heard one say hoarsely, \"He\ncan't get us ... we could get him if he came in the door.\"\n\"Oh, yes?\" was the answer. \"Do you know who that guy is? He's the one\nthey call 'Death Star.' I'm not facing Starrett Blade in a gun fight.\nYou can do what you like, but I'm leaving.\" Then he lifted his voice.\n\"Hey, Blade! I'm coming out. Don't shoot.\"\n\"Okay,\" threw back Star and the man appeared in the doorway, empty\nhands held high. After a second, the other joined him.\nAnne turned to Star. \"Now I know why they call you 'Death Star' Blade,\"\nshe said, and gestured toward the men who had surrendered, and the two\nwhom Starrett had shot down.\nHe mused there for a minute. Then Anne broke the silence with, \"Star,\nwhat are we going to do now? Garrett's men will be up here in a little\nwhile. We can't get to a sub-space beam. What are we going to do when\nthey come up to investigate?\"\nStarrett Blade laughed. \"Do? Well, we could turn them over to Commander\nWeddel!\"\n\"\nWhat?\n\"\nGrinning broadly, Star pointed, with a flourish, at the door. Anne\nspun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from the\ncorridor.\n\"Very simple,\" said Star across the lounge to Anne. \"When I smashed\nthe vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which is\nincluded in all sets. You know, a direction finder doesn't work, except\nin the liner-beam principle, in space, because of the diffusing effect\nof unrestricted cosmic rays.\"\n\"Yes, I knew that,\" said Anne. \"But how\u2014\"\nStarrett grinned again. \"A type of beam has been found which it is\nimpossible for cosmics to disturb. But you can't send messages on\nit, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit is\nbroken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is a\ndistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal\nis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity\ncruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He\nstopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See\nthese papers?\"\n\"Uh-huh. What are they, Star?\"\n\"They are the main plans of Devil Garrett's power plant, and they're\nthe one good thing he's ever done. These plans are going to bring the\nbarren, rocky Centauri planets to life!\"\nHe got up, and paced to the window, and stood there, looking out, and\nup through the plastic port. \"The planets of Centauri!\" he murmured\nsoftly. \"Seven circling Alpha alone. And all seven are barren, rocky,\nlevel except for the thousands of lakes ... lakes that are going to be\nthe life of Centauri!\"\nHe turned back to the window. \"And all because a pirate named Devil\nGarrett built a vast power plant to use to garner more power!\"\n\"You know, Anne, as a mockery, and a warning, I think I'll propose that\nthis planet be officially named ... 'Garrett'!\"\nShe looked up at him, and there was laughter bright in her eyes, and\ntugging at her mouth. \"Yes, there ought to be a reason,\" she murmured.\nStar wavered. She was so darn close.\nAfter a minute, she turned her head, and looked up at him. \"Star, how\nsoon will there be those gardens and woods you described? I mean,\nhow long before Garrett can be turned into that kind of world you\ndescribed?\"\n\"Why ... under pressure, we can do it in six months. Why?\"\n\"Not half quick enough,\" she murmured happily, \"but it'll have to do,\nStar.\" Laughing, she turned her face up to his. \"Have you ever thought\nthat planet Garrett will be wonderful for a honeymoon?\"\n", "summary": "Star is fighting for his life.

Weaponless, his ship gone, he was\npinning his hopes on a girl\u2014who wanted him dead.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Spring 1945.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nStarrett Blade crouched in the rocks by the tiny Centaurian lake. It\nwas only about two or three hundred feet across, but probably thousands\nof feet deep. This lake, and hundreds of others like it, were the\nonly things to break the monotony of the flat, rocky surface of Alpha\nCentauri III\u2014called the most barren planet in space.\nTen minutes ago, Star Blade's ship had spun into the stagnant waters\nbefore him. An emergency release had flung the air-lock doors open, and\nthe air pressure had flung Star out. And now he was waiting for Devil\nGarrett to come down to the water's edge to search for him.\nFor eight years, Devil Garrett had been the top space pirate in the\nvoid. For a year, Star himself had personally been hunting him. And on\na tour over Alpha III, a Barden energy-beam had stabbed up at Blade's\nship, and Star Blade had crashed into the lake.\nThat Barden Beam had Star worried and puzzled. It took a million volts\nof power for a split-second flash of the beam. Garrett didn't have an\natomics plant on Alpha III\u2014if he had, escaping rays would point it\nout, no matter how well it was camouflaged. There was no water power,\nfor there was no running water. There were only the lakes ... and tidal\npower was out, for Alpha III had no moon.\nHowever, that could wait. Star slid the electron knife from his\nwater-proof sheath, gripped it firmly. He could hear quick footsteps as\na man came down the trail that led directly past his hiding place.\nIt wasn't Garrett, which was disappointing. But it was one of his men,\nand he was heavily armed. That didn't worry Star.\nHis fighting had earned Starrett Blade the nickname of \"Death Star.\"\nThe man walked to the water's edge, and peered out over the pool. He\nsaw the bubbles that were coming up from the sinking ship, and he\nnodded, grunted in satisfaction, and started to turn back.\nStar landed on him, knocking him sprawling on the rock. The pirate\njerked up an arm, holding the jet-gun.\nThe stabbing lance of blue fire cracked from the electron knife, dug\ninto the man's heart.\nStar tossed the dead pirate's cloak over his shoulders, and thrust both\nelectron blade and jet-gun into his belt. He straightened, and saw the\nleveled gun from the corner of his eye.\nHe got the jet in his right hand, the knife in his left, and went into\na dive that flipped him behind a rock. The three actions took only a\nsplit-second, and the blast from the jet-gun flaked rock where he had\nbeen standing.\nWhile a jet-gun is the most deadly weapon known, you have to press a\nloading stud to slide another blast-capsule into place. Death Star knew\nthis very well. So he knew he was safe in coming up from behind the\nspur of stone to fire his own gun.\nIf his reflexes hadn't been as quick as they were, he would have\nblasted the girl.\nHe stopped, and stood for a second, staring at the girl. She was\nsomething to invite stares, too. In the moment that lasted between her\nnext move, he had time to register that she was about five feet five\ntall, black-haired\u2014the kind of black hair that looks like silken spun\ndarkness\u2014dark-eyed, and possessing both a face and a form that would\nmake anyone stop and gulp.\nThen the moment of half-awed survey was over, and she leveled the jet\non him, and said in a trembling voice, \"Drop those weapons, or I'll\nblast you ...\npirate\n!\"\nDeath Star said, \"That jet-gun is empty. I can see the register on the\nmagazine. And I'm not a pirate. I'm Starrett Blade.\"\nThe useless jet-gun slid out of the girl's hand, and she gave a\nhalf-gasp. \"Starrett Blade! I\u2014I don't believe ...\" she broke off\nabruptly. \"So you're Death Star! A fine story for a hired killer, a\npirate.\"\nStar reddened. \"Look,\" he snapped, \"I don't know who's been talking to\nyou, but ...\" he whirled, and his hand whipped the jet-gun from his\nbelt. As he did so, the girl jerked up the jet-gun she had dropped, and\nflung it with all her strength. The blow landed on his arm and side,\nand paralyzed him long enough for the man who had leaped out behind him\nto land a stunning blow against his head. As Star went down, he dizzily\ncursed himself for becoming interested in the argument with the girl,\nso that he did not heed his reflexes in time ... and dimly, he wondered\nwhy it had seemed so important to convince the lovely dark-haired girl.\nThen a bit of the cosmos seemed to fall on Star's head, and he was\nhurled into blackness.\nAn eternity seemed to pass.\nDeep in the blackness, a light was born. It leaped toward him, a\nfar-away comet rocketing along, coming from some far, unknown corner\nof the galaxy. It became a flaming sun in a gray-green space, and\nstrangely, there seemed to be several odd planets circling about the\nsun. Some of them were vast pieces of queer electronic machinery. Some\nwere vague, villainous-looking men. One was the dark-haired girl, and\nthere was lovely contempt in her dark-star pools of eyes.\nThen into the midst of this queer universe, there swam a new planet. It\nwas the face of a man, and the man was Devil Garrett.\nThat brought Star up, out of his daze, onto his feet as though he had\nbeen doused with cold water. He stood there, not staring, just looking\nat Garrett.\nThe most famous killer in the void was big. He was six feet three, and\ntwice as strong as he looked. He wore a huge high-velocity jet-gun, and\na set of electron knives, all of the finest workmanship. He was sitting\non a laboratory chair of steel, and the chair bent slightly under his\ngreat weight.\nHe smiled at Star, and there was a touch of hell in the smile. He said,\n\"Ah, Mr. Garrett.\"\nStar's jaw dropped. \"Garrett? What do you\u2014\" he broke off. A glance at\nthe girl told him what the purpose was.\n\"Look, Mr. Devil Garrett,\" said the pirate, still smiling softly, \"Miss\nHinton is aware of your identity. There is no need to attempt to fool\nus.... I've known it was you ever since I flashed that beam at your\nship. And you needn't flatter yourself that the Devil's luck is going\nto hold out as far as you are concerned. For in a very short while,\nI'm going to have you executed ... before a stellar vision screen,\nconnected with Section Void Headquarters! I wish the authorities to see\nDevil Garrett die, so that I might collect the reward that is offered\non you!\"\nStar stood quiet, and looked straight into Garrett's eyes. After a\nminute of silence, Garrett's lips twisted into a smile, and he said\nmockingly, \"Well, pirate? What are you thinking of?\"\nStar said, in a low, cold voice, \"I'm thinking of putting an electron\nfire-blade into your face, Devil Garrett!\"\nGarrett laughed ... huge, rather evil, bluff laughter. The mirth of a\nperson who is both powerful and dangerous. And then the girl leaped\nforward, shaking with rage.\n\"You beast! Murderer! To accuse this man ... you fool, you might have\nbeen able to complete any scheme of escape you had, if you hadn't\ncalled yourself Starrett Blade! Mr. Blade....\" She gestured toward\nGarrett, who made a mocking, sardonic bow. \"... has given me ample\nproof that he is who he says! And this long before you came. He's shown\nme papers giving a description and showing a tri-dimension picture of\nyou....\"\nFire leaped in Star's eyes. \"Listen ...\" he snapped furiously, as he\nstarted to step forward. Then Garrett made a signal with his hand, and\nsomeone drove a fist against the base of Star's skull.\nWhen Star came to, he was in a cell of sorts. A man standing by the\ndoor told him that he was to be executed, \"... after Mr. Blade and the\nlady have eaten.\" Starrett swore at him, and the man went out, with a\nmocking \"Goodbye, Mr. Garrett!\"\nStar got up. His head spun, and he almost fell at first, but the daze\nleft in his head from the two blows quickly cleared away. He felt for\nvarious weapons which he had hidden about him ... and found them gone.\nGarrett's men had searched carefully.\nStar sat down, his head spinning more now from mystery than from\nphysical pain. He had to keep himself in a whole skin, of course. That\nwas most important right now. But other things were bothering him,\ntugging at his mind like waves slapping around a swamped ship, each\ntrying to shove it in a different direction.\nThere was the girl. Star wondered why she always leaped into his mind\nfirst. And there was the way Garrett was trying to leave the impression\nthat he was Blade, so that he could kill Blade as Garrett.\nObviously, the reason for that was the girl, Miss Hinton, Garrett had\ncalled her. She had been shown faked papers by Garrett, papers proving\nthat the two were ... were whatever Garrett had twisted the story into!\nStar clutched at his head. He was in a mess. He was going to be killed,\nand he was going to die without knowing the score. And he didn't like\nthat. Nor did he like dying as Star Blade shouldn't die; executed as\na \"wolf's-head\" pirate. The girl would be watching, and he felt as if\nthat would make it far worse.\nHis head came up, and he smiled flintily. He still had an ace card! One\nhand felt for it, and he shook his head slowly. It was a gamble ... but\nall the others had been found.\nBlade looked up quickly, as the door opened. Two men came into the\ncell, carrying jet-guns. They motioned Blade to his feet. \"Come on,\nBlade.\" One began, when the other hit him across the mouth.\n\"You fool!\" he hissed. \"You better not call him that; suppose that\ngirl was to hear it? Until the boss gets what he wants on Earth, that\ngirl has got to think that he's Blade! We're killing this guy as Devil\nGarrett! And a loud-mouthed fool like you ... look out!\"\nBlade had landed on the bickering men, and was grappling with the one\nwho had called him by name. As the other leaped forward, swinging a\nclubbing blow with a jet-gun, Star tripped one man into the corner, and\nducked under the gun. He hit the man in the stomach, drove a shoulder\nup under his arms, and smashed the man's face in with a series of sharp\nblows. The man went reeling backward across the room, and Star's hand\nleaped toward that \"ace card\" which he still held.\nDevil Garrett stepped in the door, and made a mock out of a courteous\nbow. As he did so, Star snarled in rage, but stood very still, for the\nelectron knife in Garrett's hand did not waver.\nGarrett gestured silently toward the door, and Star, equally silent,\nwalked over and out, at the point of the weapon.\nStar Blade stood before a transmitter, and thought about death.\nHe was very close to it. Garrett stood five yards away, a gun in\nhis hand, and the muzzle trained on Blade's chest. The gun was the\nuniversally used weapon of execution, an old projectile-firing weapon.\nStar did not doubt that Devil Garrett was an excellent shot with it.\nThe girl, very round-eyed and nervous, sat by Garrett. He had explained\nto her that Garrett was the type of pirate that it is law to kill, or\nhave executed, by anyone. Which was very true.\nA man stepped away from the transmitter, and nodded to Garrett. Star\nfelt a surge of hope, as he saw that it was a two-way transmitter. If\nthe image of an Interstellar Command headquarters was tuned in\u2014Garrett\nwould undoubtedly do it, if only to show the police that he had killed\nStarrett Blade\u2014then Garrett could not kill him and cut the beam in\ntime to prevent one of the police from giving a cry that would echo\nover the sub-space beam arriving almost instantly in this room, and let\nthe girl know that she had been tricked. And Garrett would not want\nthat. Not that it would matter to Starrett Blade.\nThen Star saw what kind of a transmitter it was, and he groaned. It\nwas not a Hineson Sub-space beamer ... it was an old-style transmitter\nwhich had different wave speeds, because of the different space-bridger\nunits in it.\nThe visual image would arrive many seconds before the sound did. Thus\nthe girl would not hear Garrett revealed, but would see only Blade's\ndeath. And then ... whatever Garrett had planned, Blade wished heartily\nthat he could have the chance to interfere.\nThe beam was coming in. Star saw the mists swimming on the screen\nchange, solidify into a figure ... the figure of District Commander\nWeddel seated at a desk. He saw Weddel's eyebrows rise, saw his lips\nmove\u2014then Garrett stepped over a pace, and Weddel saw him, saw the gun\nin his hand....\nThe police officer yelled, silently, and came to his feet, an\nexpression of shocked surprise on his face\u2014surprise, Blade thought\ndesperately, that the girl might interpret as shock at seeing Devil\nGarrett.\nWhich was right, in a way.\nThen, as Commander Weddel leapt to his feet, as Devil Garrett's\nfinger tightened on the trigger, as the girl sucked in her breath\ninvoluntarily, Star Blade scooped up a bit of metal\u2014a fork\u2014and flung\nit at the vision transmitter.\nNot at the screen. But at the equipment behind the dial-board. At a\ncertain small unit, which was almost covered by wires and braces for\nthe large tubes. And the fork struck it, bit deep, and caused result.\nResult in the form of a burned-out set. If television equipment can\ncurse, that set cursed them. Its spitting of sparks and blue electric\nflame mingled with a strange, high-pitched whine.\nIt was the diversion that caused Garrett to miss Star, which gave him\ntime to pull three or four of Garrett's men onto the floor with him.\nOne of the men drove the butt of a jet-gun into the side of Star's\nhead, and for the third time, he went very limp. The last thing he saw\nwas the girl.\nSomehow, the expression on her face was different from what it had\nbeen. He was searching for the difference, when the blow struck\nhim. Somewhere in the space that lies between consciousness and\nunconsciousness, he reflected bitterly that if he kept staring at the\ngirl when he should be fighting, he might not recover some day. This\nwas the third time that he had been knocked out that way. It was not\ngetting monotonous. He still felt it a novelty.\nStar awoke in the same prison cell, facing the wall away from the door.\nHe wondered if he were still alive, tried to move his head, and decided\nthat he wasn't. He didn't even get up or look around when he dimly\nheard the door being opened.\nBut when he heard the girl's voice, he came up and around very swiftly,\ndespite his head.\nIt was the girl all right. Even through the tumbled mists of his brain,\nhe could see that she was not a dream. And as he reeled and fell\nagainst the wall, she was beside him in a flash, her arm supporting him.\nAt first he tried to push himself erect, his head whirling with sick\ndizziness, and bewilderment. Through a twisting haze, he peered up at\nthe girl's face. It reflected a look that, amazingly, was one of\u2014with\nno other phrase to do\u2014compassion. Star half-sighed, and laid his head\non the girl's breast, and closed his eyes.\nIn a minute or two, she said tensely, \"Are you all right?\" Star looked\nup at her.\n\"I guess so. Here\u2014give a hand while I get my balance.\" She held him as\nhe tried a step or two, and then he straightened. \"I guess I'll be all\nright, now,\" he smiled. \"My head feels like\u2014say! How come you're doing\nthis? What made you change your mind? And who are you?\"\nShe said quickly, breathlessly, \"I know you're Star Blade, now. That\ntransmission set.... I can read lips! I\nknew\nwhat that officer was\nsaying! It was just as if I had\nheard\nhim say that ... that you were\nStarrett Blade and that man out there is Devil Garrett!\" she made a\nchoking sound. \"And I've been here, alone, for a month! For a month!\"\n\"A month? Huh\u2014please\u2014you...?\"\nStar took a breath, and started over. \"You.... Who\nare\nyou? What are\nyou doing here?\"\nShe said, \"I'm Anne Hinton. My father is Old John Hinton. Have you\nheard of him?\"\n\"Of course!\" said Star. \"He manufactures most of the equipment '\nBlade\nCosmian\n' uses. Weapons, Hineson Sub-Spacers, Star-Traveler craft ...\nthe ship I was in when Garrett brought me down was a Hinton craft. I\nshould have recognized the name. But go on. What\u2014\"\n\"Garrett communicated with dad, secretly. He posed as Starrett\nBlade, as you, and told dad that he was developing certain new power\nprocesses. And he is! He has a new\u2014or maybe it isn't so new\u2014way of\nelectrolyzing water to liberate hydrogen and oxygen.\"\n\"I think I understand,\" said Star quickly. \"When the oxygen and\nhydrogen are allowed to combine, and produce an explosion which drive\na turbine-generator. Then that could be hitched up to a cyclotron, and\neven the most barren of Alpha's lake-rock planets could be....\"\n\"No,\" she shook her head puzzledly. \"It's just electric power. He said\nthat atomics would release stray rays that would attract pirates.\"\n\"I know,\" Star nodded, abstractedly. \"I was thinking of another\napplication of it ... hmm. But say! What was Garrett after? I know that\nhe wouldn't do this just to get a secret process sold. He must have had\nanother plan behind it. Got any idea?\"\nAnne shook her head slowly. \"I don't know. I can't see....\"\n\"Perhaps I could help you?\" Devil Garrett asked smoothly from the door.\nStar whirled, thrust Anne behind him, but there was no way out. Garrett\nstood in the door, and there were men behind him. The jet in his hand\ncould kill both of the two at one shot. And they had no weapons to\nresist with.\nDevil Garrett stepped them out of the room, and down the corridor,\nthrough a large door Star had noticed at the end of the passage, and\ninto a huge room.\nIt must have been a thousand feet long, and half that wide. It was at\nleast a hundred yards deep. And it was almost filled with gigantic\nmachines.\nBetween the machinery, the spaces were almost filled with steel ladders\nand cat-walks. Crews of men swarmed over them. It was the largest mass\nof equipment Starrett had ever seen.\nHis eyes began to pick out details. Those huge vat-like things down\nat the far end, with the large cables running into them, and the\nmighty pumps connected to them ... they were probably the electrolysis\nchambers.\nAnd those great pipes, they must carry the hydrogen and oxygen from\nthe electro chambers to the large replicas of engines, which could be\nnothing else but the explosion chambers, where the gases were allowed\nto re-unite, and explode. And there by the giant engines, those must be\nturbines, which in turn connected with the vast-sized generators just\nunder the platforms on which they stood.\nStar Blade whistled softly through his teeth. A huge enterprise! It\ncould be ... but for a moment he had forgotten Devil Garrett.\nThe girl standing by his side, Star turned toward Garrett. \"Well?\"\nGarrett smiled his mocking grin. \"You grasp the principle, of course.\nBut let me show you ... you see those pipes that run from the turbines\nafter the wheels?\"\n\"Yes. They carry the gases off. Where do they lead?\"\n\"Into giant subterranean caverns beneath the surface!\" Garrett said.\n\"Now look over there, on the platforms across from us. Can you\nrecognize a Barden energy-beamer, Blade? Run by power from my little\nplant here, which is run by water from a thousand lakes!\n\"Just imagine, if you can, hundreds of those plants all over Alpha\nIII. And each one with dozens of high-powered Barden beams to protect\nit! And Hinton ray screens to protect us from radio-controlled rocket\nshells from space, or Barden Rays, or any other weapon of offence, or\nto warn if anyone lands on this planet!\" Garrett leaned forward, his\neyes aglow.\n\"Blade, I'll take over the few governing posts on this little planet,\nand I'll rule an entire world, a whole planet to myself! It'll be the\nfirst time in history! And it won't be the last. With the Hinton secret\npatents, the plans of all John Hinton's inventions and processes....\"\nStar twisted, and got his \"ace card\" out of its hiding place.\nIt was a jet weapon, little more than a jet-blast capsule for a\njet-gun. The sides were thicker and stronger, and there was a device\nfixed on it so it could be fired. Altogether, it was somewhat smaller\nthan an old-style fountain pen.\nHe twisted up from the floor, and moved faster than he had moved ever\nbefore. Star was famous for his speed and the quickness and alertness\nof his reflexes. He earned his fame a score of times over in that one\ninstant.\nAnd Devil Garrett died.\nThere was perhaps an eighth of a second between the staff of blue white\nfire from the tiny jet in Star's hand and the huge broadsword of fire\nfrom Garrett's gun. But in the split-second Star's fire knifed into\nGarrett's vitals, and Garrett gave a convulsive jerk, and fired even as\nhis muscles started the jerking movement.\nAnd the flame went over Star's head, singeing his scalp.\nOf the four men with Garrett, one let go of the struggling Anne, and\nswore as he snatched at an electron knife in his belt. Anne's hand\nhad already whipped the knife out, and without bothering to press the\nelectron stud, she buried the knife in his back.\nTwo of the remaining men whirled, and went for the door as though a\ndevil was after them. The other tried to get a jet-gun out. It was his\nfinal mistake. A blue lance from Anne's knife whipped close enough to\nhim to make him dodge, and then Star got his hand on Garrett's jet.\nThe other two men had, in their flight, taken a door which led, not\ninto the large corridor, but into a small room at one side, a room\nfilled with instruments and recording devices for the machinery in the\nroom below. Star leaped to the side of the door, and called, \"Are you\ngoing to come out, or am I coming in to get you?\"\nThere was a short silence, in which Anne heard one say hoarsely, \"He\ncan't get us ... we could get him if he came in the door.\"\n\"Oh, yes?\" was the answer. \"Do you know who that guy is? He's the one\nthey call 'Death Star.' I'm not facing Starrett Blade in a gun fight.\nYou can do what you like, but I'm leaving.\" Then he lifted his voice.\n\"Hey, Blade! I'm coming out. Don't shoot.\"\n\"Okay,\" threw back Star and the man appeared in the doorway, empty\nhands held high. After a second, the other joined him.\nAnne turned to Star. \"Now I know why they call you 'Death Star' Blade,\"\nshe said, and gestured toward the men who had surrendered, and the two\nwhom Starrett had shot down.\nHe mused there for a minute. Then Anne broke the silence with, \"Star,\nwhat are we going to do now? Garrett's men will be up here in a little\nwhile. We can't get to a sub-space beam. What are we going to do when\nthey come up to investigate?\"\nStarrett Blade laughed. \"Do? Well, we could turn them over to Commander\nWeddel!\"\n\"\nWhat?\n\"\nGrinning broadly, Star pointed, with a flourish, at the door. Anne\nspun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from the\ncorridor.\n\"Very simple,\" said Star across the lounge to Anne. \"When I smashed\nthe vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which is\nincluded in all sets. You know, a direction finder doesn't work, except\nin the liner-beam principle, in space, because of the diffusing effect\nof unrestricted cosmic rays.\"\n\"Yes, I knew that,\" said Anne. \"But how\u2014\"\nStarrett grinned again. \"A type of beam has been found which it is\nimpossible for cosmics to disturb. But you can't send messages on\nit, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit is\nbroken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is a\ndistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal\nis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity\ncruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He\nstopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See\nthese papers?\"\n\"Uh-huh. What are they, Star?\"\n\"They are the main plans of Devil Garrett's power plant, and they're\nthe one good thing he's ever done. These plans are going to bring the\nbarren, rocky Centauri planets to life!\"\nHe got up, and paced to the window, and stood there, looking out, and\nup through the plastic port. \"The planets of Centauri!\" he murmured\nsoftly. \"Seven circling Alpha alone. And all seven are barren, rocky,\nlevel except for the thousands of lakes ... lakes that are going to be\nthe life of Centauri!\"\nHe turned back to the window. \"And all because a pirate named Devil\nGarrett built a vast power plant to use to garner more power!\"\n\"You know, Anne, as a mockery, and a warning, I think I'll propose that\nthis planet be officially named ... 'Garrett'!\"\nShe looked up at him, and there was laughter bright in her eyes, and\ntugging at her mouth. \"Yes, there ought to be a reason,\" she murmured.\nStar wavered. She was so darn close.\nAfter a minute, she turned her head, and looked up at him. \"Star, how\nsoon will there be those gardens and woods you described? I mean,\nhow long before Garrett can be turned into that kind of world you\ndescribed?\"\n\"Why ... under pressure, we can do it in six months. Why?\"\n\"Not half quick enough,\" she murmured happily, \"but it'll have to do,\nStar.\" Laughing, she turned her face up to his. \"Have you ever thought\nthat planet Garrett will be wonderful for a honeymoon?\"\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nDEATH STAR\nBy TOM PACE\nTrapped by the most feared of space pirates\nDevil Garrett, Starrett Blade was fighting for\nhis life. Weaponless, his ship gone, he was\npinning his hopes on a girl\u2014who wanted him dead.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Spring 1945.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nStarrett Blade crouched in the rocks by the tiny Centaurian lake. It\nwas only about two or three hundred feet across, but probably thousands\nof feet deep. This lake, and hundreds of others like it, were the\nonly things to break the monotony of the flat, rocky surface of Alpha\nCentauri III\u2014called the most barren planet in space.\nTen minutes ago, Star Blade's ship had spun into the stagnant waters\nbefore him. An emergency release had flung the air-lock doors open, and\nthe air pressure had flung Star out. And now he was waiting for Devil\nGarrett to come down to the water's edge to search for him.\nFor eight years, Devil Garrett had been the top space pirate in the\nvoid. For a year, Star himself had personally been hunting him. And on\na tour over Alpha III, a Barden energy-beam had stabbed up at Blade's\nship, and Star Blade had crashed into the lake.\nThat Barden Beam had Star worried and puzzled. It took a million volts\nof power for a split-second flash of the beam. Garrett didn't have an\natomics plant on Alpha III\u2014if he had, escaping rays would point it\nout, no matter how well it was camouflaged. There was no water power,\nfor there was no running water. There were only the lakes ... and tidal\npower was out, for Alpha III had no moon.\nHowever, that could wait. Star slid the electron knife from his\nwater-proof sheath, gripped it firmly. He could hear quick footsteps as\na man came down the trail that led directly past his hiding place.\nIt wasn't Garrett, which was disappointing. But it was one of his men,\nand he was heavily armed. That didn't worry Star.\nHis fighting had earned Starrett Blade the nickname of \"Death Star.\"\nThe man walked to the water's edge, and peered out over the pool. He\nsaw the bubbles that were coming up from the sinking ship, and he\nnodded, grunted in satisfaction, and started to turn back.\nStar landed on him, knocking him sprawling on the rock. The pirate\njerked up an arm, holding the jet-gun.\nThe stabbing lance of blue fire cracked from the electron knife, dug\ninto the man's heart.\nStar tossed the dead pirate's cloak over his shoulders, and thrust both\nelectron blade and jet-gun into his belt. He straightened, and saw the\nleveled gun from the corner of his eye.\nHe got the jet in his right hand, the knife in his left, and went into\na dive that flipped him behind a rock. The three actions took only a\nsplit-second, and the blast from the jet-gun flaked rock where he had\nbeen standing.\nWhile a jet-gun is the most deadly weapon known, you have to press a\nloading stud to slide another blast-capsule into place. Death Star knew\nthis very well. So he knew he was safe in coming up from behind the\nspur of stone to fire his own gun.\nIf his reflexes hadn't been as quick as they were, he would have\nblasted the girl.\nHe stopped, and stood for a second, staring at the girl. She was\nsomething to invite stares, too. In the moment that lasted between her\nnext move, he had time to register that she was about five feet five\ntall, black-haired\u2014the kind of black hair that looks like silken spun\ndarkness\u2014dark-eyed, and possessing both a face and a form that would\nmake anyone stop and gulp.\nThen the moment of half-awed survey was over, and she leveled the jet\non him, and said in a trembling voice, \"Drop those weapons, or I'll\nblast you ...\npirate\n!\"\nDeath Star said, \"That jet-gun is empty. I can see the register on the\nmagazine. And I'm not a pirate. I'm Starrett Blade.\"\nThe useless jet-gun slid out of the girl's hand, and she gave a\nhalf-gasp. \"Starrett Blade! I\u2014I don't believe ...\" she broke off\nabruptly. \"So you're Death Star! A fine story for a hired killer, a\npirate.\"\nStar reddened. \"Look,\" he snapped, \"I don't know who's been talking to\nyou, but ...\" he whirled, and his hand whipped the jet-gun from his\nbelt. As he did so, the girl jerked up the jet-gun she had dropped, and\nflung it with all her strength. The blow landed on his arm and side,\nand paralyzed him long enough for the man who had leaped out behind him\nto land a stunning blow against his head. As Star went down, he dizzily\ncursed himself for becoming interested in the argument with the girl,\nso that he did not heed his reflexes in time ... and dimly, he wondered\nwhy it had seemed so important to convince the lovely dark-haired girl.\nThen a bit of the cosmos seemed to fall on Star's head, and he was\nhurled into blackness.\nAn eternity seemed to pass.\nDeep in the blackness, a light was born. It leaped toward him, a\nfar-away comet rocketing along, coming from some far, unknown corner\nof the galaxy. It became a flaming sun in a gray-green space, and\nstrangely, there seemed to be several odd planets circling about the\nsun. Some of them were vast pieces of queer electronic machinery. Some\nwere vague, villainous-looking men. One was the dark-haired girl, and\nthere was lovely contempt in her dark-star pools of eyes.\nThen into the midst of this queer universe, there swam a new planet. It\nwas the face of a man, and the man was Devil Garrett.\nThat brought Star up, out of his daze, onto his feet as though he had\nbeen doused with cold water. He stood there, not staring, just looking\nat Garrett.\nThe most famous killer in the void was big. He was six feet three, and\ntwice as strong as he looked. He wore a huge high-velocity jet-gun, and\na set of electron knives, all of the finest workmanship. He was sitting\non a laboratory chair of steel, and the chair bent slightly under his\ngreat weight.\nHe smiled at Star, and there was a touch of hell in the smile. He said,\n\"Ah, Mr. Garrett.\"\nStar's jaw dropped. \"Garrett? What do you\u2014\" he broke off. A glance at\nthe girl told him what the purpose was.\n\"Look, Mr. Devil Garrett,\" said the pirate, still smiling softly, \"Miss\nHinton is aware of your identity. There is no need to attempt to fool\nus.... I've known it was you ever since I flashed that beam at your\nship. And you needn't flatter yourself that the Devil's luck is going\nto hold out as far as you are concerned. For in a very short while,\nI'm going to have you executed ... before a stellar vision screen,\nconnected with Section Void Headquarters! I wish the authorities to see\nDevil Garrett die, so that I might collect the reward that is offered\non you!\"\nStar stood quiet, and looked straight into Garrett's eyes. After a\nminute of silence, Garrett's lips twisted into a smile, and he said\nmockingly, \"Well, pirate? What are you thinking of?\"\nStar said, in a low, cold voice, \"I'm thinking of putting an electron\nfire-blade into your face, Devil Garrett!\"\nGarrett laughed ... huge, rather evil, bluff laughter. The mirth of a\nperson who is both powerful and dangerous. And then the girl leaped\nforward, shaking with rage.\n\"You beast! Murderer! To accuse this man ... you fool, you might have\nbeen able to complete any scheme of escape you had, if you hadn't\ncalled yourself Starrett Blade! Mr. Blade....\" She gestured toward\nGarrett, who made a mocking, sardonic bow. \"... has given me ample\nproof that he is who he says! And this long before you came. He's shown\nme papers giving a description and showing a tri-dimension picture of\nyou....\"\nFire leaped in Star's eyes. \"Listen ...\" he snapped furiously, as he\nstarted to step forward. Then Garrett made a signal with his hand, and\nsomeone drove a fist against the base of Star's skull.\nWhen Star came to, he was in a cell of sorts. A man standing by the\ndoor told him that he was to be executed, \"... after Mr. Blade and the\nlady have eaten.\" Starrett swore at him, and the man went out, with a\nmocking \"Goodbye, Mr. Garrett!\"\nStar got up. His head spun, and he almost fell at first, but the daze\nleft in his head from the two blows quickly cleared away. He felt for\nvarious weapons which he had hidden about him ... and found them gone.\nGarrett's men had searched carefully.\nStar sat down, his head spinning more now from mystery than from\nphysical pain. He had to keep himself in a whole skin, of course. That\nwas most important right now. But other things were bothering him,\ntugging at his mind like waves slapping around a swamped ship, each\ntrying to shove it in a different direction.\nThere was the girl. Star wondered why she always leaped into his mind\nfirst. And there was the way Garrett was trying to leave the impression\nthat he was Blade, so that he could kill Blade as Garrett.\nObviously, the reason for that was the girl, Miss Hinton, Garrett had\ncalled her. She had been shown faked papers by Garrett, papers proving\nthat the two were ... were whatever Garrett had twisted the story into!\nStar clutched at his head. He was in a mess. He was going to be killed,\nand he was going to die without knowing the score. And he didn't like\nthat. Nor did he like dying as Star Blade shouldn't die; executed as\na \"wolf's-head\" pirate. The girl would be watching, and he felt as if\nthat would make it far worse.\nHis head came up, and he smiled flintily. He still had an ace card! One\nhand felt for it, and he shook his head slowly. It was a gamble ... but\nall the others had been found.\nBlade looked up quickly, as the door opened. Two men came into the\ncell, carrying jet-guns. They motioned Blade to his feet. \"Come on,\nBlade.\" One began, when the other hit him across the mouth.\n\"You fool!\" he hissed. \"You better not call him that; suppose that\ngirl was to hear it? Until the boss gets what he wants on Earth, that\ngirl has got to think that he's Blade! We're killing this guy as Devil\nGarrett! And a loud-mouthed fool like you ... look out!\"\nBlade had landed on the bickering men, and was grappling with the one\nwho had called him by name. As the other leaped forward, swinging a\nclubbing blow with a jet-gun, Star tripped one man into the corner, and\nducked under the gun. He hit the man in the stomach, drove a shoulder\nup under his arms, and smashed the man's face in with a series of sharp\nblows. The man went reeling backward across the room, and Star's hand\nleaped toward that \"ace card\" which he still held.\nDevil Garrett stepped in the door, and made a mock out of a courteous\nbow. As he did so, Star snarled in rage, but stood very still, for the\nelectron knife in Garrett's hand did not waver.\nGarrett gestured silently toward the door, and Star, equally silent,\nwalked over and out, at the point of the weapon.\nStar Blade stood before a transmitter, and thought about death.\nHe was very close to it. Garrett stood five yards away, a gun in\nhis hand, and the muzzle trained on Blade's chest. The gun was the\nuniversally used weapon of execution, an old projectile-firing weapon.\nStar did not doubt that Devil Garrett was an excellent shot with it.\nThe girl, very round-eyed and nervous, sat by Garrett. He had explained\nto her that Garrett was the type of pirate that it is law to kill, or\nhave executed, by anyone. Which was very true.\nA man stepped away from the transmitter, and nodded to Garrett. Star\nfelt a surge of hope, as he saw that it was a two-way transmitter. If\nthe image of an Interstellar Command headquarters was tuned in\u2014Garrett\nwould undoubtedly do it, if only to show the police that he had killed\nStarrett Blade\u2014then Garrett could not kill him and cut the beam in\ntime to prevent one of the police from giving a cry that would echo\nover the sub-space beam arriving almost instantly in this room, and let\nthe girl know that she had been tricked. And Garrett would not want\nthat. Not that it would matter to Starrett Blade.\nThen Star saw what kind of a transmitter it was, and he groaned. It\nwas not a Hineson Sub-space beamer ... it was an old-style transmitter\nwhich had different wave speeds, because of the different space-bridger\nunits in it.\nThe visual image would arrive many seconds before the sound did. Thus\nthe girl would not hear Garrett revealed, but would see only Blade's\ndeath. And then ... whatever Garrett had planned, Blade wished heartily\nthat he could have the chance to interfere.\nThe beam was coming in. Star saw the mists swimming on the screen\nchange, solidify into a figure ... the figure of District Commander\nWeddel seated at a desk. He saw Weddel's eyebrows rise, saw his lips\nmove\u2014then Garrett stepped over a pace, and Weddel saw him, saw the gun\nin his hand....\nThe police officer yelled, silently, and came to his feet, an\nexpression of shocked surprise on his face\u2014surprise, Blade thought\ndesperately, that the girl might interpret as shock at seeing Devil\nGarrett.\nWhich was right, in a way.\nThen, as Commander Weddel leapt to his feet, as Devil Garrett's\nfinger tightened on the trigger, as the girl sucked in her breath\ninvoluntarily, Star Blade scooped up a bit of metal\u2014a fork\u2014and flung\nit at the vision transmitter.\nNot at the screen. But at the equipment behind the dial-board. At a\ncertain small unit, which was almost covered by wires and braces for\nthe large tubes. And the fork struck it, bit deep, and caused result.\nResult in the form of a burned-out set. If television equipment can\ncurse, that set cursed them. Its spitting of sparks and blue electric\nflame mingled with a strange, high-pitched whine.\nIt was the diversion that caused Garrett to miss Star, which gave him\ntime to pull three or four of Garrett's men onto the floor with him.\nOne of the men drove the butt of a jet-gun into the side of Star's\nhead, and for the third time, he went very limp. The last thing he saw\nwas the girl.\nSomehow, the expression on her face was different from what it had\nbeen. He was searching for the difference, when the blow struck\nhim. Somewhere in the space that lies between consciousness and\nunconsciousness, he reflected bitterly that if he kept staring at the\ngirl when he should be fighting, he might not recover some day. This\nwas the third time that he had been knocked out that way. It was not\ngetting monotonous. He still felt it a novelty.\nStar awoke in the same prison cell, facing the wall away from the door.\nHe wondered if he were still alive, tried to move his head, and decided\nthat he wasn't. He didn't even get up or look around when he dimly\nheard the door being opened.\nBut when he heard the girl's voice, he came up and around very swiftly,\ndespite his head.\nIt was the girl all right. Even through the tumbled mists of his brain,\nhe could see that she was not a dream. And as he reeled and fell\nagainst the wall, she was beside him in a flash, her arm supporting him.\nAt first he tried to push himself erect, his head whirling with sick\ndizziness, and bewilderment. Through a twisting haze, he peered up at\nthe girl's face. It reflected a look that, amazingly, was one of\u2014with\nno other phrase to do\u2014compassion. Star half-sighed, and laid his head\non the girl's breast, and closed his eyes.\nIn a minute or two, she said tensely, \"Are you all right?\" Star looked\nup at her.\n\"I guess so. Here\u2014give a hand while I get my balance.\" She held him as\nhe tried a step or two, and then he straightened. \"I guess I'll be all\nright, now,\" he smiled. \"My head feels like\u2014say! How come you're doing\nthis? What made you change your mind? And who are you?\"\nShe said quickly, breathlessly, \"I know you're Star Blade, now. That\ntransmission set.... I can read lips! I\nknew\nwhat that officer was\nsaying! It was just as if I had\nheard\nhim say that ... that you were\nStarrett Blade and that man out there is Devil Garrett!\" she made a\nchoking sound. \"And I've been here, alone, for a month! For a month!\"\n\"A month? Huh\u2014please\u2014you...?\"\nStar took a breath, and started over. \"You.... Who\nare\nyou? What are\nyou doing here?\"\nShe said, \"I'm Anne Hinton. My father is Old John Hinton. Have you\nheard of him?\"\n\"Of course!\" said Star. \"He manufactures most of the equipment '\nBlade\nCosmian\n' uses. Weapons, Hineson Sub-Spacers, Star-Traveler craft ...\nthe ship I was in when Garrett brought me down was a Hinton craft. I\nshould have recognized the name. But go on. What\u2014\"\n\"Garrett communicated with dad, secretly. He posed as Starrett\nBlade, as you, and told dad that he was developing certain new power\nprocesses. And he is! He has a new\u2014or maybe it isn't so new\u2014way of\nelectrolyzing water to liberate hydrogen and oxygen.\"\n\"I think I understand,\" said Star quickly. \"When the oxygen and\nhydrogen are allowed to combine, and produce an explosion which drive\na turbine-generator. Then that could be hitched up to a cyclotron, and\neven the most barren of Alpha's lake-rock planets could be....\"\n\"No,\" she shook her head puzzledly. \"It's just electric power. He said\nthat atomics would release stray rays that would attract pirates.\"\n\"I know,\" Star nodded, abstractedly. \"I was thinking of another\napplication of it ... hmm. But say! What was Garrett after? I know that\nhe wouldn't do this just to get a secret process sold. He must have had\nanother plan behind it. Got any idea?\"\nAnne shook her head slowly. \"I don't know. I can't see....\"\n\"Perhaps I could help you?\" Devil Garrett asked smoothly from the door.\nStar whirled, thrust Anne behind him, but there was no way out. Garrett\nstood in the door, and there were men behind him. The jet in his hand\ncould kill both of the two at one shot. And they had no weapons to\nresist with.\nDevil Garrett stepped them out of the room, and down the corridor,\nthrough a large door Star had noticed at the end of the passage, and\ninto a huge room.\nIt must have been a thousand feet long, and half that wide. It was at\nleast a hundred yards deep. And it was almost filled with gigantic\nmachines.\nBetween the machinery, the spaces were almost filled with steel ladders\nand cat-walks. Crews of men swarmed over them. It was the largest mass\nof equipment Starrett had ever seen.\nHis eyes began to pick out details. Those huge vat-like things down\nat the far end, with the large cables running into them, and the\nmighty pumps connected to them ... they were probably the electrolysis\nchambers.\nAnd those great pipes, they must carry the hydrogen and oxygen from\nthe electro chambers to the large replicas of engines, which could be\nnothing else but the explosion chambers, where the gases were allowed\nto re-unite, and explode. And there by the giant engines, those must be\nturbines, which in turn connected with the vast-sized generators just\nunder the platforms on which they stood.\nStar Blade whistled softly through his teeth. A huge enterprise! It\ncould be ... but for a moment he had forgotten Devil Garrett.\nThe girl standing by his side, Star turned toward Garrett. \"Well?\"\nGarrett smiled his mocking grin. \"You grasp the principle, of course.\nBut let me show you ... you see those pipes that run from the turbines\nafter the wheels?\"\n\"Yes. They carry the gases off. Where do they lead?\"\n\"Into giant subterranean caverns beneath the surface!\" Garrett said.\n\"Now look over there, on the platforms across from us. Can you\nrecognize a Barden energy-beamer, Blade? Run by power from my little\nplant here, which is run by water from a thousand lakes!\n\"Just imagine, if you can, hundreds of those plants all over Alpha\nIII. And each one with dozens of high-powered Barden beams to protect\nit! And Hinton ray screens to protect us from radio-controlled rocket\nshells from space, or Barden Rays, or any other weapon of offence, or\nto warn if anyone lands on this planet!\" Garrett leaned forward, his\neyes aglow.\n\"Blade, I'll take over the few governing posts on this little planet,\nand I'll rule an entire world, a whole planet to myself! It'll be the\nfirst time in history! And it won't be the last. With the Hinton secret\npatents, the plans of all John Hinton's inventions and processes....\"\nStar twisted, and got his \"ace card\" out of its hiding place.\nIt was a jet weapon, little more than a jet-blast capsule for a\njet-gun. The sides were thicker and stronger, and there was a device\nfixed on it so it could be fired. Altogether, it was somewhat smaller\nthan an old-style fountain pen.\nHe twisted up from the floor, and moved faster than he had moved ever\nbefore. Star was famous for his speed and the quickness and alertness\nof his reflexes. He earned his fame a score of times over in that one\ninstant.\nAnd Devil Garrett died.\nThere was perhaps an eighth of a second between the staff of blue white\nfire from the tiny jet in Star's hand and the huge broadsword of fire\nfrom Garrett's gun. But in the split-second Star's fire knifed into\nGarrett's vitals, and Garrett gave a convulsive jerk, and fired even as\nhis muscles started the jerking movement.\nAnd the flame went over Star's head, singeing his scalp.\nOf the four men with Garrett, one let go of the struggling Anne, and\nswore as he snatched at an electron knife in his belt. Anne's hand\nhad already whipped the knife out, and without bothering to press the\nelectron stud, she buried the knife in his back.\nTwo of the remaining men whirled, and went for the door as though a\ndevil was after them. The other tried to get a jet-gun out. It was his\nfinal mistake. A blue lance from Anne's knife whipped close enough to\nhim to make him dodge, and then Star got his hand on Garrett's jet.\nThe other two men had, in their flight, taken a door which led, not\ninto the large corridor, but into a small room at one side, a room\nfilled with instruments and recording devices for the machinery in the\nroom below. Star leaped to the side of the door, and called, \"Are you\ngoing to come out, or am I coming in to get you?\"\nThere was a short silence, in which Anne heard one say hoarsely, \"He\ncan't get us ... we could get him if he came in the door.\"\n\"Oh, yes?\" was the answer. \"Do you know who that guy is? He's the one\nthey call 'Death Star.' I'm not facing Starrett Blade in a gun fight.\nYou can do what you like, but I'm leaving.\" Then he lifted his voice.\n\"Hey, Blade! I'm coming out. Don't shoot.\"\n\"Okay,\" threw back Star and the man appeared in the doorway, empty\nhands held high. After a second, the other joined him.\nAnne turned to Star. \"Now I know why they call you 'Death Star' Blade,\"\nshe said, and gestured toward the men who had surrendered, and the two\nwhom Starrett had shot down.\nHe mused there for a minute. Then Anne broke the silence with, \"Star,\nwhat are we going to do now? Garrett's men will be up here in a little\nwhile. We can't get to a sub-space beam. What are we going to do when\nthey come up to investigate?\"\nStarrett Blade laughed. \"Do? Well, we could turn them over to Commander\nWeddel!\"\n\"\nWhat?\n\"\nGrinning broadly, Star pointed, with a flourish, at the door. Anne\nspun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from the\ncorridor.\n\"Very simple,\" said Star across the lounge to Anne. \"When I smashed\nthe vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which is\nincluded in all sets. You know, a direction finder doesn't work, except\nin the liner-beam principle, in space, because of the diffusing effect\nof unrestricted cosmic rays.\"\n\"Yes, I knew that,\" said Anne. \"But how\u2014\"\nStarrett grinned again. \"A type of beam has been found which it is\nimpossible for cosmics to disturb. But you can't send messages on\nit, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit is\nbroken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is a\ndistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal\nis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity\ncruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He\nstopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See\nthese papers?\"\n\"Uh-huh. What are they, Star?\"\n\"They are the main plans of Devil Garrett's power plant, and they're\nthe one good thing he's ever done. These plans are going to bring the\nbarren, rocky Centauri planets to life!\"\nHe got up, and paced to the window, and stood there, looking out, and\nup through the plastic port. \"The planets of Centauri!\" he murmured\nsoftly. \"Seven circling Alpha alone. And all seven are barren, rocky,\nlevel except for the thousands of lakes ... lakes that are going to be\nthe life of Centauri!\"\nHe turned back to the window. \"And all because a pirate named Devil\nGarrett built a vast power plant to use to garner more power!\"\n\"You know, Anne, as a mockery, and a warning, I think I'll propose that\nthis planet be officially named ... 'Garrett'!\"\nShe looked up at him, and there was laughter bright in her eyes, and\ntugging at her mouth. \"Yes, there ought to be a reason,\" she murmured.\nStar wavered. She was so darn close.\nAfter a minute, she turned her head, and looked up at him. \"Star, how\nsoon will there be those gardens and woods you described? I mean,\nhow long before Garrett can be turned into that kind of world you\ndescribed?\"\n\"Why ... under pressure, we can do it in six months. Why?\"\n\"Not half quick enough,\" she murmured happily, \"but it'll have to do,\nStar.\" Laughing, she turned her face up to his. \"Have you ever thought\nthat planet Garrett will be wonderful for a honeymoon?\"\n", "summary": "Starrett Blade is on a trip with his father, John Hinton, to check on his ship, which has crashed on the surface of a planet called Alpha III. His ship has landed on a lake, and he is exploring the water when he is attacked by a Barden energy beam. He is knocked unconscious by the force of the beam and thrown into the water, where he drowns. He wakes up in a hospital room, and the doctor, Doctor Hatwoody, tells him that he has been taken to Section Void Headquarters, where Garrett is being held. The doctor explains that Garrett has been working with the Devil to develop a new way of running the ship, and that the only way to get it to work is to make it look like the ship crashed in the water. He tells Star to find Garrett, and they go to his office, where they meet Garrett's father, who tells them about the new power process that he is working on. The two go to the control room, which is filled with instruments and machinery, and Garrett shows them the plans of his new power processes. He explains that the new process will be able to run on solar power, which can be used to drive a turbine-generator. He also tells them that they can use the same process on Earth, but it will take a lot more energy. They go back to their ship, where the ship is attacked again, this time by the Barden beam. The ship is brought down by the beam, and Star and Garrett are trapped in the whole time. They are able to escape, but they are unable to see each other side of the ship. They run out of air and land on a new planet.    Garrett and his father go to investigate the new planet, and it turns out that it is the same planet as the one that Star had crashed on. They find the ship that was attacked, and when they get to it, they find it to be the same one that the ship had landed on before. The story ends with the two of them in Garrett's office, discussing how they will get out of this mess.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}

Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\nSmall is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\nIn one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\nSight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\nFor a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n\"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\nThe girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n\"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n\"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n\"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\nnarl\nlast night when it attacked you.\"\nDoubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\nNoork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n\"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n\"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\nThe girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n\"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n\"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\nNoork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n\"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\nBut her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\nThe girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n\"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\nNoork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n\"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\nThe girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\nOne armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\nNoork\nAt first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\nNoork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\nA barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\nThese Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\nAnd the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\nA moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\nThe Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n\"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\nNoork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\nThe jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\nUd tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\nA growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n\"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\nUd's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n\"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n\"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n\"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n\"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\nAnd the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\nTo Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\nBut Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\nThe other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\nSo it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich\u2014whose memory was\ngone completely\u2014again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\nThe Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\nTwo words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\nAfter a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\nSword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\nHe was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\nSecure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n\"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\nNoork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n\"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n\"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\nThe old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood woman\u2014and ugly, my son.\"\n\"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n\"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n\"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\nNoork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n\"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n\"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\nRold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n\"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\nRold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n\"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n\"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\nThe slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n\"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n\"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n\"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\nNoork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\nThe skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\nNoork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\nOther misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\nHe moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metal\u2014gold, silver and brass\u2014vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\nThese then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshipped\u2014mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\nNoork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\nAs he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n\"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\nNoork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\nIn that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\nHis sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\nThe struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\nThe sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\nIn a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\nSo it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\nHe looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\nFrom the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\nNoork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\nThe matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\nHe stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\nThere were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\nOne of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n\"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n\"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\nNoork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\nAcross the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n\"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\nThe priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\nNoork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\nThe burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\nThe fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\nThe priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\nBetween the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\nTholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n\"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n\"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\nSlowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n\"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyes\u2014-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n\"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nRaiders of the Second Moon\nBy GENE ELLERMAN\nA strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\nand had brought him to this tiny world\u2014to\nwrite an end to his first existence.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Summer 1945.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nBeyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\nSmall is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\nIn one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\nSight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\nFor a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n\"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\nThe girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n\"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n\"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n\"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\nnarl\nlast night when it attacked you.\"\nDoubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\nNoork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n\"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n\"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\nThe girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n\"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n\"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\nNoork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n\"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\nBut her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\nThe girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n\"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\nNoork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n\"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\nThe girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\nOne armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\nNoork\nAt first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\nNoork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\nA barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\nThese Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\nAnd the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\nA moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\nThe Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n\"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\nNoork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\nThe jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\nUd tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\nA growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n\"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\nUd's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n\"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n\"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n\"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n\"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\nAnd the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\nTo Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\nBut Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\nThe other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\nSo it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich\u2014whose memory was\ngone completely\u2014again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\nThe Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\nTwo words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\nAfter a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\nSword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\nHe was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\nSecure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n\"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\nNoork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n\"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n\"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\nThe old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood woman\u2014and ugly, my son.\"\n\"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n\"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n\"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\nNoork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n\"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n\"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\nRold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n\"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\nRold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n\"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n\"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\nThe slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n\"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n\"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n\"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\nNoork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\nThe skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\nNoork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\nOther misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\nHe moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metal\u2014gold, silver and brass\u2014vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\nThese then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshipped\u2014mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\nNoork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\nAs he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n\"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\nNoork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\nIn that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\nHis sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\nThe struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\nThe sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\nIn a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\nSo it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\nHe looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\nFrom the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\nNoork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\nThe matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\nHe stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\nThere were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\nOne of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n\"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n\"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\nNoork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\nAcross the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n\"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\nThe priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\nNoork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\nThe burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\nThe fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\nThe priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\nBetween the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\nTholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n\"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n\"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\nSlowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n\"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyes\u2014-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n\"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\n", "summary": "The story begins with a man named Noork, who is a hunter and a former slave, named Tholon Sarna, on a small moon of the planet Luna. He is approached by a girl named Tako, who introduces herself as a friend and asks him to kill a man, Gurn, who he thinks is the renegade leader of the bandits. He tells her that he is a renegade from the planet Sarna and that he killed a man called Gurn last night. He then tells her about his mission to destroy the people of the moon and their planet, and she asks him why he is on the moon. He explains that he has been exiled from his home planet, Earth, and is now a fugitive from the authorities. He asks her to kill Gurn and the other men, and he tells her he is writing a novel about his experience. He also tells her the story of the time he was captured by the bandits and brought to the moon, and how he was given a new identity as a hunter. He says he is the only one who knows how to hunt and kills, and that the other people on the planet are afraid of him. He wants to destroy them all, and the only way he can do that is to write his novel. He begins to write the story in the language of the people on this moon, which is the language that he speaks to the girl, and then switches to the language he speaks in the jungle, which he calls the \"Vasad\". He tells the girl that he was exiled from Earth, but that he now speaks the language spoken by the people, and they are afraid to speak to him. The girl asks him questions, and Noork replies that he does not speak to them, but he does speak to the woman, who asks him if he is human. He replies that no, but is a fugitive. He goes to the headquarters of the supervising council, where he meets Tholon, who tells him that he will be the new governor of the new moon. Noork is pleased to hear this news, and asks Tholon to appoint him governor. He meets the woman who is the wife of the leader of a nearby planet, who informs him that the planet is inhabited by humans, and has been for the past ten thousand years. He informs her that the people who live on the new planet are called the \"vans\", and that they are the people that killed the last man on the old planet, Gurs, and are now trying to destroy it. He reveals that he had been exiled to the new world because he killed the man who killed Gurs and the woman he was with, and now he is trying to find a way to destroy all of them. He takes the woman to the top of a cliff and shoots her, and when he does, she screams and runs. He kills her, but she is able to escape. He follows her and kills her. He finds her unconscious in the forest, and after a while, he realizes that she is the woman that killed Gurn. He realizes that he knows her name is Tako. He decides to take her with him to the planet, where she is a girl, but the planet has changed. He shoots her and takes her with his rifle.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}

Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\nSmall is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\nIn one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\nSight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\nFor a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n\"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\nThe girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n\"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n\"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n\"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\nnarl\nlast night when it attacked you.\"\nDoubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\nNoork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n\"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n\"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\nThe girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n\"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n\"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\nNoork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n\"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\nBut her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\nThe girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n\"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\nNoork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n\"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\nThe girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\nOne armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\nNoork\nAt first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\nNoork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\nA barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\nThese Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\nAnd the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\nA moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\nThe Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n\"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\nNoork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\nThe jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\nUd tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\nA growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n\"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\nUd's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n\"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n\"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n\"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n\"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\nAnd the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\nTo Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\nBut Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\nThe other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\nSo it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich\u2014whose memory was\ngone completely\u2014again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\nThe Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\nTwo words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\nAfter a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\nSword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\nHe was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\nSecure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n\"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\nNoork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n\"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n\"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\nThe old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood woman\u2014and ugly, my son.\"\n\"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n\"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n\"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\nNoork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n\"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n\"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\nRold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n\"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\nRold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n\"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n\"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\nThe slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n\"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n\"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n\"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\nNoork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\nThe skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\nNoork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\nOther misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\nHe moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metal\u2014gold, silver and brass\u2014vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\nThese then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshipped\u2014mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\nNoork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\nAs he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n\"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\nNoork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\nIn that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\nHis sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\nThe struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\nThe sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\nIn a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\nSo it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\nHe looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\nFrom the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\nNoork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\nThe matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\nHe stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\nThere were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\nOne of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n\"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n\"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\nNoork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\nAcross the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n\"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\nThe priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\nNoork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\nThe burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\nThe fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\nThe priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\nBetween the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\nTholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n\"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n\"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\nSlowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n\"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyes\u2014-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n\"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nRaiders of the Second Moon\nBy GENE ELLERMAN\nA strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\nand had brought him to this tiny world\u2014to\nwrite an end to his first existence.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Summer 1945.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nBeyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\nSmall is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\nIn one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\nSight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\nFor a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n\"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\nThe girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n\"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n\"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n\"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\nnarl\nlast night when it attacked you.\"\nDoubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\nNoork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n\"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n\"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\nThe girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n\"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n\"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\nNoork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n\"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\nBut her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\nThe girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n\"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\nNoork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n\"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\nThe girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\nOne armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\nNoork\nAt first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\nNoork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\nA barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\nThese Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\nAnd the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\nA moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\nThe Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n\"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\nNoork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\nThe jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\nUd tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\nA growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n\"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\nUd's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n\"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n\"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n\"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n\"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\nAnd the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\nTo Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\nBut Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\nThe other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\nSo it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich\u2014whose memory was\ngone completely\u2014again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\nThe Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\nTwo words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\nAfter a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\nSword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\nHe was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\nSecure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n\"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\nNoork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n\"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n\"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\nThe old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood woman\u2014and ugly, my son.\"\n\"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n\"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n\"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\nNoork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n\"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n\"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\nRold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n\"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\nRold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n\"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n\"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\nThe slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n\"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n\"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n\"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\nNoork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\nThe skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\nNoork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\nOther misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\nHe moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metal\u2014gold, silver and brass\u2014vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\nThese then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshipped\u2014mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\nNoork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\nAs he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n\"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\nNoork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\nIn that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\nHis sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\nThe struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\nThe sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\nIn a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\nSo it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\nHe looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\nFrom the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\nNoork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\nThe matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\nHe stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\nThere were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\nOne of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n\"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n\"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\nNoork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\nAcross the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n\"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\nThe priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\nNoork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\nThe burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\nThe fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\nThe priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\nBetween the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\nTholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n\"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n\"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\nSlowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n\"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyes\u2014-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n\"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\n", "summary": "Noork is an exile from the city of Grath.

THIESSEN\nThe city was strange, fantastic, beautiful.\nHe'd never been there before, yet already he\nwas a fabulous legend\u2014a dire, hateful legend.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Spring 1955.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nHe lay on his stomach, a lean man in faded one piece dungarees, and an\nodd metallic hat, peering over the side of the canal. Behind him the\nlittle winds sifted red dust into his collar, but he could not move; he\ncould only sit there with his gaze riveted on the spires and minarets\nthat twinkled in the distance, far down the bottom of the canal.\nOne part of his mind said,\nThis is it, this is the fabled city of\nMars. This is the beauty and the fantasy and the music of the legends,\nand I must go down there.\nYet somewhere deeper in his mind, deep in\nthe primal urges that kept him from death, the warning was taut and\nurgent.\nGet away. They have a part of your mind now. Get away from the\ncity before you lose it all. Get away before your body becomes a husk,\na soulless husk to walk the low canals with sightless eyes, like those\nwho came before you.\nHe strained to push back from the edge, trying to get that fantastic\nbeauty out of his sight. He fought the lids of his eyes, fought to\nclose them while he pushed himself back, but they remained open,\nstaring at the jeweled towers, and borne on the little winds the thin\nwail of music reached him, saying,\nCome into the city, come down into\nthe fabled city\n.\nHe slid over the edge, sliding down the sloping sides of the canal.\nThe rough sandstone tore at his dungarees, tore at his elbow where it\ntouched but he did not feel the pain. His face was turned toward the\ntowers, and the sound of his breathing was less than human.\nHis feet caught a projecting bit of stone and were slowed for an\ninstant, so that he turned sideways and rolled on, down into the red\ndust bottom of the canal, to lie face down in the dust, with the chin\nstrap of the odd metallic hat cutting cruelly into his chin.\nHe lay there an instant, knowing that now he had a chance. With his\nface down like this, and the dust smarting his eyes the image was gone\nfor an instant. He had to get away, he knew that. He had to mount the\nsides of the canal and never look back.\nHe told himself, \"I am Eric North, from Earth, the Third Planet of Sol,\nand this is not real.\"\nHe squirmed in the dust, feeling it bite his cheeks; he squirmed until\nhe could get up and see nothing but the red sand stone walls of the\ncanal. He ran at the walls and clawed his way up like an animal in his\nhaste. He wouldn't look again.\nThe wind freshened and the tune of the music began to talk to him. It\ntold of going barefoot over long streets of fur. It told of jewels, and\nwine, and women as fair as springtime. These and more were in the city,\nwaiting for him to claim them.\nHe sobbed, and clawed forward. He stopped to rest, and slowly his head\nbegan to turn. He turned, and the spires and minarets twinkled at him,\nbeautiful, soothing, stopping the tears that had welled down his cheeks.\nWhen he reached the bottom of the canal he began to run toward the city.\nWhen he came to the city there was a high wall around it, and a heavy\ngate carved with lotus blossoms. He beat against the gate and cried,\n\"Oh! Let me in. Let me in to the city!\" The music was richer now, as if\nit were everywhere, and the gate swung open without the faintest sound.\nA sentinel stood before the opened gate at the end of a long blue\nstreet. He was dressed in red silk with his sleeves edged in blue\nleopard skin, and he wore a belt with a jeweled short sword. He drew\nthe sword from its scabbard, and bowed forward until the point of the\nsword touched the street of blue fur. He said, \"I give you the welcome\nof my sword, and the welcome of the city. Speak your name so that it\nmay be set in the records of the dreamers.\"\nThe music sang, and the spires twinkled, and Eric said, \"I am Eric\nNorth!\"\nThe sword point jerked, and the sentinel straightened. His face was\nwhite. He cried aloud, \"It is Eric the Bronze. It is Eric of the\nLegend.\" He whirled the sword aloft, and smashed it upon Eric's metal\nhat, and the hatred was a blue flame in his eyes.\nWhen Eric regained consciousness the people of the city were all about\nhim. They were very fair, and the women were more beautiful than music.\nYet now they stared at him with red hate in their eyes. An older man\ncame forward and struck at the copper hat with a stick. The clang\ndeafened Eric and the man cried, \"You are right. It is Eric the Bronze.\nBring the ships and let him be scourged from the city.\"\nThe man drew back the stick and struck again, and Eric's back took\nfire with the blow. The crowd chanted, \"Whips, bring the whips,\" and\nfear forced Eric to his feet. He fled then, running on the heedless\nfeet of panic, outstripping those who were behind him until he passed\nthrough the great gates into the red dust floor of the canal. The gates\nclosed behind him, and the dust beat upon him, and he paused, his heart\nhammering inside his chest like a great bell clapper. He turned and\nlooked behind to be sure he was safe.\nThe towers twinkled at him, and the music whispered to him, \"Come back,\nEric North. Come back to the city.\"\nHe turned and stumbled back to the great gate and hammered on it until\nhis fists were raw, pleading for it to open and let him back.\nAnd deep inside him some part of his mind said, \"This is a madness you\ncannot escape. The city is evil, an evil like you have never known,\"\nand a fear as old as time coursed through his frame.\nHe seized the copper hat from his head, and beat on the lotus carvings\nof the great door, crying, \"Let me in! Please, take me back into the\ncity.\"\nAnd as he beat the city changed. It became dull and sordid and evil, a\ncity of disgust, with every part offensive to the eye. The spires and\nminarets were gargoyles of hatred, twisted and misshapen, and the sound\nof the city was a macabre song of hate.\nHe stared, and his back was chill with superstitions as old as the\nbeginning of man. The city flickered, changing before his eyes until it\nwas beautiful again.\nHe stood, amazed, and put the metal hat back on his head. With the\nmotion the shift took place again, and beauty was ugliness. Amazed, he\nstared at the illusion, and the thought came to him that the metal hat\nhad not entirely failed him after all.\nHe turned and began to walk away from the city, and when it began to\ncall he took the hat off his head and found peace for a time. Then when\nit began again he replaced the hat, and revulsion sped his footsteps.\nAnd so, hat on, hat off, he made his way down the dusty floor of the\ncanal, and up the rocky sides until he stood on the Martian desert, and\nthe canal was a thin line behind him. He breathed easily then, for he\nwas beyond the range of the illusions.\nAnd now that his mind was his own again he began to study the problem,\nand to understand something of the nature of the forces against which\nhe had been pitted.\nThe helmet contained an electrical circuit, designed as a shield\nagainst electrical waves tuned to affect his brain. But the hat had\nfailed because the city, whatever it was, had adjusted to this revised\npattern as he had approached it. Hence, the helmet had been no defense\nagainst illusion. However, when he had jerked the helmet off suddenly\nto beat on the door, his mental pattern had changed, too suddenly, and\nthe machine caught up only after he had glimpsed another image. Then as\nthe illusion adjusted replacing the helmet threw it off again.\nHe grinned wryly. He would have liked to know more about the city,\nwhatever it was. He would have liked to know more about the people he\nhad seen, whether they were real or part of the illusion, and if they\nwere as ugly as the second city had been.\nYet the danger was too great. He would go back to his ship and make the\narrangements to destroy the city. The ship was armed, and to deliver\nindirect fire over the edge of the canal would be simple enough. Garve\nNorth, his brother, waited back at the ship. If he knew of the city he\nwould have to go there. Eric must not take a chance on that. After they\nhad blasted whatever it was that lay in the canal floor, then it would\nbe time enough to tell Garve, and go down to see what was left.\nThe ship rested easily on the flat sandstone area where he had\nestablished base camp. Its familiar lines brought a smile to Eric's\nface, a feeling of confidence now that tools and weapons were his again.\nHe opened the door and entered. The lock doors were left open so that\nhe could enter directly into the body of the ship. He came in in a\nswift leap, calling, \"Garve! Hey, Garve, where are you?\"\nThe ship remained mute. He prowled through it, calling, \"Garve,\"\nwondering where the young hothead had gone, and then he saw a note\nclipped to the control board of the ship. He tore it loose impatiently\nand began to read. Garve had scrawled:\n\"Funny thing, Eric. A while ago I thought I heard music. I walked down\nto the canal, and it seemed like there were lights, and a town of some\nsort far down the canal. I wanted to investigate, but thought I'd\nbetter come back. But the thing has been in my mind for hours now, and\nI'm going down to see what it is. If you want to follow, come straight\ndown the canal.\"\nEric stared at the note, and the line of his jaw was white. Apparently\nGarve had seen the city from farther away, and its effect had not been\nso strong. Even so, Garve's natural curiosity had done the rest.\nGarve had gone down to the city, and Garve had no shielded hat. Eric\nselected two high explosive grenades from the ship's arsenal. They\nwere small but they packed a lot of power. He had a pistol packed\nwith smaller pellets of the same explosive, and he had the hat. That\nshould be adequate. He thrust the bronze hat back on his head and began\nwalking back to the canal.\nThe return back to the city would always live in his mind as a\nphantasmagora, a montage of twisted hate and unseemly beauty. When he\ncame again to the gate he did not attempt to enter, but circled the\nwall, hat on, hat off, stiff limbed like a puppet dancing to the same\ntune over and over again. He found a place where he could scale the\nwall, and thrust the helmet on his head, and clawed up the misshapen\nwall. It was all he could do to make himself drop into the ugly city.\nHe heard a familiar voice as he dropped. \"Eric,\" the voice said. \"Eric,\nyou did come back.\" The voice was his brother's, and he whirled,\nseeking the voice. A figure stood before him, a twisted caricature of\nhis brother. The figure cried, \"The hat! You fool, get rid of that\nhat!\" The caricature that was his brother seized the hat, and jerked\nso hard that the chin strap broke under Eric's chin. The hat was flung\naway and sailed high and far over the fence and outside the city.\nThe phantasm flickered, the illusion moved. Garve was now more handsome\nthan ever, and the city was a dream of delight. Garve said, \"Come,\" and\nEric followed down a street of blue fur. He had no will to resist.\nGarve said, \"Keep your head down and your face hidden. If we meet\nsomeone you may not be recognized. They won't be expecting you from\nthis side of the city.\"\nEric asked, \"You knew I'd come after you?\"\n\"Yes. The Legend said you'd be back.\"\nEric stopped and whirled to face his brother. \"The Legend? Eric the\nBronze? What is this wild fantasy?\"\n\"Not so loud!\" Garve's voice cautioned him. \"Of course the crowd called\nyou that because of the copper hat and your heavy tan. But the Elders\nbelieve so too. I don't know what it is, Eric, reincarnation, prophesy,\nsuperstition, I only know that when I was with the Elders I believed\nthem. You are a part of a Legend. You are Eric the Bronze.\"\nEric looked down at his sun tanned hands and flexed them. He loosened\nthe explosive pistol in its holster. At least he was going to be a well\narmed, well prepared Legend. And while one part of his mind marveled\nat the city and relaxed into a pleasure as deep as a dream, another\nstruggled with the almost forgotten desire to rescue his brother and\nescape. He asked, \"Who are the Elders?\"\n\"We are going to them, to the center of the city.\" Garve's voice\nsharpened, \"Keep your head down. I think the last two men we passed are\nlooking after us. Don't look back.\"\nAfter a moment Garve said, \"I think they are following us. Get ready\nto run. If we are separated, keep going until you reach City Center.\nThe Elders will be expecting you.\" Garve glanced back, and his voice\nsharpened, \"Now! Run!\"\nThey ran. But as they ran figures began to converge upon them. Farther\nup the street others appeared, cutting off their flight.\nGarve cried, \"In here,\" and pulled Eric into a crevice between two\nbuildings. Eric drew his gun, and savagery began to dance in his eyes.\nThe soft fur muffled sounds of pursuit closed in upon them.\nGarve put one hand on Eric's gun hand and said, \"Wait here. And if you\nvalue my life, don't use that gun.\" Then he was gone, running deerlike\ndown the street.\nFor an instant Eric thought the ruse had succeeded. He heard cries and\ntwo men passed him running in pursuit. But then the cry came back. \"Let\nhim go. Get the other one. The other one.\"\nEric was seen an instant later, and the people of the city began to\nconverge upon him. He could have destroyed them all with his charges in\nthe gun, but his brother's warning shrieked in his ears, \"If you value\nmy life don't use the gun.\"\nThere was nothing he could do. Eric stood quietly until he was taken\nprisoner. They moved him to the center of the wide fur street. Two men\nheld his arms, and twisted painfully. The crowd looked at him, coldly,\ncalculatingly. One of them said, \"Get the whips. If we whip him he will\nnot come back.\" The city twinkled, and the music was so faint he could\nhardly hear it.\nThere was only one weapon Eric could use. He had gathered from Garve's\nwords that these people were superstitious.\nHe laughed, a great chest-shattering laugh that gusted out into the\nthin Martian air. He laughed and cried in a great voice, \"And can you\nso easily dispose of a Legend? If I am Eric of the Legend, can whips\ndefeat the prophesy?\"\nThere was an instant when he could have twisted loose. They stood,\nfear-bound at his words. But there was no place to hide, and without\nthe use of his weapons Eric could not have gone far. He had to bluff it\nout.\nThen one of the men cried, \"Fools! It is true. We must take no chance\nwith the whips. He would come back. But if he dies here before us now,\nthen we may forget the prophesy.\"\nThe crowd murmured and a second voice cried, \"Get the sword, get the\nguards, and kill him at once!\"\nEric tensed to break away but now it was too late. His captors were\nalert. They increased the twist on his arms until he almost screamed\nwith the pain.\nThe crowd parted, and the guard came through, his red silk clothing\ngleaming in the sun, his sword bright and deadly. He stopped before\nEric, and the sword swirled up like a saber, ready for a slashing cut\ndownward across Eric's neck.\nA woman's voice, soft and yet authoritative, called, \"Hold!\" And a\nmurmur of respect rippled through the crowd.\n\"Nolette! The Daughter of the City comes.\"\nEric turned his gaze to the side and saw the woman who had spoken. She\nwas mounted upon a black horse with a jeweled bridle. She was young and\nher hair was long and free in the wind. She had ridden so softly across\nthe fur street that no one had been aware of her presence.\nShe said, \"Let me touch this man. Let me feel the pulse of his heart so\nthat I may know if he is truly the Bronze one of the Legend. Give me\nyour hand, stranger.\" She leaned down and grasped his hand. Eric shook\nhis arms free, and reached up and clung to the offered hand, thinking,\n\"If I pull her down perhaps I can use her as a shield.\" He tensed his\nmuscles and began to pull.\nShe cried, \"No! You fool. Come up on the horse,\" and pulled back with\nan energy as fierce as his own. Then he had swung up on the horse, and\nthe animal leaped forward, its muffled gallop beating out a tattoo of\nfreedom.\nEric clung tightly to the girl's waist. He could feel the young\nsuppleness of her body, and the fine strands of her hair kept swirling\nback into his face. It had a faint perfume, a clean and heady scent\nthat made him more aware of the touch of her waist. He breathed deeply,\noddly happy as they rode.\nAfter five minutes ride they came to a building in the center of the\ncity. The building was cubical, severe in line and architecture, and it\ncontrasted oddly with the exquisite ornament of the rest of the city.\nIt was as if it were a monolith from another time, a stranger crouched\namong enemies.\nThe girl halted before the structure and said, \"Dismount here, Eric.\"\nEric swung down, his arms still tingling with pleasure where he had\nheld her. She said, \"Knock three times on the door. I will see you\nagain inside. And thank your brother for sending me to bring you here.\"\nEric knocked on the door. The door was as plain as the building, made\nof a luminous plastic. It had all the beauty of the great gate door,\nbut a more timeless, more functional beauty.\nThe door opened and an old man greeted Eric. \"Come in. The Council\nawaits you. Follow me, please.\"\nEric followed down a hallway and into a large room. The room was\nobviously designed for a conference room. A great table stood in the\nroom, made of the same luminous plastic as the door of the building.\nSix men sat at this conference table. Eric's guide placed him in a\nchair at the base of the T-shaped table.\nThere was one vacant seat beside the head of the T, and as Eric\nwatched, the young woman who had rescued him entered and took her place\nthere. She smiled at Eric, and the room took on a warmth that it had\nlacked with only the older men present. The man at her right, obviously\npresiding here looked at Eric and spoke. \"I am Kroon, the eldest of\nthe elders. We have brought you here to satisfy ourselves of your\nidentity. In view of your danger in the City you are entitled to some\nsort of explanation.\" He glanced around the room and asked, \"What is\nthe judgment of the elders?\"\nEric caught a faint nod here, a gesture there. Kroon nodded as if\nin satisfaction. He turned to the girl, \"And what is your opinion,\nDaughter of the City?\"\nNolette's expression held sorrow, as if she looked into the far future.\nShe said, \"He is Eric the Bronze. I have no doubt.\"\nEric asked, \"And what is this Legend of Eric the Bronze? Why am I so\ndespised in the city?\"\nKroon answered, \"According to the Ancient Legend you will destroy the\ncity. This, and other things.\"\nEric gaped. No wonder the crowd had shown such hatred. But why were\nthe elders so friendly? They were obviously the governing body, and if\nthere was strife between them and the people it had not shown in the\nrespect the crowd had accorded Nolette.\nKroon said, \"I see you are puzzled. Let me tell you the story of the\nCity. The City is old. It dates from long ago when the canals of Mars\nran clear and green with water, and the deserts were vineyards and\ngardens. The drouth came, and the changes in climate, and soon it\nbecame plain that the people of Mars were doomed. They had ships, and\ncould build more, and gradually they left to colonize other planets.\nYet they could take little of their science. And fear and riots\ndestroyed much. Also there were those who were filled with love for\nthis homeland, and who thought that one day it might be habitable\nagain. All the skill of the ancient Martian fathers went into the\nbuilding of a giant machine, the machine that is the City, to protect a\nsmall colony of those who were chosen to remain on Mars.\"\n\"This whole city is a machine!\" Eric asked.\n\"Yes, or the product of one. The heart of it lies underneath our feet,\nin caverns beneath this building. The nature of the machine is this,\nthat it translates thought into reality.\"\nEric stared. The idea was staggering.\n\"This is essentially simple, although the technology is complex. It is\nnecessary to have a recording device, to capture thought, a transmuting\ndevice capable of transmuting the red dust of the desert into any\nsort of material desired, and a construction device, to assemble this\nmaterial into the pattern already recorded from thought.\" Kroon paused.\n\"You still doubt, my friend. Perhaps you are thirsty after your escape.\nThink strongly of a tall glass of cold water, visualize it in your\nmind, the sight and the fluidity and the touch of it.\"\nEric did so. Without warning a glass of water stood on the table before\nhim. He touched the water to his lips. It was cool and satisfying. He\ndrank it, convinced completely.\nEric asked, \"And I am to destroy the City?\"\n\"Yes. The time has come.\"\n\"But why?\" Eric demanded. For an instant he could see the twinkling\nbeauty as clearly as if he had stood outside the walls of this building.\nKroon said, \"There are difficulties. The machine builds according to\nthe mass will of the people, though it is sensitive to the individual\nin areas where it does not conflict with the imagination of the mass.\nWe have had strangers, visitors, and even our own people, who grew\ndrunk with the power of the machine, who dreamed more and more lust and\ngreed into existence. These were banished from the city, and so strong\nis the call of the city that many of them became victims of their own\nevilness, and now walk mindlessly, with no thought but to seek for the\nbeauty they have lost here.\"\nKroon sighed. \"The people have lost the will to learn. Many do not even\nknow of the machine. Our science is almost gone, and only a few of us,\nthe dreamers, the elders, have kept alive the old knowledge of the\nmachine and its history. By the collected powers of our imagination we\nbuild and control the outward appearance of the city.\n\"We have passed this down from father to son.

His face was turned toward the\ntowers, and the sound of his breathing was less than human.\nHis feet caught a projecting bit of stone and were slowed for an\ninstant, so that he turned sideways and rolled on, down into the red\ndust bottom of the canal, to lie face down in the dust, with the chin\nstrap of the odd metallic hat cutting cruelly into his chin.\nHe lay there an instant, knowing that now he had a chance. With his\nface down like this, and the dust smarting his eyes the image was gone\nfor an instant. He had to get away, he knew that. He had to mount the\nsides of the canal and never look back.\nHe told himself, \"I am Eric North, from Earth, the Third Planet of Sol,\nand this is not real.\"\nHe squirmed in the dust, feeling it bite his cheeks; he squirmed until\nhe could get up and see nothing but the red sand stone walls of the\ncanal. He ran at the walls and clawed his way up like an animal in his\nhaste. He wouldn't look again.\nThe wind freshened and the tune of the music began to talk to him. It\ntold of going barefoot over long streets of fur. It told of jewels, and\nwine, and women as fair as springtime. These and more were in the city,\nwaiting for him to claim them.\nHe sobbed, and clawed forward. He stopped to rest, and slowly his head\nbegan to turn. He turned, and the spires and minarets twinkled at him,\nbeautiful, soothing, stopping the tears that had welled down his cheeks.\nWhen he reached the bottom of the canal he began to run toward the city.\nWhen he came to the city there was a high wall around it, and a heavy\ngate carved with lotus blossoms. He beat against the gate and cried,\n\"Oh! Let me in. Let me in to the city!\" The music was richer now, as if\nit were everywhere, and the gate swung open without the faintest sound.\nA sentinel stood before the opened gate at the end of a long blue\nstreet. He was dressed in red silk with his sleeves edged in blue\nleopard skin, and he wore a belt with a jeweled short sword. He drew\nthe sword from its scabbard, and bowed forward until the point of the\nsword touched the street of blue fur. He said, \"I give you the welcome\nof my sword, and the welcome of the city. Speak your name so that it\nmay be set in the records of the dreamers.\"\nThe music sang, and the spires twinkled, and Eric said, \"I am Eric\nNorth!\"\nThe sword point jerked, and the sentinel straightened. His face was\nwhite. He cried aloud, \"It is Eric the Bronze. It is Eric of the\nLegend.\" He whirled the sword aloft, and smashed it upon Eric's metal\nhat, and the hatred was a blue flame in his eyes.\nWhen Eric regained consciousness the people of the city were all about\nhim. They were very fair, and the women were more beautiful than music.\nYet now they stared at him with red hate in their eyes. An older man\ncame forward and struck at the copper hat with a stick. The clang\ndeafened Eric and the man cried, \"You are right. It is Eric the Bronze.\nBring the ships and let him be scourged from the city.\"\nThe man drew back the stick and struck again, and Eric's back took\nfire with the blow. The crowd chanted, \"Whips, bring the whips,\" and\nfear forced Eric to his feet. He fled then, running on the heedless\nfeet of panic, outstripping those who were behind him until he passed\nthrough the great gates into the red dust floor of the canal. The gates\nclosed behind him, and the dust beat upon him, and he paused, his heart\nhammering inside his chest like a great bell clapper. He turned and\nlooked behind to be sure he was safe.\nThe towers twinkled at him, and the music whispered to him, \"Come back,\nEric North. Come back to the city.\"\nHe turned and stumbled back to the great gate and hammered on it until\nhis fists were raw, pleading for it to open and let him back.\nAnd deep inside him some part of his mind said, \"This is a madness you\ncannot escape. The city is evil, an evil like you have never known,\"\nand a fear as old as time coursed through his frame.\nHe seized the copper hat from his head, and beat on the lotus carvings\nof the great door, crying, \"Let me in! Please, take me back into the\ncity.\"\nAnd as he beat the city changed. It became dull and sordid and evil, a\ncity of disgust, with every part offensive to the eye. The spires and\nminarets were gargoyles of hatred, twisted and misshapen, and the sound\nof the city was a macabre song of hate.\nHe stared, and his back was chill with superstitions as old as the\nbeginning of man. The city flickered, changing before his eyes until it\nwas beautiful again.\nHe stood, amazed, and put the metal hat back on his head. With the\nmotion the shift took place again, and beauty was ugliness. Amazed, he\nstared at the illusion, and the thought came to him that the metal hat\nhad not entirely failed him after all.\nHe turned and began to walk away from the city, and when it began to\ncall he took the hat off his head and found peace for a time. Then when\nit began again he replaced the hat, and revulsion sped his footsteps.\nAnd so, hat on, hat off, he made his way down the dusty floor of the\ncanal, and up the rocky sides until he stood on the Martian desert, and\nthe canal was a thin line behind him. He breathed easily then, for he\nwas beyond the range of the illusions.\nAnd now that his mind was his own again he began to study the problem,\nand to understand something of the nature of the forces against which\nhe had been pitted.\nThe helmet contained an electrical circuit, designed as a shield\nagainst electrical waves tuned to affect his brain. But the hat had\nfailed because the city, whatever it was, had adjusted to this revised\npattern as he had approached it. Hence, the helmet had been no defense\nagainst illusion. However, when he had jerked the helmet off suddenly\nto beat on the door, his mental pattern had changed, too suddenly, and\nthe machine caught up only after he had glimpsed another image. Then as\nthe illusion adjusted replacing the helmet threw it off again.\nHe grinned wryly. He would have liked to know more about the city,\nwhatever it was. He would have liked to know more about the people he\nhad seen, whether they were real or part of the illusion, and if they\nwere as ugly as the second city had been.\nYet the danger was too great. He would go back to his ship and make the\narrangements to destroy the city. The ship was armed, and to deliver\nindirect fire over the edge of the canal would be simple enough. Garve\nNorth, his brother, waited back at the ship. If he knew of the city he\nwould have to go there. Eric must not take a chance on that. After they\nhad blasted whatever it was that lay in the canal floor, then it would\nbe time enough to tell Garve, and go down to see what was left.\nThe ship rested easily on the flat sandstone area where he had\nestablished base camp. Its familiar lines brought a smile to Eric's\nface, a feeling of confidence now that tools and weapons were his again.\nHe opened the door and entered. The lock doors were left open so that\nhe could enter directly into the body of the ship. He came in in a\nswift leap, calling, \"Garve! Hey, Garve, where are you?\"\nThe ship remained mute. He prowled through it, calling, \"Garve,\"\nwondering where the young hothead had gone, and then he saw a note\nclipped to the control board of the ship. He tore it loose impatiently\nand began to read. Garve had scrawled:\n\"Funny thing, Eric. A while ago I thought I heard music. I walked down\nto the canal, and it seemed like there were lights, and a town of some\nsort far down the canal. I wanted to investigate, but thought I'd\nbetter come back. But the thing has been in my mind for hours now, and\nI'm going down to see what it is. If you want to follow, come straight\ndown the canal.\"\nEric stared at the note, and the line of his jaw was white. Apparently\nGarve had seen the city from farther away, and its effect had not been\nso strong. Even so, Garve's natural curiosity had done the rest.\nGarve had gone down to the city, and Garve had no shielded hat. Eric\nselected two high explosive grenades from the ship's arsenal. They\nwere small but they packed a lot of power. He had a pistol packed\nwith smaller pellets of the same explosive, and he had the hat. That\nshould be adequate. He thrust the bronze hat back on his head and began\nwalking back to the canal.\nThe return back to the city would always live in his mind as a\nphantasmagora, a montage of twisted hate and unseemly beauty. When he\ncame again to the gate he did not attempt to enter, but circled the\nwall, hat on, hat off, stiff limbed like a puppet dancing to the same\ntune over and over again. He found a place where he could scale the\nwall, and thrust the helmet on his head, and clawed up the misshapen\nwall. It was all he could do to make himself drop into the ugly city.\nHe heard a familiar voice as he dropped. \"Eric,\" the voice said. \"Eric,\nyou did come back.\" The voice was his brother's, and he whirled,\nseeking the voice. A figure stood before him, a twisted caricature of\nhis brother. The figure cried, \"The hat! You fool, get rid of that\nhat!\" The caricature that was his brother seized the hat, and jerked\nso hard that the chin strap broke under Eric's chin. The hat was flung\naway and sailed high and far over the fence and outside the city.\nThe phantasm flickered, the illusion moved. Garve was now more handsome\nthan ever, and the city was a dream of delight. Garve said, \"Come,\" and\nEric followed down a street of blue fur. He had no will to resist.\nGarve said, \"Keep your head down and your face hidden. If we meet\nsomeone you may not be recognized. They won't be expecting you from\nthis side of the city.\"\nEric asked, \"You knew I'd come after you?\"\n\"Yes. The Legend said you'd be back.\"\nEric stopped and whirled to face his brother. \"The Legend? Eric the\nBronze? What is this wild fantasy?\"\n\"Not so loud!\" Garve's voice cautioned him. \"Of course the crowd called\nyou that because of the copper hat and your heavy tan. But the Elders\nbelieve so too. I don't know what it is, Eric, reincarnation, prophesy,\nsuperstition, I only know that when I was with the Elders I believed\nthem. You are a part of a Legend. You are Eric the Bronze.\"\nEric looked down at his sun tanned hands and flexed them. He loosened\nthe explosive pistol in its holster. At least he was going to be a well\narmed, well prepared Legend. And while one part of his mind marveled\nat the city and relaxed into a pleasure as deep as a dream, another\nstruggled with the almost forgotten desire to rescue his brother and\nescape. He asked, \"Who are the Elders?\"\n\"We are going to them, to the center of the city.\" Garve's voice\nsharpened, \"Keep your head down. I think the last two men we passed are\nlooking after us. Don't look back.\"\nAfter a moment Garve said, \"I think they are following us. Get ready\nto run. If we are separated, keep going until you reach City Center.\nThe Elders will be expecting you.\" Garve glanced back, and his voice\nsharpened, \"Now! Run!\"\nThey ran. But as they ran figures began to converge upon them. Farther\nup the street others appeared, cutting off their flight.\nGarve cried, \"In here,\" and pulled Eric into a crevice between two\nbuildings. Eric drew his gun, and savagery began to dance in his eyes.\nThe soft fur muffled sounds of pursuit closed in upon them.\nGarve put one hand on Eric's gun hand and said, \"Wait here. And if you\nvalue my life, don't use that gun.\" Then he was gone, running deerlike\ndown the street.\nFor an instant Eric thought the ruse had succeeded. He heard cries and\ntwo men passed him running in pursuit. But then the cry came back. \"Let\nhim go. Get the other one. The other one.\"\nEric was seen an instant later, and the people of the city began to\nconverge upon him. He could have destroyed them all with his charges in\nthe gun, but his brother's warning shrieked in his ears, \"If you value\nmy life don't use the gun.\"\nThere was nothing he could do. Eric stood quietly until he was taken\nprisoner. They moved him to the center of the wide fur street. Two men\nheld his arms, and twisted painfully. The crowd looked at him, coldly,\ncalculatingly. One of them said, \"Get the whips. If we whip him he will\nnot come back.\" The city twinkled, and the music was so faint he could\nhardly hear it.\nThere was only one weapon Eric could use. He had gathered from Garve's\nwords that these people were superstitious.\nHe laughed, a great chest-shattering laugh that gusted out into the\nthin Martian air. He laughed and cried in a great voice, \"And can you\nso easily dispose of a Legend? If I am Eric of the Legend, can whips\ndefeat the prophesy?\"\nThere was an instant when he could have twisted loose. They stood,\nfear-bound at his words. But there was no place to hide, and without\nthe use of his weapons Eric could not have gone far. He had to bluff it\nout.\nThen one of the men cried, \"Fools! It is true. We must take no chance\nwith the whips. He would come back. But if he dies here before us now,\nthen we may forget the prophesy.\"\nThe crowd murmured and a second voice cried, \"Get the sword, get the\nguards, and kill him at once!\"\nEric tensed to break away but now it was too late. His captors were\nalert. They increased the twist on his arms until he almost screamed\nwith the pain.\nThe crowd parted, and the guard came through, his red silk clothing\ngleaming in the sun, his sword bright and deadly. He stopped before\nEric, and the sword swirled up like a saber, ready for a slashing cut\ndownward across Eric's neck.\nA woman's voice, soft and yet authoritative, called, \"Hold!\" And a\nmurmur of respect rippled through the crowd.\n\"Nolette! The Daughter of the City comes.\"\nEric turned his gaze to the side and saw the woman who had spoken. She\nwas mounted upon a black horse with a jeweled bridle. She was young and\nher hair was long and free in the wind. She had ridden so softly across\nthe fur street that no one had been aware of her presence.\nShe said, \"Let me touch this man. Let me feel the pulse of his heart so\nthat I may know if he is truly the Bronze one of the Legend. Give me\nyour hand, stranger.\" She leaned down and grasped his hand. Eric shook\nhis arms free, and reached up and clung to the offered hand, thinking,\n\"If I pull her down perhaps I can use her as a shield.\" He tensed his\nmuscles and began to pull.\nShe cried, \"No! You fool. Come up on the horse,\" and pulled back with\nan energy as fierce as his own. Then he had swung up on the horse, and\nthe animal leaped forward, its muffled gallop beating out a tattoo of\nfreedom.\nEric clung tightly to the girl's waist. He could feel the young\nsuppleness of her body, and the fine strands of her hair kept swirling\nback into his face. It had a faint perfume, a clean and heady scent\nthat made him more aware of the touch of her waist. He breathed deeply,\noddly happy as they rode.\nAfter five minutes ride they came to a building in the center of the\ncity. The building was cubical, severe in line and architecture, and it\ncontrasted oddly with the exquisite ornament of the rest of the city.\nIt was as if it were a monolith from another time, a stranger crouched\namong enemies.\nThe girl halted before the structure and said, \"Dismount here, Eric.\"\nEric swung down, his arms still tingling with pleasure where he had\nheld her. She said, \"Knock three times on the door. I will see you\nagain inside. And thank your brother for sending me to bring you here.\"\nEric knocked on the door. The door was as plain as the building, made\nof a luminous plastic. It had all the beauty of the great gate door,\nbut a more timeless, more functional beauty.\nThe door opened and an old man greeted Eric. \"Come in. The Council\nawaits you. Follow me, please.\"\nEric followed down a hallway and into a large room. The room was\nobviously designed for a conference room. A great table stood in the\nroom, made of the same luminous plastic as the door of the building.\nSix men sat at this conference table. Eric's guide placed him in a\nchair at the base of the T-shaped table.\nThere was one vacant seat beside the head of the T, and as Eric\nwatched, the young woman who had rescued him entered and took her place\nthere. She smiled at Eric, and the room took on a warmth that it had\nlacked with only the older men present. The man at her right, obviously\npresiding here looked at Eric and spoke. \"I am Kroon, the eldest of\nthe elders. We have brought you here to satisfy ourselves of your\nidentity. In view of your danger in the City you are entitled to some\nsort of explanation.\" He glanced around the room and asked, \"What is\nthe judgment of the elders?\"\nEric caught a faint nod here, a gesture there. Kroon nodded as if\nin satisfaction. He turned to the girl, \"And what is your opinion,\nDaughter of the City?\"\nNolette's expression held sorrow, as if she looked into the far future.\nShe said, \"He is Eric the Bronze. I have no doubt.\"\nEric asked, \"And what is this Legend of Eric the Bronze? Why am I so\ndespised in the city?\"\nKroon answered, \"According to the Ancient Legend you will destroy the\ncity. This, and other things.\"\nEric gaped. No wonder the crowd had shown such hatred. But why were\nthe elders so friendly? They were obviously the governing body, and if\nthere was strife between them and the people it had not shown in the\nrespect the crowd had accorded Nolette.\nKroon said, \"I see you are puzzled. Let me tell you the story of the\nCity. The City is old. It dates from long ago when the canals of Mars\nran clear and green with water, and the deserts were vineyards and\ngardens. The drouth came, and the changes in climate, and soon it\nbecame plain that the people of Mars were doomed. They had ships, and\ncould build more, and gradually they left to colonize other planets.\nYet they could take little of their science. And fear and riots\ndestroyed much. Also there were those who were filled with love for\nthis homeland, and who thought that one day it might be habitable\nagain. All the skill of the ancient Martian fathers went into the\nbuilding of a giant machine, the machine that is the City, to protect a\nsmall colony of those who were chosen to remain on Mars.\"\n\"This whole city is a machine!\" Eric asked.\n\"Yes, or the product of one. The heart of it lies underneath our feet,\nin caverns beneath this building. The nature of the machine is this,\nthat it translates thought into reality.\"\nEric stared. The idea was staggering.\n\"This is essentially simple, although the technology is complex. It is\nnecessary to have a recording device, to capture thought, a transmuting\ndevice capable of transmuting the red dust of the desert into any\nsort of material desired, and a construction device, to assemble this\nmaterial into the pattern already recorded from thought.\" Kroon paused.\n\"You still doubt, my friend. Perhaps you are thirsty after your escape.\nThink strongly of a tall glass of cold water, visualize it in your\nmind, the sight and the fluidity and the touch of it.\"\nEric did so. Without warning a glass of water stood on the table before\nhim. He touched the water to his lips. It was cool and satisfying. He\ndrank it, convinced completely.\nEric asked, \"And I am to destroy the City?\"\n\"Yes. The time has come.\"\n\"But why?\" Eric demanded. For an instant he could see the twinkling\nbeauty as clearly as if he had stood outside the walls of this building.\nKroon said, \"There are difficulties. The machine builds according to\nthe mass will of the people, though it is sensitive to the individual\nin areas where it does not conflict with the imagination of the mass.\nWe have had strangers, visitors, and even our own people, who grew\ndrunk with the power of the machine, who dreamed more and more lust and\ngreed into existence. These were banished from the city, and so strong\nis the call of the city that many of them became victims of their own\nevilness, and now walk mindlessly, with no thought but to seek for the\nbeauty they have lost here.\"\nKroon sighed. \"The people have lost the will to learn. Many do not even\nknow of the machine. Our science is almost gone, and only a few of us,\nthe dreamers, the elders, have kept alive the old knowledge of the\nmachine and its history. By the collected powers of our imagination we\nbuild and control the outward appearance of the city.\n\"We have passed this down from father to son. A part of the ancient\nLegend is that the builders made provisions for the machine to be\ndestroyed when contact with outsiders had been made once again, so that\nour people would again have to struggle forward to knowledge and power.\nThe instrument of destruction was to be a man termed Eric the Bronze.\nIt is not that you are reborn. It is just that sometime such a man\nwould come.\"\nEric said, \"I can understand the Bronze part. They had thought that a\nspace man might well be sun tanned. They had thought that a science to\nprotect against this beautiful illusion would provide a metal shield\nof some sort, probably copper in nature. That such a man should come\nis inevitable. But why Eric. Why the name Eric?\"\nFor the first time Nolette spoke. She said quietly, \"The name Eric\nwas an honorable name of the ancient fathers. It must have been their\nthought that the new beginning should wait for some of their own far\nflung kind to return.\"\nEric nodded. He asked, \"What happens now?\"\n\"Nothing. Dwell here with us and you will be safe from our people. If\nthe prediction is not soon fulfilled and you are not the Eric of the\nLegend, you may stay or go as you desire.\"\n\"My brother, Garve.

He fled then, running on the heedless\nfeet of panic, outstripping those who were behind him until he passed\nthrough the great gates into the red dust floor of the canal. The gates\nclosed behind him, and the dust beat upon him, and he paused, his heart\nhammering inside his chest like a great bell clapper. He turned and\nlooked behind to be sure he was safe.\nThe towers twinkled at him, and the music whispered to him, \"Come back,\nEric North. Come back to the city.\"\nHe turned and stumbled back to the great gate and hammered on it until\nhis fists were raw, pleading for it to open and let him back.\nAnd deep inside him some part of his mind said, \"This is a madness you\ncannot escape. The city is evil, an evil like you have never known,\"\nand a fear as old as time coursed through his frame.\nHe seized the copper hat from his head, and beat on the lotus carvings\nof the great door, crying, \"Let me in! Please, take me back into the\ncity.\"\nAnd as he beat the city changed. It became dull and sordid and evil, a\ncity of disgust, with every part offensive to the eye. The spires and\nminarets were gargoyles of hatred, twisted and misshapen, and the sound\nof the city was a macabre song of hate.\nHe stared, and his back was chill with superstitions as old as the\nbeginning of man. The city flickered, changing before his eyes until it\nwas beautiful again.\nHe stood, amazed, and put the metal hat back on his head. With the\nmotion the shift took place again, and beauty was ugliness. Amazed, he\nstared at the illusion, and the thought came to him that the metal hat\nhad not entirely failed him after all.\nHe turned and began to walk away from the city, and when it began to\ncall he took the hat off his head and found peace for a time. Then when\nit began again he replaced the hat, and revulsion sped his footsteps.\nAnd so, hat on, hat off, he made his way down the dusty floor of the\ncanal, and up the rocky sides until he stood on the Martian desert, and\nthe canal was a thin line behind him. He breathed easily then, for he\nwas beyond the range of the illusions.\nAnd now that his mind was his own again he began to study the problem,\nand to understand something of the nature of the forces against which\nhe had been pitted.\nThe helmet contained an electrical circuit, designed as a shield\nagainst electrical waves tuned to affect his brain. But the hat had\nfailed because the city, whatever it was, had adjusted to this revised\npattern as he had approached it. Hence, the helmet had been no defense\nagainst illusion. However, when he had jerked the helmet off suddenly\nto beat on the door, his mental pattern had changed, too suddenly, and\nthe machine caught up only after he had glimpsed another image. Then as\nthe illusion adjusted replacing the helmet threw it off again.\nHe grinned wryly. He would have liked to know more about the city,\nwhatever it was. He would have liked to know more about the people he\nhad seen, whether they were real or part of the illusion, and if they\nwere as ugly as the second city had been.\nYet the danger was too great. He would go back to his ship and make the\narrangements to destroy the city. The ship was armed, and to deliver\nindirect fire over the edge of the canal would be simple enough. Garve\nNorth, his brother, waited back at the ship. If he knew of the city he\nwould have to go there. Eric must not take a chance on that. After they\nhad blasted whatever it was that lay in the canal floor, then it would\nbe time enough to tell Garve, and go down to see what was left.\nThe ship rested easily on the flat sandstone area where he had\nestablished base camp. Its familiar lines brought a smile to Eric's\nface, a feeling of confidence now that tools and weapons were his again.\nHe opened the door and entered. The lock doors were left open so that\nhe could enter directly into the body of the ship. He came in in a\nswift leap, calling, \"Garve! Hey, Garve, where are you?\"\nThe ship remained mute. He prowled through it, calling, \"Garve,\"\nwondering where the young hothead had gone, and then he saw a note\nclipped to the control board of the ship. He tore it loose impatiently\nand began to read. Garve had scrawled:\n\"Funny thing, Eric. A while ago I thought I heard music. I walked down\nto the canal, and it seemed like there were lights, and a town of some\nsort far down the canal. I wanted to investigate, but thought I'd\nbetter come back. But the thing has been in my mind for hours now, and\nI'm going down to see what it is. If you want to follow, come straight\ndown the canal.\"\nEric stared at the note, and the line of his jaw was white. Apparently\nGarve had seen the city from farther away, and its effect had not been\nso strong. Even so, Garve's natural curiosity had done the rest.\nGarve had gone down to the city, and Garve had no shielded hat. Eric\nselected two high explosive grenades from the ship's arsenal. They\nwere small but they packed a lot of power. He had a pistol packed\nwith smaller pellets of the same explosive, and he had the hat. That\nshould be adequate. He thrust the bronze hat back on his head and began\nwalking back to the canal.\nThe return back to the city would always live in his mind as a\nphantasmagora, a montage of twisted hate and unseemly beauty. When he\ncame again to the gate he did not attempt to enter, but circled the\nwall, hat on, hat off, stiff limbed like a puppet dancing to the same\ntune over and over again. He found a place where he could scale the\nwall, and thrust the helmet on his head, and clawed up the misshapen\nwall. It was all he could do to make himself drop into the ugly city.\nHe heard a familiar voice as he dropped. \"Eric,\" the voice said. \"Eric,\nyou did come back.\" The voice was his brother's, and he whirled,\nseeking the voice. A figure stood before him, a twisted caricature of\nhis brother. The figure cried, \"The hat! You fool, get rid of that\nhat!\" The caricature that was his brother seized the hat, and jerked\nso hard that the chin strap broke under Eric's chin. The hat was flung\naway and sailed high and far over the fence and outside the city.\nThe phantasm flickered, the illusion moved. Garve was now more handsome\nthan ever, and the city was a dream of delight. Garve said, \"Come,\" and\nEric followed down a street of blue fur. He had no will to resist.\nGarve said, \"Keep your head down and your face hidden. If we meet\nsomeone you may not be recognized. They won't be expecting you from\nthis side of the city.\"\nEric asked, \"You knew I'd come after you?\"\n\"Yes. The Legend said you'd be back.\"\nEric stopped and whirled to face his brother. \"The Legend? Eric the\nBronze? What is this wild fantasy?\"\n\"Not so loud!\" Garve's voice cautioned him. \"Of course the crowd called\nyou that because of the copper hat and your heavy tan. But the Elders\nbelieve so too. I don't know what it is, Eric, reincarnation, prophesy,\nsuperstition, I only know that when I was with the Elders I believed\nthem. You are a part of a Legend. You are Eric the Bronze.\"\nEric looked down at his sun tanned hands and flexed them. He loosened\nthe explosive pistol in its holster. At least he was going to be a well\narmed, well prepared Legend. And while one part of his mind marveled\nat the city and relaxed into a pleasure as deep as a dream, another\nstruggled with the almost forgotten desire to rescue his brother and\nescape. He asked, \"Who are the Elders?\"\n\"We are going to them, to the center of the city.\" Garve's voice\nsharpened, \"Keep your head down. I think the last two men we passed are\nlooking after us. Don't look back.\"\nAfter a moment Garve said, \"I think they are following us. Get ready\nto run. If we are separated, keep going until you reach City Center.\nThe Elders will be expecting you.\" Garve glanced back, and his voice\nsharpened, \"Now! Run!\"\nThey ran. But as they ran figures began to converge upon them. Farther\nup the street others appeared, cutting off their flight.\nGarve cried, \"In here,\" and pulled Eric into a crevice between two\nbuildings. Eric drew his gun, and savagery began to dance in his eyes.\nThe soft fur muffled sounds of pursuit closed in upon them.\nGarve put one hand on Eric's gun hand and said, \"Wait here. And if you\nvalue my life, don't use that gun.\" Then he was gone, running deerlike\ndown the street.\nFor an instant Eric thought the ruse had succeeded. He heard cries and\ntwo men passed him running in pursuit. But then the cry came back. \"Let\nhim go. Get the other one. The other one.\"\nEric was seen an instant later, and the people of the city began to\nconverge upon him. He could have destroyed them all with his charges in\nthe gun, but his brother's warning shrieked in his ears, \"If you value\nmy life don't use the gun.\"\nThere was nothing he could do. Eric stood quietly until he was taken\nprisoner. They moved him to the center of the wide fur street. Two men\nheld his arms, and twisted painfully. The crowd looked at him, coldly,\ncalculatingly. One of them said, \"Get the whips. If we whip him he will\nnot come back.\" The city twinkled, and the music was so faint he could\nhardly hear it.\nThere was only one weapon Eric could use. He had gathered from Garve's\nwords that these people were superstitious.\nHe laughed, a great chest-shattering laugh that gusted out into the\nthin Martian air. He laughed and cried in a great voice, \"And can you\nso easily dispose of a Legend? If I am Eric of the Legend, can whips\ndefeat the prophesy?\"\nThere was an instant when he could have twisted loose. They stood,\nfear-bound at his words. But there was no place to hide, and without\nthe use of his weapons Eric could not have gone far. He had to bluff it\nout.\nThen one of the men cried, \"Fools! It is true. We must take no chance\nwith the whips. He would come back. But if he dies here before us now,\nthen we may forget the prophesy.\"\nThe crowd murmured and a second voice cried, \"Get the sword, get the\nguards, and kill him at once!\"\nEric tensed to break away but now it was too late. His captors were\nalert. They increased the twist on his arms until he almost screamed\nwith the pain.\nThe crowd parted, and the guard came through, his red silk clothing\ngleaming in the sun, his sword bright and deadly. He stopped before\nEric, and the sword swirled up like a saber, ready for a slashing cut\ndownward across Eric's neck.\nA woman's voice, soft and yet authoritative, called, \"Hold!\" And a\nmurmur of respect rippled through the crowd.\n\"Nolette! The Daughter of the City comes.\"\nEric turned his gaze to the side and saw the woman who had spoken. She\nwas mounted upon a black horse with a jeweled bridle. She was young and\nher hair was long and free in the wind. She had ridden so softly across\nthe fur street that no one had been aware of her presence.\nShe said, \"Let me touch this man. Let me feel the pulse of his heart so\nthat I may know if he is truly the Bronze one of the Legend. Give me\nyour hand, stranger.\" She leaned down and grasped his hand. Eric shook\nhis arms free, and reached up and clung to the offered hand, thinking,\n\"If I pull her down perhaps I can use her as a shield.\" He tensed his\nmuscles and began to pull.\nShe cried, \"No! You fool. Come up on the horse,\" and pulled back with\nan energy as fierce as his own. Then he had swung up on the horse, and\nthe animal leaped forward, its muffled gallop beating out a tattoo of\nfreedom.\nEric clung tightly to the girl's waist. He could feel the young\nsuppleness of her body, and the fine strands of her hair kept swirling\nback into his face. It had a faint perfume, a clean and heady scent\nthat made him more aware of the touch of her waist. He breathed deeply,\noddly happy as they rode.\nAfter five minutes ride they came to a building in the center of the\ncity. The building was cubical, severe in line and architecture, and it\ncontrasted oddly with the exquisite ornament of the rest of the city.\nIt was as if it were a monolith from another time, a stranger crouched\namong enemies.\nThe girl halted before the structure and said, \"Dismount here, Eric.\"\nEric swung down, his arms still tingling with pleasure where he had\nheld her. She said, \"Knock three times on the door. I will see you\nagain inside. And thank your brother for sending me to bring you here.\"\nEric knocked on the door. The door was as plain as the building, made\nof a luminous plastic. It had all the beauty of the great gate door,\nbut a more timeless, more functional beauty.\nThe door opened and an old man greeted Eric. \"Come in. The Council\nawaits you. Follow me, please.\"\nEric followed down a hallway and into a large room. The room was\nobviously designed for a conference room. A great table stood in the\nroom, made of the same luminous plastic as the door of the building.\nSix men sat at this conference table. Eric's guide placed him in a\nchair at the base of the T-shaped table.\nThere was one vacant seat beside the head of the T, and as Eric\nwatched, the young woman who had rescued him entered and took her place\nthere. She smiled at Eric, and the room took on a warmth that it had\nlacked with only the older men present. The man at her right, obviously\npresiding here looked at Eric and spoke. \"I am Kroon, the eldest of\nthe elders. We have brought you here to satisfy ourselves of your\nidentity. In view of your danger in the City you are entitled to some\nsort of explanation.\" He glanced around the room and asked, \"What is\nthe judgment of the elders?\"\nEric caught a faint nod here, a gesture there. Kroon nodded as if\nin satisfaction. He turned to the girl, \"And what is your opinion,\nDaughter of the City?\"\nNolette's expression held sorrow, as if she looked into the far future.\nShe said, \"He is Eric the Bronze. I have no doubt.\"\nEric asked, \"And what is this Legend of Eric the Bronze? Why am I so\ndespised in the city?\"\nKroon answered, \"According to the Ancient Legend you will destroy the\ncity. This, and other things.\"\nEric gaped. No wonder the crowd had shown such hatred. But why were\nthe elders so friendly? They were obviously the governing body, and if\nthere was strife between them and the people it had not shown in the\nrespect the crowd had accorded Nolette.\nKroon said, \"I see you are puzzled. Let me tell you the story of the\nCity. The City is old. It dates from long ago when the canals of Mars\nran clear and green with water, and the deserts were vineyards and\ngardens. The drouth came, and the changes in climate, and soon it\nbecame plain that the people of Mars were doomed. They had ships, and\ncould build more, and gradually they left to colonize other planets.\nYet they could take little of their science. And fear and riots\ndestroyed much. Also there were those who were filled with love for\nthis homeland, and who thought that one day it might be habitable\nagain. All the skill of the ancient Martian fathers went into the\nbuilding of a giant machine, the machine that is the City, to protect a\nsmall colony of those who were chosen to remain on Mars.\"\n\"This whole city is a machine!\" Eric asked.\n\"Yes, or the product of one. The heart of it lies underneath our feet,\nin caverns beneath this building. The nature of the machine is this,\nthat it translates thought into reality.\"\nEric stared. The idea was staggering.\n\"This is essentially simple, although the technology is complex. It is\nnecessary to have a recording device, to capture thought, a transmuting\ndevice capable of transmuting the red dust of the desert into any\nsort of material desired, and a construction device, to assemble this\nmaterial into the pattern already recorded from thought.\" Kroon paused.\n\"You still doubt, my friend. Perhaps you are thirsty after your escape.\nThink strongly of a tall glass of cold water, visualize it in your\nmind, the sight and the fluidity and the touch of it.\"\nEric did so. Without warning a glass of water stood on the table before\nhim. He touched the water to his lips. It was cool and satisfying. He\ndrank it, convinced completely.\nEric asked, \"And I am to destroy the City?\"\n\"Yes. The time has come.\"\n\"But why?\" Eric demanded. For an instant he could see the twinkling\nbeauty as clearly as if he had stood outside the walls of this building.\nKroon said, \"There are difficulties. The machine builds according to\nthe mass will of the people, though it is sensitive to the individual\nin areas where it does not conflict with the imagination of the mass.\nWe have had strangers, visitors, and even our own people, who grew\ndrunk with the power of the machine, who dreamed more and more lust and\ngreed into existence. These were banished from the city, and so strong\nis the call of the city that many of them became victims of their own\nevilness, and now walk mindlessly, with no thought but to seek for the\nbeauty they have lost here.\"\nKroon sighed. \"The people have lost the will to learn. Many do not even\nknow of the machine. Our science is almost gone, and only a few of us,\nthe dreamers, the elders, have kept alive the old knowledge of the\nmachine and its history. By the collected powers of our imagination we\nbuild and control the outward appearance of the city.\n\"We have passed this down from father to son. A part of the ancient\nLegend is that the builders made provisions for the machine to be\ndestroyed when contact with outsiders had been made once again, so that\nour people would again have to struggle forward to knowledge and power.\nThe instrument of destruction was to be a man termed Eric the Bronze.\nIt is not that you are reborn. It is just that sometime such a man\nwould come.\"\nEric said, \"I can understand the Bronze part. They had thought that a\nspace man might well be sun tanned. They had thought that a science to\nprotect against this beautiful illusion would provide a metal shield\nof some sort, probably copper in nature. That such a man should come\nis inevitable. But why Eric. Why the name Eric?\"\nFor the first time Nolette spoke. She said quietly, \"The name Eric\nwas an honorable name of the ancient fathers. It must have been their\nthought that the new beginning should wait for some of their own far\nflung kind to return.\"\nEric nodded. He asked, \"What happens now?\"\n\"Nothing. Dwell here with us and you will be safe from our people. If\nthe prediction is not soon fulfilled and you are not the Eric of the\nLegend, you may stay or go as you desire.\"\n\"My brother, Garve. What about him?\"\n\"He loves the city. He will also stay, though he will be outside this\nbuilding.\" Kroon clasped his hands. \"Nolette, will you show Eric his\nquarters?\"\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nThe Beast-Jewel of Mars\nBy V. E. THIESSEN\nThe city was strange, fantastic, beautiful.\nHe'd never been there before, yet already he\nwas a fabulous legend\u2014a dire, hateful legend.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Spring 1955.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nHe lay on his stomach, a lean man in faded one piece dungarees, and an\nodd metallic hat, peering over the side of the canal. Behind him the\nlittle winds sifted red dust into his collar, but he could not move; he\ncould only sit there with his gaze riveted on the spires and minarets\nthat twinkled in the distance, far down the bottom of the canal.\nOne part of his mind said,\nThis is it, this is the fabled city of\nMars. This is the beauty and the fantasy and the music of the legends,\nand I must go down there.\nYet somewhere deeper in his mind, deep in\nthe primal urges that kept him from death, the warning was taut and\nurgent.\nGet away. They have a part of your mind now. Get away from the\ncity before you lose it all. Get away before your body becomes a husk,\na soulless husk to walk the low canals with sightless eyes, like those\nwho came before you.\nHe strained to push back from the edge, trying to get that fantastic\nbeauty out of his sight. He fought the lids of his eyes, fought to\nclose them while he pushed himself back, but they remained open,\nstaring at the jeweled towers, and borne on the little winds the thin\nwail of music reached him, saying,\nCome into the city, come down into\nthe fabled city\n.\nHe slid over the edge, sliding down the sloping sides of the canal.\nThe rough sandstone tore at his dungarees, tore at his elbow where it\ntouched but he did not feel the pain. His face was turned toward the\ntowers, and the sound of his breathing was less than human.\nHis feet caught a projecting bit of stone and were slowed for an\ninstant, so that he turned sideways and rolled on, down into the red\ndust bottom of the canal, to lie face down in the dust, with the chin\nstrap of the odd metallic hat cutting cruelly into his chin.\nHe lay there an instant, knowing that now he had a chance. With his\nface down like this, and the dust smarting his eyes the image was gone\nfor an instant. He had to get away, he knew that. He had to mount the\nsides of the canal and never look back.\nHe told himself, \"I am Eric North, from Earth, the Third Planet of Sol,\nand this is not real.\"\nHe squirmed in the dust, feeling it bite his cheeks; he squirmed until\nhe could get up and see nothing but the red sand stone walls of the\ncanal. He ran at the walls and clawed his way up like an animal in his\nhaste. He wouldn't look again.\nThe wind freshened and the tune of the music began to talk to him. It\ntold of going barefoot over long streets of fur. It told of jewels, and\nwine, and women as fair as springtime. These and more were in the city,\nwaiting for him to claim them.\nHe sobbed, and clawed forward. He stopped to rest, and slowly his head\nbegan to turn. He turned, and the spires and minarets twinkled at him,\nbeautiful, soothing, stopping the tears that had welled down his cheeks.\nWhen he reached the bottom of the canal he began to run toward the city.\nWhen he came to the city there was a high wall around it, and a heavy\ngate carved with lotus blossoms. He beat against the gate and cried,\n\"Oh! Let me in. Let me in to the city!\" The music was richer now, as if\nit were everywhere, and the gate swung open without the faintest sound.\nA sentinel stood before the opened gate at the end of a long blue\nstreet. He was dressed in red silk with his sleeves edged in blue\nleopard skin, and he wore a belt with a jeweled short sword. He drew\nthe sword from its scabbard, and bowed forward until the point of the\nsword touched the street of blue fur. He said, \"I give you the welcome\nof my sword, and the welcome of the city. Speak your name so that it\nmay be set in the records of the dreamers.\"\nThe music sang, and the spires twinkled, and Eric said, \"I am Eric\nNorth!\"\nThe sword point jerked, and the sentinel straightened. His face was\nwhite. He cried aloud, \"It is Eric the Bronze. It is Eric of the\nLegend.\" He whirled the sword aloft, and smashed it upon Eric's metal\nhat, and the hatred was a blue flame in his eyes.\nWhen Eric regained consciousness the people of the city were all about\nhim. They were very fair, and the women were more beautiful than music.\nYet now they stared at him with red hate in their eyes. An older man\ncame forward and struck at the copper hat with a stick. The clang\ndeafened Eric and the man cried, \"You are right. It is Eric the Bronze.\nBring the ships and let him be scourged from the city.\"\nThe man drew back the stick and struck again, and Eric's back took\nfire with the blow. The crowd chanted, \"Whips, bring the whips,\" and\nfear forced Eric to his feet. He fled then, running on the heedless\nfeet of panic, outstripping those who were behind him until he passed\nthrough the great gates into the red dust floor of the canal.

The spires and\nminarets were gargoyles of hatred, twisted and misshapen, and the sound\nof the city was a macabre song of hate.\nHe stared, and his back was chill with superstitions as old as the\nbeginning of man.

The lock doors were left open so that\nhe could enter directly into the body of the ship. He came in in a\nswift leap, calling, \"Garve! Hey, Garve, where are you?\"\nThe ship remained mute. He prowled through it, calling, \"Garve,\"\nwondering where the young hothead had gone, and then he saw a note\nclipped to the control board of the ship.

He thrust the bronze hat back on his head and began\nwalking back to the canal.\nThe return back to the city would always live in his mind as a\nphantasmagora, a montage of twisted hate and unseemly beauty. When he\ncame again to the gate he did not attempt to enter, but circled the\nwall, hat on, hat off, stiff limbed like a puppet dancing to the same\ntune over and over again. He found a place where he could scale the\nwall, and thrust the helmet on his head, and clawed up the misshapen\nwall.

The Legend said you'd be back.\"\nEric stopped and whirled to face his brother. \"The Legend? Eric the\nBronze? What is this wild fantasy?\"\n\"Not so loud!\" Garve's voice cautioned him. \"Of course the crowd called\nyou that because of the copper hat and your heavy tan. But the Elders\nbelieve so too. I don't know what it is, Eric, reincarnation, prophesy,\nsuperstition, I only know that when I was with the Elders I believed\nthem. You are a part of a Legend. You are Eric the Bronze.\"\nEric looked down at his sun tanned hands and flexed them. He loosened\nthe explosive pistol in its holster. At least he was going to be a well\narmed, well prepared Legend. And while one part of his mind marveled\nat the city and relaxed into a pleasure as deep as a dream, another\nstruggled with the almost forgotten desire to rescue his brother and\nescape. He asked, \"Who are the Elders?\"\n\"We are going to them, to the center of the city.\" Garve's voice\nsharpened, \"Keep your head down. I think the last two men we passed are\nlooking after us. Don't look back.\"\nAfter a moment Garve said, \"I think they are following us. Get ready\nto run. If we are separated, keep going until you reach City Center.\nThe Elders will be expecting you.\" Garve glanced back, and his voice\nsharpened, \"Now! Run!\"\nThey ran. But as they ran figures began to converge upon them. Farther\nup the street others appeared, cutting off their flight.\nGarve cried, \"In here,\" and pulled Eric into a crevice between two\nbuildings. Eric drew his gun, and savagery began to dance in his eyes.\nThe soft fur muffled sounds of pursuit closed in upon them.\nGarve put one hand on Eric's gun hand and said, \"Wait here. And if you\nvalue my life, don't use that gun.\" Then he was gone, running deerlike\ndown the street.\nFor an instant Eric thought the ruse had succeeded. He heard cries and\ntwo men passed him running in pursuit. But then the cry came back. \"Let\nhim go. Get the other one. The other one.\"\nEric was seen an instant later, and the people of the city began to\nconverge upon him. He could have destroyed them all with his charges in\nthe gun, but his brother's warning shrieked in his ears, \"If you value\nmy life don't use the gun.\"\nThere was nothing he could do. Eric stood quietly until he was taken\nprisoner. They moved him to the center of the wide fur street. Two men\nheld his arms, and twisted painfully. The crowd looked at him, coldly,\ncalculatingly. One of them said, \"Get the whips. If we whip him he will\nnot come back.\" The city twinkled, and the music was so faint he could\nhardly hear it.\nThere was only one weapon Eric could use. He had gathered from Garve's\nwords that these people were superstitious.\nHe laughed, a great chest-shattering laugh that gusted out into the\nthin Martian air. He laughed and cried in a great voice, \"And can you\nso easily dispose of a Legend? If I am Eric of the Legend, can whips\ndefeat the prophesy?\"\nThere was an instant when he could have twisted loose. They stood,\nfear-bound at his words. But there was no place to hide, and without\nthe use of his weapons Eric could not have gone far. He had to bluff it\nout.\nThen one of the men cried, \"Fools! It is true. We must take no chance\nwith the whips. He would come back. But if he dies here before us now,\nthen we may forget the prophesy.\"\nThe crowd murmured and a second voice cried, \"Get the sword, get the\nguards, and kill him at once!\"\nEric tensed to break away but now it was too late. His captors were\nalert. They increased the twist on his arms until he almost screamed\nwith the pain.\nThe crowd parted, and the guard came through, his red silk clothing\ngleaming in the sun, his sword bright and deadly. He stopped before\nEric, and the sword swirled up like a saber, ready for a slashing cut\ndownward across Eric's neck.\nA woman's voice, soft and yet authoritative, called, \"Hold!\" And a\nmurmur of respect rippled through the crowd.\n\"Nolette! The Daughter of the City comes.\"\nEric turned his gaze to the side and saw the woman who had spoken. She\nwas mounted upon a black horse with a jeweled bridle. She was young and\nher hair was long and free in the wind. She had ridden so softly across\nthe fur street that no one had been aware of her presence.\nShe said, \"Let me touch this man. Let me feel the pulse of his heart so\nthat I may know if he is truly the Bronze one of the Legend. Give me\nyour hand, stranger.\" She leaned down and grasped his hand. Eric shook\nhis arms free, and reached up and clung to the offered hand, thinking,\n\"If I pull her down perhaps I can use her as a shield.\" He tensed his\nmuscles and began to pull.\nShe cried, \"No! You fool. Come up on the horse,\" and pulled back with\nan energy as fierce as his own. Then he had swung up on the horse, and\nthe animal leaped forward, its muffled gallop beating out a tattoo of\nfreedom.\nEric clung tightly to the girl's waist. He could feel the young\nsuppleness of her body, and the fine strands of her hair kept swirling\nback into his face. It had a faint perfume, a clean and heady scent\nthat made him more aware of the touch of her waist. He breathed deeply,\noddly happy as they rode.\nAfter five minutes ride they came to a building in the center of the\ncity. The building was cubical, severe in line and architecture, and it\ncontrasted oddly with the exquisite ornament of the rest of the city.\nIt was as if it were a monolith from another time, a stranger crouched\namong enemies.\nThe girl halted before the structure and said, \"Dismount here, Eric.\"\nEric swung down, his arms still tingling with pleasure where he had\nheld her. She said, \"Knock three times on the door. I will see you\nagain inside. And thank your brother for sending me to bring you here.\"\nEric knocked on the door. The door was as plain as the building, made\nof a luminous plastic. It had all the beauty of the great gate door,\nbut a more timeless, more functional beauty.\nThe door opened and an old man greeted Eric. \"Come in. The Council\nawaits you. Follow me, please.\"\nEric followed down a hallway and into a large room. The room was\nobviously designed for a conference room. A great table stood in the\nroom, made of the same luminous plastic as the door of the building.\nSix men sat at this conference table. Eric's guide placed him in a\nchair at the base of the T-shaped table.\nThere was one vacant seat beside the head of the T, and as Eric\nwatched, the young woman who had rescued him entered and took her place\nthere. She smiled at Eric, and the room took on a warmth that it had\nlacked with only the older men present. The man at her right, obviously\npresiding here looked at Eric and spoke. \"I am Kroon, the eldest of\nthe elders. We have brought you here to satisfy ourselves of your\nidentity. In view of your danger in the City you are entitled to some\nsort of explanation.\" He glanced around the room and asked, \"What is\nthe judgment of the elders?\"\nEric caught a faint nod here, a gesture there. Kroon nodded as if\nin satisfaction. He turned to the girl, \"And what is your opinion,\nDaughter of the City?\"\nNolette's expression held sorrow, as if she looked into the far future.\nShe said, \"He is Eric the Bronze. I have no doubt.\"\nEric asked, \"And what is this Legend of Eric the Bronze? Why am I so\ndespised in the city?\"\nKroon answered, \"According to the Ancient Legend you will destroy the\ncity. This, and other things.\"\nEric gaped. No wonder the crowd had shown such hatred. But why were\nthe elders so friendly? They were obviously the governing body, and if\nthere was strife between them and the people it had not shown in the\nrespect the crowd had accorded Nolette.\nKroon said, \"I see you are puzzled. Let me tell you the story of the\nCity. The City is old. It dates from long ago when the canals of Mars\nran clear and green with water, and the deserts were vineyards and\ngardens. The drouth came, and the changes in climate, and soon it\nbecame plain that the people of Mars were doomed. They had ships, and\ncould build more, and gradually they left to colonize other planets.\nYet they could take little of their science. And fear and riots\ndestroyed much. Also there were those who were filled with love for\nthis homeland, and who thought that one day it might be habitable\nagain. All the skill of the ancient Martian fathers went into the\nbuilding of a giant machine, the machine that is the City, to protect a\nsmall colony of those who were chosen to remain on Mars.\"\n\"This whole city is a machine!\" Eric asked.\n\"Yes, or the product of one. The heart of it lies underneath our feet,\nin caverns beneath this building. The nature of the machine is this,\nthat it translates thought into reality.\"\nEric stared. The idea was staggering.\n\"This is essentially simple, although the technology is complex. It is\nnecessary to have a recording device, to capture thought, a transmuting\ndevice capable of transmuting the red dust of the desert into any\nsort of material desired, and a construction device, to assemble this\nmaterial into the pattern already recorded from thought.\" Kroon paused.\n\"You still doubt, my friend. Perhaps you are thirsty after your escape.\nThink strongly of a tall glass of cold water, visualize it in your\nmind, the sight and the fluidity and the touch of it.\"\nEric did so. Without warning a glass of water stood on the table before\nhim. He touched the water to his lips. It was cool and satisfying. He\ndrank it, convinced completely.\nEric asked, \"And I am to destroy the City?\"\n\"Yes. The time has come.\"\n\"But why?\" Eric demanded. For an instant he could see the twinkling\nbeauty as clearly as if he had stood outside the walls of this building.\nKroon said, \"There are difficulties. The machine builds according to\nthe mass will of the people, though it is sensitive to the individual\nin areas where it does not conflict with the imagination of the mass.\nWe have had strangers, visitors, and even our own people, who grew\ndrunk with the power of the machine, who dreamed more and more lust and\ngreed into existence. These were banished from the city, and so strong\nis the call of the city that many of them became victims of their own\nevilness, and now walk mindlessly, with no thought but to seek for the\nbeauty they have lost here.\"\nKroon sighed. \"The people have lost the will to learn. Many do not even\nknow of the machine. Our science is almost gone, and only a few of us,\nthe dreamers, the elders, have kept alive the old knowledge of the\nmachine and its history. By the collected powers of our imagination we\nbuild and control the outward appearance of the city.\n\"We have passed this down from father to son. A part of the ancient\nLegend is that the builders made provisions for the machine to be\ndestroyed when contact with outsiders had been made once again, so that\nour people would again have to struggle forward to knowledge and power.\nThe instrument of destruction was to be a man termed Eric the Bronze.\nIt is not that you are reborn. It is just that sometime such a man\nwould come.\"\nEric said, \"I can understand the Bronze part. They had thought that a\nspace man might well be sun tanned. They had thought that a science to\nprotect against this beautiful illusion would provide a metal shield\nof some sort, probably copper in nature. That such a man should come\nis inevitable. But why Eric. Why the name Eric?\"\nFor the first time Nolette spoke. She said quietly, \"The name Eric\nwas an honorable name of the ancient fathers. It must have been their\nthought that the new beginning should wait for some of their own far\nflung kind to return.\"\nEric nodded. He asked, \"What happens now?\"\n\"Nothing. Dwell here with us and you will be safe from our people. If\nthe prediction is not soon fulfilled and you are not the Eric of the\nLegend, you may stay or go as you desire.\"\n\"My brother, Garve. What about him?\"\n\"He loves the city. He will also stay, though he will be outside this\nbuilding.\" Kroon clasped his hands. \"Nolette, will you show Eric his\nquarters?\"\n", "summary": "The story begins with a young man named Eric on Mars. He has never been there before, but he has heard stories about the fabled city of Mars. When he sees the city, he is overwhelmed with its beauty and its wealth. He is taken by the beauty of the city and is taken to the city's center. There, he meets his brother, who is also a legend. The two go to see the Old City, which is described as dark and mysterious. When they enter, they are attacked by a strange machine. The machine is able to control the minds of the people, but it is sensitive to the individual's thoughts. The story ends with the two running out of time.  Kroon, the leader of the Elders, tells his son that they are going to destroy the city. The city is evil, an evil like you have never known, and a fear as old as time courts his son. He decides to follow his father\u2019s advice and take the ship back to Earth. The ship is armed, and to deliverindirect fire over the edge of the canal would be simple enough. The plan is foiled by the humans, who are able to build more advanced machines than the humans.", "faithfulness": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}

Earth Flight 21 was a\nsuicide run, a coffin ship, they told him.\nUranian death lay athwart the space lanes. But\nShano already knew this was his last ride.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\nPlanet Stories Fall 1949.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nMercurian night settled black and thick over the Q City Spaceport.\nTentative fingers of light flicked and probed the sky, and winked out.\n\"Here she comes,\" somebody in the line ahead said.\nShano coughed, his whole skeletal body jerking. Arthritic joints sent\nflashes of pain along his limbs. Here she comes, he thought, feeling\nneither glad nor sad.\nHe coughed and slipped polarized goggles over his eyes.\nThe spaceport emerged bathed in infra red. Hangars, cradles, freighter\ncatapults and long runways stood out in sharp, diamond-clear detail.\nHigh up, beyond the cone of illumination, a detached triple row of\nbright specks\u2014portholes of the liner\nStardust\n\u2014sank slowly down.\nThere was no eagerness in him. Only a tiredness. A relief. Relief from\na lifetime of beating around the planets. A life of digging, lifting,\nlugging and pounding. Like a work-worn Martian camel, he was going home\nto die.\nAs though on oiled pistons the ship sank into the light, its long\nshark-like hull glowing soft and silvery, and settled with a feathery\nsnuggle into the cradle's ribs.\nThe passenger line quivered as a loud-speaker boomed:\n\"\nStardust, now arrived at Cradle Six! Stardust, Cradle Six! All\npassengers for Venus and Earth prepare to board in ten minutes.\n\"\nShano coughed, and wiped phlegm from his thin lips, his hand following\naround the bony contours of his face, feeling the hollows and the beard\nstubble and loose skin of his neck. He coughed and thought of the\nvanium mines of Pluto, and his gum-clogged lungs. A vague, pressing\ndesire for home overwhelmed him. It had been so long.\n\"\nAttention! Attention, Stardust passengers! The signal is red. The\nsignal is red. Refunds now being made. Refunds now. Take-off in five\nminutes.\n\"\nThe man ahead swore and flicked up an arm. \"Red,\" he groaned. \"By the\ninfinite galaxies, this is the last straw!\" He charged away, knocking\nShano aside as he passed.\nRed signal.\nIn bewildered anxiety Shano lifted the goggles from his\neyes and stared into the sudden blackness. The red signal. Danger out\nthere. Passengers advised to ground themselves, or travel at their own\nrisk.\nHe felt the passengers bump and fumble past him, grumbling vexatiously.\nA hot dread assailed him, and he coughed, plucking at his chest.\nPlucking at an urgency there.\nDropping the goggles to his rheumy eyes, he saw that the passenger line\nhad dissolved. He moved, shuffling, to the gate, thrust his ticket into\nthe scanner slot, and pushed through the turnstile when it clicked.\n\"\nFlight twenty-one, now arriving from Venus\n,\" the loud-speaker said\nmonotonously. Shano glanced briefly upward and saw the gleaming belly\nof twenty-one sinking into the spaceport cone of light.\nHe clawed his way up the gangway and thrust out his ticket to the\nlieutenant standing alone at the air lock. The lieutenant, a sullen,\nchunky man with a queer nick in his jawbone, refused the ticket.\n\"Haven't you heard, mister? Red signal. Go on back.\"\nShano coughed, and peered through the lenses of his goggles. \"Please,\"\nhe said. \"Want to go home. I've a right.\" The nicked jaw stirred faint\nmemories within his glazed mind.\nThe lieutenant punched his ticket. \"It's your funeral, old man.\"\nThe loud-speaker blared. \"\nStardust, taking off in thirty seconds. The\nsignal is red. Stardust, taking\u2014\n\"\nWith the words dinning in his ears, Shano stepped into the air lock.\nThe officer followed, spun wheels, and the lock closed. The outside was\nshut off.\nLifting goggles they entered the hull, through a series of two more\nlocks, closing each behind them.\n\"We're afloat,\" the officer said. \"We've taken off.\" A fleck of light\ndanced far back in his eye. Shano felt the pressure of acceleration\ngradually increasing, increasing, and hurried in.\nCaptain Menthlo, a silver-mustached Jupiterian, broad, huge, yet\ncrushable as a beetle, talked while his hands manipulated a panel of\nstuds in the control room. The pilot, his back encased in leather, sat\nin a bucket seat before him, listening into earphones.\n\"Surprised to learn of a passenger aboard,\" the captain said, glancing\nbriefly sideways. \"You're entitled to know of the danger ahead.\" He\nflicked a final stud, spoke to the pilot and at last turned a serious,\nsquared face to Shano. \"Old man,\" he said. \"There's a Uranian fleet out\nthere. We don't know how many ships in this sector. Flight twenty-one,\nwhich just landed, had a skirmish with one, and got away. We may not be\nso lucky. You know how these Uranian devils are.\"\nShano coughed, and wiped his mouth. \"Dirty devils,\" he said. \"I was\ndriv' off the planet once, before this war started. I know things\nabout them Uranian devils. Heard them in the mines around. Hears\nthings, a laborer does.\"\nThe captain seemed for the first time to realize the social status of\nhis lone passenger, and he became a little gruff.\n\"Want you to sign this waiver, saying you're traveling at your own\nrisk. We'll expect you to keep to your cabin as much as possible.\nWhen the trouble comes we can't bother with a passenger. In a few\nhours we'll shut down the ship entirely, and every mechanical device\naboard, to try to avoid detection.\" His mustaches rose like two spears\nfrom each side of his squared nose as his face changed to an alert\nwatchfulness. \"Going home, eh?\" he said. \"You've knocked around some,\nby the looks of you. Pluto, from the sound of that cough.\"\nShano scrawled his signature on the waiver. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Pluto.\nWhere a man's lungs fights gas.\" He blinked watery eyes. \"Captain,\nwhat's a notched jaw mean to you?\"\n\"Well, old man,\" the captain grasped Shano's shoulder and turned him\naround. \"It means somebody cut himself, shaving. You stick tight to\nyour cabin.\" He nodded curtly and indicated the door.\nDescending the companionway to the next deck Shano observed the\nnick-jawed lieutenant staring out the viewport, apparently idling. The\nman turned and gripped Shano's thin arm.\n\"A light?\" he said, tapping a cigarette. Shano produced a lighter\ndisk and the chunky man puffed. He was an Earthman and his jaw seemed\ncut with a knife, notched like a piece of wood. Across the breast of\nhis tunic was a purple band, with the name\nRourke\n. \"Why are you so\nanxious to get aboard, old man?\" He searched Shano's face. \"There's\ntrouble ahead, you know.\"\nShano coughed, wracking his body, as forgotten memories stirred\nsluggishly in his mind. \"Yup,\" he said, and jerked free and stumbled\ndown the steel deck.\nIn his cabin he lay on the bunk, lighted a cigarette and smoked,\ncoughing and staring at the rivet-studded bulkhead. The slow movement\nof his mind resolved into a struggle, one idea groping for the other.\nWhat were the things he'd heard about nicked jaws? And where had\nhe heard them? Digging ore on Pluto; talk in the pits? Secretive\nsuspicions voiced in smoke-laden saloons of Mars? In the labor gangs of\nUranus? Where? Shano smoked and didn't know. But he knew there was a\nrumor, and that it was the talk of ignorant men. The captain had evaded\nit. Shano smoked and coughed and stared at the steel bulkhead and\nwaited.\nThe ship's alarm clanged. Shano jerked from his bunk like a broken\nwatch spring. He crouched, trembling, on arthritic joints, as a\nloud-speaker blared throughout the ship.\n\"\nAll hands! We now maintain dead silence. Close down and stop all\nmachinery. Power off and lights out. An enemy fleet is out there,\nlistening and watching for mechanical and electronic disturbance.\nAtmosphere will be maintained from emergency oxygen cylinders. Stop\npumps.\n\"\nShano crouched and listened as the ship's steady drone ceased and the\nvibrations ceased. The pumps stopped, the lights went out.\nPressing the cold steel bulkhead, Shano heard oxygen hiss through the\npipes. Hiss and hiss and then flow soundlessly, filling the cabin and\nhis lungs. He choked.\nThe cabin was like a mine shaft, dark and cold. Feet pounded on the\ndeck outside.\nShano clawed open the door. He peered out anxiously.\nCold blobs of light, phosphorescent bulbs held in the fists of men,\nglimmered by. Phosphorescent bulbs, because the power was off. Shano\nblinked. He saw officers and men, their faces tight and pinched,\nhurrying in all directions. Hurrying to shut down the ship.\nHe acted impulsively. A young ensign strode by, drawn blaster in hand.\nShano followed him; followed the bluish glow of his bulb, through\nlabyrinthine passages and down a companionway, coughing and leering\nagainst the pain in his joints. The blue light winked out in the\ndistance and Shano stopped.\nHe was suddenly alarmed. The captain had warned him to stay in his\ncabin. He looked back and forth, wondering how to return.\nA bell clanged.\nShano saw a cold bulb glowing down the passageway, and he shuffled\nhopefully toward it. The bulb moved away. He saw an indistinct figure\ndisappear through a door marked, ENGINE ROOM.\nShano paused uncertainly at the end of the passageway. A thick cluster\nof vertical pipes filled the corner. He peered at the pipes and saw a\ngray box snuggled behind them. It had two toggle switches and a radium\ndial that quivered delicately.\nShano scratched his scalp as boots pounded on the decks, above\nand below. He listened attentively to the ship's familiar noises\ndiminishing one by one. And finally even the pounding of feet died out;\neverything became still. The silence shrieked in his ears.\nThe ship coasted. Shano could sense it coasting. He couldn't feel it\nor hear it, but he knew it was sliding ghost-like through space like a\nsubmarine dead under water, slipping quietly past a listening enemy.\nThe ship's speaker rasped softly. \"\nEmergency. Battle posts.\n\"\nThe captain's voice. Calm, brief. It sent a tremor through Shano's\nbody. He heard a quick scuffle of feet again, running feet, directly\noverhead, and the captain's voice, more urgently, \"Power on. They've\nheard us.\"\nThe words carried no accusation, but Shano realized what they meant.\nA slip-up. Something left running. Vibrations picked up quickly by\ndetectors of the Uranian space fleet.\nShano coughed and heard the ship come to life around him. He pulled\nhimself out of the spasm, cursing Pluto. Cursing his diseased,\ngum-clogged lungs. Cursing the Uranian fleet that was trying to prevent\nhis going home\u2014even to die.\nThis was a strange battle. Strange indeed. It was mostly silence.\nOccasionally, as though from another world, came a brief, curt order.\n\"Port guns alert.\" Then hush and tension.\nThe deck lurched and the ship swung this way and that. Maybe dodging,\nmaybe maneuvering\u2014Shano didn't know. He felt the deck lurch, that was\nall.\n\"Fire number seven.\"\nHe heard the weird scream of a ray gun, and felt the constricting\nterror that seemed to belt the ship like an iron band.\nThis was a battle in space, and out there were Uranian cruisers trying\nto blast the\nStardust\nout of the sky. Trying and trying, while the\ncaptain dodged and fired back\u2014pitted his skill and knowledge against\nan enemy Shano couldn't see.\nHe wanted desperately to help the captain break through, and get to\nEarth. But he could only cling to the plastic pipes and cough.\nThe ship jounced and slid beneath his feet, and was filled with sound.\nIt rocked and rolled. Shano caromed off the bulkhead.\n\"Hold fire.\"\nHe crawled to his knees on the slippery deck, grabbed the pipes and\npulled himself erect, hand over hand. His eyes came level with the gray\nmetal box behind the pipes. He squinted, fascinated, at the quivering\ndial needle. \"Hey!\" he said.\n\"Stand by.\"\nShano puzzled it out, his mind groping. He wasn't used to thinking.\nOnly working with his hands.\nThis box. This needle that had quivered when the ship was closed\ndown....\n\"It's over. Chased them off. Ready guns before laying to. Third watch\non duty.\"\nShano sighed at the sudden release of tension throughout the space\nliner\nStardust\n.\nSmoke spewed from his nostrils. His forehead wrinkled with\nconcentration. Those rumors: \"Man sells out to Uranus, gets a nick cut\nin his jaw. Ever see a man with a nick in his jaw? Watch him, he's up\nto something.\" The talk of ignorant men. Shano remembered.\nHe poked behind the pipes and angrily slapped the toggle switches on\nthe box. The captain would only scoff. He'd never believe there was a\ntraitor aboard who had planted an electronic signal box, giving away\nthe ship's position. He'd never believe the babblings of an old man.\nHe straightened up, glaring angrily. He knew. And the knowledge made\nhim cold and furious. He watched the engine room emergency exit as it\nopened cautiously.\nA chunky man backed out, holstering a flat blaster. He turned and saw\nShano, standing smoking. He walked over and nudged Shano, his face\ndark. Shano blew smoke into the dark face.\n\"Old man,\" said Rourke. \"What're you doing down here?\"\nShano blinked.\nRourke fingered the nick in his jaw, eyes glinting. \"You're supposed to\nbe in your cabin,\" he said. \"Didn't I warn you we'd run into trouble?\"\nShano smoked and contemplated the chunky man. Estimated his strength\nand youth and felt the anger and frustration mount in him. \"Devil,\" he\nsaid.\n\"Devil,\" he said and dug his cigarette into the other's face.\nHe lunged then, clawing. He dug the cigarette into Rourke's flushed\nface, and clung to his body. Rourke howled. He fell backward to the\ndeck, slapping at his blistered face. He thrashed around and Shano\nclung to him, battered, pressing the cigarette relentlessly, coughing,\ncursing the pain in his joints.\nShano grasped Rourke's neck with his hands. He twisted the neck with\nhis gnarled hands. Strong hands that had worked.\nHe got up when Rourke stopped thrashing. The face was purple and he\nwas dead. Shano shivered. He crouched in the passageway shivering and\ncoughing.\nA tremendous grinding sounded amid-ships. Loud rending noises of\nprotesting metal. The ship bucked like a hooked fish. Then it was\nstill. An empty clank echoed through the hull. The captain's voice\ncame, almost yelling. \"Emergency! Emergency! Back to your posts. Engine\nroom\u2014report! Engine room\u2014\"\nShano picked himself off the deck, his mind muddled. He coughed and\nput a cigarette to his lips, flicking a lighter disk jerkily from his\npocket. He blew smoke from his nostrils and heard the renewed pounding\nof feet. What was going on now?\n\"Engine room! Your screen is dead! Switch onto loud-speaker system.\nEngine room!\"\nGiddily, Shano heard clicks and rasps and then a thick voice, atom\nmotors whirring in the background.\n\"Selector's gone, sir. Direct hit. Heat ray through the deck plates.\nWe've sealed the tear. Might repair selector in five hours.\"\nShano coughed and sent a burst of smoke from his mouth.\n\"Captain!\" A rasping, grating sound ensued from a grill above Shano's\nhead, then a disconnected voice. \"Get the men out of there. It's\nuseless. Hurry it up!\" A series of clicks and the heavy voice of the\nchief engineer. \"Captain! Somebody's smashed the selector chamber.\nEngine room's full of toxia gas!\"\nShano jumped. He prodded the body on the deck with his toe.\nThe\nStardust's\nmechanical voice bellowed: \"Engine room!\" It\nreproduced the captain's heavy breathing and his tired voice. \"We're\nabout midway to Venus,\" it said. \"There were two ships and we drove\nthem off. But there may be others. They'll be coming back. They know\nwe've been hit. We have to get away fast!\"\nShano could see the captain in his mind, worried, squared face slick\nwith moisture. Shouting into a control room mike. Trying to find out\nwhat the matter was with his space ship.\nThe engineer's answer came from the grill. \"Impossible, sir. Engine\nroom full of toxia gas. Not a suit aboard prepared to withstand it. And\nwe have to keep it in there. Selector filaments won't function without\nthe gas. Our only chance was to put a man in the engine room to repair\nthe broken selector valve rods or keep them running by hand.\"\n\"Blast it!\" roared the captain. \"No way of getting in there? Can't you\nby-pass the selector?\"\n\"No. It's the heart of the new cosmic drive, sir. The fuels must pass\nthrough selector valves before entering the tube chambers. Filaments\nwill operate so long as toxia gas is there to burn, and will keep\ntrying to open the valves and compensate for fluctuating engine\ntemperature. But the rod pins have melted down, sir\u2014they're common\ntungsten steel\u2014and when the rods pull a valve open, they slip off and\ndrop down, useless. It's a mess. If we could only get a man in there\nhe might lift up the dropped end of a rod and slip it into place each\ntime it fell, and keep the valves working and feeding fuel.\"\nThe speaker spluttered and Shano smoked thoughtfully, listening to the\ntalk back and forth, between the captain and the engineer. He didn't\nunderstand it, but knew that everything was ended. They were broken\ndown in space and would never make Earth. Those Uranian devils would\ncome streaking back. Catch them floating, helpless, and blast them to\nbits. And he would never get home to die.\nShano coughed, and cursed his lungs. Time was when these gum-clogged\nlungs had saved his life. In the Plutonian mines. Gas explosions in the\ntunnels. Toxia gas, seeping in, burning the men's insides. But with\ngum-clogged lungs he'd been able to work himself clear. Just getting\nsick where other men had died, their insides burned out.\nShano smoked and thought.\nThey wouldn't even know, he told himself, squirming through the\nemergency exit into the engine room, and sealing it after him. And they\nwouldn't understand if they did. Pink mist swirled about him. Toxia\ngas. Shano coughed.\nHe squinted around at the massive, incomprehensible machinery. The guts\nof the space ship.\nThen he saw the shattered, gold-gleaming cylinder, gas hissing from\na fine nozzle, and filaments glowing bluish inside it, still working\naway. He saw five heavy Carrsteel rods hanging useless, on melted-down\npins, and the slots their pronged ends hooked into. He looked at his\nhands, and shook his head.\n\"One try,\" he said to himself. \"One try, Shano. One important thing in\nyour life. Here's your opportunity. The toxia gas will get you. It'll\nkill you at this concentration. But you'll last for maybe twelve hours.\nAnother man wouldn't last a minute. Another man's lungs aren't clogged\nwith Juno gum.\"\nHe grasped a rod and lifted it, sweating under the weight, and slipped\nthe forked end into its slot. Going home to die, he thought. Well,\nmaybe not going home. Couldn't remember what Earth looked like anyway.\nWhat was that again? Oh yeah\u2014just lift them up, and when they drop\noff, lift them up again.\nShano coughed, and lifted the heavy rods into position. One jerked back\nsuddenly and smoothly, and something went, \"Pop, pop,\" behind him and\nmachinery whirred. He lifted the rod and slipped it back on. Another\njerked, pulled open a large valve, and dropped off. Shano bent, and\nlifted, coughing and coughing. He forgot what he was doing, mind blank\nthe way it went when he worked. Just rhythmically fell into the job,\nthe way a laborer does. He waited for a rod to slip and fall, then\nlifted it up and slipped it in place, skin sweating, joints shooting\npain along his limbs.

Arthritic joints sent\nflashes of pain along his limbs. Here she comes, he thought, feeling\nneither glad nor sad.\nHe coughed and slipped polarized goggles over his eyes.\nThe spaceport emerged bathed in infra red. Hangars, cradles, freighter\ncatapults and long runways stood out in sharp, diamond-clear detail.\nHigh up, beyond the cone of illumination, a detached triple row of\nbright specks\u2014portholes of the liner\nStardust\n\u2014sank slowly down.\nThere was no eagerness in him. Only a tiredness. A relief. Relief from\na lifetime of beating around the planets. A life of digging, lifting,\nlugging and pounding. Like a work-worn Martian camel, he was going home\nto die.\nAs though on oiled pistons the ship sank into the light, its long\nshark-like hull glowing soft and silvery, and settled with a feathery\nsnuggle into the cradle's ribs.\nThe passenger line quivered as a loud-speaker boomed:\n\"\nStardust, now arrived at Cradle Six! Stardust, Cradle Six! All\npassengers for Venus and Earth prepare to board in ten minutes.\n\"\nShano coughed, and wiped phlegm from his thin lips, his hand following\naround the bony contours of his face, feeling the hollows and the beard\nstubble and loose skin of his neck. He coughed and thought of the\nvanium mines of Pluto, and his gum-clogged lungs. A vague, pressing\ndesire for home overwhelmed him. It had been so long.\n\"\nAttention! Attention, Stardust passengers! The signal is red. The\nsignal is red. Refunds now being made. Refunds now. Take-off in five\nminutes.\n\"\nThe man ahead swore and flicked up an arm. \"Red,\" he groaned. \"By the\ninfinite galaxies, this is the last straw!\" He charged away, knocking\nShano aside as he passed.\nRed signal.\nIn bewildered anxiety Shano lifted the goggles from his\neyes and stared into the sudden blackness. The red signal. Danger out\nthere. Passengers advised to ground themselves, or travel at their own\nrisk.\nHe felt the passengers bump and fumble past him, grumbling vexatiously.\nA hot dread assailed him, and he coughed, plucking at his chest.\nPlucking at an urgency there.\nDropping the goggles to his rheumy eyes, he saw that the passenger line\nhad dissolved. He moved, shuffling, to the gate, thrust his ticket into\nthe scanner slot, and pushed through the turnstile when it clicked.\n\"\nFlight twenty-one, now arriving from Venus\n,\" the loud-speaker said\nmonotonously. Shano glanced briefly upward and saw the gleaming belly\nof twenty-one sinking into the spaceport cone of light.\nHe clawed his way up the gangway and thrust out his ticket to the\nlieutenant standing alone at the air lock. The lieutenant, a sullen,\nchunky man with a queer nick in his jawbone, refused the ticket.\n\"Haven't you heard, mister? Red signal. Go on back.\"\nShano coughed, and peered through the lenses of his goggles. \"Please,\"\nhe said. \"Want to go home. I've a right.\" The nicked jaw stirred faint\nmemories within his glazed mind.\nThe lieutenant punched his ticket. \"It's your funeral, old man.\"\nThe loud-speaker blared. \"\nStardust, taking off in thirty seconds. The\nsignal is red. Stardust, taking\u2014\n\"\nWith the words dinning in his ears, Shano stepped into the air lock.\nThe officer followed, spun wheels, and the lock closed. The outside was\nshut off.\nLifting goggles they entered the hull, through a series of two more\nlocks, closing each behind them.\n\"We're afloat,\" the officer said. \"We've taken off.\" A fleck of light\ndanced far back in his eye. Shano felt the pressure of acceleration\ngradually increasing, increasing, and hurried in.\nCaptain Menthlo, a silver-mustached Jupiterian, broad, huge, yet\ncrushable as a beetle, talked while his hands manipulated a panel of\nstuds in the control room. The pilot, his back encased in leather, sat\nin a bucket seat before him, listening into earphones.\n\"Surprised to learn of a passenger aboard,\" the captain said, glancing\nbriefly sideways. \"You're entitled to know of the danger ahead.\" He\nflicked a final stud, spoke to the pilot and at last turned a serious,\nsquared face to Shano. \"Old man,\" he said. \"There's a Uranian fleet out\nthere. We don't know how many ships in this sector. Flight twenty-one,\nwhich just landed, had a skirmish with one, and got away. We may not be\nso lucky. You know how these Uranian devils are.\"\nShano coughed, and wiped his mouth. \"Dirty devils,\" he said. \"I was\ndriv' off the planet once, before this war started. I know things\nabout them Uranian devils. Heard them in the mines around. Hears\nthings, a laborer does.\"\nThe captain seemed for the first time to realize the social status of\nhis lone passenger, and he became a little gruff.\n\"Want you to sign this waiver, saying you're traveling at your own\nrisk. We'll expect you to keep to your cabin as much as possible.\nWhen the trouble comes we can't bother with a passenger. In a few\nhours we'll shut down the ship entirely, and every mechanical device\naboard, to try to avoid detection.\" His mustaches rose like two spears\nfrom each side of his squared nose as his face changed to an alert\nwatchfulness. \"Going home, eh?\" he said. \"You've knocked around some,\nby the looks of you. Pluto, from the sound of that cough.\"\nShano scrawled his signature on the waiver. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Pluto.\nWhere a man's lungs fights gas.\" He blinked watery eyes. \"Captain,\nwhat's a notched jaw mean to you?\"\n\"Well, old man,\" the captain grasped Shano's shoulder and turned him\naround. \"It means somebody cut himself, shaving. You stick tight to\nyour cabin.\" He nodded curtly and indicated the door.\nDescending the companionway to the next deck Shano observed the\nnick-jawed lieutenant staring out the viewport, apparently idling. The\nman turned and gripped Shano's thin arm.\n\"A light?\" he said, tapping a cigarette. Shano produced a lighter\ndisk and the chunky man puffed. He was an Earthman and his jaw seemed\ncut with a knife, notched like a piece of wood. Across the breast of\nhis tunic was a purple band, with the name\nRourke\n. \"Why are you so\nanxious to get aboard, old man?\" He searched Shano's face. \"There's\ntrouble ahead, you know.\"\nShano coughed, wracking his body, as forgotten memories stirred\nsluggishly in his mind. \"Yup,\" he said, and jerked free and stumbled\ndown the steel deck.\nIn his cabin he lay on the bunk, lighted a cigarette and smoked,\ncoughing and staring at the rivet-studded bulkhead. The slow movement\nof his mind resolved into a struggle, one idea groping for the other.\nWhat were the things he'd heard about nicked jaws? And where had\nhe heard them? Digging ore on Pluto; talk in the pits? Secretive\nsuspicions voiced in smoke-laden saloons of Mars? In the labor gangs of\nUranus? Where? Shano smoked and didn't know. But he knew there was a\nrumor, and that it was the talk of ignorant men. The captain had evaded\nit. Shano smoked and coughed and stared at the steel bulkhead and\nwaited.\nThe ship's alarm clanged. Shano jerked from his bunk like a broken\nwatch spring. He crouched, trembling, on arthritic joints, as a\nloud-speaker blared throughout the ship.\n\"\nAll hands! We now maintain dead silence. Close down and stop all\nmachinery. Power off and lights out. An enemy fleet is out there,\nlistening and watching for mechanical and electronic disturbance.\nAtmosphere will be maintained from emergency oxygen cylinders. Stop\npumps.\n\"\nShano crouched and listened as the ship's steady drone ceased and the\nvibrations ceased. The pumps stopped, the lights went out.\nPressing the cold steel bulkhead, Shano heard oxygen hiss through the\npipes. Hiss and hiss and then flow soundlessly, filling the cabin and\nhis lungs. He choked.\nThe cabin was like a mine shaft, dark and cold. Feet pounded on the\ndeck outside.\nShano clawed open the door. He peered out anxiously.\nCold blobs of light, phosphorescent bulbs held in the fists of men,\nglimmered by. Phosphorescent bulbs, because the power was off. Shano\nblinked. He saw officers and men, their faces tight and pinched,\nhurrying in all directions. Hurrying to shut down the ship.\nHe acted impulsively. A young ensign strode by, drawn blaster in hand.\nShano followed him; followed the bluish glow of his bulb, through\nlabyrinthine passages and down a companionway, coughing and leering\nagainst the pain in his joints. The blue light winked out in the\ndistance and Shano stopped.\nHe was suddenly alarmed. The captain had warned him to stay in his\ncabin. He looked back and forth, wondering how to return.\nA bell clanged.\nShano saw a cold bulb glowing down the passageway, and he shuffled\nhopefully toward it. The bulb moved away. He saw an indistinct figure\ndisappear through a door marked, ENGINE ROOM.\nShano paused uncertainly at the end of the passageway. A thick cluster\nof vertical pipes filled the corner. He peered at the pipes and saw a\ngray box snuggled behind them. It had two toggle switches and a radium\ndial that quivered delicately.\nShano scratched his scalp as boots pounded on the decks, above\nand below. He listened attentively to the ship's familiar noises\ndiminishing one by one. And finally even the pounding of feet died out;\neverything became still. The silence shrieked in his ears.\nThe ship coasted. Shano could sense it coasting. He couldn't feel it\nor hear it, but he knew it was sliding ghost-like through space like a\nsubmarine dead under water, slipping quietly past a listening enemy.\nThe ship's speaker rasped softly. \"\nEmergency. Battle posts.\n\"\nThe captain's voice. Calm, brief. It sent a tremor through Shano's\nbody. He heard a quick scuffle of feet again, running feet, directly\noverhead, and the captain's voice, more urgently, \"Power on. They've\nheard us.\"\nThe words carried no accusation, but Shano realized what they meant.\nA slip-up. Something left running. Vibrations picked up quickly by\ndetectors of the Uranian space fleet.\nShano coughed and heard the ship come to life around him. He pulled\nhimself out of the spasm, cursing Pluto. Cursing his diseased,\ngum-clogged lungs. Cursing the Uranian fleet that was trying to prevent\nhis going home\u2014even to die.\nThis was a strange battle. Strange indeed. It was mostly silence.\nOccasionally, as though from another world, came a brief, curt order.\n\"Port guns alert.\" Then hush and tension.\nThe deck lurched and the ship swung this way and that. Maybe dodging,\nmaybe maneuvering\u2014Shano didn't know. He felt the deck lurch, that was\nall.\n\"Fire number seven.\"\nHe heard the weird scream of a ray gun, and felt the constricting\nterror that seemed to belt the ship like an iron band.\nThis was a battle in space, and out there were Uranian cruisers trying\nto blast the\nStardust\nout of the sky. Trying and trying, while the\ncaptain dodged and fired back\u2014pitted his skill and knowledge against\nan enemy Shano couldn't see.\nHe wanted desperately to help the captain break through, and get to\nEarth. But he could only cling to the plastic pipes and cough.\nThe ship jounced and slid beneath his feet, and was filled with sound.\nIt rocked and rolled. Shano caromed off the bulkhead.\n\"Hold fire.\"\nHe crawled to his knees on the slippery deck, grabbed the pipes and\npulled himself erect, hand over hand. His eyes came level with the gray\nmetal box behind the pipes. He squinted, fascinated, at the quivering\ndial needle. \"Hey!\" he said.\n\"Stand by.\"\nShano puzzled it out, his mind groping. He wasn't used to thinking.\nOnly working with his hands.\nThis box. This needle that had quivered when the ship was closed\ndown....\n\"It's over. Chased them off. Ready guns before laying to. Third watch\non duty.\"\nShano sighed at the sudden release of tension throughout the space\nliner\nStardust\n.\nSmoke spewed from his nostrils. His forehead wrinkled with\nconcentration. Those rumors: \"Man sells out to Uranus, gets a nick cut\nin his jaw. Ever see a man with a nick in his jaw? Watch him, he's up\nto something.\" The talk of ignorant men. Shano remembered.\nHe poked behind the pipes and angrily slapped the toggle switches on\nthe box. The captain would only scoff. He'd never believe there was a\ntraitor aboard who had planted an electronic signal box, giving away\nthe ship's position. He'd never believe the babblings of an old man.\nHe straightened up, glaring angrily. He knew. And the knowledge made\nhim cold and furious. He watched the engine room emergency exit as it\nopened cautiously.\nA chunky man backed out, holstering a flat blaster. He turned and saw\nShano, standing smoking. He walked over and nudged Shano, his face\ndark. Shano blew smoke into the dark face.\n\"Old man,\" said Rourke. \"What're you doing down here?\"\nShano blinked.\nRourke fingered the nick in his jaw, eyes glinting. \"You're supposed to\nbe in your cabin,\" he said. \"Didn't I warn you we'd run into trouble?\"\nShano smoked and contemplated the chunky man. Estimated his strength\nand youth and felt the anger and frustration mount in him. \"Devil,\" he\nsaid.\n\"Devil,\" he said and dug his cigarette into the other's face.\nHe lunged then, clawing. He dug the cigarette into Rourke's flushed\nface, and clung to his body. Rourke howled. He fell backward to the\ndeck, slapping at his blistered face. He thrashed around and Shano\nclung to him, battered, pressing the cigarette relentlessly, coughing,\ncursing the pain in his joints.\nShano grasped Rourke's neck with his hands. He twisted the neck with\nhis gnarled hands. Strong hands that had worked.\nHe got up when Rourke stopped thrashing. The face was purple and he\nwas dead. Shano shivered. He crouched in the passageway shivering and\ncoughing.\nA tremendous grinding sounded amid-ships. Loud rending noises of\nprotesting metal. The ship bucked like a hooked fish. Then it was\nstill. An empty clank echoed through the hull. The captain's voice\ncame, almost yelling. \"Emergency! Emergency! Back to your posts. Engine\nroom\u2014report! Engine room\u2014\"\nShano picked himself off the deck, his mind muddled. He coughed and\nput a cigarette to his lips, flicking a lighter disk jerkily from his\npocket. He blew smoke from his nostrils and heard the renewed pounding\nof feet. What was going on now?\n\"Engine room! Your screen is dead! Switch onto loud-speaker system.\nEngine room!\"\nGiddily, Shano heard clicks and rasps and then a thick voice, atom\nmotors whirring in the background.\n\"Selector's gone, sir. Direct hit. Heat ray through the deck plates.\nWe've sealed the tear. Might repair selector in five hours.\"\nShano coughed and sent a burst of smoke from his mouth.\n\"Captain!\" A rasping, grating sound ensued from a grill above Shano's\nhead, then a disconnected voice. \"Get the men out of there. It's\nuseless. Hurry it up!\" A series of clicks and the heavy voice of the\nchief engineer. \"Captain! Somebody's smashed the selector chamber.\nEngine room's full of toxia gas!\"\nShano jumped. He prodded the body on the deck with his toe.\nThe\nStardust's\nmechanical voice bellowed: \"Engine room!\" It\nreproduced the captain's heavy breathing and his tired voice. \"We're\nabout midway to Venus,\" it said. \"There were two ships and we drove\nthem off. But there may be others. They'll be coming back. They know\nwe've been hit. We have to get away fast!\"\nShano could see the captain in his mind, worried, squared face slick\nwith moisture. Shouting into a control room mike. Trying to find out\nwhat the matter was with his space ship.\nThe engineer's answer came from the grill. \"Impossible, sir. Engine\nroom full of toxia gas. Not a suit aboard prepared to withstand it. And\nwe have to keep it in there. Selector filaments won't function without\nthe gas. Our only chance was to put a man in the engine room to repair\nthe broken selector valve rods or keep them running by hand.\"\n\"Blast it!\" roared the captain. \"No way of getting in there? Can't you\nby-pass the selector?\"\n\"No. It's the heart of the new cosmic drive, sir. The fuels must pass\nthrough selector valves before entering the tube chambers. Filaments\nwill operate so long as toxia gas is there to burn, and will keep\ntrying to open the valves and compensate for fluctuating engine\ntemperature.

He is nervous about the unknown that awaits him. He has been working for the space station for a long time and is tired of the long hours and long days. He wants to go home to see his wife, but he is told that the trip is his last. He does not want to go, but the woman he is waiting for is his wife. He tries to explain that he is going to Earth to see her, but she refuses to go. He gets angry and threatens her with his gun, but then he realizes that he has to go to the control room to get the papers to sign. He goes to the counter to sign his ticket and is told by the woman that he cannot leave the ship. He then goes to get his luggage and is met by the captain of the ship, who tells him that he will be taking off in five minutes. Shano is confused and is then informed that the ship is being attacked by the Varsoom. He rushes to the airlock and punches the man in the face, who is unconscious. Shanoo is taken to the hospital and is informed that he must be put into a coma for a month. He wakes up in a hospital and receives news that he needs to be sent back to Earth. He decides to go back to his job and asks for a doctor to examine him. The doctor agrees and tells him to be discharged. He leaves and Shano goes to catch a cab to the spacestation. He arrives at the next morning. He sees the woman who is waiting to board the ship and is relieved to see that she is not his wife and that she has been sighted. He tells her that he loves her and that he wants to marry her. She is shocked and asks him why he wants a wife and not a wife. Shanie tells her he is a spaceman and that they will be going home. She tells him she is a teacher and that her husband is a doctor. Shaney is confused by this and is upset that she cannot marry him. She then tells him he is not allowed to go on the trip. He asks her why she is so upset and she says that she will be with him forever. He says that he can't marry her because he is the last man to see Earth. She says that her parents are in a coma and that the only reason she is alive is because she is the only one who can save them. He realizes that she wants to be with Shano and that is why she has to die. He feels sick and nauseous and wants to die too. He thinks about his wife's death and the fact that he was the last person to see it. He starts to weep and realizes that his life has been a long one. He looks around for her and sees her. He runs to her and kisses her goodbye. He hears a voice in the distance and turns around to see the woman. She has been crying. He kisses her and then turns around and sees the Varsovian woman. He turns around. He knows that she died.", "faithfulness": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, null, 0, null, 0, null, 0]}

The red signal. Danger out\nthere.

He moved, shuffling, to the gate, thrust his ticket into\nthe scanner slot, and pushed through the turnstile when it clicked.\n\"\nFlight twenty-one, now arriving from Venus\n,\" the loud-speaker said\nmonotonously. Shano glanced briefly upward and saw the gleaming belly\nof twenty-one sinking into the spaceport cone of light.\nHe clawed his way up the gangway and thrust out his ticket to the\nlieutenant standing alone at the air lock. The lieutenant, a sullen,\nchunky man with a queer nick in his jawbone, refused the ticket.\n\"Haven't you heard, mister? Red signal. Go on back.\"\nShano coughed, and peered through the lenses of his goggles. \"Please,\"\nhe said. \"Want to go home.

The outside was\nshut off.\nLifting goggles they entered the hull, through a series of two more\nlocks, closing each behind them.\n\"We're afloat,\" the officer said. \"We've taken off.\" A fleck of light\ndanced far back in his eye. Shano felt the pressure of acceleration\ngradually increasing, increasing, and hurried in.\nCaptain Menthlo, a silver-mustached Jupiterian, broad, huge, yet\ncrushable as a beetle, talked while his hands manipulated a panel of\nstuds in the control room. The pilot, his back encased in leather, sat\nin a bucket seat before him, listening into earphones.\n\"Surprised to learn of a passenger aboard,\" the captain said, glancing\nbriefly sideways. \"You're entitled to know of the danger ahead.\" He\nflicked a final stud, spoke to the pilot and at last turned a serious,\nsquared face to Shano. \"Old man,\" he said. \"There's a Uranian fleet out\nthere. We don't know how many ships in this sector. Flight twenty-one,\nwhich just landed, had a skirmish with one, and got away. We may not be\nso lucky. You know how these Uranian devils are.\"\nShano coughed, and wiped his mouth. \"Dirty devils,\" he said. \"I was\ndriv' off the planet once, before this war started. I know things\nabout them Uranian devils. Heard them in the mines around. Hears\nthings, a laborer does.\"\nThe captain seemed for the first time to realize the social status of\nhis lone passenger, and he became a little gruff.\n\"Want you to sign this waiver, saying you're traveling at your own\nrisk. We'll expect you to keep to your cabin as much as possible.\nWhen the trouble comes we can't bother with a passenger. In a few\nhours we'll shut down the ship entirely, and every mechanical device\naboard, to try to avoid detection.\" His mustaches rose like two spears\nfrom each side of his squared nose as his face changed to an alert\nwatchfulness. \"Going home, eh?\" he said. \"You've knocked around some,\nby the looks of you. Pluto, from the sound of that cough.\"\nShano scrawled his signature on the waiver. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Pluto.\nWhere a man's lungs fights gas.\" He blinked watery eyes. \"Captain,\nwhat's a notched jaw mean to you?\"\n\"Well, old man,\" the captain grasped Shano's shoulder and turned him\naround. \"It means somebody cut himself, shaving. You stick tight to\nyour cabin.\" He nodded curtly and indicated the door.\nDescending the companionway to the next deck Shano observed the\nnick-jawed lieutenant staring out the viewport, apparently idling. The\nman turned and gripped Shano's thin arm.\n\"A light?\" he said, tapping a cigarette. Shano produced a lighter\ndisk and the chunky man puffed. He was an Earthman and his jaw seemed\ncut with a knife, notched like a piece of wood. Across the breast of\nhis tunic was a purple band, with the name\nRourke\n. \"Why are you so\nanxious to get aboard, old man?\" He searched Shano's face. \"There's\ntrouble ahead, you know.\"\nShano coughed, wracking his body, as forgotten memories stirred\nsluggishly in his mind. \"Yup,\" he said, and jerked free and stumbled\ndown the steel deck.\nIn his cabin he lay on the bunk, lighted a cigarette and smoked,\ncoughing and staring at the rivet-studded bulkhead. The slow movement\nof his mind resolved into a struggle, one idea groping for the other.\nWhat were the things he'd heard about nicked jaws? And where had\nhe heard them? Digging ore on Pluto; talk in the pits? Secretive\nsuspicions voiced in smoke-laden saloons of Mars? In the labor gangs of\nUranus? Where? Shano smoked and didn't know. But he knew there was a\nrumor, and that it was the talk of ignorant men. The captain had evaded\nit. Shano smoked and coughed and stared at the steel bulkhead and\nwaited.\nThe ship's alarm clanged. Shano jerked from his bunk like a broken\nwatch spring. He crouched, trembling, on arthritic joints, as a\nloud-speaker blared throughout the ship.\n\"\nAll hands! We now maintain dead silence. Close down and stop all\nmachinery. Power off and lights out. An enemy fleet is out there,\nlistening and watching for mechanical and electronic disturbance.\nAtmosphere will be maintained from emergency oxygen cylinders. Stop\npumps.\n\"\nShano crouched and listened as the ship's steady drone ceased and the\nvibrations ceased. The pumps stopped, the lights went out.\nPressing the cold steel bulkhead, Shano heard oxygen hiss through the\npipes. Hiss and hiss and then flow soundlessly, filling the cabin and\nhis lungs. He choked.\nThe cabin was like a mine shaft, dark and cold. Feet pounded on the\ndeck outside.\nShano clawed open the door. He peered out anxiously.\nCold blobs of light, phosphorescent bulbs held in the fists of men,\nglimmered by. Phosphorescent bulbs, because the power was off. Shano\nblinked. He saw officers and men, their faces tight and pinched,\nhurrying in all directions. Hurrying to shut down the ship.\nHe acted impulsively. A young ensign strode by, drawn blaster in hand.\nShano followed him; followed the bluish glow of his bulb, through\nlabyrinthine passages and down a companionway, coughing and leering\nagainst the pain in his joints. The blue light winked out in the\ndistance and Shano stopped.\nHe was suddenly alarmed. The captain had warned him to stay in his\ncabin. He looked back and forth, wondering how to return.\nA bell clanged.\nShano saw a cold bulb glowing down the passageway, and he shuffled\nhopefully toward it. The bulb moved away. He saw an indistinct figure\ndisappear through a door marked, ENGINE ROOM.\nShano paused uncertainly at the end of the passageway. A thick cluster\nof vertical pipes filled the corner. He peered at the pipes and saw a\ngray box snuggled behind them. It had two toggle switches and a radium\ndial that quivered delicately.\nShano scratched his scalp as boots pounded on the decks, above\nand below. He listened attentively to the ship's familiar noises\ndiminishing one by one. And finally even the pounding of feet died out;\neverything became still. The silence shrieked in his ears.\nThe ship coasted. Shano could sense it coasting. He couldn't feel it\nor hear it, but he knew it was sliding ghost-like through space like a\nsubmarine dead under water, slipping quietly past a listening enemy.\nThe ship's speaker rasped softly. \"\nEmergency. Battle posts.\n\"\nThe captain's voice. Calm, brief. It sent a tremor through Shano's\nbody. He heard a quick scuffle of feet again, running feet, directly\noverhead, and the captain's voice, more urgently, \"Power on. They've\nheard us.\"\nThe words carried no accusation, but Shano realized what they meant.\nA slip-up. Something left running. Vibrations picked up quickly by\ndetectors of the Uranian space fleet.\nShano coughed and heard the ship come to life around him. He pulled\nhimself out of the spasm, cursing Pluto. Cursing his diseased,\ngum-clogged lungs. Cursing the Uranian fleet that was trying to prevent\nhis going home\u2014even to die.\nThis was a strange battle. Strange indeed. It was mostly silence.\nOccasionally, as though from another world, came a brief, curt order.\n\"Port guns alert.\" Then hush and tension.\nThe deck lurched and the ship swung this way and that. Maybe dodging,\nmaybe maneuvering\u2014Shano didn't know. He felt the deck lurch, that was\nall.\n\"Fire number seven.\"\nHe heard the weird scream of a ray gun, and felt the constricting\nterror that seemed to belt the ship like an iron band.\nThis was a battle in space, and out there were Uranian cruisers trying\nto blast the\nStardust\nout of the sky. Trying and trying, while the\ncaptain dodged and fired back\u2014pitted his skill and knowledge against\nan enemy Shano couldn't see.\nHe wanted desperately to help the captain break through, and get to\nEarth. But he could only cling to the plastic pipes and cough.\nThe ship jounced and slid beneath his feet, and was filled with sound.\nIt rocked and rolled. Shano caromed off the bulkhead.\n\"Hold fire.\"\nHe crawled to his knees on the slippery deck, grabbed the pipes and\npulled himself erect, hand over hand. His eyes came level with the gray\nmetal box behind the pipes. He squinted, fascinated, at the quivering\ndial needle. \"Hey!\" he said.\n\"Stand by.\"\nShano puzzled it out, his mind groping. He wasn't used to thinking.\nOnly working with his hands.\nThis box. This needle that had quivered when the ship was closed\ndown....\n\"It's over. Chased them off. Ready guns before laying to. Third watch\non duty.\"\nShano sighed at the sudden release of tension throughout the space\nliner\nStardust\n.\nSmoke spewed from his nostrils. His forehead wrinkled with\nconcentration. Those rumors: \"Man sells out to Uranus, gets a nick cut\nin his jaw. Ever see a man with a nick in his jaw? Watch him, he's up\nto something.\" The talk of ignorant men. Shano remembered.\nHe poked behind the pipes and angrily slapped the toggle switches on\nthe box. The captain would only scoff. He'd never believe there was a\ntraitor aboard who had planted an electronic signal box, giving away\nthe ship's position. He'd never believe the babblings of an old man.\nHe straightened up, glaring angrily. He knew. And the knowledge made\nhim cold and furious. He watched the engine room emergency exit as it\nopened cautiously.\nA chunky man backed out, holstering a flat blaster. He turned and saw\nShano, standing smoking. He walked over and nudged Shano, his face\ndark. Shano blew smoke into the dark face.\n\"Old man,\" said Rourke. \"What're you doing down here?\"\nShano blinked.\nRourke fingered the nick in his jaw, eyes glinting. \"You're supposed to\nbe in your cabin,\" he said. \"Didn't I warn you we'd run into trouble?\"\nShano smoked and contemplated the chunky man. Estimated his strength\nand youth and felt the anger and frustration mount in him. \"Devil,\" he\nsaid.\n\"Devil,\" he said and dug his cigarette into the other's face.\nHe lunged then, clawing. He dug the cigarette into Rourke's flushed\nface, and clung to his body. Rourke howled. He fell backward to the\ndeck, slapping at his blistered face. He thrashed around and Shano\nclung to him, battered, pressing the cigarette relentlessly, coughing,\ncursing the pain in his joints.\nShano grasped Rourke's neck with his hands. He twisted the neck with\nhis gnarled hands. Strong hands that had worked.\nHe got up when Rourke stopped thrashing. The face was purple and he\nwas dead. Shano shivered. He crouched in the passageway shivering and\ncoughing.\nA tremendous grinding sounded amid-ships. Loud rending noises of\nprotesting metal. The ship bucked like a hooked fish. Then it was\nstill. An empty clank echoed through the hull. The captain's voice\ncame, almost yelling. \"Emergency! Emergency! Back to your posts. Engine\nroom\u2014report! Engine room\u2014\"\nShano picked himself off the deck, his mind muddled. He coughed and\nput a cigarette to his lips, flicking a lighter disk jerkily from his\npocket. He blew smoke from his nostrils and heard the renewed pounding\nof feet. What was going on now?\n\"Engine room! Your screen is dead! Switch onto loud-speaker system.\nEngine room!\"\nGiddily, Shano heard clicks and rasps and then a thick voice, atom\nmotors whirring in the background.\n\"Selector's gone, sir. Direct hit. Heat ray through the deck plates.\nWe've sealed the tear. Might repair selector in five hours.\"\nShano coughed and sent a burst of smoke from his mouth.\n\"Captain!\" A rasping, grating sound ensued from a grill above Shano's\nhead, then a disconnected voice. \"Get the men out of there. It's\nuseless. Hurry it up!\" A series of clicks and the heavy voice of the\nchief engineer. \"Captain! Somebody's smashed the selector chamber.\nEngine room's full of toxia gas!\"\nShano jumped. He prodded the body on the deck with his toe.\nThe\nStardust's\nmechanical voice bellowed: \"Engine room!\" It\nreproduced the captain's heavy breathing and his tired voice. \"We're\nabout midway to Venus,\" it said. \"There were two ships and we drove\nthem off. But there may be others. They'll be coming back. They know\nwe've been hit. We have to get away fast!\"\nShano could see the captain in his mind, worried, squared face slick\nwith moisture. Shouting into a control room mike. Trying to find out\nwhat the matter was with his space ship.\nThe engineer's answer came from the grill. \"Impossible, sir. Engine\nroom full of toxia gas. Not a suit aboard prepared to withstand it. And\nwe have to keep it in there. Selector filaments won't function without\nthe gas. Our only chance was to put a man in the engine room to repair\nthe broken selector valve rods or keep them running by hand.\"\n\"Blast it!\" roared the captain. \"No way of getting in there? Can't you\nby-pass the selector?\"\n\"No. It's the heart of the new cosmic drive, sir. The fuels must pass\nthrough selector valves before entering the tube chambers. Filaments\nwill operate so long as toxia gas is there to burn, and will keep\ntrying to open the valves and compensate for fluctuating engine\ntemperature. But the rod pins have melted down, sir\u2014they're common\ntungsten steel\u2014and when the rods pull a valve open, they slip off and\ndrop down, useless. It's a mess. If we could only get a man in there\nhe might lift up the dropped end of a rod and slip it into place each\ntime it fell, and keep the valves working and feeding fuel.\"\nThe speaker spluttered and Shano smoked thoughtfully, listening to the\ntalk back and forth, between the captain and the engineer. He didn't\nunderstand it, but knew that everything was ended. They were broken\ndown in space and would never make Earth. Those Uranian devils would\ncome streaking back. Catch them floating, helpless, and blast them to\nbits. And he would never get home to die.\nShano coughed, and cursed his lungs. Time was when these gum-clogged\nlungs had saved his life. In the Plutonian mines. Gas explosions in the\ntunnels. Toxia gas, seeping in, burning the men's insides. But with\ngum-clogged lungs he'd been able to work himself clear. Just getting\nsick where other men had died, their insides burned out.\nShano smoked and thought.\nThey wouldn't even know, he told himself, squirming through the\nemergency exit into the engine room, and sealing it after him. And they\nwouldn't understand if they did. Pink mist swirled about him. Toxia\ngas. Shano coughed.\nHe squinted around at the massive, incomprehensible machinery. The guts\nof the space ship.\nThen he saw the shattered, gold-gleaming cylinder, gas hissing from\na fine nozzle, and filaments glowing bluish inside it, still working\naway. He saw five heavy Carrsteel rods hanging useless, on melted-down\npins, and the slots their pronged ends hooked into. He looked at his\nhands, and shook his head.\n\"One try,\" he said to himself. \"One try, Shano. One important thing in\nyour life. Here's your opportunity. The toxia gas will get you. It'll\nkill you at this concentration. But you'll last for maybe twelve hours.\nAnother man wouldn't last a minute. Another man's lungs aren't clogged\nwith Juno gum.\"\nHe grasped a rod and lifted it, sweating under the weight, and slipped\nthe forked end into its slot. Going home to die, he thought. Well,\nmaybe not going home. Couldn't remember what Earth looked like anyway.\nWhat was that again? Oh yeah\u2014just lift them up, and when they drop\noff, lift them up again.\nShano coughed, and lifted the heavy rods into position. One jerked back\nsuddenly and smoothly, and something went, \"Pop, pop,\" behind him and\nmachinery whirred. He lifted the rod and slipped it back on. Another\njerked, pulled open a large valve, and dropped off. Shano bent, and\nlifted, coughing and coughing. He forgot what he was doing, mind blank\nthe way it went when he worked. Just rhythmically fell into the job,\nthe way a laborer does. He waited for a rod to slip and fall, then\nlifted it up and slipped it in place, skin sweating, joints shooting\npain along his limbs. He heard the machinery working. He heard the\nhigh, howling whine of cosmic jets. He, Shano, was making the machinery\ngo. He was running the cosmic drive.\nA bell clanged somewhere. \"Engine room! Engine room! We're under way!\nWhat happened?\"\nSilence, while Shano coughed and made the machinery go, thinking about\nthe Earth he hadn't seen for many years.\n\"Captain!\" the speaker bawled. \"There's a man in there! Working the\nvalve rods! Somebody is in the engine room and the gas isn't....\"\nShano grinned, feeling good. Feeling happy. Lifting the heavy steel\nrods, driving the ship. Keeping the jets screaming and hurtling the\nliner\nStardust\ntoward Venus. He wondered if they'd found Rourke yet.\nIf he could keep going for twelve hours they would get to Venus. After\nthat....\n\"Home,\" he coughed. \"Hell! Who wants to go home?\"\nHe plucked at his agitated chest, thinking of a whole damn Uranian\nfleet swooping down on a spot in space, expecting to find a crippled\nship there with a spy inside it. And finding nothing. Because of Shano.\nA useless old man.\nCoughing came out all mixed up with laughing.\n"], "document": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\nSIGNAL RED\nBy HENRY GUTH\nThey tried to stop him.

He couldn't feel it\nor hear it, but he knew it was sliding ghost-like through space like a\nsubmarine dead under water, slipping quietly past a listening enemy.\nThe ship's speaker rasped softly. \"\nEmergency. Battle posts.\n\"\nThe captain's voice. Calm, brief. It sent a tremor through Shano's\nbody. He heard a quick scuffle of feet again, running feet, directly\noverhead, and the captain's voice, more urgently, \"Power on. They've\nheard us.\"\nThe words carried no accusation, but Shano realized what they meant.\nA slip-up. Something left running. Vibrations picked up quickly by\ndetectors of the Uranian space fleet.\nShano coughed and heard the ship come to life around him. He pulled\nhimself out of the spasm, cursing Pluto. Cursing his diseased,\ngum-clogged lungs. Cursing the Uranian fleet that was trying to prevent\nhis going home\u2014even to die.\nThis was a strange battle. Strange indeed. It was mostly silence.\nOccasionally, as though from another world, came a brief, curt order.\n\"Port guns alert.\" Then hush and tension.\nThe deck lurched and the ship swung this way and that. Maybe dodging,\nmaybe maneuvering\u2014Shano didn't know. He felt the deck lurch, that was\nall.\n\"Fire number seven.\"\nHe heard the weird scream of a ray gun, and felt the constricting\nterror that seemed to belt the ship like an iron band.\nThis was a battle in space, and out there were Uranian cruisers trying\nto blast the\nStardust\nout of the sky. Trying and trying, while the\ncaptain dodged and fired back\u2014pitted his skill and knowledge against\nan enemy Shano couldn't see.\nHe wanted desperately to help the captain break through, and get to\nEarth. But he could only cling to the plastic pipes and cough.\nThe ship jounced and slid beneath his feet, and was filled with sound.\nIt rocked and rolled. Shano caromed off the bulkhead.\n\"Hold fire.\"\nHe crawled to his knees on the slippery deck, grabbed the pipes and\npulled himself erect, hand over hand. His eyes came level with the gray\nmetal box behind the pipes. He squinted, fascinated, at the quivering\ndial needle. \"Hey!\" he said.\n\"Stand by.\"\nShano puzzled it out, his mind groping. He wasn't used to thinking.\nOnly working with his hands.\nThis box. This needle that had quivered when the ship was closed\ndown....\n\"It's over. Chased them off. Ready guns before laying to. Third watch\non duty.\"\nShano sighed at the sudden release of tension throughout the space\nliner\nStardust\n.\nSmoke spewed from his nostrils. His forehead wrinkled with\nconcentration. Those rumors: \"Man sells out to Uranus, gets a nick cut\nin his jaw. Ever see a man with a nick in his jaw? Watch him, he's up\nto something.\" The talk of ignorant men. Shano remembered.\nHe poked behind the pipes and angrily slapped the toggle switches on\nthe box. The captain would only scoff. He'd never believe there was a\ntraitor aboard who had planted an electronic signal box, giving away\nthe ship's position. He'd never believe the babblings of an old man.\nHe straightened up, glaring angrily. He knew. And the knowledge made\nhim cold and furious. He watched the engine room emergency exit as it\nopened cautiously.\nA chunky man backed out, holstering a flat blaster. He turned and saw\nShano, standing smoking. He walked over and nudged Shano, his face\ndark. Shano blew smoke into the dark face.\n\"Old man,\" said Rourke. \"What're you doing down here?\"\nShano blinked.\nRourke fingered the nick in his jaw, eyes glinting. \"You're supposed to\nbe in your cabin,\" he said. \"Didn't I warn you we'd run into trouble?\"\nShano smoked and contemplated the chunky man. Estimated his strength\nand youth and felt the anger and frustration mount in him. \"Devil,\" he\nsaid.\n\"Devil,\" he said and dug his cigarette into the other's face.\nHe lunged then, clawing. He dug the cigarette into Rourke's flushed\nface, and clung to his body. Rourke howled. He fell backward to the\ndeck, slapping at his blistered face. He thrashed around and Shano\nclung to him, battered, pressing the cigarette relentlessly, coughing,\ncursing the pain in his joints.\nShano grasped Rourke's neck with his hands. He twisted the neck with\nhis gnarled hands. Strong hands that had worked.\nHe got up when Rourke stopped thrashing. The face was purple and he\nwas dead. Shano shivered. He crouched in the passageway shivering and\ncoughing.\nA tremendous grinding sounded amid-ships. Loud rending noises of\nprotesting metal. The ship bucked like a hooked fish. Then it was\nstill. An empty clank echoed through the hull. The captain's voice\ncame, almost yelling. \"Emergency! Emergency! Back to your posts. Engine\nroom\u2014report! Engine room\u2014\"\nShano picked himself off the deck, his mind muddled. He coughed and\nput a cigarette to his lips, flicking a lighter disk jerkily from his\npocket. He blew smoke from his nostrils and heard the renewed pounding\nof feet. What was going on now?\n\"Engine room! Your screen is dead! Switch onto loud-speaker system.\nEngine room!\"\nGiddily, Shano heard clicks and rasps and then a thick voice, atom\nmotors whirring in the background.\n\"Selector's gone, sir. Direct hit. Heat ray through the deck plates.\nWe've sealed the tear. Might repair selector in five hours.\"\nShano coughed and sent a burst of smoke from his mouth.\n\"Captain!\" A rasping, grating sound ensued from a grill above Shano's\nhead, then a disconnected voice. \"Get the men out of there. It's\nuseless. Hurry it up!\" A series of clicks and the heavy voice of the\nchief engineer. \"Captain! Somebody's smashed the selector chamber.\nEngine room's full of toxia gas!\"\nShano jumped. He prodded the body on the deck with his toe.\nThe\nStardust's\nmechanical voice bellowed: \"Engine room!\" It\nreproduced the captain's heavy breathing and his tired voice. \"We're\nabout midway to Venus,\" it said. \"There were two ships and we drove\nthem off. But there may be others. They'll be coming back. They know\nwe've been hit. We have to get away fast!\"\nShano could see the captain in his mind, worried, squared face slick\nwith moisture. Shouting into a control room mike. Trying to find out\nwhat the matter was with his space ship.\nThe engineer's answer came from the grill. \"Impossible, sir. Engine\nroom full of toxia gas. Not a suit aboard prepared to withstand it. And\nwe have to keep it in there. Selector filaments won't function without\nthe gas. Our only chance was to put a man in the engine room to repair\nthe broken selector valve rods or keep them running by hand.\"\n\"Blast it!\" roared the captain. \"No way of getting in there? Can't you\nby-pass the selector?\"\n\"No. It's the heart of the new cosmic drive, sir. The fuels must pass\nthrough selector valves before entering the tube chambers. Filaments\nwill operate so long as toxia gas is there to burn, and will keep\ntrying to open the valves and compensate for fluctuating engine\ntemperature. But the rod pins have melted down, sir\u2014they're common\ntungsten steel\u2014and when the rods pull a valve open, they slip off and\ndrop down, useless. It's a mess. If we could only get a man in there\nhe might lift up the dropped end of a rod and slip it into place each\ntime it fell, and keep the valves working and feeding fuel.\"\nThe speaker spluttered and Shano smoked thoughtfully, listening to the\ntalk back and forth, between the captain and the engineer. He didn't\nunderstand it, but knew that everything was ended. They were broken\ndown in space and would never make Earth. Those Uranian devils would\ncome streaking back. Catch them floating, helpless, and blast them to\nbits. And he would never get home to die.\nShano coughed, and cursed his lungs. Time was when these gum-clogged\nlungs had saved his life. In the Plutonian mines. Gas explosions in the\ntunnels. Toxia gas, seeping in, burning the men's insides. But with\ngum-clogged lungs he'd been able to work himself clear. Just getting\nsick where other men had died, their insides burned out.\nShano smoked and thought.\nThey wouldn't even know, he told himself, squirming through the\nemergency exit into the engine room, and sealing it after him. And they\nwouldn't understand if they did. Pink mist swirled about him. Toxia\ngas. Shano coughed.\nHe squinted around at the massive, incomprehensible machinery. The guts\nof the space ship.\nThen he saw the shattered, gold-gleaming cylinder, gas hissing from\na fine nozzle, and filaments glowing bluish inside it, still working\naway. He saw five heavy Carrsteel rods hanging useless, on melted-down\npins, and the slots their pronged ends hooked into. He looked at his\nhands, and shook his head.\n\"One try,\" he said to himself. \"One try, Shano. One important thing in\nyour life. Here's your opportunity. The toxia gas will get you. It'll\nkill you at this concentration. But you'll last for maybe twelve hours.\nAnother man wouldn't last a minute. Another man's lungs aren't clogged\nwith Juno gum.\"\nHe grasped a rod and lifted it, sweating under the weight, and slipped\nthe forked end into its slot. Going home to die, he thought. Well,\nmaybe not going home. Couldn't remember what Earth looked like anyway.\nWhat was that again? Oh yeah\u2014just lift them up, and when they drop\noff, lift them up again.\nShano coughed, and lifted the heavy rods into position. One jerked back\nsuddenly and smoothly, and something went, \"Pop, pop,\" behind him and\nmachinery whirred. He lifted the rod and slipped it back on. Another\njerked, pulled open a large valve, and dropped off. Shano bent, and\nlifted, coughing and coughing. He forgot what he was doing, mind blank\nthe way it went when he worked. Just rhythmically fell into the job,\nthe way a laborer does. He waited for a rod to slip and fall, then\nlifted it up and slipped it in place, skin sweating, joints shooting\npain along his limbs. He heard the machinery working. He heard the\nhigh, howling whine of cosmic jets. He, Shano, was making the machinery\ngo. He was running the cosmic drive.\nA bell clanged somewhere. \"Engine room! Engine room! We're under way!\nWhat happened?\"\nSilence, while Shano coughed and made the machinery go, thinking about\nthe Earth he hadn't seen for many years.\n\"Captain!\" the speaker bawled. \"There's a man in there! Working the\nvalve rods! Somebody is in the engine room and the gas isn't....\"\nShano grinned, feeling good. Feeling happy. Lifting the heavy steel\nrods, driving the ship. Keeping the jets screaming and hurtling the\nliner\nStardust\ntoward Venus. He wondered if they'd found Rourke yet.\nIf he could keep going for twelve hours they would get to Venus. After\nthat....\n\"Home,\" he coughed. \"Hell! Who wants to go home?\"\nHe plucked at his agitated chest, thinking of a whole damn Uranian\nfleet swooping down on a spot in space, expecting to find a crippled\nship there with a spy inside it. And finding nothing. Because of Shano.\nA useless old man.\nCoughing came out all mixed up with laughing.\n", "summary": "The story begins with the captain of the spaceship, Shano, explaining to the passengers that there is a problem with the ship, and that they are being attacked by the enemy, the U.S. Space Patrol. The ship is headed to Venus and Earth, and the captain has ordered all passengers to board at their own risk. The captain explains that the ship is a suicide run, a coffin ship, which is illegal, and there is no way for the passengers to get off the ship. Shano agrees to board the ship at the earliest possible moment, and he is told that he is to stay on the ship for ten minutes, and then he will be escorted to the emergency oxygen room. The story then moves to the control room, where Shano is informed that the captain is hurt, and they have to find a way to get him back to Earth. They go to the engine room, and Shano notices that the air quality is very bad. The room is very hot, but cool, so he uses a lighter to cool down the room. Inside, he sees an indistinct figure with a beard, and it turns out to be the ship's engineer, Taggart. He tells Shano that he has been working on this ship for a long time, and has a reputation for being a daredevil.   Shano tries to escape the room, but the room is locked, so the ship has to be towed back to the airlock. He uses a knife to cut through the door, but it doesn't work. He is able to get through, and escapes the room with his hands. He finds himself in the emergency airlock, but he is unable to breathe. He hears a scream from the other side of the door. He tries to run, but his hands get burned by the heat, and his body is freezing cold. He realizes that he must have been in the room for a while, and runs out of air. He wakes up in a hospital bed, where he finds a doctor, who tells him that he had been in a fight with the enemy. The doctor also tells him about the rumors about the man who cut himself, and sold himself to the Uranians. The man died of lung-rot, and had to be buried alive. The doctors tell him that the man had been working in the mines of Uranus for years, and now he is a spy for the Uranian government. He wants to help Shano escape, but Shano refuses. The Doctor tells him to stay with the Captain, who is the only one who might be able to help him, and tell him what to do.  The story ends with Shano in a room with the doctor, where the doctor tells him he is going to die.", "faithfulness": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}
