gynecological cytology , including conventional fine needle aspiration cytology ( fnac ) , guided fnac and fluid cytology . the thin - prep ( tp ) smears were consistently devoid of obscuring elements and the cells were adequately preserved and evenly dispersed . pitfalls noticed as cytomorphologic alterations in lbcs are small - sized cell clusters , with more single cells than sheets . the cells are generally smaller , occasionally show spindling , chromatin detail is attenuated , nucleoli are more prominent , intranuclear inclusion is difficult to visualize , decrease of extracellular particles is seen , there is a decrease in the number of small mononuclear cells / red blood cells / myoepithelial cells and the background matrix is altered . the pathologist should be cautious in interpreting fine needle aspirations prepared using tp if that is the only methodology employed . the advantages of lbc , independent of diagnostic accuracy and morphology , have been well described . although studies on lbc are documented for breast , non - gynecological specimen , thyroid , salivary gland and soft tissues , the authors supplemented bone lesions to all the above in their study . lbc in fnac smears can be performed on aspirates from different organs like salivary gland , thyroid , lymph nodes , breast , bone and soft tissue and other usual and guided fnac samples . processing of the samples is carried out using the tp kit , marketed by cytec corporation , malborough , ma , usa . in a comparison study , usually two passes are made . the first pass is performed for the conventional preparation ( cp ) and the second pass is for the tp preparation . tp smears are superior to cp smears in fnac ; this fact can be proved by performing a wilcoxon 's signed rank test , p value < 0.001 . tp preparations are nowadays used in some sophisticated investigations like immunohistochemistry studies in breast lesions , non - hodgkin 's lymphoma ( nhl ) and hodgkin 's lymphoma ( hl ) in effusions , analysis of proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( pcna ) , cell blocks from scraping of cytosmears and comparison with conventional cell blocks .", "the aim of our study was to determine the efficacy of lbc technology over conventional smear methods in fnac samples . the study was performed on patients attending the cytology outpatient department ( opd ) of the hospital over a period of 2 years . , samples were processed using the liquiprep processing kit and a special kit marketed by cytec corporation . processing was performed manually in three steps , i.e. collection , concentration and cellular encapsulation . the lp cytology processing kit contains a preservative solution and a cellular base . using the lbc processing kit , , the samples were pushed into a preservative solution , approximately three - times the volume of the sample , and left as such for at least 1 h. this is followed by the next step , i.e. concentration , where the preserved sample is centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min . for cystic fluids , the supernatant fluid is discarded and , after adding the cleaning solution , it is again centrifuged for 15 min to increase its concentration . a pellet is produced , the supernatant fluid is discarded and a base solution of about 50 microl is added to the pellet to make a thin , homogenous suspension . this suspension was placed on an ethanol - cleaned glass slide and two circular smears of 1 cm diameter were made . the second option , which uses a cellular base solution , was used in certain cases , particularly if the sample contains necrotic substance or mucin . about 4 ml of cleansing solution was used in selected cases , along with the preservative solution , and the processing was performed in a similar fashion . two passes were performed , the first pass was for cp and the second pass yielded material for the tp preparation , which was processed by the tp kit marketed by cytcec corporation . different stains were used for staining the cp and lp smears , like he , pap and diff quick . the representative cs and lb preparations were compared by a semiquantitative scoring system using several criteria [ table 1 ] . the concentration method used in the procedure was useful in the diagnosis of cystic lesions like aneurysmal bone cysts , warthin 's tumor of salivary glands and metastatic carcinoma . statistical analysis was performed using the wilcoxon signed rank test on the spss program ( chicago , il , usa ) . every cytological diagnosis was recorded and tabulated and compiled to yield the p - value .", "a total of 110 cases were studied , which were distributed among 30 cases of breast ( 10 fibroadenoma , four mastitis and 12 ductal carcinoma ) , 40 cases of lymph node ( 20 reactive hyperplasia , 12 granulomatous lymphadenitis , three lymphoma and five metastatic carcinoma ) , 10 cases of salivary gland ( two sialadenitis , five mixed tumor , one warthin 's tumor and two mucoepidermoid carcinoma ) , 18 cases of thyroid ( 10 colloid goiter , four thyroiditis and four carcinoma cases ) and 12 cases of soft tissue and bone lesions ( five benign and seven malignant ) . comparison between cytological features in lbc and cs was carried out using the wilcoxon signed rank test separately for each organ in a tabular form , as shown in table 2 . in our study , in two cases of pleomorphic adenoma , one case of warthin 's tumor and two cases of colloid goiter , a support of cs was needed due to pitfalls in lbc described above . wilcoxon signed rank test statistics of lbc versus cp for breast cases , fibroadenoma , mastitis and ductal carcinoma were better diagnosed on lbc preparations due to clarity of the nuclear features [ figure 1 ] . comparison data for lymph nodes suggested that the rs cells were more easily diagnosed on lbc smears due to monolayering . liquiprep cytosmear of the breast showing pleomorphic - looking ductal epithelial cells in a cluster and acinar pattern in a clear background in case of salivary gland lesions , the mixed salivary tumor was better visualized in the conventional smear because of preservation of the stromal component . cystic neoplasms of the salivary glands were better appreciated in lbc smears because of concentration . in sialoadenitis , lbcs were not very useful in goiter and infectious lesions , but they proved very useful in neoplastic lesions [ figure 2 ] . in lytic bone lesions like aneurismal bone cyst ( abc ) , giant cell tumor ( gct ) and metastasis , liquiprep cytosmear showing papillary carcinoma of the thyroid in a clear background with nuclear grooving the study conducted by mygdakos et al .", "lbc was favored over cs for evaluating gynecological specimens , which was approved by the fda in 1996 . thereafter , lbc has been found to be useful in non - gynecological cytologic specimens like fnac and body fluids , both small and large volume , which have drawn variable conclusions . in conventional fnac smears , cells are admixed with debris , blood and exudates , which make the interpretation difficult . there is suboptimal preservation of cells and cellular obscuring by unwanted material , leading to a high proportion of cases reported as inadequate or unsatisfactory for assessment . to overcome this problem , the lbc technique was introduced , which preserves cells in a liquid medium and removes all debris , blood and exudates , either by filtration or density gradient interpretation , there is even distribution of cell material , lack of obscuring factors , no drying artifact and monolayering . in our study , fnac was performed from various sites like breast , lymph node , salivary glands , thyroid and bone and soft tissue . in fibroadenoma breasts , although stromal fragments were lost , lbc proved to be useful in the diagnosis based on visualization of ductal aggregates and bipolar cells . for duct carcinomas , the wilcoxon signed ranked test for thyroid lesions [ table 2 ] , lbc was not useful in goiter and infectious lesions . lbc was not useful in cystic neoplasms like warthin 's tumor , mucoepidermoid and adenoid cystic carcinoma and comparable to the study by parfitt et al . for bone and soft tissues , good results were obtained in lbc because of background clearing and concentration phenomenon . in all lesions of the lymph node , lbc proved to be a better option . because of the pitfalls of lbc , as described above , in some selected cases of granulomatous lymphadenitis ( lacking epitheloid cells ) , mucinous tumors ( lack of mucin ) , colloid goiter ( thin colloid fragmented ) and pleomorphic adenomas of the salivary gland ( myxoid background poor and present in droplets ) , a support on cs may prove useful . as observed by the authors , lbc of bony lesions do not require support of cs .", "tp preparations are superior to cps with regard to clear background , monolayer cell preparation and cell preservation . it is easier and less time consuming to screen and interpret tp preparations because the cells are limited to smaller areas on clear backgrounds , with excellent cellular preservation . however , tp preparations are more expensive than cp and require some experience for interpretation . lbc is strongly advocated in the best interest of public health , by improving the quality of the sample and reducing the likelihood of false - negative cytology results ."], "summary": "background : liquid - based cytology ( lbc ) is fast becoming a useful method in evaluating both gynecological and non - gynecological preparations , including fine needle aspiration ( fna ) cytology . even distribution of cells , decreasing obscuring background elements like blood and mucus , well preserved nuclear and cytoplasmic details and rapid fixation helps in better visualization of cells.aim:this study was conducted to asses the diagnostic accuracy of liquid  based cytology versus conventional smears in fine needle aspiration samples.study design : in this prospective study , we had 110 cases , including 30 cases of breast , 40 of lymph node , 10 of salivary glands , 18 of thyroid and 12 of bone and soft tissue . in each case , two passes were performed . the first pass was for conventional preparation ( cp ) and the second pass yielded material for thin - prep ( tp ) preparation . both cp and tp smears were compared for cellularity , background blood and necrotic cell debris , cell architecture , informative background , presence of a monolayer of cells and nuclear and cytoplasmic details by a semiquantitative scoring system . wilcoxon 's signed rank test on an spss program was used for statistical analysis.results:diagnostic accuracy was better in lbc smears compared with cp smears due to lack of background debris and better cell morphology , which was performed according to wilcoxon 's signed rank test , yielding a p - value of < 0.001 . however , in some cases , because of a decrease in cell size , clustering and altered background in lbc , a support of cp was essential.conclusion:lbc performed on fna samples can be a simple and valuable technique . only in few selected cases , where background factor is an essential diagnostic clue , a combination of both cp and tp is necessary .", "ranking": [0, 3, 1, 2, 4]}
{"id": "PMC4709816", "section_names": ["I", "M", "R", "D", "C"], "document": ["studies have reported that men are more prone to diseases and have a higher mortality rate than women . previous investigations have shown that men adopt more inappropriate lifestyle choices , are less concerned about their health , ignore the warning signs of the disease , and also have late referral to medical centers compared with women . according to the official census published by american cancer society , prostate cancer was reported as the second leading cause of cancer death among american men after lung cancer and its incidence ranked the first among all cancers in 2013 . however , in iran , the rate of deaths from prostate cancer is found relatively higher than other types of cancers . remarkably , with 1309 deaths in 2013 , its mortality rate was estimated as 3.85 per 100.000 men in the same year . according to statistical surveys , this was higher than that of esophageal and laryngeal cancer but lower than that of gastric , lung and bronchial cancer . based on the published statistics , its age - standardized incidence rate in iran during 2003 to 2008 was reported as 4.69 , 7.16 , 14.04 , 16.65 , and 16.02 per 100,000 men , respectively , indicating an increasing trend of the disease in iran during the mentioned years . prostate cancer is fully and definitely treatable if diagnosed and detected early before the metastasis of the disease . since such a cancer is often asymptomatic , it is diagnosed after its progress to the later stage that is incurable . at this stage , it has no definite treatment , so the mortality rate increases . in 2013 , the american cancer society recommended that men aged older than 50 should be aware about screening for early prostate cancer detection and those who are at risk of developing the disease should receive information about such screening at earlier ages . ethnicity , a family history of the disease , age and obesity are known as the risk factors of this cancer . despite being asymptomatic digital rectal examination ( dre ) and prostatic - specific antigen ( psa ) are routine testing techniques for early prostate cancer diagnosis . transrectal ultrasound ( trus- guided prostate biopsy is also another most commonly used method of diagnosing the disease . furthermore , prevention and early detection of cancer are considered as critical factors in controlling the disease and increasing the survival of patients . therefore , the importance of public health education should be emphasized in developing countries where people have inadequate information about screening methods . various studies have shown that men with higher levels of knowledge show higher tendency towards such screening . when counseling and education is done based on a specific protocol health belief model ( hbm ) has been widely used to measure the health beliefs and behaviors about cancer screening . the perceived susceptibility , severity , benefits , and barriers are four main components of the hbm . behavior was explained by the hbm as ensuing from the combination of attitudes associated with four concepts . perceived severity : feelings concerning the seriousness of acquiring a sickness or of leaving it untreated embody evaluations of each medical and clinical consequence ( for example , death , disability , and pain ) and potential social consequences ( such as effects of the work , domestic life , and social relations ) . perceived benefits focus on the effectiveness of healthy behavior in reducing the threat of the condition . perceived barriers is the potential negative aspects of a particular health behavior , a kind of unconscious , cost - benefit analysis occurring when the individuals know the perceived barriers are more costly than the perceived benefits ; then , they take action to do screening . for example , these barriers can be expensive , time consuming , unpleasant , painful or upsetting . in addition to the four original concepts , health motivation has also been used as part of the hbm in predicting health related behavior . health motivation refers to a generalized state of intent that results in behaviors to maintain or improve health . the concept of health motivation used in combination with the original four hbm concepts has evidence of significant predictive ability . therefore , in this study we used hbm focusing on prevention as a reference framework . currently , there is a lack of consideration towards men s health , especially the middle - aged and elderly ones . due to the increasing number of cases with prostate cancer reported by clinical specialists , which are caused by the late referral of the patients , we aimed to investigate the effect of hbm - based education with the purpose of increasing knowledge and the health belief about prostate cancer and prostate cancer screening behaviors .", "this study was approved by the ethics committee of shiraz university of medical sciences ( ethics committee approval number : ct-92 - 6721 ) . in this non - blinded randomized controlled trial , 210 men aged we selected our participants from the population of men who were retired from shiraz department of education , using a simple random sampling method . the researcher referred to the list of the males retired from shiraz education department , using table of random numbers . their positive and broader insights towards research projects could facilitate easy accessibility to them for further follow - ups and evaluation of the results . shiraz general department of retirement affairs was chosen as research setting due to the large number of referrals for welfare and administrative affairs . the sample size was calculated as 105 in each group based on the data of similar studies and using power ssc statistical software ( power : 80% ,  : 0.05 , mean difference : 1.6 , loss rate=20% and sd : 3.2 ) . quadri- balanced block randomization method was used to randomize the participants into intervention and control groups . in this study therefore , we used two variables , a and b , for them , respectively . by taking two variables a and b in quaternary blocks , six modes of movement were possible . according to the sample size ( 210 ) then , the blocks were randomly written on paper and the researcher referred to the list of men and placed them in the blocks . afterwards , 30 men were excluded due to their withdrawal from participation in the study , so the number of final participants was 93 and 87 in the intervention and control groups , respectively ( figure 1 ) . consort flow diagram of participants inclusion criteria were willingness to participate in the study , giving written informed consent , no history of prostate cancer and prostatic hyperplasia with obvious clinical symptoms , age of 50 to 70 years , and lack of severe vision and hearing impairment . however , exclusion criteria were absence in training sessions and participation in similar training courses . after explaining the aims of the study , written informed consent was obtained from all the participants and their anonymity and confidentiality were guaranteed . data were collected by the researcher and a trained research assistant through face to face interview by using three different questionnaires including demographic questionnaire , prostate cancer screening- health belief model scale ( pcs - hbm ) and the knowledge prostate cancer screening questionnaire . the demographic questionnaire was developed by the researcher ; it included 13 questions about demographic characteristics of the participants . the questionnaire provided information about age , marital status , educational level and monthly income , history of prostate cancer and prostatic hyperplasia with obvious clinical symptoms , history of undergoing prostate cancer screening using dre and psa testing , a family history of the mentioned cancer , knowledge about the disease as well as the methods of acquiring knowledge about it for researcher . scores ranged from 0 to 12 with higher scores reflecting a higher level of knowledge . scores lower than 7 , 7 - 9 and 10 - 12 were considered as low , intermediate , and good , respectively . prostate cancer screening - health belief model scale ( pcs - hbm)which was designed by capik and gozum ( 2011 ) included 41 items with a 5 point likert scale anchored at 1=completely disagree and 5=completely agree . the scale consisted of 41 questions and 5 sub - scales including perceived susceptibility ( 5 items ) , perceived severity ( 5 items ) , health motivations ( 10 items ) , perceived barriers ( 15 items ) , and perceived benefits ( 7 items ) . an increase in the scores for the sub - scales of susceptibility , severity , motivation and benefit and a decrease in the score for the sub - scale of barriers reflected the positive effect of the intervention . pcs - hbm and prostate cancer screening knowledge questionnaire were translated in persian using back translation technique , which includes the use of a panel of experts and interpreters to translate the items from the source language to the target language and then they were back - translated to the source language . then , some changes were made to adapt this instrument to iranian culture . after performing a pilot study on 30 men retired from shiraz department of education , the reliability coefficient for pcs - hbm and prostate cancer screening knowledge questionnaires was calculated , using cronbach alpha and kuder richardson 20technique . after analyzing the data , kuder richardson 20 coefficient was calculated as 0.98 for the knowledge prostate cancer screening questionnaire and cronbach s alpha was calculated as 0.83 for pcs - hbm questionnaire . to assess the prostate cancer screening behaviors of men in the intervention group , they were given referral forms for free consultation with a urologist and prostate cancer screening . subsequently , the participation rate of men , who had not been screened within the last year , was examined one and three months after the intervention . afterwards , the participants of the intervention group attended training workshops consisting of two four - hour sessions for two days , in groups of 15 participants . the educational program was designed based on pre - test results and structures of health belief model . educational intervention was performed in the intervention group through lecture , group discussion with questions and answers , and brain storming . the learning process was facilitated by teaching aids , such as videos , photos and booklets . in the first session , first lecture method was employed due to little information in most of the subjects to make them familiar with prostate cancer , its anatomy , physiology , functions of prostate gland , pathology , and effective risk factors . then , we used perceived susceptibility structure , talked about the incidence and prevalence rate of prostate cancer in iran and the world , signs and symptom of prostate cancer , and the current treatment modalities of prostate cancer . then , with regard to adults education theory which considered free discussion as a necessary part of education , the subjects held group discussion . then , by considering the perceived severity , those whose parents , relatives or a close friend had died as a result of prostate cancer were invited to talk about the severity of the complications of prostate cancer as someone who had experienced it . finally , the complications of the lack of health , especially low levels of primary and secondary prevention , were discussed by the participants . in the second session , first lecture method was employed due to low level of information in most of the subjects to make them familiar with methods of prostate cancer screening . the subjects had group discussion on benefits and advantages of prostate cancer screening in prevention of prostate cancer , treatability of prostate cancer in the early stage , and cost efficacy of prostate cancer prevention . in order to help the subjects to brain storm in education , all the inhibiting obstacles in unimportant subjects complications of diagnosis of prostate cancer and positive predictive value(ppv ) and negative predictive value ( npv ) of psa test were indicated and related strategies were mentioned . then , the clients discussed about the ear of prostate cancer screening . the men participating in the control group received no planned educational program , but the intervention sessions were offered to this group after the study was completed . statistical qualitative tests , analysis of covariance ( ancova ) , chi - square , independent and paired t - test were used as appropriate .", "the age range of the participants was 50 - 70 years and their meansd age was 58.14.8 and 56.85.3 in the intervention and control groups , respectively . independent t - test showed no significant difference between the two groups with respect to their age p=0.08 . there was a significant difference between the groups in terms of educational level and monthly income ; those in the intervention group had a higher educational level and income compared of the participants in the control group ( p>0.05 ) . regarding the randomized allocation of the participants , the results of ancova showed that the significant difference found between the groups in terms of income and educational level had no compounding effect on the study . the rate of the participants who had no family history of prostate cancer and no experience of undergoing dre and psa testing for prostate cancer screening was reported 87.2% , 95.6% and 85.6% , respectively . 86.1% of the men had no knowledge about such screening ; however , the other respondents knew about it and reported television ( 48% ) , magazines and newspapers ( 20% ) , a family member with the same disease ( 12% ) , radio ( 8% ) , physicians ( 8% ) , and friends ( 4% ) as their source of knowledge . according to table 1 which compares the knowledge level between the intervention and control groups before and after the intervention , 95.7% of the men in the intervention group were at low and intermediate levels before the intervention , while their levels improved to intermediate and good after the intervention nevertheless , we observed no significant changes in the control group in this regard ( table 1 ) . comparison of knowledge level between the intervention and control groups before and after the intervention paired t - test showed a statistically significant difference in the mean score of hbm components in the intervention group after being compared with that before the intervention ( p>0.05 ) . in the control group , such difference was reported only for perceived susceptibility ( p>0.05 ) , while there was no statistically significant difference in the mean scores of perceived severity , barriers , benefits , and motivation ( p>0.05 ) . independent t - test revealed a statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups with respect to the mean scores of the perceived susceptibility , severity , barriers and benefits after the intervention ( p>0.05 ) compared with before it ( p>0.05 ) . the results of the data analysis showed a statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups regarding the mean scores of knowledge and motivation before the intervention ( p>0.05 ) . to reach a more accurate result ( to control the significance effect of the mean scores of knowledge and hbm components in the intervention and control groups before the intervention ) , the mean difference scores were compared after the intervention . according to the result of independent t - test , a statistically significant difference was observed between the groups with respect to the mean scores of all hbm components after the intervention ( p<0.001 ) ( table 2 ) . comparison of the mean score ( sd ) of hbm components and knowledge between the intervention and control groups paired t - test indicated a significant difference in the mean score of knowledge in the intervention group after the intervention compared with before it ( p<0.001 ) , while no significant differences ( despite a slight change ) were observed in the control group ( p=0.808 ) . the participation rate of men in screening before the intervention , one month and three months after the intervention is shown in table 3 .", "the primary objective of this study was to increase participation in the screening and for this aim education based on the health belief model was implemented ; then , we investigated the levels of knowledge , scores of the health belief components about prostate cancer , and the rate of participating retired men in prostate cancer screening . 86.1% of the retired men in this study had no knowledge about prostate cancer screening . similarly , in a study which was conducted in north florida , 0.83% african american men had some knowledge about prostate cancer screening and 17% did not have any knowledge about it . another study also indicated that 58% of male new yorkers were aware of prostate cancer screening in 2000 . in our study and another study in iran , ( 2007 ) was 67% ; allen et al.s study ( 2010 ) reported 44% ; and in sheridan ( 2012 ) it was reported 59% . comparison of the results of these studies with those of our study indicates a low level of awareness about prostate cancer screening and low participation rate in prostate cancer screening among iranian men . our findings were consistent with other studies indicating the significant increase of individuals knowledge level about prostate cancer after the intervention . a study which was done in turkey with this tool did not find a significant difference in the level of knowledge in men after an educational intervention by the web . therefore , it can be concluded that for 50 to 70 year old men , face to face training and the group training could be more effective . in another study , it was confirmed that print arm is more effective than web arm and usual care to improve knowledge and reduce decisional conflicts about prostate cancer screening . all the aforementioned studies confirmed the importance of education and its effects on promoting the level of the individuals knowledge . we also observed a significant increase in the mean score of perceived susceptibility in the intervention group following the educational intervention and such result was similar to other studies on prostate cancer screening , diabetes mellitus and breast self - examination . moreover , most of our participants believed that they might be at risk of prostate cancer . perceived susceptibility  could be the most powerful factor in predicting the behaviors . as to the perceived susceptibility , the belief that the disease can occur without any symptoms leads to initiation of screening behaviors . in our study , the mean score of such a component increased in the control group . bakhtariaghdam et al . also reached a similar result and suggested it could be due to the fact that taking the pre - test had made the respondents sensitive to the subject . however , ghaffari et al . believed that it resulted from the curiosity of the participants in the control group to evaluate and complete the questionnaire at the pre - test stage . similarly , we can conclude that such increase lies in the curiosity of the participants to find out more about the disease and increase their knowledge about it during the interval between pre - test and post - test phases which makes them sensitive to the subjects discussed in the questionnaire . reminding our participants of serious complications and the chronic nature of prostate cancer and considering loss of health and the problems caused by such disease as well as high costs of treatment have been important factors which led to improvement of their level of perceived severity . several investigations showed that evaluation of clinical outcomes by the individuals could also affect this component . moreover , we found a significant difference between the two groups after the intervention in terms of perceived severity . this finding was in agreement with other studies on the effect of hbm - based education on osteoporosis preventive behaviors and breast self - examination . furthermore , independent t - test showed a statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups with respect to the mean score of perceived benefits after the intervention . other researchers found similar results in examining the effect of hbm - based educational program on urinary tract infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome preventive behaviors . we believe that medical and health care staff should constantly consult with men about the risk of prostate cancer progression and benefits of screening . men should also talk with the staff about their fears and obstacles which prevent them from participating in screening programs as it can increase their responsibility for their own health . there are two factors which can facilitate the men s participation in prostate cancer screening : \n 1-the belief that dre and psa tests help diagnose the disease before the appearance of symptoms.2-the belief that early diagnosis and treatment can improve the prognosis of the disease . \n  the belief that dre and psa tests help diagnose the disease before the appearance of symptoms . the belief that early diagnosis and treatment can improve the prognosis of the disease . in the incidence of preventive behaviors , perceived barriers are directly associated with early diagnosis and participation in prostate cancer screening , while education can remove such barriers and make men take action for early detection of the disease . according to both retrospective and prospective studies ,  perceived barriers  is found to be the most powerful dimension of hbm in the expression and prediction of health protective behaviors . we observed a significant difference between the groups regarding the mean score of  perceived barriers  . likewise , other researchers found a significant decrease in the dimension of  perceived barriers  after hbm - based educational intervention in their studies on prostate cancer screening and nutritional behaviors associated with gastric cancer . moreover , we tried to decrease the barriers significantly by increasing the participants knowledge through education and providing free screening and consulting with a urologist . according to the results , the mean scores of health motivation appeared as significantly different between the groups . our finding was similar to that of capk and gzm who found an increase in the motivation mean score ; however , such increase was not statistically significant . insignificant increase of motivation could be attributed to the participants low levels of knowledge and lack of sufficient information about prostate cancer and screening . therefore , the significant increase of motivation in our study could be due to the proper knowledge level in the intervention group after training sessions and the efficiency of our educational intervention compared with internet and web - based education for men aged over 50 . capk and gzm reported that the rate of participation in the screening increased after the educational intervention . furthermore , another study indicated that 48% of the participants who had not been screened within the last year were referred for screening again . similarly , weinrich et al . observed that 71.8% of those in the intervention group participated in free screening due to educational intervention . we found out that the participation rate in such screening increased from 7.5% to 24% and 43.3% one month and three months after the intervention , respectively . finally , we observed that 36 men , who had not been screened within the last year , participated in prostate cancer screening . one limitation of the present study was the post - test one month after the intervention . therefore , assessing information in several time intervals after the interventions is recommended in order to examine the long - term effects of interventions on prostate cancer screening behaviors and participation in decision - making regarding the subject . it is also recommended that the follow - up periods of screening should be increased to one year . further investigations are also required to find out the most important potential barriers to prostate cancer screening in iran . another limitation of this study was selecting the samples from among a particular group of people such as teachers . it appears that the level of education and knowledge is so much higher than the general population . it is recommended that in future studies samples should be chosen from various groups of people such as rural ones to obtain more generalizable results .", "our findings showed that the health education programs designed based on hbm could positively affect the prostate cancer preventive behaviors of our retired participants by improving their knowledge level and hbm components . hence , we could confirm the efficacy of hbm in adopting the prostate cancer screening behaviors by the participants . since this type of cancer is treatable in early stages , more attention should be paid to the educational design and planning based on educational theories and models so that we could increase the required knowledge about prostate cancer for early diagnosis and treatment of the disease ."], "summary": "background : prostate cancer has been reported as the second leading cause of cancer death among men in 2013 . prevention and early detection of cancer are considered as critical factors in controlling the disease and increasing the survival of patients . therefore , we aimed to investigate the effect of health belief model ( hbm)-based education on knowledge and prostate cancer screening behaviors in a randomized controlled trial.methods:this study was a non -

while 4 ( 26.6% ) had combined deficiency of both . bone marrow examinations were available in all 15 patients and revealed moderate to severe megaloblastosis . initially , all the patients were started on empirical broad spectrum intravenous ( iv ) antibiotic treatment . eleven ( 73% ) of them responded to this approach and showed a decrease in temperature levels . however , 4 ( 26.6% ) continued to remain febrile . in these patients , antibiotics were stopped , and vitamin b12 and folate supplementation was started . all of these 4 patients showed symptomatic improvement within 48 h along with the improvement in hematological parameters by the 7 day . further improvement in hemoglobin , mcv , and other hematological parameters were seen on follow - up . table 3 describes the clinical and investigation findings in 4 patients who showed improvement with vitamin b12 and folate administration . most of these patients were females with low - grade fever lasting for the duration of > 2 weeks . three of the patients had combined deficiency of b12 and folate while 1 had isolated folate deficiency .", "as observed in our study , infection continues to be the most common cause of fever in patients of megaloblastic anemia . this is evidenced by the fact that 73% of our patients showed improvement on administration of broad spectrum iv antibiotics . this was despite the fact that no obvious focus of infection could be found in them , even after extensive investigations . it has been suggested that patients of megaloblastic anemia are more susceptible to infection due to impaired intracellular killing of ingested bacteria by the neutrophils and macrophages . the metabolic activation is reduced by 3536% in the leukocytes that are deficient in b12 ( but not so with folate deficiency ) . hence , bacterial killing is reduced and abnormal ; and it is reverted after specific therapy . however , 4 of our patients ( 26.6% ) showed no improvement with antibiotics but showed marked improvement within 48 h on administration of vitamin b12 and folate . this shows that though it is rare to find megaloblastic anemia as the sole cause of fever , it still remains an important and often overlooked cause of the same . such cases are often treated as cases of puo , and precious time and money is wasted on their management . as per the modified petersdorf criteria , fuo is defined as : a temperature exceeding 38.3c duration of the fever of more than 3 weeks and evaluation of three outpatient visits or 3 days in hospital . on the review of literature for causes of puo we found in our study that most of the patients had low - grade fever with temperature < 100 f. the temperature was > 102 f in only 3 of the 15 patients ( 20% ) . furthermore , it was observed that most of the patients who presented with megaloblastic anemia being the sole cause of fever ; had a longer duration of disease , more severe anemia and higher values of mcv . it has been suggested that since megaloblastic anemia is a panmyelosis , characterized by hypercellular marrow and ineffective hematopoiesis , premature destruction of hematopoietic precursors could possibly release intracellular substances which might function as systemic pyrogens . alternatively , studies have proposed that defective oxygenation at the thermoregulatory center of the hypothalamus might be the explanation for pyrexia . however , lack of correlation between neurological manifestation and pyrexia in megaloblastic disease negates this theory . to confound matters even further , few studies have shown that a rise in temperature might cause depletion of folate stores , both in red blood cells and serum , leading to disturbances in folate metabolism . hence , whether pyrexia is a cause or effect of folate deficiency remains to be fully understood . although the reason behind it remains unclear , the association of fever with megaloblastic anemia remains a well - documented phenomenon . further studies on bone marrow microenvironment and role of cytokine signaling in these cases would help in discovering the cause in the future .", "we conclude that though infection remains to be the most common cause of pyrexia in patients of megaloblastic anemia , few cases also show a causal relationship between the two . hence , measurement of b12 and folate levels should be advised in all patients presenting with fever without any obvious cause . the correct identification of b12/folate deficiency being the cause of fever ( after all other causes have been ruled out ) , would help in adequate and timely management of the patient and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics ."], "summary": "objectivethe objective was to study megaloblastic anemia as a cause of pyrexia of unknown origin ( puo).materials and methodswe conducted a study on 15 patients of megaloblastic anemia associated with fever , attending our hospital clinics over a period of 6 months.resultswhile 11 patients had symptoms suggesting foci of infection and responded well to intravenous antibiotics , 4 patients had neither any evidence of infection nor responded with empirical broad spectrum antibiotic treatment . they were treated with vitamin b12/folate therapy which led to marked improvement in fever within 48 h. presenting complaints of the patients and severity / duration of fever along with other epidemiological data were also studied in each case.conclusionthe present study led us to conclude that megaloblastic anemia forms an important and reversible cause of fever and should be ruled out in all patients presenting with puo . this knowledge would help the physicians in adequate and timely management of these patients .", "ranking": [4, 0, 3, 1, 2]}

eight straight , single - rooted , human maxillary central incisors and canines were selected for this study . the teeth were placed in 1.23% chlorhexidine for 2 hours and then stored in 0.9% saline solution at room temperature until use . the roots did not display cracks , caries , resorption , or canal calcification and had closed apices . the crowns of the teeth were cut at the cementoenamel junction using a low -

cured composite resin ( filtek p60 , 3 m espe , usa ) to a height of 4 mm . then , the specimens were subjected to 2500 thermal cycles between 55c and 5c using a digital thermocycling machine ( willytec / sd , mechatronik gmbh , munich , germany ) , with a dwell time of 60 seconds and a transition time of 15 seconds . for cyclic loading procedure , in each group , half of the prepared teeth ( n=6 ) were mounted in acrylic blocks at an angle of 45 and were placed in a universal testing machine ( zwickroll , z050 , zwick gmbh , ulm , germany ) for mechanical cycling . the upper rod of the cycling machine could apply load pulses from 15 n to 45 n at a frequency of 3 hz onto the core buildup . during cycling , the teeth were irrigated with water at 37c , as regulated by a thermostat . the specimens were cycled 100000 times at a crosshead speed of 1 mm / min . the other teeth from each group , which were not subjected to cyclic loading , were stored in distilled water until load cycling was completed . each root was sectioned perpendicular to its long axis from the coronal to the apical direction under water cooling using a high - speed machine ( meccatom t201a ; persi co. , france ) . two slices , each 1-mm thick , were obtained from the root apical and cervical regions and 4 slices were finally prepared from each root . the thickness of each slice was measured by a digital gauge ( mitutoyo cd15 , mitutoyo co. , kawasaki , japan ) . for each final slice , push - out bond strength was performed using a universal testing machine ( zwickroll , z050 , ulm , germany ) at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm / min until failure occurred . push - out bond strength values were calculated in mpa by dividing this force by the bonded interface of the post segment , which was calculated with the following formula : \n a = n/2rhwhere  is 3.14 , r is the post radius , and h is the thickness of the slice in mm . after the push - out test , failure modes of the samples were assessed using a stereomicroscope ( nikon eclips e600 , tokyo , japan ) at 20 and recorded as follows : \n cohesive , if the fracture occurred in the post or dentinadhesive , if the fracture occurred at post  dentin interfacemixed , when a combination of adhesive and cohesive failure occurred cohesive , if the fracture occurred in the post or dentin adhesive , if the fracture occurred at post  dentin interface mixed , when a combination of adhesive and cohesive failure occurred data were analyzed using statistical software ( spss 13.0 , spss inc . ,", "mean and standard deviation of the studied groups for push - out bond strength are presented in table 1 . results of three - way anova indicated that bond strength of fiber post to root dentin was not affected by the factors of  mechanical cycling  ( p=0.549 ) ,  surface treatment of root canal dentin  ( p=0.279 ) and their interactions ( p=0.774 ) ; whereas ,  region of the root canal  as the main factor showed significant differences ( p=0.004 ) . push - out bond strength for cervical regions was higher in comparison with the apical regions ( p=0.004 ) . the interactions of mechanical cycling and region of the root canal and also surface treatment and region of the root canal was not significant ( p>.05 ) . the results showed that the adhesive failure was the most predominant mode of failure ( fig 1 ) . the results showed that the adhesive failure was the most predominant mode of failure ( fig 1 ) .", "in order to increase retention of fiber posts in the root canal , it is necessary to improve their clinical performance and long - term service . in vitro studies that simulate the clinical situations might be useful in this respect . to focus on these issues , the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of cyclic loading on the bond strength of quartz fiber posts to different regions of the root canal dentin after different surface treatments of the root canal dentin . the results indicated that mechanical cycling did not decrease the bond strength of quartz fiber posts to root canal dentin significantly , consistent with the results of studies focusing on stress distribution [ 1921 ] . this finding might be attributed to the better stress distribution of fiber posts due to similarity of their elastic modulus to root dentin . concluded that mechanical loading has no adverse effects on the adhesion between two fiber posts and root dentin . in contrast , the results of a study by galhano revealed that the bond strength of zirconium post to root dentin is compromised when specimens are subjected to cyclic loading . rigidity and high modulus of elasticity of zirconia posts concentrate stresses at the post - dentin interface . reported that flexibility of the post plays an important role in the bond strength of the post to root dentin after load cycling . the results of this study showed that chemical solvent application , phosphoric acid etching and treatment with ultrasound file did not significantly increase the bond strength of fiber posts to root dentin . pretreatment of root dentin with acid removes the smear layer and smear plug , opens dentinal tubules , demineralizes intertubular and peritubular dentin and exposes the collagen fibers . inter - diffusion zone forms on the etched dentin substrate by penetration of adhesive resins . however , the present study demonstrated that the bond strength did not significantly increase after treatment with phosphoric acid . .   demonstrated that application of phosphoric acid could significantly increase bond strength . an explanation could be that the applied bonding system and resin cement used in their study was different . application of a chemical solvent did not significantly increase the bond strength of fiber posts . conversely , demiryurek   et al . showed that the bond strength of fiber posts significantly increased after treatment with sikko tim ( chemical solvent ) . the chemical solvent removes the remnants of resin sealer and gutta - percha and increases the bond strength between the resin cement and dentin . in this study , treatment with ultrasound file did not significantly improve the bond strength . zang et al . demonstrated that ultrasonic agitation in combination with edta / naocl irrigation improved the push - out strength of the fiber post .   in their study , a chemical irrigant was applied in combination with ultrasonic agitation and this may explain the negative results . in addition , a previous study reported that treatment with ultrasound file increased the bond strength of fiber posts . a combination of etching and ultrasound file was applied in that study , while we used only ultrasound files . the results of push - out bond strength for different root regions in this study revealed that the bond strength was significantly affected by the region of the root canal . push - out bond strength for the cervical segments in this study was higher than that for the apical segments . an explanation for this could be low - density tubules and orientation of tubules in the apical regions of the root canal . a favorable handling in the cervical rather than the apical region leads to better achievements and higher bond strength . the results of the present study were consistent with the studies conducted by ohlmann et al .   and kalkan et al . it was found that adhesive fracture was the most common mode of failure , confirming that the weakest area was the post - dentin interface . in this study , the specimens were loaded 100000 cycles under 1545 n , representing the recorded occlusal forces during mastication and swallowing . in the present study , the push - out test was used for measuring the bond strength of the cemented fiber posts . application of the thin - slice design of specimens in this test provides uniform distribution of the stresses . in addition concluded that a push - out test is more accurate than a microtensile technique and there is a narrow spread for data distribution . moreover , in measuring the bond strength with the micro - tensile test , more premature failures occurred compared with the push - out test . it is necessary to carry out further studies to reinforce bond in post - cement - dentin interfaces . in this study , only various treatments on dentin surface with an adhesive system and a luting cement were evaluated ; it is recommended to assess different adhesive systems and luting cements .", "based on the results presented in this research , push -

aldosterone axis ( 10 ) . the treatment of csw syndrome is to maintain a positive sodium balance by supplying sufficient water and sodium ( 11 ) . the water and sodium supply was generally performed through an intravenous injection of 0.9% normal saline solution or 3% salt solution . at this time , the correction hyponatremia of needs to be done to the levels to prevent the occurrence of central pontine myelinolysis . the rate of injection of saline solution should be at 1 - 2 mmol / l per hour and must be monitored not to exceed 25 meq / l per day . occasionally , injection of a normal saline solution with loop diuretics like furosemide needs to be considered ( 7 ) . the two cases of this report developed hypotension and natriuresis after a cranial vault remodeling surgery and manifested polyuria ; however , any neurologic abnormalities such as reduced levels of consciousness were not observed in the cases . on the other hand , the first case showed an increase of the 24-hr urine amount up to 2,000 ml , a decrease of the central venous pressure down to 1 -

{"id": "PMC3571514", "section_names": ["INTRODUCTION", "METHODS & MATERIALS", "RESULTS", "DISCUSSION", "CONCLUSION"], "document": ["dual - polymerizing resin cements have been extensively used for placement of indirect restorations and posts . the dual - polymerizing materials were developed to compensate for the lack of polymerization in the absence of light and to represent a combination of auto- and light - polymerizing components . in some clinical situations , such as in dark zones at the apical region and during the cementation of indirect restorations , the severe light attenuation results in low degree of conversion ( dc ) , which can compromise the mechanical properties and consequently the longevity of the indirect restorations.14 modifications in the viscosity of the resin cements allow their use in different clinical situations . the option for low viscosity versions offer some benefits , such as minor thickness of the pellicle that was formed following the restoration placement . the lowest film thickness generates smaller polymerization shrinkage , reducing the possibility of gaps formation and premature marginal leakage.5,6 the difference in the cement formulations that change the viscosity is related to the proportion between resin matrix and filler particle content.7 high volume fraction of fillers can increase the viscosity and the elastic modulus and strength of composites.7,8 low viscosity or flowable resins and resin cements present lower filler loading than regular restorative materials . most direct dental restorative composites use bisphenol - a - diglycidylether dimethacrylate ( bis - gma ) , which is considered a very viscous monomer , and when mixed with higher filler loadings , it becomes a nearly solid mass and unusable product . vinyl groups ( e.g. , ethylene glycol dimethacrylate ) are added as a thinner or diluent monomer for uncured pastes , which are considered another approach to change the viscosity of resin - based materials . the filler loading and the viscosity of composites may interfere in the monomer conversion , since they could restrict the mobility of monomers and the propagation of polymerization reaction.7,911 the restorative resin - based materials must reach a high degree of monomer conversion in order to present better clinical performance and longevity and also to reduce the early failures . for the dual - polymerizing resin cements , the self - cure mode should ensure the high level of conversion , especially in the cervical proximal areas , the root canal and in the internal and deep areas of the cavity preparations.1214 several methodologies have been used to analyze the dc of resin - based materials ; however , most of them use fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ) . although many researchers have evaluated the polymerization effectiveness to determine the physical and mechanical properties of dental materials,9,15,16 little information is known about the influence of different viscosities of dual - cured resin cements on their physical properties , such as the degree of conversion in situations of self - and dual - polymerization . thus , the purpose of this study was to measure the dc of two commercially dual - cured resin cements in different viscosities ( low and high ) when they were light - activated or when the materials were allowed to self - cure solely , after 5 minutes and 24 hours from the mixture of pastes ( base and catalyst ) . the hypothesis tested was that curing mode , evaluation time and viscosity would affect the dc of the resin cements .", "two commercial dual - cure resin cements in high and low viscosities were evaluated : variolink ii ( ivoclar vivadent , schaan , liechtenstein ) and nexus 2 ( kerr corp . , orange , ca , usa ) . the resin cements consist of two paste components that were equally dispensed and mixed together according to manufacturers instructions . after mixing , resin cements ( n=5 ) were applied to the horizontal attenuated total reflectance znse crystal at 45 ( fourier transform infrared spectrometer , ft - ir spectrometer 520 , nicolet instrument corp , madson , wi , usa ) at room temperature . adhesive tape ( 3 m , sumar , sp , brazil ) was placed on the znse crystal surface to act as a spacer , ensuring standard thickness for all specimens ( 100120 mm ) . a mylar strip ( quimidrol com . ltda , joinville , sc , brazil ) was placed over the cement and was pressed flat to spread the material on the crystal surface . the spectrum of unpolymerized material was obtained and the cements were either light - cured ( dual - polymerizing mode ) or allowed to self - cure only ( autopolymerizing mode ) . each specimen was left on the crystal surface and further spectra were obtained 5 minutes and 24 hours after post mixing . for light - cured groups , a halogen light curing unit ( xl 3000 , 3 m espe , st . paul , mn , usa ) was used during 40 seconds (  600 mw / cm ) . the light intensity was periodically checked with a radiometer ( curing radiometer , model 100 , kerr corp . , orange , ca , usa ) . spectra were obtained between 4000 cm and 750 cm at a resolution of 4 cm . monomer conversion was calculated ( % ) according to the changes in the ratio between the absorbance peaks corresponding to the aliphatic ( cc ) ( 1638 cm ) and aromatic ( 1608 cm ) carbon double bonds prior to and 5 minutes and 24 hours after polymerization initiation for both curing modes.10 the aromatic peak is used as an internal reference because the intensity does not change during the polymerization reaction.9,11 the effect of curing mode , viscosity and time intervals on the dc were evaluated for each material . three - way repeated measure analysis of variance ( anova ) ( curing mode , viscosities and evaluation time ) was performed and tukey s post - hoc test was used to detect pair wise differences among experimental groups . the data was analyzed using the statistical program sas 9.1 ( sas institute , cary , nc , usa ) and all statistical testing was performed at a pre - set alpha of 0.05 ( p<.05 ) .", "the statistical analysis of the data showed significant differences in curing mode , viscosity and evaluation time factors for both resin cements ( p=.01 ) . there was significant interaction between factors : the curing mode x evaluation time ( p=.01 ) . other double - interactions and the triple - interaction ( curing mode x viscosity x evaluation time ) were not significant ( p>.05 ) . the dc of resin cements was higher when the materials were light - cured and when the low - viscosity versions were used than when self - curing mode and the high - viscosity resin cements were tested , respectively ( p<.05 ) .", "the results of this study showed that the curing mode ( auto- and dual - polymerization ) , the viscosity ( low or high ) and the evaluation time ( 5 minutes or 24 hours ) influenced the dc of resin cements . thus , the research hypothesis stating that these factors would result in significant changes in the dc was accepted . as the dc is dependent on the monomeric composition and the concentration and type of the photoinitiator in each product,9,17 the statistical analysis comparing the dc between resin cements the main factors under study ( curing mode , viscosities and time intervals ) produced similar effects for the resin cements , which presented different formulations regarding the resin matrix composition and type and concentration of filler particles . the variations on the proportion of components of resin matrix and filler particles that produced the low and the high versions caused no difference in behavior between the two cements results.7 a high monomer conversion with cross - linked polymeric network formation is essential for the durability of the resin - based restorations.911 studies have shown the importance of a high dc of resinous materials in order to reach better mechanical properties , since the presence of a high amount of residual methacrylate monomers compromises the hardness , the abrasion and the fracture resistance . moreover , the low dc can increase the sorption and the solubility , interfering in the color stability and mass loss of the resin cement.2,4,9,14,1720 the resin cements showed significant difference between the evaluation times , 5 minutes and 24 hours from the polymerization initiation , independently of viscosity or curing mode . thus , the polymerization reaction for both resin cements continued after 5 minutes of the mixing of the base and catalyst pastes . the continuation of the chemical part of the polymerization reaction ( benzoyl peroxide + tertiary amines ) was primarily responsible for the increase of the dc after 24 hours . additionally , the percentage of dc increasing after 24 hours was higher for the self - cure mode than the dual cure mode , which ranged from 38.3 to 42.4% and from 26.6 to 28.4% , respectively . the continuation reaction 24 hours after polymerization initiation resulted in a reduction of absorbance peaks that corresponded to the aliphatic carbon double bonds10 and the dual polymerization increased dc , which corroborates with several studies that compared the polymerization modes for resin - based materials.2,11,21,22 for both resin cements used in this study , the direct light - polymerization provided dc that was higher and ranged from 10 to 30% higher than those observed for the self - curing mode . also , it was higher at 5 minutes ( 24 to 30% ) than for 24 hours ( 10 to 12% ) from the polymerization initiation . the auto - polymerization may be insufficient to result in an adequate dc for the long lasting restorations . clinically , the low viscosity version ensured higher dc , and 24 hours elapsed time after setting of restoration is appropriate for the final appointment , since the higher dc could better support the final oclusal adjustments , finishing , and polishing procedures . the direct light - polymerization can be considered a limitation of this study , since the light is applied directly to the resin cement layer only at the periphery of restorations . on the other hand , the inner part of indirect restorations is reached by an attenuated light and resin cement may depend only on self - cure activation . regarding the differences in the dc between high and low viscosities , higher mean values were found for low viscosity versions of both resin cements . low viscosity materials can be due to lower filler loading and/or higher addition low viscosity diluents monomers . the low viscosity monomer allows better mobility and distribution of free radicals inside the resin material , which can increase the polymerization reaction and the monomer conversion.9 the increase of dc promoted by the low viscosity versions in percentage , following the polymerization mode ranged from 0.9 to 3.1% for the dual - polymerizing groups and ranged from 1.5 to 3.9% for the auto - polymerizing mode , which was the highest percentage among the groups from nexus 2 resin cement . for the variolink ii , dual - polymerizing groups ranged from 1.4 to 2.8% , while the auto - polymerizing mode ranged from 1.7 to 2.4% .", "the direct light - activation and the low viscosity version were important to provide higher dc for the dual - polymerizing resin cements . twenty - four hours after seating the indirect restoration is appropriate for final oclusal adjustments , finishing , and polishing procedures , which are capable of generating stress to the resin cement layer ."], "summary": "objective : the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the viscosities and curing modes on the degree of conversion ( dc ) of two resin cements.methods:eight experimental groups were evaluated ( n=5 ) , according to the dual -

related nafld . given that the stomach is one of the central organs of the digestive tract relaying satiety signals to the hypothalamus [ 14 , 15 ] and is a source of peptides with critical roles in energy homeostasis ( ghrelin ) , its participation in the development of obesity related nafld or its progression looks plausible . the discovery of ghrelin and its role in human metabolism has intensified the studies of hypothalamic control of the appetite and its contribution to obesity . in 2005 , it was found that the ghrelin - encoding gene also encodes obestatin , which , unlike ghrelin , is involved in appetite suppression . in addition to ghrelin and obestatin , the stomach is the second largest source , after adipose tissue , of the appetite inhibiting peptide leptin [ 1820 ] . yet , studies on the role of gastric tissue in obesity -

acylghrelin in serum of patients with nash were increased twofold as compared to bmi - matched controls with simple steatosis , while concentrations of ghrelin and obestatin were increased in patients with advanced liver fibrosis . other studies showed that the levels of ghrelin are related to inflammation and reduce the severity of inflammation [ 21 , 22 ] . an overproduction of the ghrelin in the patients with advanced stages of chronic liver disease may be a compensatory event or a reflection of local inflammatory responses on site of their production . observations listed above prompted us to hypothesize that the gastric tissue in obese subjects is actively contributing to the systemic inflammation and pathogenesis of one of the complications of obesity , nafld . to investigate this , we performed comparative expression profiling for 84 genes encoding inflammatory cytokines , chemokines , their receptors and other components of inflammatory cascades in samples of gastric tissue removed during sleeve gastrectomy .", "this study was approved by inova institutional review board ( federal assurance fwa00000573 ) . after informed consent , 20 morbidly other chronic liver diseases were excluded by negative serology for hepatitis b and c , no history of toxic exposure and no other cause of chronic liver disease . excessive alcohol consumption ( > 10 grams / day in women and > 20 grams / day in men ) was also excluded . no patients were receiving thiazolidinediones ( tzds ) or medications for gastritis , including proton pump inhibitors . from each patient , a discarded gastric tissue during sleeve gastrectomy was obtained and snap frozen with liquid nitrogen . gene expression profiling experiments were performed using fundic samples collected from the remaining sleeve gastrectomy specimens . samples were profiled for expression levels of 84 genes encoding inflammatory cytokines , chemokines , their receptors , and other components of inflammatory cascades using rt profiler pcr arrays ( qiagen , usa ) ( see supplementary table 1 in supplementary material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/684237 ) . for each patient , a liver biopsy was performed and read by the hepatopathologist . before histopathological evaluation , each liver biopsy specimen was formalin - fixed , sectioned , and stained with hematoxylin - eosin and masson 's trichrome . the slides were reviewed following a predetermined histologic grading system ; the extent of steatosis was graded as an estimate of the percentage of tissue occupied by fat vacuoles as follows : 0 = none , 1  5% , 2 = 633% , 3 = 3466% , and 4  66% . other histological features evaluated in h & e sections included portal inflammation , lymphoplasmacytic lobular inflammation , polymorphonuclear lobular inflammation , kupffer cell hypertrophy , apoptotic bodies , focal parenchymal necrosis , glycogen nuclei , hepatocellular ballooning , and mallory - denk bodies . patients who had hepatic steatosis ( with or without nonspecific inflammation ) or nash were considered to have nafld . nash was defined as steatosis , lobular inflammation , and ballooning degeneration with or without mallory - denk bodies and with or without fibrosis . hepatic inflammation was defined according to an extent of immune cell infiltration ( lymphoplasmacytic cells , polymorphonuclear cells , and kupffer cell hypertrophy ) . for each category , score was assigned based on the following system : 0 = none , 1 = few , 2 = moderate , and 3 = many . severity of total hepatic inflammation was determined based on the sum of the individual scores with advanced hepatic inflammation 3 and mild / no hepatic inflammation <3 . severity of pericellular and portal fibrosis was determined based on a similar scoring system as follows : 0 = none , 1 = mild , 2 = moderate , and 3 = marked fibrosis . severity of total hepatic fibrosis was determined based on the sum of the individual scores ( pericellular and portal fibrosis ) with a score of 3 being considered as advanced hepatic fibrosis and a score of <3 being considered as mild / no hepatic fibrosis . total rna was extracted from fundic gastric tissue samples ( n = 20 ) using rneasy kit ( qiagen , usa ) according to manufacturer 's instructions . to determine the quantity and purity of the extracted rna , absorbances were measured at 260  nm ( a260 ) and 280  nm ( a280 ) by the genequant1300 spectrophotometer ( ge healthcare , usa ) . rna with sharp , clear 28s and 18s ribosomal rna ( rrna ) bands and the intensity of 28s rrna band approximately twice as intense as the 18s rrna band were used as parameters to evaluate the integrity of total rna . 560  ng of extracted total rna was reverse transcribed using rt first strand kit ( qiagen , usa ) . according to manufacturer 's protocol , total rna was treated to eliminate genomic dna . both random hexamers and oligo - dt primers were used to prime reverse transcription performed as recommended by enzyme manufacturer ( qiagen , usa ) . quantitative real - time pcr was performed in 96 well pcr format using bio - rad cfx96 real time system ( biorad laboratories , usa ) with a ramp speed of 1c / sec . inflammatory cytokines and receptor rt profiler pcr arrays ( qiagen , usa ) were used to simultaneously examine the mrna levels of 84 genes encoding for inflammatory cytokines , their receptors and intracellular components of inflammatory cascades along with five housekeeping genes following the manufacturer 's protocol . the real - time pcr mixtures consisted of 1  l cdna and 7.5  l of rt pcr master mix ( qiagen , usa ) in a final volume of 25  l . the thermal profile of the rt - pcr procedure was repeated for 50 cycles : ( 1 ) 95c for 10  min ; ( 2 ) 10  s denaturation at 95c and 15 s  annealing at 60c ( amplification data collected at the end of each amplification step ) ; ( 3 ) dissociation curve consisting of 10  s incubation at 95c , 5  s incubation at 65c , and a ramp up to 95c ( bio - rad cfx96 real time system , usa ) . the results of the rt profiler pcr array were further confirmed by independent qpcr experiments . for the genes with significantly altered expression levels , the primers were designed using primer3 from ncbi ( ( supplementary table 2 ) . the validation was carried out using the thermal profile for 40 cycles : ( 1 ) 95c for 10  min ; ( 2 ) 10  s denaturation at 95c and 15  s annealing at 60c ( amplification data collected at the end of each amplification step ) ; ( 3 ) dissociation curve consisting of 10  s incubation at 95c , 5  s incubation at 65c , and a ramp up to 95c ( bio - rad cfx96 real time system , usa ) . the real - time pcr mixtures consisted of 1  l cdna , 5  l of ssofast evagreen supermix ( bio - rad , usa ) , and 250  nm final concentration of primers ( invitrogen , usa ) in a final volume of 10  l . values were collected for the threshold cycle ( ct ) for each gene , and only ct values less than 40 were considered for further analysis . normalization of each target gene was carried out relative to five housekeeping genes [ 24 , 25 ] according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( qiagen , usa ) . average of ct values for five housekeeping genes ( ct ) on the same array ( b2 m , hprt1 , rpl13a , gapd , and actb ) was calculated . the normalized ct was log transformed ; resultant values were utilized for calculation of the fold change of each target gene in different cohorts . for each target gene , the fold change was used to compare the gene expression levels in two different groups within a cohort ( group a and group b ) . in this study , group a may be the diseased state and group b the nondiseased state ; group a may be the advanced diseased state and group b the mild / nondiseased state . \n c \n t values of control wells ( genomic dna control , reverse transcriptase control , and positive pcr control ) were examined separately for assessing the quality of each run and interpolate variability . for the validation of the pcr array results this study aimed for uncovering changes in gene expression in the stomach of patients with more advanced forms of nafld as compared to these with less advanced forms . comparisons were performed for the following paired cohorts : mild or no hepatic inflammation versus advanced hepatic inflammation ; mild steatosis versus advanced steatosis ; histologic nash versus nafld without histologic nash ; hepatic fibrosis versus nafld without hepatic fibrosis . mild or no hepatic inflammation versus advanced hepatic inflammation ;   mild steatosis versus advanced steatosis ;   histologic nash versus nafld without histologic nash ;   hepatic fibrosis versus nafld without hepatic fibrosis . to assess the significance of gene expression differences between compared groups , univariate analyses were performed using the nonparametric mann - whitney test to determine whether two variables covary , and to measure the strength of any relationship , spearman 's coefficient of correlation was used . the independent effect of significant variables ( p  0.05 ) on advanced inflammation , nash , and steatosis was assessed using multiple stepwise regression analysis with both the backward and forward stepwise selection procedures . the multiple test corrections were carried out using benjamini - hochberg - yekutieli procedure that controls the false discovery rate under positive dependence assumptions reflecting known phenomenon of cocorrelation of expression levels for genes involved in the same cellular or organismal process . in case the positive dependent assumption would turn incorrect , assumption - free benjamini - hochberg procedure was also applied . to put our finding into perspective , both benjamini - hochberg - yekutieli approved pvalues and the results of benjamini - hochberg test were reported .", "when cohorts with mild ( score < 3 ) and advanced hepatic inflammation ( score  3 ) were compared , expression levels for chemokine ( c - c motif ) ligand 4 ( ccl4 ) , chemokine ( c - c motif ) receptor 5 ( ccr5 ) , chemokine ( c - x - c motif ) ligand 2 ( cxcl2 ) , chemokine ( c - x - c motif ) ligand 6 ( cxcl6 ) , interferon 2 ( ifna2 ) , interleukin 19 ( il19 ) , interleukin-1 family member 8 ( il1f8 ) , and interleukin 8 ( il8 ) , were significantly increased ( p  0.05 ) ( table 2 ) . among these cytokines , ccl4 , ccr5 , ifna2 , il1f8 , and il8 were also independently and significantly correlated with hepatic inflammatory scores ( p  0.05 ) ( table 3 ) . chemokine ( c - c motif ) ligand 21 ( ccl21 ) and chemokine ( c - c motif ) ligand 3 ( ccl3 ) , on the other hand , were found to be significantly correlated ( p  0.05 ) with hepatic inflammatory scores , but did not show significant differential expression in the group - wise comparisons ( p  0.05 ) ( table 3 ) . in patients with advanced hepatic steatosis ( score  3 ) , chemokine ( c - x - c motif ) ligand 14 ( cxcl14 ) , interleukin-1 family member 10 ( il1f10 ) , and interleukin 8 receptor  ( il8rb ) had a significant differential expression ( p  0.05 ) as compared to those with mild steatosis ( score  2 ) ( table 2 ) . in addition , il8rb and il1f10 levels were positively correlated with a degree of steatosis ( p  0.05 ) ( table 3 ) . patients with presence of histologic nash as compared to those nafld patients without nash showed a significant differential expression of chemokine ( c - c motif ) receptor 3 ( ccr3 ) , chemokine ( c - c motif ) receptor 9 ( ccr9 ) , interleukin 1 receptor antagonist ( il1rn ) , interleukin 8 receptor  ( il8ra ) , and interleukin 9 ( il9 ) ( p  0.05 ) ( table 2 ) . spearman 's correlation coefficient analysis showed some of the differentially expressed genes , namely , ccr3 , ccr9 , il1rn , il8ra , and il9 to be also positively correlated with nash ( p  0.05 ) ( table 3 ) . additionally , il8rb , chemokine ( c - x - c motif ) ligand 14 ( cxcl12 ) , and chemokine ( c - x - c motif ) ligand 1 ( ccl1 ) were also positively and significantly correlated with nash ( p  0.05 ) ( table 3 ) . in patients with hepatic fibrosis , only chemokine ( c - x - c motif ) ligand 17 ( ccl17 ) was significantly upregulated ( p  0.05 ) ( table 2 ) . a different set of genes , small inducible cytokine subfamily e member 1 ( scye1 ) , il1rn , and complement component 5 ( c5 ) , however , were positively correlated with severity of fibrosis ( p  0.05 ) ( table 3 ) . to predict advanced hepatic inflammation , a single equation multivariate regression model was generated . in this model , only four variables  ccl21 , ccr5 , alt , and age acted as predictors of advanced inflammation , where ccl21 ( p < 0.0007 ) and ccr5 ( p < 0.0064 ) were the strongest predictors ( table 4 ) . these four predictors explain 66% of the variance in the inflammation phenotype ( r = 0.66 ) . for understanding the effect of independent variables on pathogenesis of histologic nash , the multivariate regression generated a statistically significant model ( p < 0.002 ) with ccr3 , cxcl12 , il1rn , il8ra , il8rb , and interleukin 5 ( il5 ) . this model explained 75% of the variance in nash phenotype ( r = 0.75 ) . the model of advanced hepatic fibrosis ( p < 0.006 ) included only il1rn ( p < 0.006 ) as a sole component explaining 34% of the variance in fibrosis ( r = 0.34 ) . interestingly , none of the genes showing differential regulation ( p  0.05 ) or significantly correlated with the degree of steatosis were able to contribute significantly to the model for steatosis ; hence , no models resulted from these analyses .", "however , it has limited capacity to store lipids . therefore , excess lipid buildup can result in the development of nafld . one of the critical thrusts in the studies of the progression of nalfd has been the search for factors that may influence the progression of steatosis to nash and cirrhosis . according to the multiple hit model of nafld , many hits may act in parallel or in tandem contributing to this pathogenesis . of these , gut - derived and adipose tissue  inflammation , a central player in the pathogenesis of nash , can enhance the probability of progression of fibrosis to nash - related cirrhosis . in the past decade , white adipose tissue has been considered as a major source for inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in obese patients [ 2931 ] . in addition to the adipose tissue , it was suggested that other tissues , particularly , gastric and intestinal tissues may overproduce various soluble molecules and contribute to overall inflammatory background influencing distant organs . our study is the first to show that mrnas encoding for various soluble molecules are overproduced in the gastric tissue of morbidly obese patients with advanced forms of nafld . remarkably , there was a substantial overlap in genes with significant differential expression ( p  0.05 ) and genes with significant correlation ( p  0.05 ) to the same histological characteristic of nafld ( supplementary figure 1 ) . further , distinct and notably , nonoverlapping sets of soluble molecule encoding genes change their expression along with various histological features of nafld ( figure 1 ) . importantly , an overlap between sets of genes significantly correlating ( p  0.05 ) with a specific histological characteristic of nafld was minimal ( figure 1 ) . il8rb / cxcr2 is a notable exclusion with its overexpression correlating with steatosis and diagnosis of nash as well as fibrosis . il8rb / cxcr2 is a receptor for the il8 chemokine that plays an important role in liver inflammation , regeneration , and repair [ 32 , 33 ] as well as in the neutrophil accumulation in other inflammatory conditions [ 31 , 34 ] . increased levels of the gastric expression of il8rb gene indicate that in morbidly obese patients with nash - associated inflammation , il8 activation is not limited to hepatic macrophages as had been shown before , but is a system - wide feature . it is plausible that il8rb present on the resident gastric macrophages cells or on neutrophils activates the neutrophils locally upon its binding to il8 . in turn , activated neutrophils may then release additional chemokines and/or may enter the liver through portal circulation and influence the progression of nafld ( figure 2 ) . this premise is also supported by our observation that the expression of il8 gene that encodes the ligand for il8rb positively correlates with advanced hepatic inflammation ( table 3 ) . circulatory il8 levels are reported to increase under oxidative stress and , in turn , stimulate further increase in levels of oxidant stress mediators by local recruitment of inflammatory cells   ( figure 2 ) . as an expanding adipose tissue of obese individuals releases increased levels of il8 [ 9 , 30 ] , it may trigger increased expression of gastric il8 and its receptor il8rb . additionally , studies have shown that free fatty acids ( ffa ) , also increased in obese individuals , influence expression of il8 in various peripheral tissues [ 36 , 37 ] . thus , the paired increase in levels of il8 and its receptor found in the gastric tissue of obese may act to activate local as well as circulating , thus contributing towards vicious cycle of inflammation and influencing progression of nafld . the expression levels of anti - inflammatory receptor il1rn , an antagonist of il1a and il1b , were positively correlated both with the presence of nash and with fibrosis ( table 3 ) . in the regression model predicting fibrosis , expression of il1rn mrna was the only significant component that explained 34% of the variance in fibrosis . additionally , il1rn mrna expression significantly contributed to the regression model predicting nash ( table 4 ) . these observations are in agreement with a recent report on association of serum il1ra levels and liver il1rn expression with nash . il1ra is expressed and secreted by a number of immune cells such as monocytes , macrophages , and neutrophils as well as epithelial cells and hepatocytes . as its expression is regulated by proinflammatory cytokines , il1rn is considered to be an acute phase protein   with levels elevated in many inflammatory conditions . we hypothesize that increased levels of circulating and/or local proinflammatory cytokines upregulate gastric il1rn expression either directly or via activated leukocytes ( figure 2 ) . once upregulated , il1ra may stimulate its own gastric expression by a positive feedback loop ( figure 2 ) . this mechanism is supported by studies showing elevated circulating il1rn in patients with obesity   and nafld [ 38 , 42 ] . many genes differentially expressed in the gastric tissue of patients with advanced forms of nafld encode chemokines previously shown as important players in a variety of inflammatory conditions . for example , expression levels of both ccl4 chemokine and its receptor ccr5 encoding genes showed significant upregulation in advanced hepatic inflammation ( table 2 ) and a positive correlation with the severity of the hepatic inflammation ( p  0.05 ) ( table 3 ) . in the multivariate regression model , ccr5 mrna level also was one of the strongest predictors of the severity of hepatic inflammation ( table 4 ) . ccl4 attracts natural killer cells , monocytes , and a variety of other immune cells . the increased expression of ccl4 and ccr5 genes in gastric tissue could be attributed to local immune cells activated in response to upstream regulators like il1f8 ( figure 2 ) . in the present study , il1f8 gene was also upregulated in stomach tissue of patients with advanced liver inflammation ( tables 2 and 5 ) . while the role of ccl4/ccr5 in the pathogenesis of nafld remains to be sketched out , these collective findings make it an attractive target for further investigation . the complex interaction of cytokines , chemokines , and their receptors highlighted in this study suggests that the gastric tissue is an integral player in obesity - associated nafld . it seems that in obesity , an increase in inflammatory responses of adipose tissue corresponds to similar increase in the inflammation within the tissues involved in satiety response . activated immune cells embedded in the gastric tissue may then recruit additional immune cells or be released in circulation , and hence amplify the inflammatory response and promote the development and progression of nafld ( figure 2 ) . an increase in recognition of the endocrine function of the stomach and its contributions to energy homeostasis this , in turn , may trigger a cascade of metabolic dysfunction culminating in nafld ( figure 2 ) . it remains to be determined if the complex interaction of inflammatory molecules in gastric tissue lies upstream or downstream of the intricate network of inflammatory signaling , which is the hallmark of nafld . evidently , the stomach plays a certain role in metabolic dysfunction ; its potential proinflammatory properties should not be neglected by studies of the conditions related to metabolic syndromes , including nafld .", "in this study , we demonstrate an altered pattern of gene expression for cytokine and chemokine encoding genes in the gastric tissue of individuals with obesity and varying degrees of hepatic inflammation and different forms of nafld . soluble inflammatory molecules produced by the stomach appear to contribute to obesity - related nafld . although the causal links between these signaling events remains to be determined , we propose that the fundus of the stomach is an integral player in the signaling milieu associated with both obesity - related nafld ."], "summary": "obesity is associated with chronic low - grade inflammation perpetuated by visceral adipose . other organs , particularly stomach and intestine , may also overproduce proinflammatory molecules . we examined the gene expression patterns in gastric tissue of morbidly obese patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( nafld ) and compared the changes in gene expression in different histological forms of nafld . stomach tissue samples from 20 morbidly obese nafld patients who were undergoing sleeve gastrectomy were profiled using qpcr for 84 genes encoding inflammatory cytokines , chemokines , their receptors , and other components of inflammatory cascades . interleukin 8 receptor - beta ( il8rb ) gene overexpression in gastric tissue was correlated with the presence of hepatic steatosis , hepatic fibrosis , and histologic diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( nash ) . expression levels of soluble interleukin 1 receptor antagonist ( il1rn ) were correlated with the presence of nash and hepatic fibrosis . mrna levels of interleukin 8 ( il8 ) , chemokine ( c - c motif ) ligand 4 ( ccl4 ) , and its receptor chemokine ( c - c motif ) receptor type 5 ( ccr5 ) showed a significant increase in patients with advanced hepatic inflammation and were correlated with the severity of the hepatic inflammation . the results of our study suggest that changes in expression patterns for inflammatory molecule encoding genes within gastric tissue may contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity -

five human canine teeth extracted for periodontal reasons with completed apices and similar lengths were used in this study . mesiodistal ( md ) and buccolingual ( bl ) radiographs were taken of the specimens to evaluate the anatomical structures of the teeth . the teeth with internal or external resorption , those which had two or more root canals , and those with calcification were discarded . the teeth were examined under a stereomicroscope to discard specimens with cracks and craze lines . soft tissues and calculus were removed mechanically from the root surfaces using a periodontal scaler . specimens were decoronated with a diamond disc under a water coolant to obtain a standardized root length of 16 mm . was carried out , weight , volume [ figure 1 ] , and density [ figure 1 ] were calculated with  precisa xb 220a precision balance ( precisa , gravimetrics ag , dietikon , switzerland ) which had a capacity of 220 g , and a readability of 0.0001 g. weight change in distilled water is equal to root volume , because density of distilled water is 1 g / cm . md and bl dimensions at 16 mm ( the coronal end of the root ) from the apex of the each root were recorded with root number . a size 10 k -

 it has a precise meaning and commonly refers to hebbian processes . in their rebuttal , they back peddle from their past specific language regarding the significance of neuromodulator release and the expression of plasticity molecules in shy . there is , however , little ambiguity in their original description of how these events purportedly promote ltp ( or ltp - like events ) during wake versus sleep [ 4 , 5 ] .    the concepts and terminology of synaptic homeostasis and scaling predate shy   and there is simply no mistaking the broad similarities between synaptic scaling and what is described in shy . for example , here is a more complete excerpt from tononi and cirelli .     like activity - dependent synaptic scaling ( emphasis added ) , however , sleep - dependent downscaling would affect most or all of a neuron 's synapses . in this respect , downscaling is conceptually different from long - term depression , which affects select groups of synapses , or depotentiation , which affects only recently potentiated ones  therefore , their use of these terms , if in fact they mean something else , is perplexing . the distinctions they make between their version of downscaling and scaling proper are welcome , but quite subtle when compared to the overall similarities . for example , synaptic homeostasis is not only manifested at the level of firing rates as implied by tononi and cirelli . that is one outcome of a homeostatic adjustment of synaptic weights in a network , as measured , for example , by mepscs [ 7 , 8 ] . this point seems moot , since tononi and cirelli cite changes in firing rates and mepscs as evidence of shy [ 9 , 10 ] .    in the end , it really does not matter what new name they give to their process ( or set of processes ) that weakens synapses . the point i was making , and which they missed , is that any form of plasticity ( especially if possibly novel ) should be examined through the prism of known facts about hebbian and non - hebbian plasticity . case in point : i never stated that the  downscaling  of shy is identical to synaptic scaling as currently understood in the field . i instead argued that since the concepts of scaling figure prominently in shy , and because scaling is an accepted means of globally adjusting synaptic weight , it is logical to examine the claims of shy based on what is known about synaptic scaling .  synaptic renormalization  from synaptic scaling , but this name change does not inoculate shy against scrutiny .", "the veracity and validity of a scientific theory is not solely determined by the amount of data piled on one side of a scale . it is also determined by a careful examination of each piece of evidence , pro and con . upon close examination , threads of supportive findings may unravel , and when contrary evidence is properly considered , an otherwise impressive mass of findings may collapse . a large part of their response is a long catalog of supportive data  some of which i included in my review . however , as i pointed out , careful examination reveals alternative explanations for some of their results . they also largely ignore evidence consistent with net increases in synaptic strength after sleep , or findings that question their hypothesized relationship between synaptic potentiation and slow - wave electroencephalographic activity ( swa ) [ 11 , 12 ] . these findings are consistent with my original discussion   and completely in opposition to predictions of shy . when these are also considered the universality of shy , and its utility as an explanation for why we sleep , becomes questionable .", "in my original review , i considered biological processes other than sleep that might explain some findings ascribed to shy . these included the cumulative effects of natural patterns in brain temperature ( and in mammals , glucocorticoid release ) across the 24-hour day or after sleep deprivation . tononi and cirelli present a number of arguments against these ideas , but i have a better idea for example , why not examine the effects of cooling or warming on drosophila synaptic proteins ( which are altered by changes in temperature as small as 8c ; not as they state 20c ) ? tononi and cirelli argue strenuously that shy is a theory of function , yet they support their argument with cellular and molecular findings that have no demonstrable function . rather than elaborate upon already dense theoretical arguments about the functional importance of shy , why not demonstrate it empirically ? in science , no argument , no matter how beautifully crafted , trumps a good experiment .", "in his discussion of sleep theories 50 years ago , nathaniel kleitman reminded his readers of the cautionary tale of ptolemy of alexandria . ptolemy was a revered scholar in the 2nd century ad who codified hundreds of years of prior greek astronomy and mathematics into what came to be known as the ptolemaic universe . the ptolemaic universe held that the stars , planets and sun revolved around the earth , embedded in overlapping crystalline spheres . this theory of the natural world was elegant , mathematical , and even highly predictive of astronomical events . the lesson from ptolemy is that scientific theories are ultimately judged not only by their power to explain , but by the validity of their physical mechanisms .    tononi and cirelli argue that for shy to be valid , it does not matter how synapses are weaker after a sleep period , just that they are . but ptolemy reminds us that this is not enough ; scientific truth comes from asking hard questions about how things actually work . i do not question their results , showing for example , changes in evoked responses or mrnas consistent with shy . first , they have not identified how sleep actually alters synaptic strength in any species . second , they have not experimentally excluded the role of other biological processes that coincide with sleep . a final consideration is that if shy is a scientific hypothesis , then tononi and cirelli should propose an experimental outcome that would force a rejection of shy ."], "summary": "in a recent article i reviewed an influential theory of sleep function , the  synaptic homeostasis hypothesis ( shy . )  according to shy , sleep renormalizes synapses that are potentiated during prior wakefulness . i concluded that while shy is a seminal theory with important implications about sleep function and the brain , its underlying mechanisms are poorly defined . in an accompanying article , the authors of shy responded at length . their reply is thoughtful and provocative , but unfortunately many of the points i raised were not accurately represented or addressed . in this brief commentary , i attempt to clarify some points of confusion . i also explain why any theory of sleep function is incomplete without an understanding of the underlying cellular mechanisms .", "ranking": [2, 0, 4, 3, 1]}

both inside their niche and in circulation of cancer patients .", "even as tremendous inventions had have ameliorated anticancer therapeutic practices , these pathologies ' developmental and progressive mechanisms are still disputed ; and inclined a chiefly limiting factor in front of drugs ' efficiency . consequently , several opinions and hypotheses have been formulated to define tumorigenesis and metastasis origins . johannes muller ( 1838 ) and her student rudolph virchow ( 1821 - 1902 ) were the first pathologists describing the cellular origin of cancer . huge plethora of studies has depicted , one by one , cascades of cancer development , to finally draw the cancer stemness theory which is reinforced by several molecular and genomic scrutinies . because of the important heterogeneity of the characterized cancer stem cells ( cscs ) , which are harbored within different kinds of tumors ; it was stubborn to accurately demarcate their origins . in regard of the copious common patterns shared with cscs , we hope to highlight relevant opinions dealing with the possibility that bone marrow progenitors did initiate the cancerous transformation .", "the cell transformation and progression , from normalcy to malignancy , could be simulated to a honey - bees ' colonial development and reproduction . this insect 's queen gives naissance to numerous and various individuals , amongst which only rare genetically defined mature females ( future queens ) will generate new outposts , when and where conditions are favorable . thus , in certain circumstances , normal cell will transform to a csc through several mechanisms , and acquire a genomic program enabling it to get patterns of \" honey- bees ' queen \" . several works impressively assembled and described the cellular , molecular and genetic circuitry that is ensued by the transformed cell to result into metastases [ 4 , 5 ] . they commonly stippled for a repeated cascade of events that permit various capabilities for tumoral cells : self- sufficiency in growth signals , insensitivity to antigrowth signals , escaping to apoptosis , unlimited replicative potential , sustained angiogenesis , tissue invasion , migration and metastasis . nonetheless , these events are physiological alterations , eroding the multi - cellular organism homeostasis , that are guaranteed by both the csc ( intrinsic factors ) and the surrounding microenvironment ( extrinsic factors ) . the genetic and epigenetic alterations constitute the major intrinsic factors leading to the disease 's development and progression ; while extrinsic factors assemble various elements such as immune surveillance depletion ; aging   and inflammation . these two factors constitute the basic trait for paget ' hypothesis : the seed and soil . seemingly , the reliability between intrinsic and extrinsic elements outlines a rate of knot for csc evolutionary scenario . thus , it is conceivable that each genomic modification might , reciprocally , match with an adequate environmental variation point . whether these two sequential events fit one to other , is still an important inquiry to enlighten . it was assumed that , at least , two or more mutational events ( genomic modifications ) should occur to initiate the primary cancerous transformation ; but to raise into metastasis in distant organs several passive and/ or active modifications are required , in both cscs ' daughters and their surrounding microenvironment . garraway and sellers ( 2006 ) have developed a model of aberrant lineage ontogeny and somatic genetics , in order to explain the chronological evolving of the disease . they proposed that tumorigenesis and metastasis arose from the activation of an inborn \" backward \" developmental program of lineage progenitors and their survival genetic programs . such system might generate an ancestral form of stem cells that aberrantly grow and invade into the body , like as it occurred during organogenesis . hold inactive in normal cells ' memory , this black box cassette is unexpectedly reactivated under some defined conditions , and will turn on a fastidious machinery of organogenesis leading to tumor development and metastases . in conjunction to the cancer stemness theory , this conception could bring simple explanations in oncology .", "bone marrow constitute the primarily reservoir of stem cells ( bmscs ) in the body . when bmscs are in contact with other tissues , they give raise to tissues ' neo- genesis . also , it has been revealed that bmscs acquire tissue morphology and landmarks , by spontaneous fusion with normal cells [ 15 , 16 ] . thus , it is plausible to seek for bmscs as the origin of various cancer diseases . some experimental models of bmscs transplantations into nude or immune- compromised animals prompted relative improving for their transformation into solid tumors [ 17 - 19 ] . this pathologic deviation of bmscs could be mediated by the accumulated chromosomal instability , as observed in murine model . using similar experimental model , zheng and liang ( 2008 ) , showed that the donating - males ' bmscs did not contribute to the induced hepatocellular carcinoma into receptive females . such debate might be caused by the important conditioning , like the immune system depletion that permits not only tumorigenesis but also any introduced pathogen 's growth . so , clinical investigations are likely much relevant to improve our knowledge on the pragmatic release of tumorigenic cells from bmscs . beyond , the great assays examining the genetic and cluster designating landmarks of cells , bmscs have been identified in the core of tumor , in cancer patients . reciprocally , cancerous cells were found to circulate and to home into the bone marrow niche . this mutual relocation of both tumorigenic cells and bmscs derived ones rappels the circulatory loops of immune cells . interestingly , osteosarcomas that could directly originate inside the bone marrow niche , is the most frequent metastasis in childhood . furthermore , in myeloma patients , there are several chromosomal translocations that occur into osteoclasts ' nuclei . according to the authors , these genetic aberrations are hybrids of osteoclasts with myeloma cells . tumoral cells have been characterized into bone marrow aspirates from non- metastatic , and disease- free breast cancer patients , after systemic recovery ; and in earlier stages ( i and ii ) of the disease [ 23 , 26 ] . ( 2011 ) , who summarized that the tumor progression is firmly dependent on bone marrow stromal cells ' lineages . the most primitive form of bmscs , the innate bmsc , will replicate and self - renew to generate various normal progenitor lineages ( hscs : hematopoietic stem cells , and bmdscs : somatic bone marrow derived stem cells ) , in order to ensure homeostasis and damaged tissues ' repair . under the influence of various extrinsic and eventually intrinsic factors , these progenitors will systematically lead to different kinds of the known myeloma ; diffuse and follicular lymphomas ; and distant sarcomas ( yellow panels ) . ( 2012 ) showed that a pluripotent stem cell derived from bmscs could re - differentiate into hematopoietic cells . this prompted the possibility that bmscs produces an ancestral form of progenitors that exhibit an active engine dotted for organogenesis : the black box cassette ( green panels ) . these ancestral cells exhibit embryonic - like stem cells properties and could be found both into bone marrow niche and the blood circulation . ultimately , they will easily enter sequential and spontaneous differentiations to any kind of stromal cells progenitors and migrate to a definite organ where they clone and contribute to tumorigenesis . perhaps , there will be swaying and switching between the yellow and green pathways , dependently on lineages ' nature and the surrounding microenvironment ( dotted lines ) . perhaps , this might explain the possible reversibility of the metastatic neuro - blastoma observed in childhood . furthermore , this theoretical scenario of tumor development and metastasis could reveal the mystery of cancers without defined origins . several investigations evidenced the existence of such memorial program , in various stromal cells , which was expected to be under epigenetic factors ' control [ 33 , 34 ] . so , the consecutive spatio- temporal variation in derived progenitor cells   would be subsequent to dna methylation dynamic that is supposed to guide memory in stem cells . since that , the epigenetic alterations in bmscs will prompt the black box cassette program to viaduct an erroneous organogenesis ( figure 1 ) .", "our opinion outlines that cancer initiating- cells could derive from bone marrow progenitors . to do so , bmscs are firstly pushed to generate an ancestral form of progenitors that have an activated memorial program - the black box cassette- leading to fastidious tissular neo - genesis . this scenario , did involve few genomic modifications that are needed for the ancestral cell release ; whereas tumorigenesis and metastases progression are spontaneously mediated without requirement of further genetic interventions . in this way of thinking , the intra and inter- tumoral cells ' heterogeneity and diversity are quietly acquired during both the colonization or at the first transformations leading to various ancestral progenies of stem cells . however , it could be envisaged that they are temporarily expressed by the progenitors as they have instable genomes . to get better comprehension concerning this hypothesis , we suggest that fine - tuning of cells ' depicting techniques toward the characterization and isolation of the most primitive forms of cancer patients ' bmscs , into both bone marrow niche ( aspirates ) and the circulation ( blood and lymph ) , is necessary . thereafter , accurate experimental models will be helpful to find the relationships between these cells and tumorigenesis and metastasis ."], "summary": "backgrounddefining cancer stem cells and their origins is of much controversy , and constitutes a challenged knockout for cell targeting- anticancer drugs . herein , we put forward a hypothetic model for cancer stem cells initiation from bone marrow stem cells . these later , will differentiate into an ancestral progenitor that activates a memorial program - the black box cassette- that is responsible of abnormal neo - organogenesis in the form of tumors and metastases . to approve this model , we assume that characterizing and investigating the most primitive forms of the bone marrow progenitors is required ; both inside their niche and in circulation of cancer patients .", "ranking": [0, 4, 1, 3, 2]}

Conclusion"], "document": ["the mandible occupies a very prominent position on the face and is therefore a favored target of intentional and unintentional trauma1 . the high incidence of fractures of the angle of the mandible is attributed to a thinner cross - sectional area relative to the neighboring segments of the mandible , the curvature of trajectories in the angle region , and the presence of third molars , particularly those that are impacted , which weakens the region2 . it is therefore not uncommon for an oral and maxillofacial surgeon to encounter fractures of the angle of the mandible in their day - to - day practice . the oral and maxillofacial surgeon 's preference for the approach to a fracture site depends on accessibility , ease of procedure , aesthetic demands by the patient , and surgical expertise . various approaches are used for the fixation of fractures of the angle region of the mandible . this technique had certain disadvantages such as an unaesthetic scar and the risk of facial nerve injury , although exposure and direct application of the plate was better with this approach3 . to counteract these disadvantages , this approach involves operating entirely through an incision made in the oral mucosa / gingiva and is frequently used by surgeons . the disadvantages included placement of the plate in an anatomically unfavorable position , thin soft tissue coverage leading to an increase in dehiscence and exposure of the plate , and breakage of the plate due to a greater degree of intraoperative plate bending , which required to adapt to the complex contours of the superior border of the mandible . other disadvantages include placement of plate closer to the dentition , allowing an easier and shorter path for bacterial pathogens to move from the periodontal sulcus to the fixation hardware and more prevalent loosening of the screw , as there is less bone density on the superior aspect of the mandible and the alveolus4 . the disadvantages of the transoral approach prompted surgeons to find an alternative method , namely the transbuccal approach . this approach involves an intraoral incision plus a small incision on the facial skin , which permits the use of a transbuccal trocar to allow instruments such as a drill or screwdriver to pass through . advantages include no external scarring , fixation of the plates on the thicker lateral cortical plate of the mandible in a sagittal plane , greater soft tissue coverage , less chance of plate fracture as weakening of plates by over - bending is avoided , lower infection rate due to less movement of pathogens from the third molar region , and direct visualization and confirmation of desired occlusion during fixation45 . since the miniplate fixation differs for the transoral and transbuccal approaches , we decided to compare the two approaches in the management of angle fractures of the mandible .", "a total of 60 patients reporting to goa dental college and hospital from march 2013 to december 2014 were included in this prospective study and were randomly divided into 2 equal groups based on the type of approach employed for fracture fixation ( group a , transoral approach ; group b , transbuccal approach ) . the study was ethically approved by the goa dental college and hospital 's review committee and written informed consent was obtained from all patients participating in the study . we included patients with an age between 15 to 60 years , unilateral / bilateral mandibular angle fractures or fractures associated with other facial bone fractures with radiographic preoperative displacement of the fracture segments ranging from 1 to 5 mm , patients with controlled systemic conditions , and those willing to follow - up . we excluded patients who refused to follow - up or had a medically compromised status and patients with infections or pathologic or comminuted fractures . the degree of anatomical displacement was studied with digital orthopantomogram ( opg ) and posteroanterior ( pa ) mandible radiographs . complete hematological investigations were performed and all patients were started on intravenous antibiotics that were continued for 5 days postoperatively in all patients . erich arch bars were applied to the maxillary and mandibular dentition a day prior to surgery . all patients were operated under general anesthesia with nasotracheal intubation following a standard surgical protocol by a single oral and maxillofacial surgeon . in group a , following local infiltration of the intraoral site with 2% lignocaine with 1:80,000 adrenaline , an incision was planned extending from the anterior border of the ascending ramus at the level of maxillary occlusal plane . the incision was then carried down just along the lateral portion of the anterior ramus and continued forward approximately 5 mm from the junction of the attached mucosa and vestibule to extend anteriorly to the level of the mandibular first molar . b ) fractured segments were stabilized and fixed with a 2.5 mm 4-hole titanium miniplate with a gap , and were secured with monocortical screws that were 2.5-mm in diameter and 6 to 8 mm in length . general anesthesia was reversed and the patient was extubated and shifted to the recovery room . in group b , in addition to the transoral incision , a small extraoral stab incision was given to permit the insertion of the transbuccal cannula.(fig . b ) the location of the extraoral stab incision was guided by the location of the fracture line and the position of the facial vessels . the trocar was advanced into the operative site with blunt dissection through the stab incision , perforating the periosteum in the area planned for plate fixation.(fig . c ) the cheek retractor was applied to stabilize the trocar assembly during movement towards and away from the fracture site . a drill bit that was 11.5 cm in length and 2.3 mm in diameter the procedure followed for fracture reduction was similar to that of the transoral approach , except that after fracture reduction , the trocar assembly was removed and the extraoral skin incision was sutured with 5.0 ethilon ( johnson & johnson , new brunswick , nj , usa ) suture.(fig . d - h ) all patients were hospitalized for 5 days and were placed on a liquid diet for 2 weeks , followed by a soft diet for another 4 weeks . intraoperatively , patients were evaluated for the ease of surgical access for fixation and the surgical time ( time from incision to closure ) . the ease of surgical access for fixation in either approach was evaluated by the operating surgeon and graded as 1 , good ; 2 , fair ; and 3 , poor , based on the visual analogue scale6 . radiographic evaluation of fracture reduction between the two groups was done by measuring the gap between the fractured segments of the mandible in postoperative opg radiographs . all radiographs were performed using the orthophos xg machine ( sirona dental systems , bensheim , germany ) with similar exposure parameters . on the radiographs measurements of the fracture gap were conducted on these 4 defined points with a digital caliper6.(fig . 3 , 4 ) postoperative complications such as scarring ( in group b ) , occlusal discrepancy , infection , nonunion , and malunion were evaluated at each regular follow - up period . evaluation of scarring in group b was done with photographs at the 6th month postoperatively . the scoring for the scar was as follows : 1 , hypertrophic scar ; 2 , invisible scar ; and 3 , barely visible scar7 . postoperative occlusion was evaluated using the following scoring system : 1 , pre trauma ; 2 , minor discrepancy ; and 3 , major discrepancy8 . the data was tabulated and subjected to statistical analysis ( spss version 13 ; spss inc . ,", "the mean age in this study was 26.73 years ( range , 17 - 53 years ) , with a peak incidence in the second and third decades of life ( n=46 , 76.7% ) which showed male predominance ( n=58 , 96.7% ) . road traffic accidents accounted for the majority of the cases ( n=52 , 86.7% ) . isolated mandibular angle fracture was seen in 20 patients ( 33.3% ) , with a higher incidence of right sided fracture ( n=36 , 60.0% ) when compared to the left ( n=24 , 40.0% ) . the ease of surgical access for fixation revealed no statistical significance when compared between the two groups . ( table 1 ) the mean surgical time for each group was 37 minutes and did not vary between groups.(table 2 ) postoperative radiographic tracing for both groups was done on the opg . it was noted that the reduction in the gap in group b was uniform from points a to d , whereas in group a , there was gradual increase in the distance between the fractured segments.(table 3 ) there was no statistical difference at point a for both groups . however , points b ( p=0.030 ) , c ( p=0.016 ) , and d ( p=0.004 ) were statistically different between groups.(table 4 ) with regard to postoperative complications , scar evaluation in group b at 6 months revealed 1 patient ( 3.3% ) with a hypertrophic scar , 6 patients ( 20.0% ) with barely visible scars , and 23 patients ( 76.7% ) with invisible scars . infection was noted in 2 patients ( 6.7% ) in group b , compared to 6 patients ( 20.0% ) in group a at 3 months postoperatively . the cause of the infection could be traced to the infected plates that were removed under local anesthesia , and patients were prescribed a course of oral antibiotics for 5 days . no cases of malunion or non - union were noted in the two groups . with regard to postoperative occlusion , 28 patients in group b had a score of 1 ( pre - trauma occlusion ) , compared to 16 patients in group a ( p=0.027 , significant ) . twelve patients in group a had a score of 2 ( mild discrepancy ) , compared to 2 patients in group b ( p=0.016 , significant ) . two patients in group a had a score of 3 ( major discrepancy ) , compared to no patients in group b.(table 5 ) the occlusal discrepancy was noted only in the first week postsurgery in either group and was corrected using elastic traction in all patients .", "the mandibular angle is subjected to forces between the muscles of mastication and the supra - hyoid group of muscles , resulting in unstable rotation of distal and proximal fragments . the presence of an impacted third molar tooth in the line of fracture may result in the fracture being compounded intraorally , which may distract away from bone or interfere in ideal fracture reduction9 . although the management of mandibular angle fractures is still a topic of debate , the treatment is dictated by the principles of fixation and aesthetic demand by the patient . as treatments and equipment have evolved , miniplate fixation can now be carried out in an anatomically favorable position using a transbuccal approach . however , some surgeons do not prefer the transbuccal technique due to the theoretical risk of damage to the facial nerve and an unfavorable facial scar1011 . in this study of 60 patients , the incidence of mandibular angle fractures was seen in ages ranging from 17 to 53 years , with a mean age of 26.73 years . the peak incidence of fractures was seen in the second and third decades of life ( n=46 , 76.7% ) with a definite predilection in males ( n=58 ) . road traffic accidents was the most common etiological factor , ( n=52 , 86.7% ) followed by assault ( n=8 , 13.3% ) . the findings were in unison with a study conducted by kumar et al.12 , which reported the pattern of maxillofacial fractures in 2,731 patients . the highest incidence of fractures in this study was found in the second and third decades of life ( n=1,535 , 56% ) . road traffic accidents were the most frequent cause ( n=2,086 , 76% ) , followed by assault ( n=260 , 12% ) . another similar study13 looked at 214 patients and stated that the incidence of angle fractures was higher in the male population and was most common in the third decade of life . although we report that surgical access is facilitated with the transbuccal approach , we did not observe any statistically significant differences between the two approaches for this parameter . surgical time is defined as the time taken from incision and exposure of the fractured site to closure . this finding contradicted studies in the literature that have shown increased surgical time with the transbuccal approach when compared to the transoral approach1011 . radiographic evaluation of fracture reduction was performed by studying the gap using tracings done on the opg . however , points b ( p=0.030 ) , c ( p=0.016 ) , and d ( p=0.004 ) were statistically different between groups . the reduction obtained in group b was uniform from points a to d , whereas in group a , there was a gradual increase in the distance between the fractured segments . we believe that the favorable position of the miniplate in the transbuccal approach brings about better control of the tensile and compressive forces , resulting in more uniform reduction in the fracture gap from points b to d. this observation was in accordance with a study on three - dimensional models by kroon et al.14 and choi et al.15 , who observed bony gaps along the inferior fracture border and found that this fracture movement was a contributory factor for subsequent complications , including infection . a study by wan et al.4 states that in transbuccal approach , no patients developed facial nerve palsy , whereas 1 patient out of 227 ( 45% ) developed a hypertrophic scar from the 6-mm facial skin incision . another study by sugar et al.10 reported similar findings in a population of 84 patients . no incidence of unsatisfactory facial scarring and facial nerve palsy from the transbuccal approach was noted . this is in accordance with our study , which reported 1 case ( 3.3% ) of hypertrophic scarring and no incidence of facial nerve palsy in group b. three months after surgery , only two patients in group b had an infection , as compared to six patients in group a. this was due to the infected plate , which was retrieved under local anesthesia . a course of oral antibiotics for 5 days was subsequently prescribed and the healing was uneventful . a study by barry and kearns9 reported infection in 4 out of 50 patients in which the plate was retrieved at an out - patient department . another study by ellis and walker16 reported infection occurring within two weeks of surgery in 2 out of 81 patients ; this infection was treated initially with oral antibiotics , which resulted in normal fracture healing . the gold standard in management of mandibular fracture is to establish the pre - trauma occlusion with minimal postoperative complications . when postoperative occlusion was assessed , the transoral group had significantly more occlusal discrepancy than the transbuccal group . the discrepancy in occlusion was observed only in the first week postsurgery and was managed using light guiding elastics in all patients , with no re - surgical intervention required in any patient . malocclusion may be due to the presence of concomitant fractures which may contribute to instability at the mandibular angle fracture site10 . this is in concordance with our study , which showed concomitant fractures in 11 patients ( 73.3% ) in group a and 9 patients ( 60% ) in group b. the rate of postoperative malocclusion reported in the literature ranges from 0% to as high as 7.5% . sugar et al.10 presented a study showing a strong preference of surgeons for fixation using a transbuccal approach . the principal reasons given were ease of use , minimal requirement for plate bending , and facilitation of plate placement in the neutral mid - point area of the mandible . our experience with the transbuccal approach was somewhat similar . a meta - analysis by al - moraissi and ellis17 states that the use of one miniplate is superior to the use of two miniplates in the management of mandibular angle fractures , as the incidence of postoperative complications was considerably lower . this is concordant with the present study , which showed better results when a single miniplate was used either transorally or transbuccally .", "in conclusion , although both approaches have inherent advantages and disadvantages , the transbuccal approach was superior to the transoral approach with regard to radiographic reduction in the fracture gap , inconspicuous external scarring , and fewer postoperative complications . we did not find increased operating time or damage to the facial nerve , which was observed by other authors when the transbuccal approach was employed . we preferred the transbuccal approach over the transoral approach due to ease of use , minimal requirement for plate bending , and facilitation of plate placement in the neutral mid - point area of the mandible . a study employing a larger sample size and without any confounding variables is ongoing to define our results even more precisely ."], "summary": "objectiveswe compared the transbuccal and transoral approaches in the management of mandibular angle fractures.materials and methodssixty patients with mandibular angle fractures were randomly divided into two equal groups ( a , transoral approach ; group b , transbuccal approach ) who received fracture reduction using a single 2.5 mm 4 holed miniplate with a bar using either of the two approaches . intraoperatively , the surgical time and the ease of surgical assess for fixation were noted . patients were followed at 1 week , 3 months , and 6 months postoperatively and evaluated clinically for post -

percha and the wall of the canal . several techniques of sealer placement have been described in the literature , such as the use of a file , lentulo spiral , absorbent paper point , gutta - percha cone , and an ultrasonic file . each technique may produce different distribution of the sealer onto the canal walls , which may affect the sealing . at present , there is no evidence to suggest that one method is better and reliable than others . hence , the purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of three most commonly used methods of sealer placement on the sealing ability of the sealer .", "one hundred and nineteen ( 119 ) human permanent central incisors teeth that had no caries , restorations , or any other noticeable defects were collected , stored in 0.9% isotonic saline , and used in this in vitro study . the crowns of the teeth were removed at the cementoenamel junction by using a hard tissue cutter ( exact , germany ) under water cooling . the working length was determined by introducing a size 10 k file into the canal until it could be seen at the apical foramen . this length was measured and the working length was set 1 mm short of the resultant measurement . all the teeth were instrumented to a size f3 protaper ( dentsply maillefer , switzerland ) following the full sequence recommended by the manufacturer . during preparation and between each protaper file , the canals were irrigated with 2 ml of 5.25% naocl by using a disposable syringe and a 25-gauge needle . also a size 10 hand file was introduced to remove any debris and to ensure the patency of the apical foramen . all root canals were then irrigated with 5 ml of 17% ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid ( edta ) followed by 5 ml of 5.25% naocl . finally , the root canals were flushed with distilled water and dried with absorbent paper points . the instrumented teeth were divided randomly into 3 experimental groups of 33 teeth each in addition to 2 groups which served as positive and negative control groups of 10 teeth each [ table 1 ] . groups , number of specimens , and sealer placement techniques root canal obturation was performed by using the cold lateral condensation technique . after sealer application according to the groups as shown in table 1 , the prefitted size 30 master gutta - percha cone was placed . the process was repeated until the spreader penetrated only into the coronal one - third of the root canal space . excess gutta - percha was removed with a heated instrument and the remainder was condensed vertically with a cold plugger . the teeth were stored in 100% humidity at 37c for 7 days to allow the sealer to set completely . after 7 days the external root surfaces were coated by two layers of nail polish except the coronal orifices . in the positive control group , no sealer was used and the nail polish was applied as the experimental group . while in the negative control group , the instrumented canals were filled with the sealer using rotary lentulo spiral and cold lateral compaction . then , the external root surfaces were entirely coated with two layers of nail polish , including the coronal orifices . each tooth was subsequently immersed in an aqueous solution of 2% methylene blue dye with ph 7.0 in an individual container and kept in the incubator at 37c for 3 days . the specimens were then decalcified in 5% nitric acid for 72 h and dehydrated gradually in ascending concentrations of alcohol to 100% . methyl salicylate was used overnight to clear the teeth . for linear dye penetration assessment , each tooth was sectioned longitudinally by using a hard tissue cutter ( exakt , japan ) . measurements were done by a blinded assessor under a light microscope ( leica , germany ) at x20 magnification . the coronal leakage was measured to the nearest 0.01 mm , from the coronal end of gutta - percha , to the most apical extent of dye , taking into consideration the region of highest penetration . this was completed using leica image analyzer software ( leica , germany ) , connected to the microscope . ten teeth of each experimental group were randomly selected and dye penetration was measured again after 1 week by the same investigator to determine examiner reliability . the data of the first and second measurements were tested using a single - measured intraclass correlation statistic ( icc ) . the difference in the amount of linear dye penetration between groups was compared using anova .", "the icc was 0.99 ( 95% ci : 0.991.00 ) suggestive of a high examiner reliability . due to technical problems during the experiment , one specimen was lost in group g1 , resulting in 32 samples for this group . the positive controls demonstrated complete dye penetration throughout the length of the canal in all teeth . in contrast , the negative controls showed no evidence of leakage in any of the samples . means of linear dye penetration and standard deviations for all groups are summarized in table 2 . there was no significant difference ( p = 0.305 ) of dye penetration among all groups .", "one of the objectives of root canal treatment is to provide a hermetic seal of root canal space . this seal is usually produced by using a semisolid or solid core material in a combination with the endodontic sealer . a solid core can not produce the desired hermetic seal ; thus , the endodontic sealer is required to provide three - dimensional obturation . the experimental system of this study was tested by using both positive and negative control groups . the positive control specimens showed total dye penetration throughout the root canal , which indicated that it is absolutely necessary to use a sealer to fill voids and gaps between the core material and the root canal walls and further confirmed the fact that filling the root canal with only the core obturating material without a sealer resulted in an increased leakage . however , the negative control specimens demonstrated no dye penetration , which indicated that two coatings of nail polish were an effective means of preventing dye penetration . the results of this study showed no statistically significant difference ( p = 0.305 ) in microleakage among the three different tested techniques of sealer placement . however , the rotary lentulo spiral group produced the highest value of microleakage and the master gutta - percha coating group had the smallest mean microleakage value . it was expected that the rotary lentulo spiral group will produce a better adaptation of the sealer onto the canal walls with even thickness which in turn leads to a better seal but the results of this study did not support our assumption . first , more amount of sealer was introduced into the canal as compared with other techniques , and as the sealer shrunk during setting , more gaps and voids might had been created that had contributed to the highest value of microleakage . second , a high volume of the sealer material may also interfere with the placement of additional accessory points which leads to less gutta - percha volume percentage compared to the amount of sealer . third , the use of rotary lentulo spiral during sealer placement may force some air bubbles into the material that will lead to void formation and microleakage , whereas , the endodontic sealer coating of master gutta - percha cone produced less sealer thickness with less potential void formation compared to the other techniques that eventually might have contributed to the smallest microleakage value obtained by this group . our results are in accordance with wiemann et al . 's , who compared the influence of four methods , file , lentulo spiral , ultrasonic files , and master gutta - percha , of sealer placement on the sealer sealing ability . in addition , they reported that less sealer was present in the apical third compared to the coronal and middle thirds of the root canal . kahn et al . investigated the efficacy of six methods of sealer placement using clear plastic blocks with simulated curved canals . they concluded that the lentulo spiral and the max - i - probe delivery system were the most effective means of sealer placement , followed by ultrasonic and sonic files , and the least effective methods were the paper point and the k file . in this study , the three methods of sealer placement showed comparable results and could be used in clinical practice . however , as the master gutta - percha coating technique had produced the lowest microleakage values , it would be suggested to be used for better results . the master gutta - percha coating technique is the simplest method among the three methods tested and it requires no additional instruments and procedures . further research perhaps is needed to study the effect of different sealer placement methods with different obturation techniques .", "within its limitations , this study showed that the three tested techniques of sealer placement provided a comparable seal . however , the master gutta - percha coating technique could be preferable as it produced the least leakage value , and no extra instrumentation and procedures are needed in its application ."], "summary": "aim : the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the sealing ability of an endodontic sealer following different techniques of its placement.materials and methods : a total of 119 permanent human anterior teeth were prepared by using manual protaper and randomly divided into three equal groups of 33 teeth each . the teeth were obturated with the cold lateral condensation technique and ah26 sealer which was placed by using the following : g1 : rotary lentulo spiral ; g2 : manual lentulo spiral ; and g3 : master gutta - percha coating . the remaining 20 teeth served as positive and negative controls . the samples were immersed in the methylene blue solution for 3 days and longitudinally sectioned for dye penetration assessment and analyzed using a stereomicroscope.results:there was no statistically significant difference ( p = 0.305 ) among the three groups . however , the rotary lentulo spiral technique and the master gutta - percha coating technique showed the highest ( 4.5 mm ) and the lowest ( 3.8 mm ) microleakage values , respectively.conclusion:different techniques of sealer placement used in this study provided a comparable seal . however , the master gutta - percha coating technique might be preferable because of its ease of use .", "ranking": [3, 0, 1, 2, 4]}

Conclusions"], "document": ["allergic disease is an increasingly prevalent problem affecting up to one - third of the general population in industrialized countries . immunotherapy is a treatment modality that can modify the immunological response of the allergy sufferer so that the affected individual will stop reacting to involved allergens . immunotherapy is indicated for the treatment of allergic rhinitis ( ar ) and asthma , and it may prevent development of asthma in patients with ar [ 1 , 2 ] . immunotherapy can be administered by different routes amongst which we find injectable and oral vaccines . injectable vaccines refers to the classical subcutaneous injection immunotherapy ( scit ) usually known as  allergy shots .  oral vaccines refer to sublingual immunotherapy ( slit ) where the allergens are administered as drops to the sublingual area even though the term oral vaccines may also include allergy tablets . the purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of treatment results in patients with nasal allergies , with or without asthma , that were treated with either one or the other of these two treatment modalities : scit or slit . there is a voluminous body of scientific evidence that proves that these two treatment modalities are efficacious for the management of allergic conditions but the issue of these two modalities having similar efficacy has not yet been fully addressed . a review of the literature reveals only a few articles that directly address this issue [ 410 ] . in five of these reports [ 59 ] scit and slit is found to have better results , and one report   finds both equally effective for ar patients but scit more effective for asthmatic patients . in our own experience , slit and scit appear to be of similar efficacy   in this report the efficacy of one will be compared against the other . scit is a well - established treatment modality that has been successfully used for many decades and is relatively well tolerated . slit is also a very old treatment modality ( earliest description is from 1900 ) and yet , while commonly used in europe , it is still not well established in the usa . over the last 20 years the european medical community produced a large amount of high - quality evidence suggesting that slit is safer than scit [ 14 , 15 ] . while no single case of mortality has ever been reported with slit [ 12 , 16 ] this is not the case with scit [ 17 , 18 ] .", "this study constitutes a retrospective , consecutive chart review of allergy patients treated by the author at his private office . inclusion criteria were as follows : a patient of any age with nasal allergies with or without asthma that was treated with immunotherapy for at least for 6 months and had at least 2 complete evaluations . a complete evaluation implies symptom scoring , evaluation of medication use , and determination of the peak flow meter ( pfm ) value . these evaluations are done every 36 months as treatment progresses . because evaluations depend on patient 's cooperation not all the patients had the same number of evaluations , but any patient that was considered a candidate had to have 2 evaluations as a minimum . we compared the first evaluation ( pretreatment ) and the last evaluation the patient had just at the time of inclusion for the study . the symptoms in the pretreatment evaluation and the amount of medications the patient was taking at that time reflect how the patient was doing without immunotherapy treatment . \n ethical considerations . subjects ' privacy was respected by collecting and recording data in such a way that the subjects could not be identified , directly or indirectly , through identifiers linked to the subject . in other words , a patient 's confidentiality would be protected by entering data in a simple spreadsheet with nonspecific identifiers as patient no . 1 , patient no . 2 , and so forth with subsequent refiling of the patient 's chart , according to usual procedure . the content of the spread sheet became anonymous and ready for statistical analysis . after discussing with patient about their allergies and advising about environmental modification maneuvers a discussion about treatment options including immunotherapy follows . in our office scit or slit is used to treat patients with inhalant allergies with or without bronchial involvement . the decision to use one or the other economical considerations , living far from the office , busy schedule , or  needle phobia ,  are examples of when a patient may chose slit . having severe asthma , being a very young patient or having medical problems that may render administration of scit risky are examples of why the treating physician will advise slit . all patients were tested using a fivefold intradermal dilution skin test ( idt ) as taught by the aaoa [ 20 , 21 ] . the test includes several panels : dust , dander , epidermals , molds , and pollens for our geographic area ( table 1 ) . standardized antigens were used for testing and treatment whenever these were available ; otherwise weight / volume antigen extracts were used . after identifying the minimally reactive antigen concentration ( meaning first reactive wheal ) for each of the patient 's reactive allergens , scit vials or slit bottles were formulated including all of the positive results ( reactive allergens in the intradermal test ) in the treatment mixture . patients on slit were treated according to a previously published protocol   where the dose is slowly advanced from 1 drop per day to 5 drops per day until attaining the most concentrated mixture in the slit bottle . the formulation was the same for both injectable and oral vaccines . while the concentration of antigens is exactly the same for both scit and slit but slit is administered daily , patients on slit will receive a larger amount of antigen each week than those treated with scit . the slit bottles are mixed with 7.5  ml . if we consider a single allergen , for example , dermatophagoides pteronyssinus ( dp ) , standardized dust mite dp has a concentration of 10,000  au / ml containing 68  mcg / ml of der p 1 and 71  mcg / ml of der p 2 antigens . if the minimally reactive antigen concentration occurred at dilution no . 3 and dose was advanced until mixing a vial from manufacturer 's concentrate , the cumulative dose this patient would receive weekly by scit would be 200  au per week , while a patient treated by slit would receive 464  au per week . as stated before , the initial allergen concentration in both scit and slit is the same : 80  au / ml as in both circumstances the extract ( with 10.000  au / ml ) will be diluted 125 times . after one year of treatment the patient on scit would receive 9680  au and the patient treated by slit would receive 21149  au or 2.18 times more allergen . a chi - square test was applied for the following allergens : dust mite , cat , roach , mold , tree - pollens , grass - pollens , and weed - pollens for both groups , scit and slit . asthma diagnosis was based on the presence of recurrent cough , chest tightness , sob , or wheezing , having a spirometry consistent with airflow obstruction or having the symptoms respond to the administration of a short - acting broncho - agonist ( saba ) . recorded symptoms included runny nose , sneezing , nasal obstruction , itchy eyes , itchy ears , cough , shortness , and wheezing . these were scored according to fell 's method   with a numerical analog from 0 through 3 as follows : 0 = symptom not present , 2 = symptom is moderate , 3 = symptom is severe . medication use was also evaluated on a similar numerical scale as follows : 0 = medication is not being used , 1 = medication is being used once a week or less , 2 = medication is being used 23 times per week , 3 = medication is being used 4 or more times per week . medications were generically grouped as allergy pills , intranasal steroids ( inss ) , and short - acting broncho - agonists ( sabas ) in the case of asthmatic patients . the value of the pfm determination was used as the parameter to be recorded at each patient 's encounter .", "ninety - three charts met the inclusion criteria , 50 on scit and 43 on slit . among the 50 patient 's on scit , 20 ( 40% ) were male , 30 ( 60% ) female ranging in age from 2.33 to 75 years ( mean 45  17.8 sd ) . this compared to 43 patients on slit of whom 21 ( 49% ) were male , 22 ( 51% ) female ranging in age from 1.66 to 75 years ( mean 35  20.8 sd ) . analysis of covariance for the dependent variables for which a significant pre / posttreatment by treatment modality interaction effects was obtained did not reveal gender or age to account for significant dependent variable variance ; in other words the results were not affected by age or gender so both groups can be considered homogeneous . a chi - square test was applied for the following allergens : dust mite , cat , roach , mold , tree - pollens , grass - pollens , and weed - pollens . results indicate that there are no statistical differences between both groups ( at the p < 0.05 level ) ; therefore in their reactivity to allergens both groups can also be considered homogeneous . there were 3 children < 12 years on scit ( mean 7.8 years ) versus 11 on slit ( mean 6.9 years ) . ten ( 20% ) scit patients had asthma versus 12 ( 28% ) on slit . thus a greater percentage of asthmatics ( 12/22 or 55% ) and more children under 12 years of age ( 11/14 or 79% ) were on slit . length of treatment for the scit group was 12 to 86 ( mean 31  18.7 sd ) months and for the slit group was 10 to 32 ( mean 19  6.3 sd ) months . for all patients the pre- and posttreatment averages for each symptom , medication use , and pf value were statistically compared through the use of repeated measure analysis of variance ( anova ) . the results for the two treatment modalities ( scit versus slit ) were also compared using the between - subjects factor of the anova ( table 2 ) . the same analyses were completed for medication use ( table 3 ) . for the pf evaluation the pre- and post - treatment values were compared ( table 4 ) . in table 2 the mean value for each symptom score before treatment and at the time of data collection the result of the test of significance is shown for each symptom within each treatment modality ( paired t - test ) . lastly , the result of the statistical analysis comparing symptom improvement with one or the other treatment modality is shown . shortness of breath and wheezing had significant improvements at p < 0.05 for both treatment modalities . the remaining symptoms had a significant improvement at p < 0.001 for both treatment modalities . wheezing and coughing were the only symptom scores which seemed to respond better to either scit ( coughing slightly better , p = 0.037 ) or slit ( wheezing slightly better , p = 0.024 ) , though both symptoms significantly improved regardless of treatment modality . both scit and slit provided equally significant reduction in use of medication ( p < 0.001 ) including allergy pills , ins , and , to a slightly lesser but still significant degree , saba ( table 3 ) but without no significant difference between both treatment modalities . pf value before treatment and at the time of the last patient evaluation is shown in table 4 . both treatment modalities were equally effective in achieving a significant increase in pf values ( p < 0.001 ) but there was no significant difference between both treatment modalities .", "this paper is a retrospective chart review and as such lacks the rigor of a prospective randomized study with a placebo control group which is very difficult to do in a private office setting . while an analysis of covariance is useful , it is not a perfect solution . a future , larger - scale study should be planned to include the above design characteristics . we observed that patients usually come to the office already using one or more allergy medications . this study , like others , demonstrates that immunotherapy , whether scit or slit , will lead to the reduction of medication use for ar and/or asthma . it was not the purpose of this paper to evaluate the effect of medications on allergy symptoms but rather to compare the effects of scit versus slit on medication use . both treatment modalities resulted in the reduction of antihistamines , inhaled nasal steroids , and sabas . the slight imbalances in demographic characteristics between the groups on scit versus slit were not statistically significant and did not affect the statistical results . the reason why there are more young patients and more asthmatic patients in the slit group can be explained by the fact that slit is safer and easier to administer therefore it is suggested more frequently for these difficult - to - manage patients . indeed we would have expected a much more pronounced difference ; yet fewer than expected chose slit because it is not covered by insurance . patients on scit have been treated for a longer period of time because slit was added to our practice later than scit . the improvement of the asthmatic symptoms wheezing and sob and the decrease in saba use were significant at p < 0.05 yet because of sample size this is not as strong as the improvement in other symptoms or medications that had an improvement at the level of p < 0.001 . the advantage for scit in treating coughing is real , but the effect size ( eta - squared ) is only 0.025 , meaning that it only accounts for 2.5% of the variance in pre- versus posttreatment differences , which is not much . the advantage of slit in treating wheezing may have been influenced by our own bias of suggesting slit use to asthmatic patients as a safer treating modality . it is therefore more likely that patients with higher symptom scores were present in the slit group . our findings demonstrate that slit is not only effective in controlling symptoms in nasal allergy patients with or without asthma , in decreasing medication use in such patients , and in improving parameters of pulmonary function , but it also appears that slit is as effective as scit these findings are in agreement with those published in the european literature [ 26 , 27 ] but certainly this presentation lacks the scientific validity of other reports   that present a prospective , randomized , controlled study ; therefore this presentation we hope will serve as a stimulus for centers with the capability to undertake such a study to continue with this line of research . this would help the fda to finally recognize slit as an effective and safe treatment modality . if slit became an fda - approved treatment modality ( and hopefully ) reimbursed by insurance companies many more patients might be receptive to immunotherapy which is a treatment capable of altering the immunological mechanisms responsible for the development of allergic conditions . pf values for asthma control should be taken as a guideline only because the predicted lung function has a high degree of variability with significant differences in pf values according to presence or not of lung disease , smoking , age , sex , and even patient 's social environment [ 2931 ] . having the advantage of providing results quickly , and requiring little training ( from the patient as well as from the technical staff ) , the pfm device is useful to monitor progress during immunotherapy . it is most useful when the changes in pf values are compared to the initial value of each patient , recorded at the time of treatment initiation . for the purpose of this study individual improvement with therapy is not reported , but rather an overall trend , thus the use of pfm provides a gross indicator of change . some of our patients were children , and it is expected they grow during treatment . certainly using a pfm as a tool to determine improvement in pulmonary function adds uncertainty as to whether the improvement in pf value is related to clinical improvement or to the growth of the patient during treatment . in this we have demonstrated that the pf value in patients treated by immunotherapy increases regardless of age or asthmatic condition . in our experience , the use of slit with multiple antigens has enabled us to treat patients that otherwise would have not received immunotherapy , or would have not continued to receive immunotherapy , like asthmatic patients with poorly controlled asthma , patients that had severe arm reactions , very young patients to whom it is difficult to administer shots or patients whose schedules prevent them from being compliant .", "these results suggest that scit and slit exhibit similar efficacy . slit objectively improves symptom scores for asthma and ar while decreasing medication usage of allergy medications and sabas . given the increased risk and difficulty in treating asthmatic and young patients , these results would suggest that slit should be considered as the main treatment modality for these patients , considering scit only for treatment failures . the results of this study are in agreement with the european literature and therefore would support the inclusion of slit in the routine management of the allergic disease ."], "summary": "while it is generally accepted that subcutaneous injection immunotherapy ( scit ) and sublingual immunotherapy ( slit ) are both efficacious , there is not yet a significant amount of information regarding their comparative efficacy . in this paper , we performed a retrospective chart review and compared treatment results in two groups of patients ( both with nasal allergies with or without asthma ) that were treated either with scit or slit . both treatment modalities were found to be of similar efficacy .", "ranking": [0, 3, 1, 4, 2]}

up , however , severe and frequent bleeding should be managed by the intervention or surgery.10 the diagnosis of ectopic variceal bleeding is difficult , because of its intermittent nature and small amount . some authors recommended that enteroscopy was a useful method for detecting varices in the small bowel.5 in addition , varices in the gallbladder and the common bile duct were seen as mural filling defects on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.11 however , the varix bleeding at the afferent loop is limited for the diagnosis with endoscopy due to angulation of the jejunojejunostomy and hardness of technical handling . some authors reported that duplex ultrasonography demonstrated the varices with the presence of serpentine vessels and a low - velocity venous signal.12 to date , the useful methods for detecting ectopic variceal bleeding have been known as ct , rbc scan , and conventional angiography , such as superior mesenteric artery portography and percutaneous transhepatic portography.3461314 in the present case , jejunal varices were suspected by the multidetector contrast - enhanced ct angiography , which were confirmed with percutaneous transhepatic portography . after the procedure and surgery , ct was a useful and safe method to evaluate the change in collateral vessels . the treatment of jejunal varices around the hepaticojejunostomy have not been well established , but stenting has been the preferred treatment modality ( table 1 ) . the resection of jejunum containing the varices was reported.15 however , the resection was not a good modality , because it caused massive intraoperative varix bleeding and recurrent jejunal varices . paquet et al.16 reported that a meso - caval interposition shunt was successfully performed to treat jejunal varices in the afferent loop after a billroth - ii resection and hepaticoduodenostomy , and no recurrence after 24 months . in the case 2 presented here , we performed the meso - caval shunt operation between the smv and the ivc , resulting in current control of this patient 's varix bleeding . however , this shunt operation has a risk for occlusion , the possibility of encephalopathy , and operative morbidities . therefore , chen et al.17 performed a proximal splenic - left intrahepatic portal shunt operation for extrahepatic portal vein obstruction . this procedure is considered in cases for which the adhesion is not severe and the intrahepatic portal vein and splenic vein are patent . however , the shunt operation and resection are aggressive , causing more complications than interventional approaches . therefore , the percutaneous transhepatic balloon dilatation with stent placement for extrahepatic portal vein obstruction has been preferred in the clinical practice since harville et al.18 performed this procedure for the treatment of colon varices . although the long - term patency of the stent has not yet been established and the rupture risk during the procedure has existed , it has been preferred because it is far less invasive and has favorable results.1418 in the case 1 , the patient was treated with the insertion of a stent and showed no bleeding for 32 months . on the other hand , however , the recurrence was common and several times additional procedures were required in order to control the bleeding . at last , the transcatheter embolization was considered to occlude the jejunal vein to supply the afferent loop.1618 this procedure had the advantage of selecting the collateral vein and preserving the hepatopetal flow . however , it required a laparotomy and had the chance of relapse . in conclusion , the variceal bleeding of the afferent loop after pppd can trigger massive and life - threatening bleeding . after detecting the varix bleeding using ct and conventional angiography , the treatment of varices in this area is recommended with less invasive approach , such as the angiographic interventions of balloon dilatation and stent insertion . surgical shunt operation can be considered when noninvasive approaches have failed ."], "summary": "we present 2 patients showing afferent jejunal varix bleeding around hepaticojejunostomy caused by extrahepatic portal vein obstruction after pylorus - preserving pancreatoduodenectomy ( pppd ) . the case 1 was a 58-year - old woman who had recurrent anemia and hematochezia 3 years after undergoing pppd . on the portography , the main portal vein was obliterated and collaterals around hepaticojejunostomy were developed . after percutaneous transhepatic balloon dilatation and stent placement through the obliterated portal vein , jejunal varices had disappeared and thereafter no bleeding occurred for 32 months . the case 2 was a 71-year - old man who had frequent melena 7 years after pppd . portal stent insertion was first tried , but failed due to severe stenosis of the main portal vein . therefore , meso - caval shunt operation was attempted in order to reduce the variceal flow . although an episode of a small amount of melena occurred one month after the shunt operation , there was no occurrence of bleeding for the next 8 months . for the treatment of jejunal varices , a less invasive approach , such as the angiographic intervention of stent insertion , balloon dilatation , or embolization is recommended first . surgical operations , such as a shunt or resection of the jejunal rim , could be considered when noninvasive approaches have failed .", "ranking": [0, 2, 1, 4, 3]}

however , phenols did not undergo transesterification . a procedure for the acetylation of alcohols , amines and phenols with isopropenyl acetate and iodine as a catalyser under solvent - free conditions were described by ahmed and van lier . recently , jereb and coworkers have demonstrated that iodine is an efficient catalyst for esterification under solvent - free conditions for several alcohols . we describe herein a simple and convenient procedure for acylation of chiral alcohols under solvent - free conditions in the presence of a catalytic amount of iodine with no by - products formation and using near equimolar amounts of alcohol and carboxylic acid ( scheme 1 ) . initially , a systematic study was carried out for catalytic evaluation of iodine in the acetylation of 2-heptanol . further , the optimized method was applied to ( r)-2-heptanol and cis-1,3-cyclohexanediol to determine that no isomerization occurred with acetylation or trifluoroacetylation . all the esters were analyzed by gas chromatography on a cp chirasil - dex cb column in order to provide optimum resolution for a chiral alcohol of a particular structural type .", "3-hexanol ( 4 ) , 4-methyl-2-pentanol ( 5 ) , 3-methylcyclopentanol ( 9 ) , 3-methylcyclohexanol ( 10 ) , 2-tert - butylcyclohexanol ( 11 ) , 2-methylcyclopentanol ( 12 ) , 4-methylcyclohexanol ( 13 ) , 2-chlorocyclohexanol ( 14 ) , 2,6-dimethylcyclohexanol ( 15 ) , 4-tert - butylcyclohexanol ( 16 ) , 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexanol ( 17 ) , 2-phenylcyclohexanol ( 18 ) , dl - menthol ( 19 ) , 1,2-cyclohexanediol ( 20 ) , 1,3-cyclohexanediol ( 21 ) , iodine , and acetic acid were all from acros organics , barcelona , spain . 2-butanol ( 1 ) , s-2-butanol , 2-hexanol ( 3 ) , s-2-hexanol , trans - s , s-1,2-cyclohexanediol , trans - r , r-1,2-cyclohexanediol , 2-heptanol ( 6 ) , r-2-heptanol , ( + ) -menthol , and tert - butanol were purchased from fluka , madrid , spain . 2-octanol ( 7 ) , 3-octanol ( 8) , and cis-1,2-cyclohexanediol were from sigma - aldrich , madrid , spain . 1-methylhexyl acetate was obtained by stirring at 100c for 48  h in a screw - cap vial a mixture of 2-heptanol ( 20  mmol ) , acetic acid ( 200  mmol ) , iodine ( 0.6  mmol ) and anh . the organic solution was washed with saturated sodium thiosulfate solution , saturated nhco3 solution , and water . hexane was stripped off by distillation at 69c at atmospheric temperature and the 1-methylhexyl acetate was obtained . the product was characterized by nmr h and c. mixtures of 2-heptanol ( 2  mmol ) , acetic acid at different molar ratios ( 2 , 3 , 4 , 12 , and 20  mmol ) containing iodine ( 0.06  mmol ) and tridecane ( 4  mmol ) as internal standard , anh . na2so4 ( 0.02  mmol ) either without solvent or dissolved in 0.5  ml ( 7  mmol ) tert - butanol were stirred at different temperatures ( 100 , 120 , and 140c ) for different reaction times ( 4 , 8 , 24 and 48  h ) in 3  ml amber screw - cap vials . the filtrate was used for gc analysis directly and analysed in a db - wax capillary column as described in the following . reactions were carried out in triplicate .   a mixture of alcohol ( 2  mmol ) , either acetic acid or trifluoroacetic acid ( 3  mmol , iodine ( 0.06  mmol ) , and anh . na2so4 ( 0.02  mmol ) ) were stirred at 100c for 48  h in a 3  ml amber screw - cap vial . the reaction product was dissolved in 1  ml dichloromethane , filtered and analysed by both gc / ms and chiral phase gc analysis as described in what follows .

adjustment method was carried out by the sas software version 9.0 ( sas institute , inc ) . all the statistical tests applied in this work were employed to determine the statistical differences among 1-methylhexyl acetate yields when reaction optimizations were carried out .", "first of all , the acetylation was studied with the presence of a tertiary alcohol , tert - butanol , or without solvent , at various molar ratios alcohol  :  acetic acid with 1 equiv . of acetic acid in the presence of 3  mol % of iodine at 100c for 24 and 48  clearly , tert - butanol makes the reaction slower , needing a 1  :  6 molar ratio and 48  h ( entry 11 ) . we obtained the maximum yield at a 1  :  2 molar ratio for 24  h without using any solvent ( entry 1 ) . similar behaviour has also been described by jereb and coworkers   using dichloromethane as solvent . they carried out the same reaction with other alcohols using a 1  :  3 molar excess of acetic acid in a free solvent system . then , we investigated the influence of lower molar ratios alcohol  :  acetic acid and different reaction times in a solvent - free system ( table 2 ) . with a 1  :  1 molar ratio alcohol  : acid the best yield was obtained after 48  h reaction ( entry 2 ) . with 1  :  1.5 and 1  :  2 molar ratios acetylation only required half the time ( 24  h ) to obtain no statistically different results ( entries 4 , 8) . remarkably in terms of atom economy , a 1  :  1 molar ratio was sufficient , but a longer reaction time was needed to reach a high yield . in order to shorten the reaction times , complementary studies were carried out , increasing the reaction temperature ( table 3 ) . we decided to carry out the subsequent reactions using a 1  :  1.5 molar ratio alcohol  :  acid at 100c for 24  h in a solvent - free system . however , considering that the main target was to determine the % ee of a chiral alcohol , it could be not necessary to achieve a high yield of acetylation . therefore , an equimolecular molar ratio alcohol  :  acid at 100c for 4  h could be sufficient . this method is a simple and greener alternative to conventional methods that typically are performed with activated carboxylic acid derivatives such as acid anhydrides , acid chlorides , acyl imidazoles , or acylureas , which need the presence of tertiary amines such as triethylamine , pyridine , or dmap [ 1520 ] . moreover , any solvent was needed [ 28 , 29 ] , there were not any byproducts formation , and an equimolar amount of reactives can be used . according to these results , we proved the stability of the chiral carbons in the selected conditions . figures 1 and 2 show the results obtained after acetylation of racemic 2-heptanol and ( r)-2-heptanol . similar results were obtained using trans-1,3-cyclohexanediol and cis-1,3-cyclohexanediol ( figures 3 , 4 , and 5 ) , indicating that the derivatization process did not cause any isomerization of the chiral carbons of the two molecules . jereb and coworkers also studied the stereochemical behaviour of some secondary cyclic aliphatic alcohols and 1-phenylethanols in their acetylation reactions with iodine as a catalyst . the aliphatic cyclic alcohols studied yielded esters with retention of stereochemistry , but a loss of stereochemical integrity was observed in chiral 1-phenylethanols . no data was provided about the behaviour of acyclic secondary alcohols or diols in these conditions . moreover , we also studied the stability of these chiral carbons using trifluoroacetic acid instead of acetic acid . in this case , a partial isomerization was observed making unsuitable this acid for acylation ( results not showed ) .   afterwards , three series of alcohols were tested with this acylation method to determine the applicability of the method to study the stereochemical ratio between isomers . the improvement in the separation factors (  ) related to the free alcohols was determined . a resolution factor of 1.5 or greater indicates baseline enantiomeric resolution .  \n the best  was obtained with 2-pentyl acetates that have a separation factor value of 3.00 compared with the 1.07 corresponding to the free alcohols . to our knowledge no better  higher  increases were also observed for 2-butanol acetate derivatives ( 1.44 compared with 1.05 ) , 2-hexanol acetate derivatives ( 1.95 compared with 1.05 ) and 2-octanol acetate derivatives ( 1.50 compared with 1.02 ) . smith and simpson   investigated the separation of enantiomers of these acyclic alcohols on a -trifluoroacetylated cyclodextrin phase at 35c , showing for the majority of them an  value similar to or lower than those obtained in our -cyclodextrin column and lower than our corresponding acylated derivatives .   the elution order of the acetylated enantiomers of some alcohols , entries 2 , 4 , 6,7 , and 8 , was assumed from the literature [ 34 , 35 ] . we would remark that the elution order of ( )-enantiomers and ( + ) -enantiomers depends on some factors such as cyclodextrin type (  ,  ,  : on a -cd derivative all ( )-enantiomers eluted before the ( + ) -enantiomers ) , the stereoconfiguration of the product ( it can have a dominant influence on chiral interactions , leading to the reversal of the elution order ) , cyclodextrin derivative types , and temperature . moreover , acylation with acetic acid allows the four stereoisomers of 3-methyl-1-cyclopentanol ( entry 1 ) , 3-methyl-1-cyclohexanol ( entry 2 ) , and 2-tert - butyl-1-cyclohexanol ( entry 3 ) to be separated . moreover , acetylation of 2-chloro-1-cyclohexanol ( entry 6 ) and 4-tert - butyl-1-cyclohexanol ( entry 7 ) increases the separation factor .   when the acylation method was applied to polysubstituted cyclic alcohols , the results were not as good as previous ones . now , only acetylation of d , l - menthol produced an increase in the separation factor value of the two enantiomers . they have already demonstrated that any isomerization was provoked in both compounds when acetylated separately . the  value was higher than the  obtained in some  ,  , and  permethylated cyclodextrins [ 13 , 33 ] and in stationary gc phases of other cyclodextrin derivatives [ 3941 ] .   finally the acylation method was applied to three diols : 1,2-octanediol , 1,2-cyclohexanediol , and 1,3-cyclohexanediol ( table 6 ) . now , one or both hydroxyl groups can be acetylated . in order to determine the retention time of the mono and diacetylated stereoisomers , two acylations reactions were carried out , one with a 1  :  4 molar ratio alcohol  :  acid and the other with a 1  :  1.5 molar ratio . when the molar ratio alcohol  :  acid was 1  :  1.5 , there were more molecules with only one hydroxyl group acetylated than with the two hydroxyl groups acetylated ( figures 3 , 4 and 5 ) . however , when the molar ratio was 1  :  4 , the numbers of diacetylated molecules were higher than the monoacetylated molecules . the samples were also analysed by nmr and the h and c spectra were in concordance with the chromatograms . the acetylation of one hydroxyl group increased the  value , compared with their corresponding alcohols ; moreover , the  value was higher when both hydroxyl groups were acetylated . thus , the diacetylation of 1,2-octanediol produced an increase in the separation factor value of the two enantiomers ( 1.03 for the diol and 1.34 for the diacetylated derivative ) .   li et al . obtained a similar  value ( 1.05 ) for the 1,2-octanediol on a -2,6-di - o - pentyl-3-o - trifluoroacetylated cyclodextrin but lower than the separation of mono- and diacetates in our column . the acetylation of trans-1,3-cyclohexanediol allowed the separation of its stereoisomers and the two sets of 1,2-cyclohexanediol stereoisomers were separated when acetylation of one of the hydroxyl groups took place . however , when one of the hydroxyl groups was acetylated one chiral carbon was formed and the enantiomers could be separated in the column . when both hydroxyls groups were acetylated , the compound was again a meso - form . finally , we would like to point out the simple handling of the reaction carried out prior to the gc analysis . any further treatment is not needed once the reaction is finished but dilution and filtration of the reaction crude . any loss of resolution capacity has not been observed in the chromatographic column after carrying out all of the described studies .", "we have demonstrated that the present procedure with iodine / carboxylic acid without adding solvent provides a very efficient method of esterification of numerous acyclic and cyclic chiral alcohols . the main advantages of this method are its operational simplicity , the ready availability , and nontoxic nature of the reagent , and its general applicability . near equimolar amounts of alcohol and carboxylic acid are typically used , thus avoiding waste and providing very simple experimental and workup procedures . furthermore , acetylation of acyclic and cyclic alcohols usually increases the separation factor of the isomers .", "1-ethylbutyl acetate \n h nmr ( 400  mhz ,

Conclusions"], "document": ["the term  cancer  refers to a set of conditions that have the growth of cells that invade tissues and organs of the human body in common . the causes of cancer are varied , but psychological and behavioral factors such as chronic stress , depression , and social isolation may contribute to the initiation and progression of certain cancers [ 2 , 3 ] . conversely , cancer is a risk factor for the development of mental disorders . symptoms of psychological and physical distress may emerge during cancer treatment in combination with disease systems [ 46 ] . attention to the psychosocial aspects of the disease is equally important to cancer treatment , especially regarding psychopathologies because they significantly impact morbidity , low adherence to treatment , hospitalization duration , prognosis , quality of life , and patient survival [ 811 ] . the estimated prevalence of psychiatric disorders in individuals with cancer is approximately 20 to 50% [ 1214 ] , and depression exhibits the highest rates [ 1518 ] . psychiatric disorders and symptoms may represent an adjustment reaction to the disease condition , and these symptoms may also be associated with a general medical condition , such as delirium . clinical complications and metabolic changes , such as hypercalcemia , anemia , vitamin b12 deficiency , and electrolyte imbalance , are also risk factors for mental disorders in cancer patients , especially depression . therefore , the impact of the cancer and the associated clinical conditions may promote the development of psychiatric disorders , especially mood disorders and psychotic symptoms [ 20 , 21 ] . pathological anxiety may be present in physical diseases , medication and drug use , alcohol withdrawal , central nervous system depressants , and the so - called anxiety disorders [ 22 , 23 ] . the prevalence of anxiety in cancer patients varies between 10 and 30% [ 24 , 25 ] , and it is often associated with the diagnosis stage , procedure performance , and uncertainty about the future [ 20 , 21 ] . the abuse of psychoactive substances is directly associated with physical diseases , such as cirrhosis , cancer , and cardiovascular disease . the consumption of alcohol and tobacco is a well - established and prominent etiological factor in patients with malignancy in the lungs and esophagus . mental disorders may appear as comorbidities with the clinical condition , which may negatively impact disease diagnosis and treatment and emotional and financial costs [ 911 ] . however , oncology clinicians poorly identify mental disorders and their most common symptoms , despite the good responses to pharmacological and/or psychosocial interventions [ 2831 ] . knowledge of the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in this specific population may increase awareness and identification and mobilize resources for prevention and treatment [ 6 , 32 ] . early screening for behavioral and/or psychological / psychiatric disorders in patients seen in health care settings positively affects health care quality and decreases suffering and institutional operational costs . this study evaluated a statistically estimated sample of cancer outpatients at a hospital specializing in cancer according to the presence / absence of major mental symptoms / disorders using simple and quick screening instruments across different oncology specialties .", "statistical calculations determined that a minimum sample size of 1,155 subjects was required with an error rate of 3% . the subjects were recruited from a single hospital specializing in cancer , and all subjects were receiving outpatient care ( new or return cases ) in different oncology specialties . the following exclusion criteria were adopted : severe cognitive impairment as qualitatively evaluated by the applicator and the absence of clinical conditions that would affect responses to the instruments . the following self -

test , chi - square , and pearson correlation test ) were used for data analysis", "the sample included adult individuals ( mean = 50.3 ; dp = 13.9 ) of both genders with a slight predominance of women ( 55.8% ) . the sample included subjects with incomplete / completed elementary school ( 59% ) , married or in a stable relationship ( 67.4% ) , with children ( 86.7% ) , and not active from a labor viewpoint ( 61.3% ) . a total of 79.5% of the sample followed some type of religion , most often catholicism ( 68% ) . approximately 80% of the sample had no previous psychiatric / psychological history or psychiatric antecedents . the prevalence of different indicators of psychiatric disorders in the total sample and according to different oncology specialties is shown in table 1 . anxiety 's symptoms rates between 21.4% and 27.3% were observed for the total group , and gynecology , mastology , and thorax specialties were prominent ( table 1 ) . the prevalence of depression indicators was 18.5% for the total group , and gynecology , orthopedics , and thorax exhibited the highest rates . the percentage prevalence of these abuse rates was higher in the upper digestive , thorax , head and neck , and urology specialties , reaching levels in excess of 30% . prevalence indicators for different sociodemographic characteristics of the sample are shown in tables 2 and 3 . women had higher anxiety indicators prevalence rates than men , and unmarried subjects exhibited higher anxiety rates than married subjects . this difference according to marital status was observed using the phq-4 a instrument , but it was not confirmed using the gad-7 instrument . higher rates of symptoms of depression were associated with females , unmarried , and widowed subjects and subjects who were professionally inactive . the rates of substance abuse ( alcohol and tobacco ) were more significant in men , married , and divorced individuals , subjects with less education , subjects who were not professionally active , and subjects who did not follow any religion ( table 3 ) . the comorbidity rate in the total sample and among different oncology specialties is also noteworthy : 27.1% of the sample exhibited at least one comorbidity , with a prevalence of cooccurrence of anxiety and depression of 11.8% , and 6.6% of the sample had more than two comorbidities . a total of 43.4% of patients in the thorax / lung specialty , 33.5% of the upper digestive specialty , and 29.8% of the urology specialty exhibited indicators of more than one mental disorder .", "cancer and psychiatric symptoms / disorders are strongly associated , and the present study evaluated this association in cancer outpatients undergoing treatment . screening instruments evaluated symptoms of depression , anxiety , and substance abuse / chemical dependence . the data showed depression indicators prevalence of 18.5% , which is greater than a previous brazilian epidemiological study of 9.4%   but similar to a meta - analysis that reported a 16.3% depression rate in cancer patients at clinics and cancer hospitals . these data corroborate previous reports of the prevalence of depression in this clinical group . the prevalence of anxiety indicators varied between 21.4% and 27.3% , which are similar to primary care users ( 27.9% ) as determined using observer - assessment interviews . these data reinforce the important association between physical disease and anxiety , regardless of treatment context . moreover , the rate of anxiety indicators in this study is high compared to a previous study that diagnosed 7.6% of cancer patients with an anxiety disorder using a diagnostic interview . however , the choice of instrument may explain this difference , and the present study used screening instruments that measure anxiety symptoms rather than specific disorders . this level is higher than patients admitted to general medical specialties ( 9.8% ) and hospitalized cancer patients ( 15.5% ) , who were all evaluated using a screening instrument . the tobacco abuse rate for the total sample was 40.2% , which was similar to the prevalence of 44% in patients admitted to gastroenterology and pulmonology wards using screening scales and diagnostic interviews . these findings suggest tobacco use as a possible risk factor , especially for oncological diseases of the respiratory system . the gynecology , mastology , and thorax specialties showed the highest rates of depression and anxiety indicators . one possible explanation for this finding is the exclusive presence of women in the first two specialties . other evaluation studies of cancer patients reported that women subjects admitted to general hospitals or the general population exhibit high rates of depression and anxiety symptoms [ 31 , 4145 ] . it is possible too that , in thorax specialty , the poorer prognosis can favor these rates . one study evaluated 987 patients with lung cancer and found depressive symptoms in most subjects . another study evaluated patients with lung cancer using a self - administered hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) and found that 37% had depression symptoms . one possible explanation for this result is suggested by two other studies that showed an increased likelihood of depressive episodes in subjects during nicotine withdrawal , and an even greater likelihood for patients with a history of previous depressive episodes [ 49 , 50 ] . therefore , patients with lung cancer may begin a process of reduction or remission of their smoking habit and develop withdrawal symptoms , which promotes the onset of depression and anxiety symptoms . men predominated among patients abusing alcohol and tobacco , which has also been demonstrated in previous evaluations in the general population in different countries [ 39 , 5153 ] . therefore , these high rates and the behaviors associated with the male gender , who care less about health and engage in more risky behavior [ 5458 ] , support the use of these substances as a risk factor for disease development [ 27 , 5963 ] . the higher prevalence rates of alcohol and tobacco abuse in thorax / lung and upper digestive specialty patients and patients with tumors in the head and neck confirm this hypothesis .", "the data presented are consistent with the previous literature and attest to the high prevalence of indicators of psychiatric disorders in cancer patients , especially compared to the prevalence in the general population . these results support the conclusion that individuals with cancer are more vulnerable to the onset and development of psychiatric disorders . conversely , the association between substance abuse and certain cancers indicates that substance abuse can be also a risk factor for disease development . this study was conducted using a large and statistically estimated sample , but the psychiatric indicators were evaluated using screening instruments . these instruments were validated previously and show adequate sensitivity and specificity , but they only provide the prevalence of indicators but do not indicate disorders per se . the subjects ' self - perception also influences these instruments , which may be overestimated or underestimated , and this fact should be considered in data interpretation as well as the fact that all the patients come from a single treatment center . the high rates indicate the need to screen for psychiatric disorders in cancer patients , especially because of the damaging effects that psychiatric symptoms may exert on patient treatment . active monitoring and early detection of symptoms may facilitate treatment adherence , decrease the duration of hospital stay , and assist in disease coping . the study also highlights the need for greater investment in prevention campaigns that discourage the use of legal substances , such as alcohol and nicotine , because these substances are risk factors in cancer development ."], "summary": "objective . this study evaluated the prevalence of various indicators of psychiatric disorders in brazilian outpatients with cancer and assessed possible associations with sociodemographic indicators . materials and methods . a total of 1,385 patients were evaluated using the following instruments : patient health questionnaire-4 ( phq-4 ) , generalized anxiety disorder ( gad-7 ) , fagerstrm test for nicotine dependence ( ftnd ) , and fast alcohol screening test ( fast ) . results . the sample was composed of both genders with a slight predominance of women ( 55.8% ) , subjects with incomplete / completed elementary school ( 59% ) , married ( 67.4% ) , with children ( 94% ) , not active from a labor viewpoint ( 61.6% ) , and following some type of religion ( 79.5% ) . the prevalence of anxiety for the total sample varied between 21.5 and 27.4% . the prevalence of depression was 21.1% , tobacco abuse / dependence was 40.2% , and alcohol was 20.3% . women had significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression than men . men had higher levels of substance abuse / dependence indicators than women . conclusion . these results are consistent with the literature , which attests to the high prevalence of psychiatric disorder indicators in cancer patients , especially compared to the general population .", "ranking": [3, 1, 4, 2, 0]}

( borden also presented an alternative but related description based \n on delocalization of unpaired radicalic electrons to accepting  * \n orbitals of cf groups . ) the preference \n for carbon sp hybridization can also be expected to lower \n the force constants for the pyramidalization ( wagging ) vibrations \n ( 7 , 8 ) and/or increase their anharmonicity . \n furthermore , torsion ( 4 ) should be facilitated by \n rehybridization and in fact quantum chemistry confirmed this for a \n 90 twist . another spectacular property of c2f4 is how \n readily it can dissociate thermally to two cf2 molecules . a c = c bond energy of only 2.95 ev is derived , less than that of a typical c  c single \n bond ( 4 ev ) . the low dissociation energy is caused by stabilization \n of the resulting two difluorocarbenes by back - bonding from nonbonding \n fluorine electrons to the empty carbon p - orbital . this also explains why cf2 has a singlet \n ground state which is more stable than the triplet ( by 2.458 ev , taken \n from the band origin of the phosphorescence spectrum ) . whereas in the previous work , only cc stretching is considered \n as the dissociation coordinate , it was argued in ref ( 16 ) that pyramidalization \n must also be involved . this idea is supported in the present work \n by the large value found for the anharmonic constant x18 coupling cc stretch with trans pyramidalization . the \n magnitude of x18 as compared to the much \n smaller x17 ( coupling cc stretch with \n cis pyramidalization ) also supports a valence - bond analysis of weak \n double bonds , which was reviewed in ref ( 19 ) .", "the samples in natural isotopic abundance were either taken from \n commercial c2f4 ( hoechst ) , that contained a \n trace of the cyclic dimer , or prepared from c2f4br2 + zn in a high - boiling \n alcohol ( diethylene glycol ) ; the comparison allowed for recognizing \n absorptions of impurities . a sample enriched in c to \n 50% was prepared from chclf2 by co2 laser isotope \n separation with enriched cf2 as the primary product . ir spectra of c2f4 in natural isotopic \n abundance \n and isotopically enriched were recorded between 370 and 4000 cm with 0.2 cm resolution by a perkinelmer \n ftir spectrometer in garching . at the \n synchrotron lab , the isotopically enriched sample was measured at \n moderate 0.1 cm resolution in the far ir region \n from 100 to 600 cm ( capturing the band at 210 \n cm ) , and at high resolution for the ir active \n cf stretch bands , see ref ( 1 ) . the present work focuses on anharmonic constants of c2f4 . only where the constants were \n expected to be different for ccf4 and c2f4 ( e.g. , in the case of \n fermi resonance ) theoretical values of the anharmonic constants xij were obtained from anharmonic \n vibrational \n frequency calculations performed using gaussian 03 revision c02 at the mp2 level using \n dunning - type correlation - consistent ( cc - pvtz ) orbitals . the molecular force field at this level of theory \n was shown in the previous study to reproduce the fundamental wavenumbers \n and the isotopic shifts of c2f4 very satisfactorily \n ( for details , see ref ( 1 ) ) , and hence was an appropriate choice for computing xij values . the calculations were performed for each of \n the c2f4 , ccf4 , and c2f4 isotopologues .", "the spectra were measured previously and the \n fundamentals extracted \n from them , using a limited number of anharmonic constants ( from combination \n and hot bands ) where necessary . for convenience \n table 1 lists the fundamentals again . in this \n work we derived a large set of experimental anharmonic constants from \n combination bands and  in particular for the lower - wavenumber \n vibrations  from hot bands , and report a complete set of theoretically \n computed values . symmetry types refer to a d2h molecule with z axis along the cc bond and the y axis perpendicular \n to the plane , as used in ref ( 1 ) for easier comparison with the c2v symmetric ccf4 ;

low - resolution values are 1338.4 \n and 1187.0 . upright : \n experimental values . \n in parentheses : values calculated by mp2/pvtz . where two values or \n a range are given for the experimental data , it may indicate ( a ) a \n dependence of the effective xij on the involved levels due to perturbations ( fermi resonances , \n section 4.4 ) or ( b ) an uncertainty due to error \n limits ( e.g. , where broad bands are involved ) or an uncertain assignment . \n a preferred value is indicated by bold face . for further details on \n the derivation of each xij and some isotopic data , the anharmonic constants xij were calculated from observed \n combination and difference bands \n by assuming that anharmonic shifts are additive : for binary combination \n bands ( i  j ) and for overtones \n we used1and2with obvious extensions for more complicated \n combinations . ( the xij values are mostly negative , as usual . ) the left - hand side of these \n equations should be read as  wavenumber of ( name )  . for hot bands ( satellite transitions near i that originate from a thermally populated \n lower level j ) we used3again \n with obvious extensions . one can often \n observe sequences of equidistant q branches , corresponding to hot \n bands starting from higher levels mj , or combination of such sequences ( from mj + nk ) . equation 3 implies that the distance of a ( first ) hot band from the fundamental \n directly indicates the corresponding anharmonic constant . combination \n bands allow for a direct assignment , whereas hot bands must be identified \n by their intensity ( controlled by the boltzmann factor ) . in a number \n of cases the supporting information ( si ) compiles the sources for each xij in table s2 , whereas table s1 lists the observed \n bands ( with hot bands ) and their isotopic shifts . two examples of \n hot bands , whose shifts are dominated by the large x18 anharmonicity , are shown in figure 1 . absorbance spectra demonstrating the large x18 derived shifts for hot - bands originating in 8 . the spectra were recorded \n in the garching laboratory , with pressure and path length of 2 bar \n and 10 cm ( for the lower trace of each panel ) , and 140 mbar and 4 \n m ( upper trace ) , respectively . for levels involving more than two quanta of vibration , anharmonic \n shifts this helped to decide between different \n assignments of combination bands in a few cases where the harmonic \n sums were similar to each other . however , such additivity need not \n apply when the levels involved are subject to fermi resonance , producing \n shifts that depend on the separation of nearby interacting levels . \n we use eqs 13 to \n obtain the experimental values , and hence , table 2 reports phenomenological xij , some of which show a spread in the values suggestive of fermi \n resonances ( in particular x18 , x26 , and x77 ) . fermi \n resonances can also be recognized if the apparent xij or the hot - band structure depends \n on the isotopologue . for c2f4 , fermi resonances \n were identified ( see section 4.4 and si ) between:5 and 2+6 ( discussed already in ref ( 1)),1 and 5+6 ( indicated by the hot - band structure \n of 1-combinations , which are different in the mixed \n isotopologue),2 and 27 ( causing irregularities \n in overtone levels of 7 , also contributing to the \n large magnitude of x27 and x77).2 and 23 , identified from the \n mp2 calculations . 5 and 2+6 ( discussed already in ref ( 1 ) ) , 1 and 5+6 ( indicated by the hot -

pvtz calculations \n reproduced the observed wavenumbers \n and isotopic shifts very well . supporting \n the overall vibrational analysis exceptions are 15 ( x22 , x28 , x29 , x2,10 , x2,11 , x36 , x3,10 , x45 , x59 , x5,11 , x66 , x68 , x77 , x88 , x10,11 ) out of 54 cases where an observed value is available \n for comparison . some of these will be discussed below .", "as already \n described in the introduction , the peculiar \n reactions of c2f4 have to do \n with cc stretching and carbon pyramidalization . the discussion will \n focus on these coordinates ( sections 4.14.3 ) . for \n a planar geometry , \n cc dissociation correlates c2h4 and c2f4 with a pair of carbenes in their lowest triplet states ( figure 2a ) . because \n the energy of forming these products is practically the same for the \n two molecules , one could also expect that the potential energy curves \n coincide and the cc stretch force constants are equal . in fact , already \n early force - field calculations showed no substantial difference ( 889 \n n / m for c2f4 and \n 940 furthermore , \n the short cc distance ( 132 pm , which is 1 pm shorter than in ethylene ) and the high cc stretch wavenumber ( 1873.8 cm , compared to 1625.4 cm   for ethylene ) do not point to a weakened bond . \n as early as 1965 , the low dissociation energy of c2f4 was attributed to switching over to a channel producing two \n singlet carbenes and to the stabilization ( by 2.458 ev , see introduction ) of singlet cf2 by back bonding , so that this channel is energetically favored by 4.9 ev . this path hence leads over an avoided \n crossing of potential surfaces ( figure 2a ) . \n if the avoidance is strong , one could expect an influence at least \n on the anharmonicity x11 ( 1 is dominated by cc stretching ) , even if not on the force \n constant at the bottom of the potential energy well . table 2 shows that the magnitude of x11 ( calculated 7.8 cm ) is not unusually \n large for such a high - frequency vibration , though noticeably larger \n than for ethylene ( x22 = 2.3 cm  ) . that the increase \n in magnitude is only moderate can be taken as a sign that the avoidance \n along this coordinate is not very strong . hence , the back reaction \n ( recombination ) will have a high barrier in planar geometry . whereas \n the measured recombination barrier is not , in fact , zero , it is only \n minor ( 9 kj / mol = 0.09 ev  ) . so , \n a lower - energy path must lead around the barrier , out of the drawing \n plane of figure 2a , that is , with distortion \n different from cc stretch . potentials for ground - state cc dissociation \n of c2f4 , leading over an avoided crossing to \n two singlet carbenes . \n in ( a ) it is assumed that the one - sided pyramidalization ( q7 + q8 ) begins only after overcoming the barrier , whereas \n ( b ) shows the preferred path , where this distortion is already fully \n developed on the barrier and is preceded by a trans pyramidalization \n ( q8 ) , while the cc distance is steadily increasing . it was argued in ref ( 16 ) that recombination of \n two cf2 molecules should \n be easiest if one of them points with its filled n orbital \n to the empty p orbital of the other . hence , the dissociation \n path will change from pure cc stretch to include also pyramidalization \n ( figure 2b ) , and the potential should be lowered \n in energy in the direction of q7 ( the coordinate of 7 ) and/or q8 . in turn in fact x18 has an unusually large magnitude , although x17 is in the normal range ( table 2 ) . ( the magnitude of x18 is not \n caused by secondary effects such as fermi resonance , as we shall see \n in section 4.4.3 . ) we can conclude that on \n stretching the cc bond the molecule first bends toward trans pyramidalization \n ( q8 ) ( figure 2b ) . the one - sided \n nonplanar bending ( figure 2 ) is a superposition \n of q7 and q8 . the reason why q8 is \n active earlier than q7 can be understood by a valence - bond \n model for weak double bonds . in this model several symmetric arrangements \n of carbenes ( a  c \n of scheme 2 ) were considered : whereas with \n two triplet carbenes all arrangements ( a  d ) lead to bonding \n interaction , with two singlet carbenes bonding occurs only in the \n trans - bent case ( c ) ; this corresponds to a double donor  one can add that the cis - bent case with singlet carbenes would \n lead only to antibonding ( scheme 2d ) . malrieu \n and trinquier derived a criterion for trans - bending ( deriving even \n the angle ) by comparing the standard double - bond energy with the singlet  their findings were confirmed by many examples , in particular with \n heavier - element homologues . we can apply \n this rule not only to the equilibrium geometry of c2f4 but also to its dissociation path , if we consider in the \n comparison the double - bond energy that is reduced on extension of \n this bond . the rule thus predicts that on cc extension c2f4 is distorted from planar geometry to a trans - bent structure , \n and this rationalizes the large magnitude of x18 . in the triplet case , the interaction \n can be bonding in all arrangements . in the singlet case , ( a ) is antibonding , \n ( b ) nonbonding , ( c ) bonding , ( d ) antibonding . more recently , borisov et al . found evidence \n for trans pyramidalization \n on extension of the cc bond also from molecular orbital calculation \n ( at high level : mller  plesset perturbation theory of \n second , third and fourth order ) : the \n authors found that the onset is relatively sudden on cc extension \n to 142 pm and that the distortion lowers the energy appreciably . ( the \n large x18 anharmonicity is an indication \n that this pyramidalization already begins not far from the s0 minimum . in fact , a cc stretch by 10 pm  from 132 to 142 pm  is \n just about the vibrational amplitude in the 1 = \n 1 level . ) although borisov et al . did not find an energy minimum with \n such a distortion , they suggested that it plays a crucial role in \n the low - energy real intermediate found by buravtsev , kolbanovskii \n et al . in thermal reactions of c2f4 and recombination \n of cf2 ( see ref ( 31 ) and literature quoted therein and section 4.3 ) . one could suppose that in order to lower the activation \n energy \n for dissociation the only necessary deviation from simple cc stretching \n is distortion toward the 8 coordinate ( q8 ) . however , there is experimental \n evidence that the asymmetric pyramidalization ( corresponding to superposition \n of q7 and q8 as in figure 2b ) is already crucial in the transition state : the pre - exponential \n factor found in the rate of thermal c2f4 dissociation \n ( 2.8  10 s  ) is clearly larger than would be typical for \n a simple bond splitting ( 10 s ) . this \n corresponds to a raised entropy of activation , such as that which \n happens if an additional degree of freedom is activated in the transition \n state . the most plausible candidate is free internal rotation , as \n it can be expected in the asymmetric structure with a single dative \n bond but not in symmetric geometry with double donor  acceptor \n bond . this picture is also consistent with a stepwise cleavage of \n the double donator  acceptor bond on c2f4 dissociation and its stepwise formation on cf2 recombination . it is worth noting that the molecule with one - sided pyramidalization \n has an electron distribution ( figure 2b ) that \n is zwitterionic and correlates in planar geometry with the 2ag state with two  electrons excited to  * , as \n already pointed out in ref ( 16 ) . a fully analogous dissociation path can also be \n expected for the \n other systems considered by malrieu and trinquier . in fact , according \n to ref ( 32 ) ground - state \n ( ir induced ) dissociation of diazomethane ( h2cnn ) follows \n a path with a pyramidalized methylene group to produce n2 + singlet ch2 ; the out - of - plane deformation was experimentally \n confirmed . in the backward reaction , n2 points with its \n n electron pair to the empty p orbital of the singlet \n methylene ( see refs ( 32 and 33 ) for a calculated potential in two dimensions , which would look similar \n for c2f4 ) . hence , \n the out - of - plane deformation on dissociation of c2f4 is not an isolated phenomenon . applying \n their energetic criterion to the equilibrium geometry of c2f4 , trinquier and malrieu found that this molecule is \n not far from the limit , where it would become nonplanar , and suggested \n that the 8 force constant may be significantly lower \n than that of ethylene . this is in fact \n confirmed in the following way : analytical expressions for a valence \n force field model for planar x2y4 were given \n by herzberg . besides the masses mx and my , bond lengths l1 ( for xx ) and l2 ( xy ) and the angle  ( half of yxy ) , both 7 and 8 only depend on the force constant for pyramidalization \n ( k/l2 ) . with equilibrium distances and angles from ref ( 1 ) and i = ( 2ci ) one derives this force constant from \n 7 and 8 ( with identical results \n for c2f4 and c2f4):4both values should be identical \n in this valence - force field model . in fact for ethylene , the value \n is 22.9 n / m , whether derived from 7 or 8 . the pyramidalization force constant \n derived from 7 of c2f4 is \n slightly higher than in ethylene ( by 17% ) , but the same quantity derived \n from 8 is only 49% of the ethylene value . ( of course , \n these values are not quantitatively meaningful , as the discrepancy \n highlights that a pure valence - force field model is not sufficient \n for wagging of c2f4 . ) so in fact the restoring \n force for the 8 vibration is significantly smaller \n than in ethylene and than that expected on the basis of the same pyramidalization \n force constant as for 7 . this is consistent with \n the prediction of the valence - bond model favoring the trans - bent geometry . the slightly raised force constant for 7 could \n be due to repulsive nonbonding interaction in cis pyramidalization . \n such a geometry would be involved in the hypothetical transition state \n of the diels  alder addition of c2f4 to \n butadiene , a reaction that has not been observed . it was argued that \n an increased energy associated with this distortion might contribute \n to inhibiting the reaction . however , an \n increase in the force constant of only 17% is hardly sufficient to \n support this explanation , and the other effects discussed in ref ( 7 ) , in particular the competing \n fast radical reactions , are probably more important . applying \n again the force - field formulas of herzberg , the force constant for torsion , k/l2 , is found to be 30.3 \n n / m for both ethylene and tetrafluoroethylene . that is , near the potential \n minimum the c = c bond in c2f4 behaves \n just like a normal double bond . consequently , the torsional barrier \n at a 90 twist ( which is a measure of the  bond strength ) \n would be identical for both molecules ( 2.8 ev ) if the two c  cf2 groups remained planar ; this was confirmed by a high - level \n calculation . however , pyramidalization \n lowers this barrier by 0.57 ev ( at mp2 level , consistent with ref ( 35 ) ) . if this stabilization is activated early along q4 , \n it could give rise to substantially negative values for x44 and especially for x47 and x48 . however , x44 and x47 are actually slightly positive \n ( 0.8 and 0.3 cm ) and x48 has no unusual magnitude ( 0.7 to 1.05 cm ) . evidently , the stabilizing effect of pyramidalization becomes \n effective only at high torsional angles . the corresponding values \n for ethylene are 2.4 , 8.9 , and 7.2 cm , respectively . the nondiagonal anharmonicities xi4 and x4j are \n generally smaller in magnitude than in ethylene . but this may simply \n have to do with the relative vibrational amplitudes , which are much \n larger for torsion of ch2 than of cf2 due to \n the relative masses . in the twisted - pyramidalized structure \n of c2f4 , the triplet ( t1 ) is only \n 0.013 ev lower than the singlet \n ( s0 ) . it \n can therefore act as a real intermediate and undergo radical - type \n reactions , further assisted by its low energy that is calculated at \n 2.1 ev . this has been a widespread interpretation \n of some peculiarities of c2f4 reactions ( see , \n for example ref ( 7 ) ) . however , buravtsev , kolbanovskii et al . found in shock - tube experiments \n ( with c2f4 diluted by ar and adiabatically compressed ) \n an intermediate at much lower energy ( 0.8 to 1 ev ) with uv and visible \n absorption ( 235 and 500 nm ) ( see refs ( 31,36 , and 37 ) and the \n literature quoted there ) . they supposed it to be a singlet diradicaloid \n of c2f4 with a geometry corresponding not to \n an energy minimum but to a point on a slope of the potential ( see , \n for example ref ( 31 ) ) . however , as these points are not stationary there are too many \n ( nearly ) isoenergetic locations with shifted electronic transitions , \n so that the electronic absorption would be smeared out . it was therefore \n suggested that the observed intermediate \n is another low - energy isomer , tetrafluoro - ethylidene cf3cf ( electronic absorption in an ar matrix : ) . however , its energy ( 1.9 ev  ) seems to be nearly as high as that of the twisted - pyramidalized \n triplet . ( in one study the twisted - pyramidalized c2f4 triplet is calculated at 0.90 ev , but computational details are not given , and previous theoretical \n results are not discussed . ) some more anharmonicities of table 1 have unusually large magnitudes or show a range \n of values and/or deviate from prediction . in many of them fermi resonances \n play a role , as will be explained here . in section4.4.3 , however , it is shown that x18 is hardly influenced by such effects and its large magnitude mainly \n results from the overall shape of the potential energy surface . fermi resonances mix two nearby levels of the \n same symmetry , which differ by three units in the quantum numbers . \n the fermi - induced \n repulsion of the levels depends in a nonlinear way on both the magnitude \n of the fermi interaction parameter and on the original ( i.e. , unperturbed ) \n energetic distance of the levels . this separation will , in general , \n change ( a ) on isotopic substitution and ( b ) on adding a quantum of \n another vibration ( i.e. , in analogous combination bands ; similarly \n also in higher overtones , in which case a quantum number dependence \n must also be taken into account ) . another method of characterizing fermi resonance interactions relies \n on intensity borrowing caused by the mixing of levels . according \n to the mp2 calculations , the great majority of xij change by 1 cm on isotopic substitution the few exceptions are \n listed in table 3 and are compared to experimental \n values . identified ( fr13 ) and the interpretation in the line  influenced by  \n is based on the assumption that an xij is affected by such a resonance if at least one \n of the levels i and j is involved in the fermi interaction . the table shows that \n the calculated isotopic shift is sometimes \n much larger than in the experiment , for instance x26 , x27 . also x56 for c2f4 is probably \n too large , as the two observed bands 5+6+11 and 5+6+12 are close to their harmonic positions \n ( table s1 in si ) . it seems that at the \n present level of theory , the calculation does not reliably reproduce \n the fermi resonance induced shifts , at least the stronger ones . this \n is not surprising given the highly sensitive and nonlinear dependence \n of fermi shift on the  unperturbed  level separations . \n the same deficiency will also affect those xij connected with at least one level ( or a \n combination thereof ) involved in a resonance listed above ( examples \n in figure 3a ) . in fact , 10 of the 15 deviations \n listed at the end of section 3 can be attributed \n in this way to the resonances fr1 and fr2 with possible contributions \n of fr3 . the exceptions are x36 , x3,10 , x66 , x68 , and x88 . in \n all 42 other cases it is worthwhile to consider \n the two strongest fermi resonances , \n fr1 ( 2/27 ) and fr2 ( 5/2+6 ) , in c2f4 in some detail . the effect of these resonances \n is summarized in figure 3 . some levels involved \n in fermi resonances and observed transitions . \n solid arrows : ir , broken arrows : raman ; double arrows ( with interaction matrix element ) indicate repulsion \n between level pairs . the anharmonic shifts involving x77 are only nominal , because the fermi perturbation is \n strong :  6x77  = 18.1 is \n less than 3 times  (= 8.2 ) and  4x77  is only \n 9.9 . ( but  2x77  +  4x77  =  6x77  , as is obvious from the level scheme , and the raman \n anharmonic shifts practically coincide with those from the ir spectra . ) \n ( b ) three - level fermi resonance 5/2+6/27+6 and \n their combinations with 9 for c2f4 and c2f4 . \n the indicated level energies are from the spectra except those in \n parentheses , which are calculated . the broken horizontal lines are \n the estimated unperturbed positions ( see the si ) , and the signed numbers are the calculated shifts . the 16.4 cm magnitude of the interaction term ( with its expected dependence \n on quantum numbers ) has been derived \n from band shifts and intensities for a series of levels built on 2/27 for all three isotopologues . bands for \n 27+x ( x = 9 , 11 ) borrow their entire intensity from 2+x . the detailed analysis \n is provided in si . it \n is also evident that x77 , x27 and x22 are affected by \n the fermi resonance ( and probably other x2i , if the level separations differ ) and that x77 is level dependent because of the varying \n separation . the fermi term is almost entirely responsible for the \n + 8.2 cm shift of 27 for c2f4 and those of the heavier isotopologues \n ( table 3 under fr1 ) . in the latter the fermi - induced \n shift is increased , because the levels 2 and 27 ( before perturbation ) are closer together than in c2f4 and are practically degenerate in c2f4 . the success of these calculations \n shows that the additional mixing of 2 with 23 ( fr3 ) is apparently a weak perturbation at most . the \n fermi resonance fr2 between 5 and 2+6 was qualitatively discussed in ref ( 1 ) . a more complete understanding \n of the resonance shifts and pattern of intensity borrowing requires \n the three - level scheme shown in figure 3b ; \n this figure also shows combinations with 9 , as they \n are all ir active and were directly observed . analysis based on this \n model has enabled the magnitude of the fermi term to be determined \n as 11 cm ; the fr1 term of 16.4 cm was used without change . significantly , the model predicts varying \n fr shifts that even differ in sign ( originating from the different \n repulsions in figure 3b ) and can thus account \n for the unusual isotopic shifts observed between c2f4 and c2f4 . \n it explains a substantial deviation of the observed isotopic shift \n 5 = 51.9 from the value of 5 = 43.1 \n expected from the teller  redlich product rule , which is valid \n for harmonic oscillators . additionally \n the relative intensities of combination bands and their isotopic dependence \n are well predicted . it is also remarkable that according to the model \n the largest part of the anharmonicity x26 is due to fermi resonance . as described in ref ( 1 ) , the lower symmetry in ccf4 leads to strong mixing of 5 with 9 ( which are nearly degenerate in c2f4 ) . the two levels repel each other \n ( even in the harmonic approximation ) and give rise to two infrared - active \n transitions . it is sometimes difficult to disentangle them and their \n combination bands from the spectra . if the large magnitude of some \n anharmonicities is caused by fermi resonance , a crucial question is \n whether this might also be the case for x18 . if so , the conspicuous value of x18 could be largely a matter of the character of the resonance and \n less a consequence of global features of the potential for dissociation , \n which we considered in section 4.1 . in fact , \n weak perturbations of the 1 level and its combinations \n by the 1/5+6 fermi resonance are indicated by the slight x18 dependence on the level and on isotopic substitution and \n the change of the hot - band structure of 1 combinations \n in ccf4 , as explained in the si . a quantitative estimate of the strength \n of the 1/5+6 interaction can be deduced from the intensities of 5+6 combinations relative to those of the corresponding \n 1 combinations , assuming that the former borrow \n their full strength from the latter . the 5+6+12 band ( 2444.3 cm ) \n has 12% the strength of the 1+12 band ( 2428.7 cm ) , see figure 1a . similarly , the 5+6+11 shoulder ( 3072 cm ) is < 1% as intense as 1+11 ( 3056.2 cm ) and clearly visible only with longer \n path length than shown in figure 1b . from both \n observations , one can estimate a fermi term ( w ) of \n no more than 2.5 cm , causing a shift ( and \n consequent change in x18 ) of < 0.5 cm . this is actually an upper bound , because such weak \n bands can also be expected without intensity borrowing . hence , fermi \n resonance affects the magnitude of x18 only by a little ( by < 3% ) , and we can maintain the conclusions \n of section 4.1 on the shape of the potential .", "a large set of anharmonic \n constants of c2f4 was derived from spectroscopic \n data , and a complete set was calculated . \n most of the calculated and experimental values agree very well , and \n nearly all deviations can be attributed to fermi resonances . the values \n were used to interpret peculiarities of the potential and reactions \n of this molecule . the facile thermal cc dissociation of c2f4 is due to curve crossing of the ground state \n ( 1ag ) with \n the two - electron excited zwitterionic 2ag state . the crossing \n barely alters the properties of the potential curve ( cut purely as \n a function of cc stretch ) near the equilibrium geometry ; the force \n constant for cc stretching ( 1 in c2f4 , 2 in c2h4 ) is nearly \n identical for the two molecules . only a slightly larger magnitude \n of the anharmonicity x11 compared to the \n corresponding x22 of ethylene provides \n a hint of a weakly avoided crossing in planar geometry of c2f4 . however , the large magnitude of x18 leads us to conclude that the dissociation path bends \n early toward \n q8 , i.e. to trans pyramidalization of the two carbon atoms \n ( figure 2b ) . this is rationalized by a valence - bond \n model , which describes the stretched cc bond as a double donor  acceptor \n bond ( scheme 2c ) . it is also consistent with \n the tendency of fluorine to induce sp hybridization at \n carbon , although this preference alone would also allow cis pyramidalization , \n q7 , which is not involved early in dissociation . on further \n cc stretching , one of the two donor  acceptor bonds breaks , \n and the pyramidalization becomes fully one - sided already in the transition \n state ( figure 2b ) . in this way , free internal \n rotation of the cf2 groups becomes possible , providing \n an additional degree of freedom that rationalizes the high pre - exponential \n factor in the rate constant of dissociation . this structure with perpendicular \n arrangement of the two cf2 groups appears very plausible \n for the back reaction . thus , one cf2 group approaches with \n its filled n orbital the empty p orbital of the other \n cf2 group ( figure 2b ) . the easy \n trans pyramidalization on minor cc stretching is probably also the \n reason that the corresponding 8 force constant is \n lowered , although all other force constants are similar to those in \n ethylene . the preference of fluorine for sp hybridization \n at \n carbon has been invoked to explain not only the easy radical addition \n and other reactions , but also the low - lying , twisted - pyramidalized \n triplet , which is nearly isoenergetic with the singlet that has a \n saddle point there . this is indicated by x44 , x47 , and x48 , which have no unusual values . very recently , \n high - level theoretical studies investigated \n electronic ground and excited states of c2f4 and their dependence on some coordinates , mainly \n to discover the fate of this molecule after electronic excitation \n and make comparisons with a corresponding time - resolved experiment \n ( ref ( 16 ) ) . for the \n ground state , the stabilizing effect of pyramidalization in the twisted \n molecule was confirmed . interestingly , the excited molecule enters \n the s1/s0 conical intersection from the 2ag state , where the molecule has a large one - sided pyramidalization , \n a 90 cc twist and a cc bond length ( 1.51  ) similar to \n that of a single bond . in the present work , the transition state for \n s0 dissociation was said to result from avoided crossing \n of the 2ag and 1ag ( i.e. , s0 ) states , \n also with large one - sided pyramidalization but at longer cc distances \n and perhaps without twist . it would be interesting to check whether \n these geometrical differences are large enough to generate an excited - state \n barrier , because evidence was found in ref ( 16 ) that cc dissociation does not begin in the excited \n state ."], "summary": "compared to ethylene and its nonfluorinated \n derivatives , c2f4 is peculiar in many reactions . it very easily \n adds to radicals and prefers formation of four - membered rings over \n diels  alder reactions . this has been rationalized by the preference \n of fluorine for carbon sp3 hybridization , which is possible \n on opening of the double bond . another property , the thermal dissociation \n of the c = c bond , has been explained by the stabilization of \n the product ( cf2 ) by back - bonding . here , it is attempted \n to correlate such properties with vibrational constants , in particular \n for c = c stretching and twisting and for carbon pyramidalization . the only force constant found to be lowered compared to ethylene is \n that for trans pyramidalization ( 8 ) , and cc bond \n softening on 8 distortion is indicated by the conspicuously \n large magnitude of anharmonic constant , x18 . both observations can be rationalized by a valence - bond model that \n predicts a trans bent structure on weakening the cc bond . conclusions \n are drawn about the dissociation path and peculiarities of the potential . other anharmonicities , both experimental and calculated and some in 12c13cf4 and 13c2f4 , are also discussed . in particular some strong fermi \n resonances are identified and their effects accounted for .", "ranking": [4, 0, 3, 1, 2]}

three ( 20% ) aih-1 and 11 ( 46% ) aih-2 patients ( p = 0.006 ) had relatives presenting autoimmune diseases . in addition , median serum alanine aminotransferase values were higher in the aih-2 group ( 28 versus 18  upper normal limit ; see table 1 ) . serum igg , iga , and ige levels were significantly higher in aih-1 in comparison to the aih-2 group of patients ( figure 1 ) . high ige levels were observed in 50/91 ( 55% ) of patients with aih-1 , but only in 2/17 ( 12% ) of those with aih-2 ( p = 0.003 ) ( table 1 ) . histopathology showed presence of cirrhosis in the majority of aih-1 patients ( 57 out of 60 ) analyzed , usually accompanied by necroinflammatory activity corresponding to a score 3 and a score 4 panacinar necrosis . liver cell rosettes were also present in almost 90% of livers , accompanied by infiltrating eosinophils and/or plasma cells , independently of patients ige serum levels ( table 2 ) . importantly , in contrast to increased ige serum levels present in about half of the patients , liver ige was absent in only 4 of the 46 aih-1 patients . finally , most patients exhibited cd8 cytotoxic t cell and nk infiltrating cells , in some cases without detectable cd4 helper t cells ( table 3 ) . however , irrespective of serum ige levels , in most patients , moderate to high infiltration levels of cd4 helper t cells usually accompanied by moderately elevated liver nk cells were in fact present . in conclusion and in spite of having analyzed only a subgroup ( 46/60 ) of patients , our results clearly show that the well - known infiltrating proinflammatory cell profile coexists side by side with ige , eosinophils , and the plasma cells possibly involved in ige production . the reason for this mixed cell profile is currently unknown . among the studied snps in aih-1 , two functionally relevant snps present , respectively , in the il13 gene and in its receptor il4ra disclosed statistically significant increases . the first snp is il13 rs20541 ( 31 versus 23% of hc ; p = 0.024 , or = 1.55 ) and , moreover , homozygosis for the a allele at il13 rs20541 , known to impact upon receptor ligand affinity , was also significantly increased compared to healthy controls ( p < 0.001 , or = 4.62 ) . increased frequencies were also found for a allele at il4ra rs1805011 ( 68% versus 49% ; p < 0.0001 , or = 2.15 ) and homozygosis for a ( 47% versus 19% ; p < 0.001 , or = 3.75 ) ( table 4 ) . the remaining polymorphisms did not show any relevant difference when aih-1 and hc groups were compared ( supplementary table 1 in supplementary material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/679813 ) . finally , we carried out analysis using a logistic regression model , which included allele carriage of the different snps as well as clinical and laboratory parameters . three modes of analysis were tested . in the first mode ( mode 1 ) , the results confirmed the findings for both il13 rs20541 ( or = 9.45 ( 95% 2.2839.18 ) p = 0.002 ) and il4ra rs1805011 ( or = 3.72 ( 95% 1.787.77 ) p < 0.001 ) . to investigate a possible association of snps with pathogenesis of the disease , a second mode ( mode 2 ) of analysis considered each snp as the dependent variable . the t allele at il5 rs2069812 showed association with treatment suspension ( remission by clinical and laboratory standards ) ( p = 0.004 ) but was a very rare outcome , present only in 7 patients ( 7/117 , 6% ) where 5 achieved regression of fibrosis after treatment ( grades iv to ii ) . il5 is directly involved in eosinophil activation and is a key molecule in allergy and eosinophilic inflammation , expressed by cd4 helper t and b cells , mast cells , and eosinophils . finally , ige was considered as the dependent variable in another analysis ( mode 3 ) . the presence of the t allele at il4 rs2227284 showed association with high ige levels ( or = 7.42 ( 95% ci 1.33 to 41.34 ) , p = 0.02 ) ( table 5 ) , an expected result . the genes individually associated with susceptibility to the disease were examined for potential gene - gene interactions . gene - gene interactions considered grouped genotypes for il4ra rs1805011 , il4 rs2243250 , il4 rs2070874 , rs2227284 , il13 rs20541 , and il5 rs2069812 and the presence of 03 and/or 13 alleles at the hla - drb1 locus . individuals presenting homozygosis for the a allele at il4ra rs1805011 and hla - drb103 and/or 13 allele were at six times greater risk to develop the disease ( or = 14.00 , p < 0.001 ) compared to the risks conferred by the same alleles individually ( hla - drb103 and/or 13 , or = 8.28 ; il4ra rs1805011 , or = 3.72 ) . individuals homozygous for the a allele at il13 rs20541 , combined with hla - drb113 and/or 03 allele also showed a slightly greater risk to develop the disease ( or = 8.88 , p = 0.04 ) .", "the recurrent presence of plasmocytes and eosinophils in liver biopsies along with the unusual finding of increased circulating ige antibodies in brazilian pediatric patients with aih was the basis for this retrospective study . to further understand if those cells might be disease markers for aih-1 , we investigated gene polymorphisms of cytokines involved in plasmocyte and eosinophil maturation and ige production . our hypothesis was that these snps might play an additional role in the development of aih , a disease primarily caused by autoreactive t cells , acting as disease modifiers in synergy with the strongly associated mhc class ii hla - drb113 and 03 alleles in the brazilian admixed population . our cross - sectional analysis of laboratory and clinical parameters aimed to distinguish if the increased levels of circulating ige are markers for the presence of an autoimmune process and therefore present in all patients irrespective of other markers or an indicator of a pathogenic role varying according to disease severity . it is also possible that ige levels are simply an epiphenomenon caused by widespread inflammatory and immune activity . the degree of portal inflammation and , especially , parenchymal lesions and interface necroinflammatory activity were remarkable in aih-1 patients and occurred irrespective of ige serum levels . a major feature in the present series of analysis was the finding of panacinar necrosis in about half of all patients , again regardless of ige serum levels , eosinophil count , or other histology characteristics . in spite of liver - infiltrating eosinophils in about 60% of these patients , eosinophil count in peripheral blood of all patients was in the normal range ( data not shown ) . this observation is in accordance with the observed lack of rast reactivity in the patients . we concluded that despite the high ige serum levels , the laboratory and clinical findings are not indicative of a concomitant allergy or atopy occurring in these children . in addition , eosinophils have a circulating half - life of only a few hours , with rapid removal of tissues by leukocyte extravasation . in tissues , eosinophils are not usually present in livers from healthy or cmv - infected patients , in contrast to liver transplanted patients , where eosinophil count correlates with degree of rejection . in our patients , and arguably due to the widespread inflammation , not only were eosinophils present but also ige was identified in most biopsies analyzed . in addition , plasma cells , t and b lymphocytes , and nk cells were also found in the liver of most patients , confirming the generalized inflammatory process . in aih , t cell - mediated cytotoxicity is believed to be the central mechanism responsible for hepatic damage . in fact , the intriguingly mixed immune profile included also the clearly defined cd8 cytotoxic t cell periportal infiltration responsible for the piecemeal necrosis that is a hallmark of the disease whereas cd4 helper t cell and b cells gathered around portal tracts . of note , in our group of patients , we observed a more modest score in the case of cd4 helper t cell infiltrating cells than described elsewhere . our data are similar to a recent study in adult aih and drug - induced liver injury patients . infiltrating liver cells were profiled and the presence of eosinophils was detected after standard staining in varying percentages in both groups of patients , but tissue ige was not measured . added to the unambiguous detection of eosinophils in the biopsies of our group of pediatric patients , we show that liver ige is present in the vast majority of patients . taken together , beyond the characteristic portal and periportal inflammatory cell profile , the ubiquitous presence of ige deposits , plasma cells , and eosinophils suggests a yet unidentified additional role in the pathogenesis of aih . in rheumatoid arthritis , the involvement of eosinophils   has been linked to il-5 and tgf-1 , profibrogenic cytokines that contribute to collagen accumulation in tissues . it is possible that , likewise , the excess liver - infiltrating eosinophils take part in the development of the severe fibrosis typical of the disease in young children . on the other hand , il4 and il13 are major cytokines involved in ige synthesis by b cells   and exhibit overlapping functions due to the interaction with the type ii receptor composed of the il4r and il13r1 expressed in nonhematopoietic cells and shared by both cytokines . il13 additionally impacts upon tissue eosinophilia , tissue remodeling , and fibrosis , especially in the liver . we observed an association between presence of the il13 codon 110 a allele ( coding for glutamine ) and susceptibility to aih-1 . this variant has been associated with increased ige levels in both atopic and healthy children . association with the functional polymorphism coding for valine in the alpha chain of the il4 receptor was also identified ( see multivariate analysis , model 1 ) . chen et al . ( 2004 )   have previously shown that the il13 glutamine carrying variant displays increased activity compared to the wild type arginine variant . furthermore , they showed that signal transduction by the variant was further enhanced when the il4 receptor alpha chain carried valine in position 50 . the results suggest that the joint presence of these two polymorphisms in aih pediatric patients may indeed impact aih pathology and contribute to disease severity . it is possible that the presence of higher circulating and liver ige reflects an overall stimulus of the immune system that results in enhanced immunoglobulin levels , which could include target - driven autoantibodies . it remains to be seen if any specific autoantigen is recognized by these ige antibodies , but without a defined target this analysis remains difficult to be achieved . the il4 rs2243250 , rs2070874 , and rs2227284 snps included in this study have been shown to impact il4 transcriptional activity   and il4 rs2227284 ( g > t ) , which resides in a putative transcription factor binding site , may act independently to regulate il4 transcription and ige production . furthermore , presence of the t allele at il4 rs2227284 has been associated with higher ige levels in white , african - american , and hispanic asthma patients . in the multivariate analysis ( see model 3 ) , the same t allele was significantly associated with serum ige levels strengthening our hypothesis of an additional role for the il4 , il13 cytokine pathway in the pathogenesis of aih .", "in conclusion , in agreement with the recurrent observation of high serum ige levels and presence of eosinophils , plasmocytes , and ige in the liver of aih-1 pediatric patients , we have identified novel associations with polymorphic variants of the il13 gene and the functionally related il4 receptor alpha chain which suggest ige - linked immune responses may be involved in the overall susceptibility to aih-1 ."], "summary": "pediatric autoimmune hepatitis ( aih ) patients present hypergammaglobulinemia , periportal cd8 + cytotoxic t cell infiltration , and cirrhosis . autoantibody profile defines aih types 1 and 2 in addition to strong association with hla - drb1 . we previously detected increased ige serum levels and sought to compare clinical and histological features according to ige levels in aih ( n = 74 , ages 114 years ) patients . additionally , we typed 117 patients and 227 controls for functional polymorphisms of il4 , il13 , il5 , and il4ra genes involved in ige switching and eosinophil maturation that might contribute to overall genetic susceptibility to aih . serum ige levels were high in 55% of aih-1 , but only in 12% of aih-2 ( p = 0.003 ) patients . liver ige was present in 91.3% of aih-1 patients . the a alleles at both il13 rs20541 and il4ra rs1805011 were associated with aih-1 ( p = 0.024 , or = 1.55 and p < 0.0001 , or = 2.15 , resp . ) . furthermore , individuals presenting homozygosis for the a allele at il4ra rs1805011 and hla - drb103 and/or 13 allele had sixfold greater risk to develop the disease ( or = 14.00 , p < 0.001 ) . the novel association suggests an additional role for ige - linked immune response genes in the pathogenesis of aih .", "ranking": [0, 4, 3, 1, 2]}

quantifying the contributions to motif discovery of different genomes or sets of genomes ; improving the predictive reliability of motifs by genome - scale clustering and co - occurrence ; determining a best minimal set of motif discovery methods , probably in a discovery approach that uses multiple methods ( 6 ) ; and using coexpression and other functional data types . in this report , we describe a new cisred database that contains predictions for whole - genome discovery of regulatory elements in mammals and other eukaryotes . we also describe the predictive system behind the database , which uses genome - scale approaches to predict deeply conserved ab initio motifs and identifies groups of similar motifs and co - occurring patterns of motifs . the system is designed to be readily maintained and extended in the context of rapidly evolving resources , data types and tools .", "the upstream section of the pipeline loads the database with significant discovered atomic motifs , and the section downstream of the database identifies groups of similar atomic motifs and co - occurring patterns of motifs . an atomic motif consists of a set of sequences , typically with a common length between 6 and 12 bp , members of which are present in a sequence region on the target species and in corresponding regions on other genomes . the system uses genome resources that are a combination of directly downloaded and processed sequences , annotations and relationships ( e.g. orthology , coexpression and interactions ) . these are stored in an automatically updated local resource that holds a wide range of public and commercial databases . motif discovery was carried out in a search region based on a single major transcript for each gene . an input target sequence set consisted of a sequence from the target species , and corresponding sequences from homologous vertebrate genes . the following rules were used to assemble target sequence sets for cisred 1.2e . we identified homologous genes by combining data from compara ( 7 ) , homologene ( 8) , inparanoid ( 9 ) and kegg ( 10 ) . for each target human gene and each of its orthologues , we took the major ensembl ( 7 ) transcript if its protein sequence was n - terminal complete . we further required that the human gene had an annotated ensembl 5-untranslated region ( 5-utr ) that was at least 10 bp long . for each target gene 's orthologue set , we required at least one of dog , mouse and rat , and at least one of chicken , frog , fugu , tetraodon and zebrafish . if the human 5-utr was < 500 bp , we applied no utr requirements to orthologues ; however , if the human 5-utr was > 500 bp , we required that all orthologues had annotated ensembl 5-utrs that were at least 10 bp long . after this filtering , for any orthologous region that was missing from an input sequence set , we added a sequence region from the current ucsc ( 11,12 ) multiple sequence alignment . for a small subset of the target genes , corresponding regions from encode - specific species were then added from the current encode multiple sequence alignment ( 13 ) . finally , regions were added from an internally processed version of the unannotated macaca mullata genome from . these rules delivered 7500 human target genes with sequence sets that contained a minimum of three and an average of six orthologous sequences from other genomes . sequence regions extended 1.5 kb upstream and 100 bp downstream of transcription start sites ( tss ) , net of all types of repeats except ltr / erv1 , ltr / ervl , ltr / malr and of coding sequences , which were masked . in addition to a target sequence set , we supplied each discovery program with a genomic  background input file . the background input for each species consisted of 1000 concatenated search regions that were randomly selected from the genome 's entire set of search regions . we used multiple discovery methods in parallel , running each method with a range of parameter settings ; typically target motif width and motif occurrence model were varied . we used a compact but diverse base set of discovery methods that consisted of consensus ( 14 ) , meme ( 15 ) and motifsampler ( 16 ) . raw discovered motifs were post - processed , for example , to remove identical motifs reported by the same algorithm , and to merge strongly overlapped motifs . we assigned p - values to motifs discovered by multiple methods across large sets of target genes whose sequence sets varied in species composition , as follows . first , we identified a representative subset of target sequence sets that sampled the range of species compositions of the target sets . then , for each representative target sequence set , we created random sequence sets by retaining the original sequence from the target species and replacing each orthologous sequence with a synthetic sequence . the random synthetic sequence was generated from the target sequence by a tool we developed to simulate neutral evolution using published substitution rates and indel rates and lengths . we then submitted each target sequence set and all random sequence sets to identical motif discovery and post - processing procedures . we assigned method - independent ( mi ) scores to all motifs discovered in target and random sequence sets , using a trainable function that contained four non - negative parameters : \n score()=(1+1d)(1+2cremote)(1+4w)(1+3(1cclose))b , \n where coefficients took the following possible values : d , w  r , b  { 0 , 1 } and c  [ 0 , 1 ] . in the above equation , d characterized the number of site sequences in a motif ; w and b characterized the shape of a motif 's information content profile ; and c characterized motif sequence conservation . the score increased when the motif was conserved for species that are evolutionarily remote from the target , and decreased when the motif was not conserved for species that are close to the target ( primates , in the case of human ) . we used the distribution of mi scores for motifs from a target gene 's random sequences to transform the mi scores for the target gene 's motifs into p - values . finally , we loaded the database with motifs whose p - values were below a threshold ( which , for cisred 1.2e , was 0.05 ) . a library of known transcription factor binding sites , split into mutually exclusive training and testing fractions , was used to optimize the scoring function and to characterize the performance of the system . the library contained 1000 sites for 300 human genes from transfac v9.1 ( 17 ) , and 250 binding sites that we curated from the literature . we optimized the scoring function by simulated annealing , using a training fraction of known sites from randomly selected genes and two objective functions : the area under a receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve and the number of experimentally known motifs that were not predicted . we assessed the system 's predictive performance with a test fraction of known sites , using observables like sensitivity , specificity and positive predictive value ( ppv ) ( e.g. ) . although comparisons of method performance are constrained by many factors , current system performance compared favourably to results in a recent study ( 6 ) . to identify groups of similar motifs , we defined two pairwise motif similarity metrics . for the first metric , we used a version of the levenstein edit distance between two sequences that was modified to permit no internal gaps ( 18 ) . for each motif , m , and its reverse complement , rc(m ) , we scanned motif pairs relative to each other , and reported the overall minimum average mutual edit distance to motif k , i.e. min(d(m , k ) , d(rc(m),k ) ) . the second metric was based on the maximum information content shared between position frequency matrices derived for each motif , and also treated a motif and its reverse complement as equivalent . we hierarchically clustered pairwise dissimilarity matrices with the local density - based optics algorithm ( 19 ) . we extracted clusters from optics ' reachability output by applying an automatic cluster recognition method that identifies cluster boundaries as inflection points in the reachability plot ( 20 ) , then traversing these hierarchical segmentation results with an algorithm that traced a deepest available path , constrained by a maximum preset depth . the large size of mammalian genomes makes it challenging to organize the computational hardware and software infrastructure required to address such issues routinely . we did the large - scale discovery , similarity and co - occurrence calculations on a beowulf - style , 400 cpu ( pentium iii , xeon , opteron ) oscar cluster ( ) running red hat linux 9 ; and remotely on the beowulf 1700 cpu  glacier cluster at westgrid ( ) . we clustered motifs on a 12 dual - core cpu ( ultrasparc iv ) smp server with 96 gb of ram running solaris 9 .", "the database infrastructure is designed to evolve to hold results from a range of mammals , as well as results from model organisms . because promoter regions are enriched sources of regulatory elements , motif discovery and the cisred design were both based on regions around tsss . cisred human v1.2 contains motifs from promoter regions of 7500 human genes using ensembl v30 ( ncbi 35 ) data , as well as a pilot result set of 250 mouse genes . the current database design makes three types or levels of information available for regulatory elements : ( i ) atomic motifs , which are discovered independently in each target region sequence set ; ( ii ) groups of similar motifs , each of which is a putative model for the binding site of a single transcription factor ; and ( iii ) co - occurring patterns of models , which are putative regulatory modules . predicted regulatory elements can be viewed directly in cisred 's web user interface . from this interface , motifs can be viewed in the ucsc genome browser , in the ensembl genome browser via a das server , or in the sockeye comparative genomics workspace ( 21 ) . a user can filter the displayed motifs by criteria like the p - value threshold , the orthologous species present in a motif and the discovery method . the database contains a table of high - confidence globally coexpressed genes ( 22 ) ; genes coexpressed with each cisred target gene are listed on that gene 's page . the database also contains a table of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) from dbsnp ( 8) that occur in predicted motifs . when a predicted human motif contains a snp , the cisred atomic motif page highlights this variation on the target sequence of a motif site sequence set , and the highlighted base hyperlinks to the snp 's primary source information in dbsnp . a current schema diagram is available from the  databases & methods page , and direct sql queries can be run on the mysql databases at . a user can download the data , with sql files , as well as a compressed file that contains all input fasta sequence sets . because older versions of the database may not be compatible with the current user interface , only recent versions for each species can be accessed through the web or via a mysql client . however , historical releases of cisred databases are archived and can be downloaded . certain parts of the system 's software are available from a tab on the cisred home page . sockeye ( 21 ) permits , for example , a user to assess details of conserved regions relative to genomic annotations in multiple sequence alignments . the hitplotter visualizer displays large sets of discovered motifs from multiple - method discovery runs , and is available on request as a beta release .", "database contents will be extended to include large - scale results for human , mouse , rat , caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila melanogaster . the input sequence sets for this database were based on human tsss that were identified by considering ensembl ( 7 ) and refseq ( 23 ) annotations . to address the limitations of gene and transcript annotations for non - human species , corresponding vertebrate search regions were taken from ucsc ( 11,12 ) and encode multiple sequence alignments ( 13 ) . we are extending our ability to take advantage of unannotated and low - coverage genome sequence data . we are continuing to improve motif post - processing and scoring . optimizing the scoring function depends on having a large library of known motif sites ; we anticipate that a newly created web database for submitting and curating binding sites from the literature may help us to enlarge and improve this resource (; s. b. montgomery and o. l. griffith , manuscript in preparation ) . given a scalable clustering method , we continue to assess motif similarity metrics and how best to use the hierarchical information output from optics . given groups of similar motifs , we are applying group labels to atomic motifs , then identifying overrepresented co - occurring motif patterns using hypergeometric statistics , imposing separation constraints on neighbouring motifs , and searching in two stages for patterns larger than pairs ( 24,25 ) . we are implementing methods for annotating discovered motifs as known or novel against known site resources . given annotated motifs , we will annotate overrepresented co - occurring patterns of human motif pairs as known versus novel using the transcompel resource ( 26 ) . we are applying genome - scale motif clustering and co - occurrence as filters for predicted motifs that may improve the predictive reliability and the resulting catalogue of conserved regulatory elements . we have assembled a large multi - species coexpression resource that contains public microarray and sage data from diverse sources ( 22 ) ( table 1 ) . we have shown that combining global coexpression data from multiple platforms improves confidence in coexpression predictions when assessed against the gene ontology ( go ) ( 27 ) . from this , we established go - based pearson correlation thresholds that identified high - confidence globally coexpressed gene pairs . the coexpression database makes results available from this global analysis and from two other recent analyses ( 28,29 ) . although coexpressed genes can have similar regulatory elements , the system 's predictive performance improved only marginally when inputs included coexpressed genes in addition to orthologous genes ( data not shown ) . given these results , currently we are assessing an approach that includes no coexpressed genes in motif discovery inputs , but uses coexpression information to assess groups and co - occurring patterns identified in genome - scale sets of atomic motifs . we will extend the database user interface to offer more complex user filtering , as well as motif searches based on consensus strings or matrices . for work with classes of regulatory elements that are defined by wet lab data types based on , for example , chip or dnase i hypersensitivity ( e.g. see encode tracks within the ucsc genome browser ) ( 11,13 ) , we have designed a new schema that is based on search regions rather than on genes , and will extend the user interface to support this . we will continue to assess the contributions to regulatory element predictions of different genomes and sets of genomes . we will integrate and assess new motif discovery methods , and will identify a best minimal set of methods on an ongoing basis .", "data processing system for high - throughput motif discovery , clustering , co - occurrence , annotation and performance assessment . database contents and high - level links , from a web user perspective , as of cisred human v1.2 .  groups are clusters of similar motifs that are identified by large - scale optics ( 19 ) clustering ."], "summary": "we describe cisred , a database for conserved regulatory elements that are identified and ranked by a genome - scale computational system ( ) . the database and high - throughput predictive pipeline are designed to address diverse target genomes in the context of rapidly evolving data resources and tools . motifs are predicted in promoter regions using multiple discovery methods applied to sequence sets that include corresponding sequence regions from vertebrates . we estimate motif significance by applying discovery and post - processing methods to randomized sequence sets that are adaptively derived from target sequence sets , retain motifs with p - values below a threshold and identify groups of similar motifs and co - occurring motif patterns . the database offers information on atomic motifs , motif groups and patterns . it is web - accessible , and can be queried directly , downloaded or installed locally .", "ranking": [0, 2, 1, 3, 4]}

Conclusions"], "document": ["recent evidence has shown that fat accumulation , especially in the abdominal cavity , causes dysregulation of adipokines , including increase in leptin , tumor necrosis factor- ( tnf- )  , interleukin-6 , and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 , and decrease in adiponectin , leading to the development of various metabolic disorders and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases [ 1 , 2 ] . adiponectin , a member of the c1q / tnf - related protein ( ctrp ) family , is one of the most extensively studied adipokines that possesses insulin - sensitizing , anti - inflammatory and antiatherogenic effects [ 35 ] . to date , 15 additional ctrp family members have been identified that are related to adiponectin in sequence and structural organization [ 6 , 7 ] . of all the ctrps , ctrp9 has the highest amino acid identity to adiponectin in its globular c1q domain [ 6 , 8 ] . ctrp9 is predominantly expressed in the adipose tissue and plays protective roles in diet - induced obesity , glucose intolerance , and insulin resistance in mice [ 8 , 9 ] . several basic studies have shown the beneficial effects of ctrp9 on the cardiovascular system [ 1014 ] . ctrp9 was shown to induce endothelium - dependent vasorelaxation , attenuate neointimal formation after vascular injury , and protect against cardiac injury [ 10 , 11 ] , and adverse cardiac remodeling   after acute infarction in mice . consistent with those experimental studies , serum ctrp9 levels were found to be inversely related to obesity , insulin resistance , and dyslipidemia in a community - based population   and in patients with coronary artery disease . in contrast , serum ctrp9 levels were positively associated with bmi in morbidly obese subjects requiring bariatric surgery   and with obesity , insulin resistance , and arterial stiffness in subjects with type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) . no study is currently available on the association between ctrp9 and morphological evidence of atherosclerosis in human subjects . moreover , the association of ctrp9 with atherosclerosis remains to be fully investigated because patients with renal dysfunction or chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) , who have a high risk of cardiovascular mortality , were not included in the preceding studies [ 15 , 16 , 18 ] . therefore , in this study , we measured the plasma levels of ctrp9 in subjects with t2d representing a wide range of renal function and investigated the clinical association of plasma ctrp9 level with the intima - media thickness ( imt ) of the carotid artery separately in subjects with ckd and in those without ckd .", "we consecutively enrolled 419 subjects with t2d ( 245 men and 174 women ) who were admitted to the diabetes center of the osaka city university hospital for the purpose of glycemic control , education , and/or evaluation of diabetic complications between january 2009 and july 2014 . subjects with type 1 diabetes and other types of diabetes were excluded from the present study . in our analyses , the estimated glomerular filtration rate ( egfr ) was calculated by using the japanese egfr equation , and the subjects were divided into the ckd ( egfr < 60  ml / min/1.73  m ) or the non -

linked immunosorbent assay following the manufacturer 's instructions . the minimum detectable levels of ctrp9 and adiponectin were 1.29  ng / ml and 23.4  pg / ml , respectively . the intra- and interassay coefficients of variation of ctrp9 were < 10% and < 12% , respectively , whereas those of adiponectin were < 10% and < 10% , respectively . ultrasonography of the common carotid artery ( cca ) was performed by using a phase - locked echo - tracking system , which was equipped with a high - resolution real - time 13  mhz linear scanner ( prosound ssd 6500 and f75 ; hitachi aloka medical , ltd . , the imt value was determined by using a measurement software ( intimascope ; media cross co. ltd , tokyo , japan ) , as described elsewhere . in brief , images were obtained 20  mm proximal to the origin of the bulb at the far wall of both ccas . the average value of 416 points in this region and the largest value , including plaque lesions , in the cca were measured separately . the mean - imt of the right and left cca ( mean - imt ) and the greatest imt among the left and right cca ( max - imt ) were used as markers of atherosclerotic changes . data are expressed as number ( % ) or median ( interquartile range ) as appropriate . for comparisons between the non - ckd and ckd groups , -test or wilcoxon rank - sum test multiple regression analyses were performed to explore the factors associated with carotid imt after adjustment for age , sex , body mass index ( bmi ) , systolic bp , egfr , hba1c level , triglyceride level , high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) cholesterol level , low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol level , treatment with statins , treatment with angiotensin ii receptor blockers or angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors ( arbs / aceis ) , smoking status , ctrp9 level , and adiponectin level . a p value of < 0.05 was considered significant . statistical analyses were performed by using the jmp 10 software ( sas institute inc . , cary , nc , usa ) .", "the clinical characteristics of the total study population , as well as of the subjects with and without ckd , are shown in table 1 . the median age , duration of diabetes , and bmi of the subjects were 65 years , 11 years , and 25.0  kg / m , respectively . one hundred and sixty - one subjects ( 38.4% ) were categorized into the ckd group and the remaining 258 ( 61.6% ) were categorized into the non - ckd group . the median egfr was 42.7 and 76.7  ml / min/1.73  m for the ckd and the non -

cholesterol , and ldl - cholesterol levels were lower in subjects with ckd than in those without ckd . the prevalence of subjects treated with oral hypoglycemic agents such as sulfonylureas , biguanides , and thiazolidinediones was lower , whereas that of subjects treated with insulin was higher , in the ckd group than in the non - ckd group . the ckd group had a higher prevalence of subjects treated with arbs / aceis and statins for hypertension and dyslipidemia , respectively , than the non - ckd group . the median plasma ctrp9 and adiponectin levels for the total population were 17.4  g / ml ( range , 0.0684.3  g / ml ) and 6.2  g / ml ( range , 0.8546.4  g / ml ) , respectively . of note , both plasma ctrp9 and adiponectin levels were inversely correlated with egfr ( figure 1 , supplementary tables  1 and  2 in supplementary material , available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/8624313 ) , and , accordingly , the plasma levels of ctrp9 and adiponectin were markedly higher in the ckd group than in the non - ckd group ( table 1 ) . no significant correlation between plasma ctrp9 and adiponectin levels was found in either the total population , the non - ckd group , or the ckd group ( supplementary table 1 ) . in univariate analyses , the plasma ctrp9 levels were positively correlated with age , systolic bp , serum creatinine , and triglycerides and negatively correlated with egfr , hba1c , and hdl - cholesterol ( supplementary table 1 ) . on the other hand , the plasma adiponectin levels were positively correlated with age , diabetes duration , systolic bp , serum creatinine , and hdl - cholesterol and negatively correlated with bmi , egfr , immunoreactive insulin , homa - r , and serum triglyceride levels ( supplementary table 2 ) . the median of max - imt and mean - imt was 1.08  mm ( range , 0.502.86 ) and 0.76  mm ( range , 0.341.57 ) , respectively . subjects with ckd had higher max - imt and mean - imt than those without ckd ( table 1 ) . we then examined the association of plasma ctrp9 levels with carotid imt by using univariate analyses in the non - ckd and the ckd groups , separately . in the non - ckd group , plasma ctrp9 levels were positively correlated with max - imt and mean - imt ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) . in contrast , neither max - imt nor mean - imt was significantly correlated with plasma ctrp9 levels in the ckd group ( figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) . on the other hand , plasma adiponectin levels were positively correlated with mean - imt (  = 0.147 , p = 0.019 ) , but not with max - imt (  = 0.036 , p = 0.563 ) , in the non - ckd group . neither max - imt (  = 0.039 , p = 0.627 ) nor mean - imt (  = 0.090 , p = 0.259 ) was significantly correlated with plasma adiponectin levels in the ckd group . finally , we performed multiple regression analyses to identify an independent association between plasma ctrp9 levels and carotid imt after adjusting for bmi , plasma adiponectin level , and other potential confounders including age , sex , systolic bp , egfr , hba1c , serum triglyceride level , hdl - cholesterol level , ldl - cholesterol level , smoking status , and presence of treatment with statins and arbs / aceis in the non - ckd or the ckd groups , separately . in the non - ckd group , plasma ctrp9 level was found to be an independent determinant of max - imt (  = 0.128 , p = 0.037 ) and mean - imt (  = 0.124 , p = 0.028 ) ( table 2 ) . notably , among variables other than ctrp9 , the independent determinants were only age for max - imt and only age and ldl - cholesterol level for mean - imt in the non - ckd group . on the other hand , no significant association was observed between plasma ctrp9 level and carotid imt in the ckd group ( table 2 ) .", "in the present study , we measured plasma ctrp9 levels in patients with t2d representing a wide range of renal functions and investigated the impact of plasma ctrp9 level on carotid imt separately in subjects with or without ckd . importantly , the association was independent of obesity , plasma adiponectin levels , and other traditional cardiovascular risk factors . the results also revealed that plasma ctrp9 levels were elevated in subjects with ckd compared with those without ckd ; however , plasma ctrp9 levels were not significantly associated with carotid imt in the ckd group . this study clearly demonstrated that plasma ctrp9 levels were independently and positively associated with carotid imt in diabetic subjects without ckd . previous experimental studies in mice consistently demonstrated the beneficial effects of ctrp9 on vascular endothelial function , vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation , and the profile of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages [ 28 , 29 ] . several studies have investigated the association of ctrp9 with cardiovascular risk factors in human subjects [ 15 , 16 , 18 ] , whereas only two reports have shown the association of ctrp9 with atherosclerosis   or cardiovascular disease . in a study in which 35% of subjects had diabetes , the ctrp9 level in serum and epicardial adipose tissue negatively predicted the presence of coronary artery disease . in contrast , a study exclusively of diabetic subjects   showed that serum ctrp9 levels were independently and positively associated with arterial stiffness . the present study showed a positive relationship between ctrp9 and carotid imt , suggesting that the impact of ctrp9 on atherosclerosis or cardiovascular disease differs depending on the characteristics of study population , at least with regard to diabetic status . unlike a prior study on subjects with t2d that evaluated subclinical atherosclerosis according to brachial - ankle pulse wave velocity , we were able to demonstrate in diabetic subjects a close relationship between plasma ctrp9 level and carotid imt , the most established surrogate marker for cardiovascular diseases . moreover , our subjects were older ( age , 65 versus 58 years ) and had poorer glycemic control ( hba1c , 8.6% versus 7.0% ) and lower renal function ( egfr , 76.7 versus 94  ml / min/1.73  m ) than those in a prior study , even in the non - ckd group . therefore , this study further suggests a significant impact of ctrp9 on atherosclerosis in patients with t2d who are exposed to a relatively high risk of cardiovascular diseases . importantly , the positive relationship between plasma ctrp9 levels and carotid imt was independent of obesity , plasma adiponectin levels , and other traditional cardiovascular risk factors in the non - ckd group . considering the inhibitory effect of ctrp9 on vascular smooth muscle cell growth and neointimal formation in mice , a detrimental impact of ctrp9 on carotid imt in this study could be explained by a compensatory response of ctrp9 to the conditions predisposing to the development of atherosclerosis in subjects with t2d . upregulation of ctrp9 expression in the adipose tissue was observed in 8-week - old ob / ob mice relative to age - matched controls . the protein expression of ctrp9 in cardiac tissue was also increased at 4 weeks in mice that received a high - fat diet and decreased thereafter . a prior study showing an independent and positive association of serum ctrp9 level with arterial stiffness in human subjects with t2d also indicated a role of ctrp9 as a compensatory factor in the pathogenesis of arterial stiffening . our research group previously reported that plasma adiponectin levels were inversely associated with carotid arterial stiffness in nondiabetic but not in diabetic subjects . no antiatherogenic effect of adiponectin with carotid imt taking these results together , a loss of antiatherogenic effect of adiponectin in diabetic condition could be one of the explanations for the compensatory response of ctrp9 to advanced atherosclerosis in patients with t2d . this study also suggests a possibility of a direct pathophysiological link between ctrp9 and atherogenesis in patients with t2d ; however , this needs to be confirmed with future studies . in this study , previous studies investigating ctrp9 levels in the circulation of human subjects excluded those with renal dysfunction [ 15 , 16 ] or targeted t2d subjects with normal renal function . this study is the first to demonstrate elevated plasma ctrp9 levels in human subjects with renal dysfunction compared with those without renal dysfunction . the plasma levels of adiponectin , which belongs to the c1q family and has high homology to ctrp9 , were also elevated in subjects with ckd and inversely correlated with egfr in the present study . the plasma levels of the other isoform of ctrp , ctrp3 , were also associated with egfr in human subjects including those with t2d . although the elevated adiponectin level in patients with ckd is reported to play a protective role against atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases [ 35 , 36 ] , it is currently unknown whether the elevated ctrp9 levels in subjects with ckd play a role or are merely due to reduced renal excretion . in the present study , the plasma ctrp9 levels were associated with systolic hypertension , renal dysfunction , and metabolic dysregulation ( e.g. , obesity , high triglyceride level , and low hdl - cholesterol level ) in the ckd group , whereas no parameter other than age and systolic bp was correlated with ctrp9 levels in the non - ckd group ( supplementary table 1 ) . these observations may indicate an association of ctrp9 with obesity - related metabolic dysregulation in diabetic subjects with ckd ; however , its functional significance needs to be confirmed in further studies . in contrast to diabetic subjects without ckd , those with ckd exhibited no significant association between plasma ctrp9 levels and carotid imt . it is well recognized that individuals with ckd are at a higher risk for cardiovascular mortality than those with preserved renal function . in patients with ckd , not only a clustering of several traditional risk factors , but also nontraditional risk factors such as anemia , hyperphosphatemia , hyperhomocysteinemia , and inflammation play a role in cardiovascular damage . indeed , in the multivariate analyses ( table 2 ) , the explanatory factors including traditional cardiovascular risk factors along with plasma ctrp9 and adiponectin levels did not significantly explain max - imt ( r = 0.088 , p = 0.515 ) or only minimally explained mean - imt ( r = 0.160 , p = 0.032 ) in the ckd group . therefore , it is possible to speculate that nontraditional factors related to ckd , although not evaluated in this study , attenuated the relationship between ctrp9 and carotid imt in subjects with ckd . the concentrations of circulating ctrp9 in this study population were found to be different from those in the prior studies [ 15 , 17 , 18 ] , even with the same assay kits . however , it needs to be mentioned that the ctrp9 levels were nearly one hundred times different among the prior studies ( mean 4.69  ng / ml , 115.3  ng / ml , and 415  ng / ml ) . moreover , ctrp9 concentrations obtained by the other assay kits were quite different between the assays ( 96  pg / ml   and 5.0  ng / ml ) . based on these facts first , we examined only ctrp9 based on its high similarity to adiponectin and the abundance in experimental evidence of its vascular effects [ 1014 ] . since ctrp1   and ctrp3 [ 34 , 40 ] were also indicated to be linked to atherosclerosis , the other members of the ctrp family need to be examined in the future . second , because this was a cross - sectional study , a causal relationship between ctrp9 and carotid atherosclerosis could not be confirmed . third , our subjects were receiving antihypertensive drugs and statins , which could have affected arterial thickness and its related risk factors . to minimize the effects of these drugs , we adjusted for the presence of these treatments in the multivariate analyses . fourth , no healthy controls were included in this study , and we could not confirm how diabetic status affects plasma ctrp9 level or its association with carotid imt . finally , because our subjects with t2d were hospitalized in a university hospital and were largely without adequate glycemic control , the current results can not be generalized to the entire population of patients with t2d .", "this study clearly shows that plasma ctrp9 levels are independently and positively associated with carotid imt in diabetic patients without ckd , but not in those with ckd . our data indicate an important link between ctrp9 and carotid arterial wall thickness , a powerful predictor of cardiovascular diseases , in patients with t2d . this study further proposes that plasma ctrp9 level is a potential biomarker of atherosclerosis in t2d patients without renal complications . further longitudinal studies are required to clarify whether plasma ctrp9 levels are predictive of the progression of atherosclerosis in patients with t2d who are at a high risk of cardiovascular diseases ."], "summary": "aim . c1q / tumor necrosis factor -

abutment assembly . because of this connection , internal type implants have more favourable stress distribution , better stability , and superior resistance to lateral load.7 however , tsuge and hagiwara8 presented no significant difference between internal and external implant - abutment connections concerning their effect on the abutment screw loosening . theoharidou et al.9 also reported that the frequency of screw loosening in single tooth restoration was 2.7% in external type implants and 2.4% in internal type implants ; this difference was not statistically significant . the frequency of screw loosening is reduced over time , but still occurs in spite of recent advances in the design and screw materials . screw loosening produces discomfort for patients ; therefore , methods to prevent screw loosening are needed . one method for preventing screw loosening that is easily applicable to clinical practice is retightening . gradual functional loading causes sliding of the screw thread and relief of screw extension induced by preload . gradual reduction of preload below a critical point causes screw turning . applying a greater preload on the screw in the first phase of screw loosening siamos et al.11 reported that in order to minimize the loss of preload , it is necessary to retighten the screw 10 minutes after the first screw tightening . however , the retightening procedure may change the shape of the abutment screw and the inner screw thread of the implant ; hence , stability during function may be affected.12 in addition , conflicting results on the effect of retightening have been reported . according to tzenakis et al.,13 if the abutment screw is repeatedly retightened , a higher preload can be obtained because of surface wear that can lower the coefficient of friction . however , weiss et al.14 reported that repeated tightening / removal procedures decreased the reverse torque value ( rtv ) of screws . riccardi - copped et al.15 reported that repeated tightening and removal of titanium screws caused the rtv to decrease gradually . the effect of screw retightening remains controversial and on the timing and frequency of retightening are lacking . the aim of this study was to assess the effect of dynamic loading and screw retightening on rtv in external and internal connection type implants .", "twenty external type implants ( diameter , 4 mm ; length , 10 mm ; sola , shinhung , seoul , korea ) and 20 internal type implants ( diameter , 4 mm ; length , 10 mm ; luna , shinhung , seoul , korea ) were used ( fig . 1 ) . abutments for cementretained prostheses ( diameter , 5 mm ; gingival height , 5.5 mm ; esthetic abutment for external implant and duo abutment for internal implant , shinhung , seoul , korea ) were connected to each implant ( fig . each implant and abutment assembly was held in a customized jig in all testing procedures . using a digital torque controller ( mgt 12 , mark-10 co. , new york , ny , usa ) after 10 minutes , the assemblies were retightened with 30 ncm torque to compensate for embedment relaxation.11 after tightening the screws twice , an initial measurement of rtv was made . the implant / abutment assemblies were divided into 4 groups ( 10 assemblies per group ) in order to evaluate the effect of intermittent retightening : 1 ) ext - n , external type implant with no retightening ; 2 ) ext - rt , external type implant with retightening ; 3 ) int - n , internal type implant with no retightening ; 4 ) int - rt , internal type implant with retightening . the implant / abutment assemblies were fitted to the mounting base of a universal testing machine ( electroplus e 3000 , instron , washington dc , wa , usa ) with the long axis of the implant fixed at 30 degrees relative to the vertical axis ( fig . the testing device delivered sine curved cyclic loading between 20 and 250 n at 14 hz for 100,000 cycles . in the groups with no retightening ( ext - n and int - n ) , the rtv was measured after 100,000 cycles of loading , while rtv was measured after 3 , 10 , and 100 cycles as well as every 20,000 cycles in the retightening groups ( fig . 3 ) . for all statistical evaluations , spss version 20.0 , spss inc . , one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) was used for comparing rtv depending on the implant system and retightening . when the rtv was measured repeatedly after various loading cycles , tukey 's test was used for post hoc comparisons , and the significance level was set at =0.05 .", "the initial rtvs were 27.8  1.3 ncm in external implants and 25.1  1.9 ncm in internal implants . both implant systems showed decreased rtvs when compared with the tightening torque value of 30 ncm . the initial rtv of external implants was significantly higher than that of internal implants ( p<.05 ) . the rtvs of all implant / abutment assemblies were significantly reduced after cyclic loading ( p<.05 , table 1 , table 2 ) . the rtvs of the groups without retightening were 25.4  1.2 ncm in the ext - n group and 15.8  1.8 ncm in the int - n group . the ext - n group showed a significantly higher rtv when compared with the int - n group ( p<.05 ) . the rtvs of the groups with retightening were 23.8  1.8 ncm in the ext - rt group and 19.9  3.3 ncm in the int - rt group . the ext - rn group showed a significantly higher rtv than the int - rn group ( p<.05 ) . in external implants on the other hand , retightened internal implant / abutment assemblies showed superior rtvs when compared to internal implants with no retightening ( table 1 , table 2 ) .", "screw loosening is the most frequently occurring mechanical complication of implant restorations.516 abutment screw loosening has been reported in a large number of studies with an incidence ranging from 2% to 15% of abutments . 2359 screw loosening is caused by inadequate tightening torque , settling of implant components , inappropriate implant position , inadequate occlusal scheme or crown anatomy , poorly fitting frameworks , improper screw design / material , and heavy occlusal forces.171819 to overcome screw loosening and joint instability , many technical solutions have been suggested . for example , new abutment screw designs and materials for maximizing preload,120 mechanical torque - applying instruments for optimizing tightening torque,21 precise implant components for antirotation , and internal conical connection implants with no micromotion or microgaps have been proposed . in the current study , the initial rtv was always smaller than the tightening torque ( 30 ncm ) in external and internal type implants . haack et al.22 reported that most of the tightening torque is used to overcome the friction of the surface and only 10% of the tightening torque is used to generate preload . they suggested that 75 - 80% of tightening torque remained in titanium or gold screws.22 kim et al.23 reported that the amount of remaining torque was affected by the screw material ( 77% remained in titanium alloy and 66% remained in gold alloy ) . for standardization of the results , the same titanium alloy was used for both internal and external abutment screws in the present study . the results showed that the remaining torque was 90.9% in external implants and 83.3% in internal implants . these relatively high remaining initial rtvs might have been caused by advanced milling technique and/or the screw design / material . in the current experiments , initial rtvs and post - cyclic loading rtvs were higher in external implants than in internal implants . this is a result of the difference in connection type between the implants . in external implants , joint stability is obtained by the tension of the screw , while it is achieved mainly by friction between the abutment and the implant in internal type implants.24 most of the tightening torque is used to produce preload in external implants,25 while in internal implants , tightening torque is distributed between friction with the abutment and preload on the screw . moreover , internal implants are susceptible to the wedge effect , which arises when tightening torque and mechanical load are applied , leading to axial displacement of the abutment , so that the tensile force of the screw is lost and preload is decreased.232425 according to lee et al.24 and kim et al.,25 axial displacement of the abutment is greater in internal implants , while rtv is greater in external implants . although screws from the same manufacturer were used for standardisation , the screws for external implants have longer threads than those of the screws used for internal implants ( fig . 1 ) . the thread - engaging surface may affect the preload in screw - tightening procedures . to our knowledge , no internal / external implant system manufactured by the same manufacturer offers either similar or identical screw shapes owing to the different inner structures of internal / external implants . although the 2 implant systems had different screw sizes and dimensions , the lengths of the engaging or the mating threads were similar in both.24 the upper part of the thread in the screw of the external implant was not in contact and just passed through the inner surface of the implant . comparison of the groups with and without retightening after cyclic loading revealed no significant differences in rtvs in external implants . however , in internal implants , retightening resulted in higher rtvs than those found in implants without retightening . these results can be explained by the difference in connection type between the implants and the number of times the implants were retightened . in internal type implants , less settling effect occurs during tightening and loosening procedures , because tightening torque generates less preload due to dissipation of force via friction between the abutment and the implant . therefore , a greater number of retightening procedures allows more settling effect and making an adequate surface of the screw . cardoso et al.26 found that rtvs decreased as the number of insertion / removal cycles increased in external type implants . in contrast , tzenakis et al.13 reported an increase of preload in internal type implants . therefore , retightening of screws is strongly recommended for joint stability , especially in internal type implants . the appropriate number of retightening procedures is not clear from the results of previous studies . tzenakis et al.13 reported a gradual increase in gold screw preload from tightening for the first time to retightening 5 and 10 times in internal type implants . in the current study it should be noted that retightening more than 5 times is not recommended for the maintenance of preload . in the present study , this phenomenon was observed in both external and internal type implants . according to delben et al.,27 rtvs were maintained constantly by retightening after every 100,000 cycles of loading in external type implants . according to binon and mchugh,28 the average daily number of mastication is about 2,700 and so 100,000 cycles corresponds to around one month . in the current study , the load cycle was decreased to 20,000 cycles ( corresponding to one week ) in order to infer the timing of retightening , because previous studies found no significant differences with 100,000 load cycles . in the current experiments , rtvs decreased only 10 rounds of cyclic loading in external and internal type implants . in our previous study,24 thus , axial displacement of the abutment screw can affect joint stability , especially in internal implants . to increase preload and secure joint stability , it is recommended that retightening be performed after 10 loading cycles for both external and internal implants . moreover , retightening after 1 week is also profitable for internal type implants .", "this study evaluated rtv according to retightening and cyclic loading in external and internal type implants . initial rtv and postcyclic loading rtv were higher in external implants than in internal implants . in external type implants , retightening did not produce a significant difference in rtv when compared with the non - retightening group after 100,000 rounds of cyclic loading . in internal type implants , the retightening group showed significantly increased rtvs when compared with the non - retightening group after cyclic loading . a decrease in rtv occurred after only 10 rounds of cyclic loading , which represents the early stage of cyclic loading . after 20,000 cycles of loading , rtvs were maintained constantly in both external and internal type implants ."], "summary": "purposethe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of cyclic loading and screw retightening on reverse torque value ( rtv ) in external and internal type implants.materials and methodscement -

schiff , 200 ) calcineurin inhibitor toxicity mean serum creatinine level was 2.1 mg / dl and mean 24 h urinary protein was 800 mg . hyperfiltration injury was diagnosed in five cases where hypertensive glomerular changes such as thickening and wrinkling of basement membrane , ischemic collapse of the tuft , and widening of bowman 's space and fsgs was seen . vessels showed marked subintimal fibrosis with > 50% narrowing of lumen and associated with chronic tubulointerstitial changes . mean serum creatinine level was 2.1 mg / dl and mean 24 h urinary protein was 300 mg . clinical and morphological details are given in table 4 .", "focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a pathological term to indicate glomerular lesion associated with various clinical situations in renal allografts . fsgs is a common cause of end - stage disease and recurrence in grafts is approximately 30% . we classified fsgs in renal grafts as recurrent disease , new - onset primary fsgs in cases where the native diagnosis was not fsgs , and secondary fsgs when associated with drug toxicity , chronic rejection or hypertension , depending on the clinical features and in correlation with various morphological features that are associated with fsgs . this number does not indicate the exact incidence , as native biopsy diagnosis is not available in many cases . risk of recurrence includes young age of the patient , presence of mesangial proliferation , and rapid progression to end - stage disease and pretransplant bilateral nephrectomy . recurrence occurs in renal grafts in early post - transplant period . these patients present with heavy proteinuria usually of nephrotic range . this criterion and an available diagnosis of native disease are helpful in diagnosing recurrent disease . in our series , all the four cases had a biopsy diagnosis of fsgs . the type of fsgs in native kidney was available in three cases , and recurrence disease had a similar pattern to native disease . recurrence can be classified as recurrence of same variant ( 51% ) , recurrence of same variant preceded by minimal change disease ( 19% ) and recurrence with a different variant of fsgs ( 19% ) . graft survival is poor and progression to end - stage renal disease is rapid and is as high as 50% . it is therefore important to diagnose and differentiate this entity from other causes of fsgs . ( a ) collapsing glomerulopathy ( jones , 200 ) . ( b ) focal segmental glomerulosclerosis - not otherwise specified ( h and e , 200 ) chronic transplant glomerulopathy and chronic humoral rejection are other conditions in which fsgs can occur . the mechanism for this is chronic immunological glomerular endothelial and podocyte injury , which is resulting in fsgs . this particular lesion is relatively easy to diagnose as associated features of chronic graft damage are seen , and c4d is positive . these patients presented in late post - transplant period mostly after 3 years and presentation is due to the rise in creatinine and mild proteinuria . these lesions are purely based on pathology diagnosis as serum levels do not correlate with the extent of renal damage and clinical features are not specific . glomerular changes include glomerular hypertrophy , capillary collapse , focal segmental or focal global sclerosis . fsgs results from hyperfiltration injury due to loss of functioning nephrons rather than direct toxic effects on podocytes . presence of hyaline arteriopathy , stripped fibrosis , [ figure 4 ] tubular atrophy with or without isometric vacuolation , and absence of heavy proteinuria help to diagnose this particular entity . striped fibrosis ( masson 's trichrome , 100 ) the true incidence of glomerulonephritis in grafts is not exactly known and ranges from 4% to 20% . membranous nephropathy and fsgs are most common of the glomerulonephropathies that can be seen in grafts with an incidence of 1 - 9% . we diagnosed two cases of new - onset fsgs in patients presenting with nephrotic range proteinuria . histologically , there were no features of hypertension or cni toxicity and c4d was negative . new - onset fsgs has favorable clinical course when compared with recurrent disease and hence it is important to identify this lesion . in long - standing grafts with nephron loss and chronic tubulointerstitial changes we described this entity separately when arterial changes are predominant and tell - tale signs of cni toxicity are absent .", "an attempt was made to etiologically classify these lesions as there is a difference in treatment and prognosis . it is important to make a diagnosis carefully using clinical information and pathology when a decision about second transplant has to be made ."], "summary": "recurrence of fsgs in renal allo grafts is a major cause of graft loss . in this context , we tried to diagnose and classify fsgs in renal allografts . indications for biopsy included graft dysfunction and/or proteinuria . three hundred and sixty - three graft biopsies were studied over a period of 2 years . we classified fsgs into recurrent fsgs , new - onset primary fsgs and fsgs secondary to chronic humoral rejection , calcineurin inhibitor toxicity , and nephron loss and hyperfiltration injury . twenty - four cases were diagnosed as fsgs , constituting 6.6% . secondary fsgs was the most common fsgs in grafts in our study . incidence of recurrent fsgs may not be accurate as pretransplant biopsy is available in very few cases .", "ranking": [2, 3, 0, 1, 4]}

lipid ( 2s)-1 , 2-di - o-[(9z , 12z , 15z)-octadeca-9 , 12 , 15-trienoyl]-3-o--d - galacto - pyranosyl glycerol ( glgpg ) , has been found to inhibit chemotaxis of neutrophils [ 13 , 14 ] and thus could impair pathophysiological cell recruitment to oa lesions . other rhp constituents such as ascorbic acid , polyphenols , flavonoids , and unsaturated fatty acids might contribute to alleviate oa mainly via their anti - inflammatory properties . indeed , rhp extracts and unsaturated fatty acids inhibited cyclooxygenase- ( cox- ) 1 and cox-2 activity [ 18 , 19 ] and associated pge2 production . in a previous in vitro study , the multiple effects of rhp on the production of inflammatory mediators by peripheral blood leukocyte and anabolic and catabolic processes in chondrocytes have been described . the current study aimed at the identification of biological activities of different parts of the rose hip fruit and an improved use of rose hip preparations in the management of oa conditions .", "rhp was prepared from rosa canina and provided by axellus , ishj , denmark ; rh - a consists of dried rose hip powder as described previously ; rh - b was prepared from dried rose hip , where the seeds had been removed before the preparation of the powder . the contents in main constituents ( see table 1 ) have been measured by standard procedures implemented at the analytical research center , dsm nutritional products , kaiseraugst ( switzerland ) . briefly , betulinic acid , oleanolic acid , and ursolic acid were determined according to validated in - house methods ( available on request ) ; vitamin c and vitamin e were analyzed according to official methods en14130 and en12822 , respectively ; linoleic acid , epa , and dha were measured according to the official method of iso 12966 -

louis , mo ) . rpmi 1640 , dmem , 2-mercaptoethanol , and mem nonessential amino acids ( neaa ) were from invitrogen ( carlsbad , ca ) . human il-1 and recombinant interferon- ( ifn- ) were from peprotech ec ( london , uk ) . human peripheral blood leukocytes ( pbl ) and primary chondrocytes from healthy individuals have been cultured and treated with inflammatory stimuli as described [ 2022 ] . human primary cell culture protocols and in vitro peripheral blood leukocyte experiments were approved by the swiss federal office of public health ( no . pbl ( at 8  10 viable cells / ml ) were cultured for 1224  h in phenol - red free rpmi 1640 ( containing 0.25% fbs , 0.1  mm neaa , 50  u / ml penicillin , 50  g / ml streptomycin , and 50 m 2-mercaptoethanol ) and stimulated with lps ( 100  ng / ml ) and ifn- ( 20  u / ml ) with graded amounts of test substances . normal human articular chondrocytes from knee ( nhac - kn ) were seeded into 6-well plates at 0.5  10 cells per well and , where indicated , activated with 10  ng / ml il-1 in supplemented cbm ( lonza , walkersville , md ) in the presence of graded amounts of test compounds for 4  h. in all cell cultures , vehicle ( i.e. , dmso ) was included at 0.5% final concentration . for molecular analysis , nhac - kn cells and pbls were lysed in rlt buffer ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) after 4 and 12  h of culture , respectively , and total rna was extracted . for the analysis of secreted mediators and proteins , pbls were cultured for 24  h ; supernatants were collected and stored at 80c until use for analysis . the isolation of total rna , synthesis of cdna and quantitative rt - pcr has been performed as detailed before . multiparametric kits were purchased from bio - rad laboratories ( hercules , ca ) and used in the liquichip workstation is 200 ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) to measure the amount of secreted proteins . p values < 0.05 ( obtained by using student 's t test or one - way anova ) were considered to reflect statistically significant differences . principal component analysis ( pca ) was performed with the package  chemometrics    of the statistical software   using the nipals algorithm with centered and scaled input data .", "rh - b , prepared from rose hip fruits after removal of seeds , displayed more potent anti - inflammatory effects . the distinct biological activity of rh - a and rh - b correlated with different contents of constituents : rh - b contained higher amounts of ursolic acid , betulinic acid , glgpg , and dha ( table 1 ) . of those , ursolic acid and betulinic acid and 3-omega pufas , but not -carotene , vitamin c , or vitamin e , displayed anti - inflammatory effects ( our unpublished data and [ 25 , 26 ] ) . removal of seeds increased the contents of -tocopherol and glgpg ; the latter had anti - inflammatory properties . other constituents ( e.g. , vitamin c ) we investigated the effect of rose hip preparations on cells of the peripheral blood , which is an obligatory passage for nutritional supplements to the target tissue ( i.e. , cartilage ) . lps / ifn- treatment induced the secretion of large quantities of ccl2/mcp-1 , ccl3/mip-1 , ccl4/mip-1 , ccl5/rantes , cxcl10/ip-10 , and cxcl8/il-8 ( table 2 and figure 1 ) . rose hip preparations significantly reduced the secretion of , for example , ccl5/rantes , and cxcl10/ip-10 . conversely , cxcl8/il-8 and ccl3/mip-1 secretion were increased , while other chemokines ( ccl11/eotaxin , ccl2/mcp-1 , and ccl4/mip-1 ) were not markedly altered . similarly the secretion of interleukins and cytokines was influenced by rh preparations : il-6 and il-12(p70 ) were less produced in the presence of increasing rhp amounts , while il-10 , il-1 , and tnf- were secreted at higher levels . the secretion of ccl5/rantes , cxcl10/ip-10 , and il-12(p70 ) was influenced by the lowest tested concentration , whereas changes in others ( e.g. , cxcl8/il-8 , ccl3/mip-1 , and il-6 ) required high rhp concentrations . rh - b had more potent effects and thus a larger impact on inflammatory mediators than its rh - a counterpart ( see table 2 ) . it should be mentioned that secretion of pge2 , ccl2/mcp-1 , ccl4/mip-1 , and cytokines ( e.g. , il-1 , il-6 and tnf- ) was stimulated by rh - a or rh - b even in the absence of lps / ifn- ( figure 1 ) . rh - a and rh - b did not impair cell viability ( data not shown ; see also ) , since some of the cellular parameters were not altered by graded amount of the substances . changes in gene expression levels showed a pattern which was similar to that of the respective proteins , as best illustrated for cxcl10/ip-10 , il-6 , and cxcl8/il-8 ( table 3 and figure 2 ) . in comparison to rh - a , the rh - b counterpart had a stronger impact on the expression of inflammatory genes . this suggests that rh - b and rh - a modulated the lps / ifn--induced changes in pbl at the level of transcription . one notable exception was ccl5/rantes , which was released from activated pbl even though the respective gene activity was virtually unaltered . also , il-1 mrna levels were decreased by rhp , whereas the cells discharged increased amounts of il-1 ( see figure 1 ) . rhp induced pge2 in unstimulated pbl and increased it in lps / ifn--activated pbl ( not shown ; see also ) . this might be explained by the presence of fatty acids that were converted into substrates for cox-1 in pbl . treatment of nhac - kn with il- drastically increased expression levels of catabolic and inflammatory genes which reflect the induction of oa conditions in normal chondrocytes ( table 4 and figure 3 ) . within 4  h of stimulation , il-1 significantly upregulated catabolic genes ( mmp-1 , mmp-3 , mmp-13 , and adamts-4 ) , cytokine genes ( il-1 , il-6 , and tnf- ) , and chemokines ( cxcl8/il-8 , ccl5/rantes , cxcl2/mip-2 , and cxcl20/mip-3 ) . rh - a concentration - dependently reduced mmp-1 and mmp-3 expression by > 50% , while mmp-13 expression was diminished by 90% at the highest dose of rh - a . proinflammatory cytokine genes like il-1 and il-6 were significantly downregulated . with regard to chemokine genes ( cxcl8/il-8 , ccl5/rantes , cxcl2/mip-2 , and cxcl20/mip-3 ) , rh - a mitigated their expression levels to a similar extent at 125500  g / ml ( up to 80% reduction ) . rh - b induced changes in gene expression that were comparable to those observed by rh - a , although there were quantitative differences in mmp-1 , mmp-13 , il-1 , cxcl8/il-8 , and ccl-2/mip-2 : in general , rh - b exerted weaker effects than rh - a ( see  fold change  in table 4 ) . notably , ccl5/rantes gene expression was dramatically induced in il-1 treated chondrocytes , but it was not upregulated in pbl . this observation points to cell- and tissue - specific modes of action of rhp and to distinct effects of rh - a and rh - b , respectively , in pbl and chondrocytes . in order to comprehensively assess the rose hip induced changes in oa biomarkers , we performed principal component analyses ( pca ) . pca is a dimension reduction method that allows transforming a complex highly correlated dataset ( e.g. , all oa biomarkers ) into a much smaller set of uncorrelated variables , that is , principal components ( pcs ) . in our experimental data meta - biomarker  and derived in decreasing order of importance , the first pc explaining most of the variation ( and thus representing most of the information ) contained in the original dataset . plotting the oa biomarkers in pca space allows to visualize and interpret these changes , which is very difficult in the high - dimensional setting of before . three different pcas were run , illustrating the global effects of rh - a and rh - b on pbls at the protein and gene level and on nhac - kn gene level . the pca were based on the expression of 17 pbl proteins , 10 pbl genes , and 14 nhac - kn genes , respectively . at the protein level , lps / ifn--activated pbl were clearly separated from the lps / ifn--activated / rhp - treated cells showing a treatment effect on pc1 . additionally a concentration - dependent effect for rh - a could be observed for pc1 as well . concentration - dependent effects for rh - b were mainly visualized by principal component 2 ( figure 4 ) . at the gene level , lps / ifn--activated pbl were separated from higher dose lps / ifn--activated / rhp - treated cells within the first principal component . additionally , rh - b exerted a more discriminating effect than rh - a within pc2 . the cumulative explained variability ( cev ) ( explained variation of pc1 + pc2 + pc3 ) for pbl at the protein and gene level was 96% and 94% , respectively , with pc1 explaining 51% and 45% of the variability . for nhac - kn , cev was 94% for variations observed at the gene level ( pc1 + pc2 , pc1 by itself explaining 80% ) . an effect of treatment was observable and mostly reflected by pc1 , whereas the effect of substance concentrations ( especially contrasting the high dose from the other doses ) was mainly distinguished by principal component 2 . a stronger effect of rh - b as compared to rh - a could also be observed in pc1 . taken together , the data indicate a distinguishable and beneficial effect of rh on oa biomarkers with rh - b being a stronger discriminator than rh - a .", "in this study , a panel of biological activities of rose hip powder prepared from the whole fruit or from shells has been compared . it provides evidence that cellular features related to inflammatory responses and cartilage destruction were modulated by the complex mixture of substances contained in rhp ( see table 1 ) . these have been measured in murine and human cellular models and are fully consistent with those previously reported . in lps - activated murine macrophages rhp exhibited mainly anti - inflammatory properties including reduced production of nitric oxide , cox-2 dependent pge2 , various chemokines , and proinflammatory cytokines . in pbl , the expression of interleukins and cytokines were mostly mitigated by rhp , while growth factor production like gm - csf and g - csf were increased . we observed a dichotomy with regard to chemokine expression : ccl5/rantes , ccl11/eotaxin , and cxcl10/ip-10 drastically decreased , whereas others augmented in the presence of rhp ( e.g. , cxl8/il-8 , ccl3/mip-1 , and ccl4/mip-1 ) . with regard to ccl5/rantes and cxcl8/il-8 , therefore , rhp could contribute to improve the amplitude and length of the acute inflammatory response through a more vigorous mobilization of lymphocytes and macrophages , while it dampens an excessive cell mobilization in chronic inflammation processes like in oa . this needs to be investigated in further experiments , where rhp should be tested on distinct subpopulations of pbl such as neutrophils , monocytes , and lymphocytes . the pattern of observed in vitro activities was more definite in the target tissue cell equivalent , that is , chondrocytes , where gene expression of ccl5/rantes , cxcl10/ip-10 , cxcl2/mip-2 , and ccl20/mip-3 was reduced by rhp . concomitantly , the expression of genes that degrade ecm was diminished and thus reflected a chondroprotective effect of rhp on cartilage tissue . previous studies highlighted the importance of chemokines in oa , with ccl5/rantes and cxcl8/il-8 being activated in chondrocytes [ 911 , 28 ] . the results of the present study corroborate previous data obtained with another source of rhp . it is premature to unambiguously define the bioactive constituents of rh - a and rh - b , whose composition considerably differed ( table 1 ) . removing seeds from rose hip preparations resulted in higher contents of anti - inflammatory substances like betulinic acid , ursolic acid , galactolipids , epa , and dha . on the other side , seeds contained the bulk of fatty acids which could serve as substrate for inflammatory mediators such as pge2 . these analyses demonstrated that rh - a and rh - b robustly modified a pattern or cluster of biological responses , as anticipated for beneficial effects of nutritional supplements ( reviewed by , e.g. , ) . more importantly , two of the three pcas performed ( at the level of pbl and nhac - kn genes ) showed that rh - b exhibited an overall stronger effect on oa biomarkers than rh - a . given the demonstrated health benefit of rose hip in clinical studies ( for review see , e.g. , ) , we hypothesize that in clinical studies rh - b is more efficacious or can be used in lower doses than rh - a in the treatment of oa conditions . indeed , a recently completed randomized active - controlled trial provided evidence that , taken at half the original dose , the novel enhanced rosehip powder ( rh - b ) had similar effects in patients with symptomatic oa as the original rosehip product ( rh - a ) .", "a new form of rosehip powder has enhanced in vitro anti - inflammatory and chondroprotective properties in human peripheral blood leukocytes and primary chondrocytes ."], "summary": "rose hip powder ( rhp ) alleviates osteoarthritis ( oa ) due to its anti - inflammatory and cartilage - protective properties . substances contained in rhp might contribute to its clinical efficacy . the activity of two rhp ( i.e. , rh - a , from the whole fruit , rh - b , from fruits without seeds ) was investigated in human peripheral blood leukocytes ( pbl ) and primary chondrocytes ( nhac - kn ) . rh - a and rh - b diminished the secretion of chemokines and cytokines in lps / ifn--activated pbl , including ccl5/rantes , cxcl10/ip-10 , interleukin- ( il- ) 6 , and il-12 . most effects were transcriptional , since gene expression levels were significantly influenced by rh - a and rh - b . in il-1 treated normal chondrocytes ( nhac - kn ) , both rh preparations reduced the expression of matrix metalloproteinase- ( mmp- ) 1 , mmp-3 , and mmp-13 and adamts-4 . these changes are associated with diminished inflammatory damage or cartilage erosion . principal component analysis revealed that ( 1 ) rh - a and rh - b modified a large pattern of biomarkers , and ( 2 ) rh - b outperformed rh - a . furthermore , rh - b contained more chondroprotective and anti - inflammatory constituents than rh - a . thus , rhp contributed to restore cellular homeostasis in pbl and chondrocytes . rh preparations from fruits without seeds are thus expected to have an improved oa - preventive or oa - therapeutic profile , as subsequently shown in a related clinical trial .", "ranking": [3, 2, 0, 4, 1]}

guided fine needle aspiration or biopsy is recommended . the imaging characteristics in our case were somewhat unique given the heterogeneity of the mass demonstrating discrete areas of soft tissue , calcification , and cyst formation , raising the initial concern of a nerve sheath tumor with possible malignant degeneration . the mass was noted to extend along the right - sided l5 and s1 nerve roots . also , we believe this massive spinal tophus to be the largest reported , measuring 7.5 cm    2.8 cm    10.3 cm , and extending from the level of l3 to s1 in the sagittal plane . in most cases , diagnosis can only be confirmed by histological examination of biopsy material . this minimally invasive diagnostic test allows differentiation from other important imitators such as neoplastic disease or infection and avoids unnecessary exploration . dual - energy ct may have a future role in differentiating spinal gout from infection or tumor and obviating biopsy by identifying the presence of uric acid in tissues . although some controversy exists , most presentations of axial pain caused by spinal gout can be medically managed.3 \n  patients without concomitant neurological deficits can be treated medically after spinal infection is excluded . medical treatment with nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory agents , such as naproxen and ibuprofen , and steroids , such as prednisolone , are effective to control pain acutely . this is followed by administration of a urate - reducing agent for long - term control such as probenecid , allopurinol , or rasburicase . maintaining adequate hydration and alkalization of urine is required to prevent recurrent episodes.3 \n 5 it is important for the clinician to realize that surgery is only warranted for relief of neurologic symptoms and that long - term management hinges on adequate medical therapy . given the long duration of this patient 's axial skeletal pain , aggressive medical management may have rendered surgery unnecessary ; however , a cautious approach is warranted when neurological deficits are present .", "department of rheumatology , chru ( university teaching hospital ) , and universit de franche -

standing peripheral tophaceous gout , elevated uric acid levels , and renal impairment , in a context of treatment discontinuation . imaging revealed a tophaceous mass surrounding zygapophysial joint , and diagnosis was confirmed by needle aspiration , revealing negatively birefringent crystals . surgery ( decompressive laminectomy and resection of intraspinal and perineural lesion ) was required in this case , with favorable outcome . the frequency of spine involvement of gout is not clearly established . in a retrospective study of patients with peripheral gout , changes suggestive of gout ( tophi or discovertebral erosion ) were present in 14% of the cases.1 in a prospective study of 45 patients with at least 3 years duration of poorly controlled peripheral gout , spinal ct evaluation revealed lesions in 35%,2 and only half of them had back pain . every segment of the spine may be involved , but as recalled by jegapragasan et al , the lumbar segment is the most frequent location . different features may be seen : vertebral bone tophi , spondylodiskitis , zygapophysial tophi or destructive arthritis , and epidural mass.3 this explains the variety of clinical symptoms ( isolated back pain , neurological symptoms associated ) and differential diagnosis ( infection , tumoral disease , degenerative disease ) . in one study,2 no differences in age , gout duration , body mass index , renal function , or presence of back pain or hypertension were found between gouty patients with and without spinal lesions , but peripheric radiographic erosions and diabetes were associated with the presence of spine ct abnormalities . the presence of subcutaneous tophi and history of previous gouty attacks are important anamnestic features that may help diagnosis , but nevertheless , gout may be revealed by spinal involvement.3 awareness may help interpretation of imaging ( plain radiography , ct , mri ) . dual - energy ct may allow in the future a most accurate imaging diagnosis approach of gout by estimates of tophus attenuation . needle aspiration is possible for zygapophyseal or discal involvement ; otherwise , a guided biopsy is required . however , in all the cases , polarized light microscopy examination is mandatory to establish the diagnosis . management of these patients may vary according to the clinical presentation . in case of neurological symptoms due to tophaceous mass , surgical decompression evidence of spine location of gout requires medical treatment of gout to avoid subsequent potential neurological complications , since old ( colchicine and allopurinol ) and new therapeutic possibilities are available for treating inflammatory attacks ( anti il-1 strategies ) and for urate lowering ( febuxostat , rasburicase , and pegloticase).4 \n 5", "for a variety of reasons , case reports are located near the bottom of the evidence pyramid . that said , they maintain a firm role in our peer - reviewed literature for the value they can provide us when they highlight rarities and raise our awareness for unusual cases that we as clinicians may be exposed to on any given day . the topic of tophaceous gout affecting the spine is such an unusual case ; it fascinates with its variability of presentation and clinical course and , therefore , lacks clear diagnostic and treatment guidelines . this well - documented case and thoughtful commentary impresses upon us the importance of a thorough physical examination of spine patients , including integument and joints outside the axial skeleton . it also underscores the importance of being familiar with differential diagnoses as we look at less than straightforward cases . it stands to reason that an earlier diagnosis in this patient would very reasonably have allowed for nonsurgical medical treatment and helped avoid surgery and subsequent disability ."], "summary": "study design  case report . objective  the objective of this study is to report the occurrence of tophaceous gout in the lumbar spine . methods  using a case report to illustrate the key points of gout in the spine , we provide a brief review of gout in the literature as it relates to its orthopedic and spinal manifestations as well as guidelines for management . \n results  this case report details the occurrence of a large and clinically significant finding of tophaceous gout in the lumbar spine in a 24-year - old man with a known history of gout and a 3-year history of progressive back pain . \n conclusion  a high index of suspicion can assist in diagnosis of patients presenting with back pain or neurologic findings with a history of gout . a previous history of gout ( especially the presence of tophi ) , hyperuricemia , and the radiological characteristics presented here should aid the clinician in making the diagnosis of spinal gout . early diagnosis has the potential to prevent the need for surgical intervention .", "ranking": [3, 4, 2, 1, 0]}

reactive protein ( crp ) production , the levels of which are known to be associated with metabolic syndromes such as obesity and diabetes , as well as with vascular events ( 17 ) . as an extension of the study of il-6r , il-6 , and crp in stroke , , there is no study about the associations between il-6r polymorphisms and ischemic stroke ( is ) . the national institutes of health stroke scale ( nihss ) is a neurologic impairment assessment tool that provides an objective quantified measurement in stroke patients ( 18,19 ) . higher scores on nihss indicate greater stroke severity . in a previous il-6 polymorphism study , patients with severe disability ( nihss  6 ) were associated with a specific genotype ( 20 ) . stroke rehabilitation outcomes are usually assessed using the modified barthel index ( mbi ) , which is a validated tool scoring independent daily living ( 21 ) . the aim of this study was to assess whether single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) of the il-6r gene were associated with the development , neurologic status , and clinical features of ischemic stroke in the korean population .", "all participants with stroke were patients who visited the departments of rehabilitation medicine at kyung hee medical center and kyung hee university hospital at gangdong . is patients were diagnosed based on magnetic resonance ( mr ) imaging , computed tomography ( ct ) , or angiography . exclusion criteria were ischemic heart disease or other causes of cerebrovascular events such as traumatic brain injury , transient ischemic attack , and vascular malformation , etc . peripheral blood samples were collected from the subjects , and genomic dna extraction was performed using a qiaamp dna mini kit ( qiagen , valencia , ca , usa ) . the genotypes of the two selected snps ware determined by direct sequencing ( macrogen , seoul , korea ) . the following primers were used in the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) amplification : rs4845617 ( forward 5-ctgttctccccgctcaggtgcg-3 , reverse 5-agaggcggacaggctaatg-3 ) and rs2228144 ( forward 5-gtagcctgggccacttcatca t-3 , reverse 5-gacctctgaggcacaactcac-3 ) . pcr consisted of 40 cycles at 94c for 30 sec , 58c for 30 sec , 72c for 30 sec , and 1 cycle at 72c for 5 min . an abi prism 3730xl analyzer ( pe applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) sequenced the pcr products , and seqmanii software ( dnastar , madison , wi , usa ) was used to analyze the sequencing data ( 22 ) . to obtain odds ratios ( ors ) , 95% confidence intervals ( cis ) , and p values adjusted for age and sex as covariates , snpanalyzer pro ( istech , goyang , korea ) , helixtree ( golden helix , bozeman , mt , usa ) , and snpstats ( http://bioinfo.iconcologia.net/index.php?module=snpstats ) were used . the chi - square test was used to determine hardy - weinberg equilibrium ( hwe ) . a multiple logistic regression analysis was adjusted for age and sex . in terms of increasing risk of disease , an increased specific allele frequency was noted in is patients compared with the allele frequency of controls . to analyze the association between a polymorphism and disease , a contingency table and chi - square test were applied using a prespecified genetic model . the codominant model was the most general model  where the disease risk associated with ab individuals lies between that of aa and bb individuals . in dominant model , with the hypothesis that carrying allele b increased risk of disease ( dominant model ) , the ab and bb genotypes are pooled giving a 2 * 2 table . alternatively , under a recessive model for allele b , cells aa and ab would be pooled . additive model is assumed that increased disease risk of  for ab genotypes and 2  for bb genotypes  ( 23 ) . in this study , codominant model 1 compared major allele homozygotes with heterozygotes , and codominant model 2 compared major allele homozygotes with minor allele homozygotes . to determine the haplotypes between the two snps and the clinical features in patients with is , haploview version 4.2 ( daly lab , cambridge , ma , usa ) was used . the study was approved by the institutional review board of medical research institute , school of medicine , kyung hee university and center , and kyung hee university hospital at gangdong ( irb no .", "the study was approved by the institutional review board of medical research institute , school of medicine , kyung hee university and center , and kyung hee university hospital at gangdong ( irb no .", "there were 121 is patients ( mean  sd , 65.7  12.1 years ) and 291 controls ( mean  sd , 63.0  9.3 years ) . there was a difference in mean age between is patients and control subjects , but it was not significant ( p = 0.30 ) . is patients were classified into two subgroups according to nihss score ( nihss 1 , nihss score < 6 ; and nihss 2 , nihss score  6 ) and mbi score ( mbi 1 , mbi  60 ; and mbi 2 , mbi score > 60 ) . the numbers of is patients with nihss score < 6 and  6 were 56 and 57 , respectively . the numbers of is patients with mbi score  60 and > 60 were 71 and 25 , respectively ( data not shown ) . nihss 1 , nihss score < 6 ; nihss 2 , nihss score  6 . the genotype and allele frequencies of the two examined snps are shown in tables 2 and 3 , respectively . two snps ( rs4845617 , 5tur ; rs2228144 , ala31ala ) of the il-6r gene were in hwe in the is and control groups , respectively ( p > 0.05 , data not shown ) . the genotype and allele frequencies of the two snps demonstrated no significant difference in is cases and controls ( table 2 ) . as shown in table 3 , the snp rs4845617 was associated with the nihss score of is patients ( p = 0.011 , or = 0.24 , 95% ci = 0.08 -

additive model , and the a allele frequency was significantly higher in the nihss 1 group of is patients . however , in snp rs2228144 , the genotype and allele frequencies did not correlate with the nihss score of the is group ( table 3 ) . furthermore , rs4845617 and rs2228144 had no correlation with mbi score in the is group ( data not shown ) . nihss 1 , nihss score < 6 ; nihss 2 , nihss score  6 . we investigated the associations between haplotypes of control subjects and is patients and nihss score . the haplotype frequencies of the two snps were not significantly different between control subjects and is patients ( table 4 ) . however , as shown in tables 5 and 6 , the ag and gg haplotypes differed between the nihss 1 and nihss 2 groups in is patients . the frequency of the ag haplotype was higher in the nihss 1 group , and that of the gg haplotype was higher in the nihss 2 group of is patients ( p = 0.014 , p = 0.0024 , respectively ) . however , the haplotype frequencies found no significant difference by mbi scores ( table 6 ) . nihss 1 , nihss score < 6 ; nihss 2 , nihss score  6 .", "ischemic stroke is known to be a heterogeneous multifactorial disease ( 24 ) . although conventional risk factors such as hypertension , diabetes , dyslipidemia and smoking account for a significant proportion of these stroke events , a considerable portion remains insufficiently explained by these factors ( 25,26 ) . as risk factors for stroke , several genetic factors have been studied ; however , there are few useful markers for prevention , diagnosis , and treatment of stroke ( 26 ) . therefore , increasing our understanding of risk factors including genetic components would allow us to predict the risk better , identification of novel stroke mechanisms , and new therapeutic approaches using genetic factors ( 27 ) . some of these snps include apolipoprotein e ( 3 ) , 5-methyltetrahydrofolate - homocysteine methyltransferase ( 6 ) , interleukin 4 ( 11 ) , interleukin-1 receptor antagonist , tumor necrosis factor , interleukin 1 beta ( 8) , neuropeptide y ( 5 ) , peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma ( 9 ) , phosphodiesterase 4d camp - specific chemokine ( c - c motif ) ligand 5 ( 4 ) , thromboxanea2 receptor , and thromboxane a synthase 1 ( platelet ) ( 10 ) . several snps have been identified in the il-6r gene , associated with carotid plaque ( 28 ) , crp ( 17,29 ) and obesity or diabetes ( 30313233 ) . however , there has been no study of polymorphisms of the il-6r gene in relation to stroke . carotid plaque is assumed to be associated with increased stroke risk . in a genetic study in a dominican population , il-6r was suggested to be a related gene associated with carotid plaque ( 28 ) . il-6 has been shown to have a positive correlation with crp and to predict the risk of vascular events . the polymorphism of il-6r gene is linked with crp expression and plasma il-6 level ( 34 ) . ( 35 ) demonstrated that the il-6r variants ( rs6684439 , rs4845622 , rs8192284 , rs4329505 ) are significantly associated with plasma crp level , independent of il-6 level . in addition , the il-6r variant interacts with crp in relation to diabetes risk . in another study , the il-6r gene ( rs4845617 ) was suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis ( 36 ) . we identified snps of il-6r , in coding regions near the promoter region , that had greater than 0.1 heterozygosity and greater than 0.1 minor allele frequency . for rs4845617 , heterozygosity is 0.471 , and minor allele frequency is 0.3804 ; for rs2228144 , heterozygosity is 0.208 , and minor allele frequency is 0.1178 . this is the first report to identify an association between snps of the il-6r gene associated with risk of stroke and the clinical features of stroke . the two snps ( rs4845617 and rs2228144 ) were not associated with development or daily activities of is . however , our results revealed that snp rs4845617 contributes to the neurologic status of is patients . the mechanisms remain of the effects of il-6r gene polymorphisms on stroke severity remain unclear . compared with previous snps studies , the sample size in this study was relatively small . therefore , other stroke risk factors analyses could be included while sample size became smaller after dividing groups with regard to hypertension , diabetes , dyslipidemia , and smoking history in this study . further studies with larger sample size are necessary to elucidate this result . in summary , two snps of the il-6r gene ( rs4845617 , rs2228144 ) were analyzed in korean ischemic stroke patients . the frequencies of genotype and alleles of the two snps demonstrated no significant difference in is cases and controls . . however , in snp rs4845617 , the frequencies of genotypes according to nihss score are statistically different , and the a allele frequency in the mild stroke patients is significantly higher than an allele frequency in the severe stroke patients . this indicates that snp rs4845617 is associated with the neurologic status evaluated by nihss in patients with is . in addition , the a allele of snp rs4845617 might have a protective effect against neurologic deficit in is patients ."], "summary": "to investigate the contribution of the interleukin-6 receptor ( il-6r ) gene single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) to the neurological status of korean patients with ischemic stroke ( is ) , two snps of the il-6r gene ( rs4845617 , 5 utr ; rs2228144 , ala31ala ) were selected . is patients were classified into clinical phenotypes according to two well - defined scores : the national institutes of health stroke survey ( nihss ) and the modified barthel index scores . there were 121 is patients and 291 control subjects . the snp rs4845617 significantly contributed to the neurological status of patients with is ( p = 0.011 in codominant model 2 , p = 0.006 in recessive model , and p = 0.008 in log - additive model ) . allele frequencies of rs4845617 and rs2228144 demonstrated no significant difference in is patients and controls . the ag and gg haplotypes differed between the nihss 1 ( nihss scores < 6 ) group and the nihss 2 ( nihss scores  6 ) group in patients with is ( p = 0.014 , p = 0.0024 ) . these results suggest that rs4845617 of the il-6r gene is associated with the neurologic status of korean patients with is .", "ranking": [0, 4, 1, 3, 2]}

Conclusion"], "document": ["parasitic intestinal nematodes are widespread , affecting human and vertebrates . worldwide , more than one - third of mankind is infected with helminths   of which 100200 million people are infected with strongyloides [ 2 , 3 ] and approximately 800 million with trichuris . the investigated nematodes strongyloides ratti and trichuris suis are very closely related to their human - pathogenic homologues strongyloides stercoralis and trichuris trichiura [ 5 , 6 ] . in contrast to immune responses to microbes with mainly inflammation , the immune responses to helminths are mostly less intense and highly regulated . modulation of the host 's immune response reported from t. suis ova can be beneficial for an attenuation of inflammatory bowel diseases ( ibd ) such as crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis [ 8 , 9 ] . helminths release multiple excretory / secretory ( e / s ) products which enable them to establish , survive , and reproduce in their hosts successfully [ 10 , 11 ] . in case of s. ratti and t. suis , these e / s products include antioxidative proteins such as thioredoxin ( trx ) , heat shock proteins , and numerous proteases as well as protease inhibitors , galectins , and orthologous of host cytokines [ 10 , 1216 ] . trx has also been reported in e / s products of multiple helminths [ 1720 ] . recently , these e / s proteins have also been detected in extracellular vesicles from helminths . trx or the trx system in general is widespread from archaea to human consisting of trx , the trx reductase , and nadph . hereby , trx is reduced by the trx reductase in an nadph - dependent manner . in general , trx superfamily members regulate thiol - based redox control , operating as protein disulfide oxidoreductases , and protect cytosolic proteins against aggregation in the cell . its redox - regulating activity is important for dna replication , maintenance of the cellular redox state , and , therefore , the cellular homeostasis and antioxidant defense [ 22 , 25 ] . furthermore , trx is part of multiple cellular pathways   and capable of regulating transcription factor activities , inhibition of apoptosis , protection from high - energy oxygen radicals , and regeneration of denatured proteins and is critical for signal transduction through thiol redox control as well as more specific processes like presenting antigens [ 22 , 23 , 2628 ] . without a signal peptide , trx is secreted by a nonclassical secretory pathway by various cells [ 29 , 30 ] . the numerous extracellular activities of trx include anti - inflammatory and antiapoptotic , and thus cytoprotective effects [ 3133 ] . of interest , multifunctional prokaryotic trx , which displays unrelated properties , that is , antioxidant activity and promotion of dna replication , has been described as moonlighting protein [ 3436 ] . in the e / s products of strongyloides and of multiple other helminths numerous multifunctional proteins have been detected like the moonlighting enzymes enolase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [ 10 , 13 , 3739 ] . while trx is well characterized , less is known about the functions of trx - lp . the trx - lp , a member of the trx superfamily , is a fusion protein composed of the classical trx domain ( wcgpc ) at the n - terminus and a c - terminal proteasome - interacting thioredoxin ( pith ) domain , formerly known as duf1000 ( protein families database , http://pfam.xfam.org/family/pf06201 ) . it is larger than the classical trx ( 12  kda ) , which is highly conserved in all species [ 23 , 25 ] . proteins of the trx superfamily have been reported in various protozoan parasites including plasmodium , trypanosoma , and toxoplasma [ 4043 ] and in the trematode clonorchis sinensis . besides thiol - based redox control , eukaryotic trx - lps are also involved in signaling processes as cofactors of certain enzymes , regulating specific signal proteins [ 45 , 46 ] . for example , the human trx - related protein ( trp32 ) , known as txnl-1 , protects the cell against glucose deprivation - induced cytotoxicity and is involved in activation of antiapoptotic akt / pi3k signaling as well as pten ( phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten ) inhibition [ 47 , 48 ] . another example is the thioredoxin domain containing 17 ( txndc17 ) , also known as trx - related protein of 14  kda ( trp14 ) , which is stat-3-dependent and responsible for the drug resistance in human colorectal cancer cells . trp14 also shows , like trx1 , s - nitrosylase activity and furthermore is able to control the tnf-/nf-b signaling pathway [ 4951 ] . in addition , pten is also an interaction partner of human trx and among others trx controls the tnf-/nf-b signaling pathway as well [ 52 , 53 ] . the novel thioredoxin - related transmembrane protein tmx4 is a type i transmembrane protein with its trx - like domain inside the er which possibly plays a role in the correct folding of proteins inside the er due to its reductase function . since trx have been reported to act as chemoattractant for leukocytes and to induce cytokines   we wanted to examine if srtrx - lp has similar impact on monocytic cells . in the present study we cloned and characterized two trx - lps and investigated some functional activities including their chemotactic activity , their ability to promote wound healing processes in the intestinal epithelial cell ( iec ) caco-2 model , and their involvement in cytokine release in a three - dimensional- ( 3d- ) cell culture model", "the s. ratti life cycle was maintained in our laboratory as reported [ 13 , 15 ] . animal experiments were approved by and conducted in accordance with guidelines of the animal protection board of the city of hamburg ( g21131/591 -

lp was repeatedly regenerated by dtt . here , the regeneration of active trx - lp is faster than the direct reduction of insulin by dtt . initially , 1.6  mm insulin ( bovine pancreas , sigma - aldrich , hamburg , germany ) was prepared by a suspension of 50  mg of insulin in 2.5  ml 100  mm potassium phosphate buffer ( ph 6.5 ) for the reaction approach . here , the ph was first adjusted to 3 with 1  m  hcl solution to completely dissolve the protein and the ph was adjusted to 6.5 with 1  m  naoh . the solution was supplemented with dh2o to a volume of 5  ml . thereafter , a master mix of 825  l 1.6  mm insulin ( 160  m final volume ) and 4675  l pe ( 100  mm potassium phosphate , 2  mm edta , ph 6.5 ) buffer was prepared . srtrx - lp was tested at a concentration of 1  m ( 30  g / ml ) , 2.5  m ( 75  g / ml ) , and 5  m ( 150  g / ml ) . in an interval of 1  min over a period of 40  min , the reduction of insulin by srtrx - lp was measured . as a negative control , the relative specific enzymatic activity was calculated by the following formula : a650  1000/mg protein concentration in the reaction mix . according to the method of wollman et al . ( 1988 ) , the trx - lp from either s. ratti or t. suis was reduced by 100  mm dtt for 1  h at room temperature ( rt ) and dialyzed against 80  mm hepes and 10  mm edta buffer for 1  h at 4c to remove dtt . the buffer was mixed with 1.7  m igm ( piercetm mouse igm isotype control , thermo scientific , czech republic ) and 0.5  l , 1  l , and 5  l of the reduced trx - lp solution for overnight reaction at rt . for protein size determination sds - page analysis healthy volunteers served as source for peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( mnc ) and polymorphonuclear cells ( pmn ) purified from venous blood samples ( collected in sodium citrate tubes ) . first , erythrocytes were sedimented from anticoagulated blood samples by addition of equal amounts of 6% hydroxyethyl starch ( heas - steril , fresenius , friedberg , germany ) . mncs were separated from pmn as reported before by density centrifugation using a two - level density gradient consisting of mono - poly resolving media ( 1.114  g / ml ; mp biomedicals , stockholm , sweden ) and lymphoflot ( 1.077  g / ml ; bio - rad , dreieich , germany ) . the cells were washed carefully with pbs , followed by a centrifugation step at 1,800  rpm for 10  min . this step was optionally repeated one more time , if too many platelets were present . while the mncs were added to the thp-1 media , the pmns were resuspended in hbss both at a concentration of 5  10 cells / ml and stored on ice until further use . to analyze the immunological effect of srtrx - lp and tstrx - lp , the recombinant proteins were used as stimuli in a 3d - coculture model , composed of human intestinal epithelial and dendritic cells ( dcs ) , derived from monocytic thp-1 cells , grown on a collagen scaffold that mimics the in vivo natural microenvironment . the human intestinal epithelial cells , caco-2 cells , were grown in dmem media ( with 10 % fcs , 1% nonessential amino acids , 1% pen / strep ; liefer - co ) until denseness of 7080% was reached and seeded on 12-well plates in thincerts tc inserts ( greiner bioone ) followed by the addition of 200  l collagen ( university hospital wrzburg ) to each insert . prior to adding the caco-2 cells , the collagen was incubated 1  h at 37c for gelation . to detach the caco-2 cells from the flask the cells were trypsinized prior to transfer 10 cells / well into the collagen - layered inserts and incubated for 2  h at 37c and 5% co2 to let them adhere on the collagen . for differentiation to dcs , thp-1 cells were washed twice in pbs and seeded in serum - free rpmi 1640 media supplemented with il-4 ( 1000  iu / ml ; peprotech , hamburg , germany ) and gm - csf ( 1000  iu / ml ; peprotech ) and were grown for 710 days . subsequently the generation of mature dcs was verified by staining 10 washed cultured cells with phycoerythrin- ( pe- ) conjugated monoclonal anti - cd86 ( b7 - 2 ) antibodies ( mouse anti - human cd86-pe - conjugated antibody ; becton - dickinson bioscience , san diego , usa , and a pe - conjugated isotype control ; pharmingen , leiden , netherlands ) analyzed by flow cytometry ( cellquestpro ; bd ) ( data not shown ) . after proper development of both cell types , the caco-2-collagen inserts were transferred to the wells with grown dcs , which were floated with dmem media ( 10% fcs , 1% nonessential amino acids , 1% pen / strep ) . the trx - lps were added as stimuli ( 5  g , 10  g , and 25  g / ml ) , while the ufm-1 activating protein uba-5 ( 25  g / ml ) from the nonparasitic nematode caenorhabditis elegans served as negative control . further controls were performed with the bacterial cell wall components lps ( 1  g / ml ; sigma - aldrich , taufkirchen , germany ) and lipoteichoic acid ( lta , 0.1  g / ml ; sigma - aldrich , taufkirchen ) to analyze potential endotoxin contaminations and to compare both responses . the supernatants were taken after 24  h , 48  h , and 72  h and stored at 20c until further use . for detection of the cytokines tnf- , il-10 , il-22 , and tslp in cell supernatants , kits from ebioscience ( san diego , usa ) were used according to the manufacturer 's instructions . here , il-10 was detected with a sensitivity of 2  pg / ml , il-22 and tslp with a sensitivity of 8  pg / ml , and tnf- with a sensitivity of 4  pg / ml . to measure the binding affinity of the s. ratti and t. suis trx - lps to certain cell types , the purified proteins were labeled using the alexa fluor 647 protein labeling kit microscale ( a30009 ) from invitrogen ( oregon , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . the binding affinity for both trx - lps to monocytes , lymphocytes , and granulocytes from peripheral blood , as well as to the cell lines thp-1 cells ( undifferentiated and differentiated ) and caco-2 cells , were tested . the fluorescently labeled proteins were tested in four different concentrations ( 0.1  g and 0.2  g [ data unpublished ] and 0.4  g and 0.6  g ) . each sample , which consisted of srtrx - lp or tstrx - lp and the cell type to be tested , was brought to a volume of 200  l with pbs and incubated for 30  min . after incubation , samples were washed twice , resuspended in 150  l pbs , and analyzed by flow cytometry on a facscalibur cytometer ( bd biosciences ) , with 10,000 events collected from the gated populations . for further characterization of the binding specificity , cells were preincubated with 0.1  g and 0.2  g ( data not shown ) or 0.4  g and 0.6  g of unlabeled protein for 30  min prior to the addition of the corresponding labeled proteins . the data were analyzed with cellquestpro . to evaluate the chemotactic activity of human monocytic thp-1 cells , boyden chambers were used as described previously [ 68 , 69 ] . dtt ( 100  mm ) reduced trx - lps from s. ratti and t. suis were tested at concentrations of 3  ng , 30  ng , 300  ng , and 1  g each in 100  l . the assay was performed with negative controls ( random migration ) such as chemotaxis buffer ( pbs containing cacl2 , mgcl2 , and bsa ) and thp-1 media ( rpmi containing hepes and 10% fcs ) and as positive control lps at 100  ng , since lps induces migration of monocytic cells . thp-1 cells ( 2  10 ) were allowed to migrate through polyvinyl - pyrrolidone - free polycarbonate filters ( pore size : 3  m ; nuclepore , tbingen , germany ) within 90  min at 37c and 5% co2 . afterwards , migrated cells were counted by using an inverted zeiss microscope ( axiovert 25 ) . to monitor epithelial cell migration of caco-2 cells and the ability of trx - lps to improve the wound healing process , we used the cytoselect 24-well wound healing assay ( cell biolabs , inc . ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . by means of the cytoselect wound healing 500  l of a caco-2 cell suspension ( containing 0.5  10 cells ) was added to each well after the inserts had firm contact with the bottom of the wells . after overnight incubation , a monolayer was formed , the inserts were removed , the cells were washed , and the different stimuli were added . we used both trx - lps , from s. ratti and t. suis , in concentrations of 3  ng , 30  ng , 300  ng , 1  g , 10  g , and 25  g per 500  l . as a positive control the human epidermal growth factor ( egf ; 0.5  ng , 5  ng , 10  ng , 15  ng , and 25  ng ) was included in order to get the proper concentration for maximal wound healing effects . as negative control cell media and lps were added . an inverted digital microscope ( evos fl thermo fisher scientific ) by advanced microscopy group was used for observation ( 4x magnification ) . the cells were incubated for 4 days , whereby each 24  h a picture was taken and the percent closure was calculated . statistical differences between groups were analyzed with the t - test for independent samples or the mann  p < 0.05 was taken as moderate evidence of significance and p < 0.01 as strong evidence of significance .", "srtrx - lp is represented by the cluster sr00399   and was abundantly found in s. ratti e / s products of parasitic s. ratti females . the partial sequence was identified as the thioredoxin family protein and was used to obtain the full - length cdna sequence by pcr . further , the full - length cdna sequence of the t. suis hypothetical protein m513 ( accession no . the protein sequence of the recombinantly expressed s. ratti and t. suis trx - lps have been verified by mass spectrometry . conserved domains of the trx - lps from the intestinal helminths s. ratti and t. suis were ascertained by the protein families database ( pfam ) . neither the trx - lp from s. ratti nor the trx - lp from t. suis contain a signal peptide . both proteins have an n - terminal thioredoxin domain containing the active side motif cxxc ( cgpc ) and a c - terminal pith ( proteasome - interacting domain of thioredoxin - like ) domain . the alignment of the amino acid sequences from different organisms revealed a relatively low degree of identity between the different species . between the trx - lps from s. ratti and t. suis the degree of identity ( 39% ) was not as high as between trx - lps from s. ratti and b. malayi ( 56% ) . trx - lps ( 94% ) , similar to the sequences of s. ratti and s. stercoralis ( 99.9% ) ( data not shown ) . comparing the other aligned helminth protein sequences , the similarities to the s. ratti and the t. suis trx - lps varied between 35% and 56% . the comparison of the redox - regulating protein between s. ratti and homo sapiens showed 43% identity . the aligned helminth sequences share , except for the trematode schistosoma mansoni , the catalytic site sequence ( cgpc ) with the human trx - lp sequence of the active site . there are always two cysteines which are separated by two amino acids , mostly glycine and proline . instead of a glycine , the s. mansoni catalytic site sequence has an arginine ( r ) ( figure 1 ) . both parasite trx - lps have a trx - like domain ( left ) as well as the pith domain ( right ) ( figure 2 ; phyre2 : ) . srtrx - lp and tstrx - lp were recombinantly expressed in endotoxin - free e. coli as his - tagged proteins and as strep - tagged proteins . the amount of purified his - tagged proteins , however , was higher than the amount of purified strep - tagged proteins . thus , after preliminary tests with strep - tagged proteins , we further worked with his - tagged proteins . both parasite proteins were verified by western blot using anti - strep and anti - his antibody ( figure s1 ) and mass spectrometry . \n ( 1 ) insulin reduction . for measurement of the functional activity of srtrx - lp using insulin , the precipitation of free insulin -chains was measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 650  nm according to holmgren ( 1979 ) as well as luthman and holmgren ( 1982 ) [ 61 , 62 ] . a concentration of 1  m ( 30  g / ml ) , 2.5  m ( 75  g / ml ) , and 5  m ( 150  g / ml ) of the srtrx - lp was used and the measuring time was plotted against the rate of precipitation ( a650/min  10 ) , which was about 0.064 a650/min at the highest concentration . srtrx - lp reduces insulin with a relative specific activity of 1556.67 and is regenerated by dtt whereby in the negative control and the lowest concentration of srtrx - lp only a slight precipitation of insulin could be measured ( figure 3 ) . \n its molecular weight is about 950  kda and it contains 26 interchain disulfide bridges that are potential substrates for trx and thus for trx - lp . additionally to the insulin reduction activity assay , the dithiol - disulfide oxidoreductase activity of the trx - lps was analyzed by an igm reduction test according to wollman et al . as positive control igm was reduced by 100  mm dtt at which bands at about 70  kda ( heavy chain igm ) and 25  kda ( light chain igm ) occur ( figure 4 , 3rd lanes ) . only exposing igm to the highest amount of srtrx - lp , five main bands were identified ( figure 4(a ) , lane 7 ) . in addition to the bands at 70  kda and 25  kda , similar to the reduction of igm with dtt , and the band at 250  kda , now bands at about 30  kda , representing monomeric s. ratti trx - lp and 60  kda representing dimeric s. ratti trx - lp , were determined . almost similar protein bands have been observed when t. suis trx - lp was analyzed ( figure 4(b ) ) ; however , t. suis trx - lp also at the low and intermediate concentration leads to the reduction of igm . further , bands at 140  kda ( heavy chain dimers of igm ) were predominant at all tstrx - lp doses ( figure 4(b ) ) . the binding ability to other immune cells as well as mucosal caco-2 cells was examined by facs ( figure 5 ) . monocytes , lymphocytes , and neutrophils as well as caco-2 cells , thp-1 cells , and thp-1-derived dendritic cells ( dcs ) were exposed to alexa flour - labeled trx - lps . thus , srtrx - lp ( figure 5(a ) ) as well as tstrx - lp ( figure 5(b ) ) proteins strongly bound to monocytic cells shown in a dose - dependent manner for peripheral monocytes ( srtrx - lp : mfi 175185 ; tstrx - lp : mfi 1960 ) , thp-1 cell line ( srtrx - lp : mfi 36108 ; tstrx - lp : mfi 38133 ) , and generated dcs ( srtrx - lp : mfi 85170 ) . srtrx - lp and at lower degree tstrx - lp also bound to caco-2 cells ( srtrx - lp : mfi 4552 ; tstrx - lp : mfi 1442 ) and with limited affinity to neutrophilic granulocytes ( srtrx - lp : mfi 15 - 16 ; tstrx - lp : mfi 1750 ) and lymphocytes ( srtrx - lp : mfi 911 ; tstrx - lp : mfi 1020 ) . in order to verify the differentiation of thp-1 cells to dcs by il-4 and gm - csf , cd86 localized on the surface of differentiated dcs but not on thp-1 cells ( data not shown ) . the s. ratti and t. suis trx - lps were examined for their ability to induce the release of cytokines in human 3d - cocultures of intestinal epithelial cells ( iec ) and dcs . the release of the inflammatory ( tnf- ) , anti - inflammatory ( il-10 ) , and th2-related cytokines ( il-22 , tslp ) was analyzed . in preliminary experiments , the optimized concentrations of lps and lta were determined as 0.5  g / ml and 0.1  g / ml ( data not shown ) . 200  g / ml t. suis extract was used as a positive control and cell culture medium was used as a negative control ( figure 6(a ) ) . the trx - lps were tested at concentrations of 3  ng , 30  ng , 300  ng , 1  g , 10  g , and 25  g ( each per ml ) . the reduced state ( reduction via dtt ) and the oxidized state ( freshly purified protein , only partly reduced , see igm reduction ) of the trx - lps made no difference in the cytokine response ( data not shown ) . this observation indicated that the immune responses the proteins triggered are probably active site - independent . 10  g and 25  g of both helminthic trx - lps are the most representative concentrations inducing the highest cytokine release . cocultured cells exposed to t. suis ( ts ) extract showed in particular an enhanced production of il-10 and il-22 after 48  h and an even higher release of il-10 after 72  h , while the proinflammatory cytokine tnf- was downregulated ( figure 6(a ) ) . srtrx- as well as tstrx - lp induced initially a slightly pronounced release of proinflammatory tnf- after 24  h ( p < 0.01 ) , followed by an increased production of il-22 and tslp after 48  h of incubation ( p < 0.01 ) . in response to the exposure of the cocultures to trx - lps in particular the th2-associated cytokine il-22 was produced after 48  h and 72  h ( p < 0.01 ) . at a concentration of 25  g of tstrx - lp , the tnf- release increased after 48  h and even dominated the il-22 production . after 72  h , the il-22 and tslp production was dominating the overall tnf- production . 10  g / ml of trx - lps appears to be slightly more potent with respect to cytokine release than 25  g of protein with statistical significance only between the il-22-inducing srtrx - lp concentrations after 48  h ( p < 0.01 ) ( figure 6(b ) ) . therefore , we investigated the chemotactic activity of the parasite trx - lps for monocytic thp-1 cells by using boyden chambers . different trx - lp concentrations ( 3  ng , 30  ng , 300  ng , and 1  g ; each per 100  l ) from both studied parasites were added to the lower compartment of the chambers . in the negative control , a few cells migrated through the membrane , while the cell migration using lps as stimulant was significantly increased . among the different applied trx - lp concentrations the highest migration rate was detected at 3  ng . the overall cell migration was higher in case of s. ratti trx - lp than after stimulation with the tstrx - lp and half bell - shaped dose - response curve reported for chemokines is more pronounced in case of the tstrx - lp ( figure 7 ) . as an important functional activity it was investigated whether the trx - lps from both nematode parasites express wound healing activity . therefore , the effect of different concentrations of trx - lps on epithelial cell ( caco-2 ) wound closure ( figure 8 , data , and figure 9 , microscopic photography ) was analyzed . compared to the untreated cells , where the wound - like area narrowed 1015% every day , the stimulated cells showed almost twice as much growth . 300  ng/500  l of both parasite trx - lps are the most potent concentration for promoting the wound healing process as well as 10  ng of egf , which was included as positive control , while 3  ng and 30  ng and concentrations upon 1  g ( each per 500  l ) have a more moderate effect on wound healing . the wound healing process was highly significantly promoted by egf and tstrx - lp ( p < 0.01 ) as well as significantly promoted by srtrx - lp ( p < 0.05 ) .", "trx is a physiologically important multifunctional protein and prokaryotic trx has been described as so - called moonlighting protein [ 34 , 35 ] . the multiple biological functions comprise features as growth factor and antioxidant , as inhibitor of apoptosis and transcriptional factor , and as chemokine [ 22 , 23 , 2528 ] . very little is known about trx - lps , in particular about those from helminths and their potential role in parasite - host interaction . there is only one publication about an endoplasmic reticulum located trx transmembrane related protein from the trematode clonorchis sinensis , containing a trx domain with the active site motif cys - pro - ala - cys ( cpac ) . this redox molecule is suggested to serve as protection against host- and parasite - generated ros . contrariwise , the s. ratti trx - lp has the catalytic domain sequence of the uniformly small ( 12  kda ) ubiquitous trx proteins ( wcgpc ) but has a size of approximately 30  kda . comparably , the t. suis trx - lp has a size of approximately 33  kda and the same catalytic domain sequence as the classic trx . in the present study , trx - lp from two parasitic nematodes , s. ratti and t. suis , were cloned , expressed , and characterized for the first time . in case of both helminths the protein was present in the e / s products of the parasites [ 13 , brattig et al . the molecular mass ( 3033  kda ) as well as the proteins structure suggested similar functions to those of the human trx - related protein ( trp32 ) , also known as txnl-1 , which protects the cell against glucose deprivation - induced cytotoxicity and is involved in antiapoptotic signaling [ 47 , 48 , 71 ] . like srtrx- and tstrx - lp , trp32 consists of an n - terminal trx and a c - terminal pith domain as well . trx - lps are known to have several binding partners and substrates they associate with by means of their trx domain , which exerts redox - active functions . the c - terminal pith domain is able to interact with the 26s proteasome by the substrate - recruiting factor of the 26s proteasome eef1a1 [ 72 , 73 ] . similar to trx , trx - lps of eukaryotic cells are also multifunctional and involved in different cellular processes including cofactor functions or the regulation of specific signaling proteins   which may indicate possible moonlighting properties that have to be demonstrated in the future [ 3436 ] . comparisons of trx - like homologues by multiple sequence alignments revealed a high sequence similarity between trx - lps from t. suis and from t. trichiura ( 94% identity ) . apart from this , the protein alignment showed a relatively low degree of similarity ( 35%56% ) between different nematodes , either parasitic or nonparasitic . except for s. mansoni all other species had the strongly conserved n - terminal trx catalytic site sequence ( cgpc ) . at the c - terminus all trx - lps possess the pith domain . like trx , the analyzed parasite proteins have no signal peptide and are released from cells by nonclassical protein export [ 29 , 75 ] . trx - lp has also various roles in several human cellular and extracellular processes , since reactive oxygen species ( ros ) occur in the normally functioning metabolism . the dithiol - disulphide oxidoreductase activity of both recombinant s. ratti and t. suis trx - lps was either analyzed by insulin reduction according to holmgren ( 1979 ) or igm reduction according to wollman et al . the relative specific activity of trx from e. coli amounts to a value of 4930 units . findings that measured relative specific activity of the srtrx - lp has an activity of about 1557 units show that it has a comparable activity to classical trx . ( 1988 ) have already shown that recombinant human trx is able to reduce the disulfide bridges of murine igm . therefore , we suggested trx domain containing trx - lps may also have the ability to reduce igm . we could show that indeed both trx - lps reduced the s - s bonds of igm . since all tstrx - lp used doses resulted in the formation of the same bands in sds - page , this trx - lp appears to be more active than the s. ratti trx - lp . even at the lowest concentration minor protein bands the more intensive they were the higher the added concentration of tstrx - lp was . a reduction of igm by not fully removed dtt can be excluded since then the strength of the formed bands would be the same in each approach . although even at the lowest concentration bands have been formed , they were more intensive at the highest concentration . furthermore , in the igm reduction assay of srtrx - lp no bands were existent at the lowest and the intermediate concentration of the added protein . through those activity assays it could be demonstrated that the recombinantly expressed trx - lps have redox functions and are able to act as classical trx . in further analysis it has been reported to be released by monocytes   and also to be chemotactic for monocytes , neutrophils , and t lymphocytes . accordingly , we have observed that s. ratti and t. suis trx - lps exhibit chemotactic activity for monocytes and have the ability to interact with them . an attraction of monocytic cells to a nematode - dwelling site could subsequently lead to an activation of the cells leading to a consecutive generation of wound healing fostering cytokines like il-22 and immunoregulatory interleukins [ 7880 ] . both parasite trx - lps bound to monocytic cells , to the thp-1 cells , and to peripheral monocytes although in some facs analysis there were only limited counting events . of interest , the parasite redox - regulating proteins also bound to caco-2 cells and more weakly to lymphocytes and granulocytes . thus , trx - lps seem to interact with intestinal epithelial cells , the first - line host cells that get exposed to e / s products released by the colonizing parasitic females , and also with second - line cells , the monocyte - derived dcs . of interest , trx has been reported to possess immunological activities . thus , it has been attributed to an anti - inflammatory role besides suppression of apoptosis and fostering cell growth [ 32 , 8183 ] . trx can interact with immune cells and facilitates the production of tnf- [ 31 , 84 ] by monocytic lineage , but it is also able to counteract the production of inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- [ 85 , 86 ] . in the present study , 3d - coculturing of the intestinal epithelial caco-2 cells and thp-1-derived dcs was performed . hereby , parasite trx - lps induced the release of proinflammatory tnf- in the first day of the culture and at high concentration after 48  h followed by a prevailing generation of the th2-related cytokine il-22 besides lower levels of tslp and il-10 . il-22 may be predominantly released by activated dcs in the cell cultures after 2 - 3 days [ 78 , 80 , 87 ] . il-22 , particularly produced by immune cells present beneath the epithelium , as the innate lymphoid cells [ 78 , 80 , 88 ] , acts through signal transducer and activator of transcription ( stat-3 ) and is important in maintaining the homeostasis of the gut and therefore serves the protection from intestinal inflammation . an important source of il-22 in acute colitis is tlr - stimulated cd11c dcs which are located in the surficial mucosal epithelium of the gut and are getting activated by invading pathogens like bacteria or parasites . these cells initiate , via il-22 and thus stat-3 , processes that are important for a proper stress response , mucosal wound healing , and apoptosis pathway [ 78 , 79 , 89 ] . il-22 may profoundly increase the proliferation and turnover of iecs and the production of mucus and antimicrobial peptides . accordingly , the release of proteins from intestinal nematodes like trx - lps may contribute to preserve or restore the integrity of the intestinal barrier . thus , there are three possible pathways for helminthic trx - lps to act : firstly , secreted trx / trx - lp protects the parasite against high ros production initiated by the host 's first - line immune response via cells of the monocyte - macrophage linage . trx may be important for redox control at wound margins , since much ros emergence was proven there [ 91 , 92 ] . therefore , among others , it serves the migration of cells and closure of wounds . then , antioxidant molecules are probably important to maintain the balance in order to prevent stress - induced cell death . secondly , secreted trx - lp stimulates mucosal dcs to generate high levels of il-22 which promotes epithelial cell proliferation and the preservation or restitution of the integrity of the intestinal barrier . in the present study we had shown that 300  ng of parasite trx - lps promoted the wound healing process of epithelial caco-2 cells . a third possible function of trx - lp secreted by the parasite may be to mimic antioxidant molecules of the host and may lead to interference reactions in the host 's antioxidant metabolism concerning the substrates and binding molecules . thus , recent reports indicated that distinct molecules secreted by helminth parasites can foster wound healing   and modulate the host 's immune response .", "in summary , we identified and characterized the secreted trx - lps from s. ratti and t. suis . both multifunctional proteins expressed antioxidative activity and the capability to interact with the host 's mucosal cells , indicated by chemotactic activity for monocytic cells , binding to host 's epithelial cells as well as to immune cells , by the release of cytokines . in particular , the promoting wound healing effect indicates the involvement of trx - lp in many pathways that are initiated in the local parasite - host interaction"], "summary": "the cellular redox state is important for the regulation of multiple functions and is essential for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and antioxidant defense . in the excretory / secretory ( e / s ) products of strongyloides ratti and trichuris suis sequences for thioredoxin ( trx ) and trx - like protein ( trx - lp ) were identified . to characterize the antioxidant trx - lp and its interaction with the parasite 's mucosal habitat , s. ratti and t. suis trx - lps were cloned and recombinantly expressed . the primary antioxidative activity was assured by reduction of insulin and igm . further analysis applying an in vitro mucosal 3d - cell culture model revealed that the secreted trx - lps were able to bind to monocytic and intestinal epithelial cells and induce the time - dependent release of cytokines such as tnf- , il-22 , and tslp . in addition , the redox proteins also possessed chemotactic activity for monocytic thp-1 cells and fostered epithelial wound healing activity . these results confirm that the parasite - secreted trx - lps are multifunctional proteins that can affect the host intestinal mucosa .", "ranking": [0, 4, 3, 2, 1]}

from the provincial health care plan ( which confirmed residency in british columbia ) , and socioeconomic status ( ses ) was based on average neighbourhood income ( obtained through postal codes and national census data ) , expressed as quintiles . diagnoses in these databases were coded using the international classification of diseases codes ( icd-9 or icd-10-ca ) , and prescription medications were coded using drug identification numbers and the anatomical therapeutic chemical ( atc ) classification system . ms in parents was identified using a validated algorithm , as those with 3 records related to ms in hospital admission or physician visit claims between 1 april 1985 and 31 december 2011 or in prescription claims after 1 april 1996 ( supplementary appendix table 1 ) . parents with ms were linked to their offspring using the birth registry and the registration file databases . all persons with ms who had a child born in british columbia between 1 january 1994 and 31 december 2006 were included in the study cohort . the ms cohort was restricted to individuals whose ms onset occurred before their child s birth , based on the first date for ms or a demyelinating condition identified in any of the hospital , physician or prescription claims ( supplementary appendix table 1 ) . a matched reference cohort of up to four children with parents who were not known to have ms or a demyelinating condition was selected from the population of british columbia . children in the matched reference cohort were matched on the year of birth and school district . the parent with ms was also matched by sex to a parent in the reference cohort . in instances where exact matching for parental sex could not be carried out ( i.e. in 4% of cases ) , the available parent in the database was selected . all children in the study were followed up for a minimum of 4  years and up to 18  years between 1994 and 2011 . peripartum depression was defined to include mood or anxiety disorders since these conditions have a shared psychopathology , are highly comorbid and are often difficult to distinguish in primary care . parents in the study were classified as having peripartum depression if they had one or more records related to mood disorders or anxiety in hospital , physician or prescription drug claims in the last 4  weeks before delivery and up to 12  months after the child s birth ( supplementary appendix table 1 ) . subsequent parental depression or anxiety ( in the period following the peripartum period ) was identified based on one or more records related to mood disorders or anxiety in hospital , physician or prescription drug claims after the peripartum period . history of depression was defined as the presence of depression or anxiety in the 2  years prior to the peripartum period . psychiatric disorders in children were defined based on one or more records for internalizing ( mood or anxiety ) psychiatric disorders or externalizing ( attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ) or conduct ) psychiatric disorders in physician or hospital claims ( supplementary appendix table 1 ) . the date associated with the first record of such a psychiatric disorder was considered the date of onset for the condition . diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder in children was restricted to the period after the child s fourth birthday since the accurate diagnosis of depressive and anxiety disorders in very young children is often difficult due to issues related to cognitive and emotional immaturity , and the asymptomatic expression of depression in children . although recent studies have used a similar approach to identifying mental health disorders , we also identified mental health disorders in children and parents using a previously validated algorithm . the latter diagnoses were used in a sensitivity analysis to assess whether results comparing children of parents with and without ms were affected by potential changes in diagnostic accuracy . the date of cohort entry ( index date ) for all children was defined as the month of the child s fourth birthday . children were followed up from the index date until the first diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder , emigration from british columbia or the study end date , which was 31 december 2011 . the child s characteristics examined included sex , the child s first language at home ( english vs other ) , presence of an older sibling ( yes vs no ) and ses at index date ( expressed as quintiles ) . the parental characteristics studied included parental sex , parental age ( continuous ) and marital status at the time of the child s birth . conditional logistic regression was used to compare the characteristics of the parent  child dyads in the ms and matched reference cohorts . the frequency of peripartum depression among parents with and without ms was estimated using cumulative rates and 95% confidence intervals ( cis ) . multivariable log - linear regression models with robust variance estimators were used to determine the association between parental ms and peripartum depression , after adjusting for potential confounders including parental marital status , parental subsequent depression or anxiety , age at the time of the child s birth , parental sex and ses . the incidence ( density ) of psychiatric disorders in children among parents with and without ms was quantified by dividing the number of children with psychiatric disorders by the total follow - up time in child - years in each category . incidence patterns of psychiatric disorders in children were examined using kaplan  meier curves and cox proportional hazard regression accounting for matched factors . in the cox models , standard errors were adjusted for within - family clustering to account for the sequential births to the same parent in the cohort . confounders were included in the final model based on the literature or statistical significance ( p value  <  0.1 ) , and the proportionality assumption in the cox model was checked for each variable in the model . the full cox model included the child s sex ( female vs male ) , ses ( expressed as quintiles ) , peripartum depression ( present vs absent ) , parental subsequent depression or anxiety ( present vs absent ) and parental marital status ( not married vs married ) . modification of the effect of parental ms by other factors was examined using interaction terms , and stratified analyses were presented to illustrate potential effect modification . results were expressed as odds ratios ( ors ) and hazard ratios ( hrs ) with 95% cis . regression model fit was assessed using the likelihood ratio test , and a two - sided p value < 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance . analyses were performed using sas version 9.2 ( sas institute inc . , cary , nc ) .", "the study cohort included 360 children with an ms parent and 1207 parent  child dyads in the matched reference cohort ( figure 1 ) . the characteristics of children with a parent with ms and those with unaffected parents were similar in terms of sex , birth order and ses at cohort entry ( table 1 ) . parents affected by ms were on average older , more likely to be english speakers , have a higher frequency of subsequent depression and to be married at the time of the child s birth . the median age at onset of ms was 28  years and the median disease duration at the index date was 8.5  years . approximately 32% of the parents affected by ms had received disease - modifying medication by the index date ( table 2 ) . characteristics of parents with and without multiple sclerosis ( ms ) and their children , british columbia , canada . from conditional logistic regression that accounted for matching at the design stage . additional characteristics of the cohort of parents with multiple sclerosis ( ms ) , british columbia , canada . n=30 ( 26% ) were exposed to glatiramer acetate and n= 85 ( 74% ) to a beta - interferon . parents affected by ms had higher rates of peripartum depression compared with parents in the reference cohort ( 25.8% vs 18.5% , p value 0.004 ; table 1 ) . similarly , fathers who had ms had considerably higher rates of peripartum depression compared with unaffected fathers ( 25.7% vs 10.2% ; figure 2 ) . among individuals with peripartum depression , 52% of parents with ms and 48% of unaffected parents had a prior history of depression ( supplementary appendix table 2 ) . adjusted analyses showed that parental sex modified the effect of parental ms on peripartum depression ( p value for interaction term 0.008 ; table 3 ) . adjusted analyses stratified by parental sex showed that the rate of peripartum depression was 2.68 times higher ( 95% ci : 1.684.29 ) among fathers with ms as compared with fathers not affected by ms , while the rate of peripartum depression was 28% higher ( 95% ci : 0.991.65 ) among mothers with ms as compared with mothers without ms . peripartum depression ( % ) by parental multiple sclerosis ( ms ) status and parental sex , british columbia , canada . unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence

table and an interaction term ( parental ms * parental sex : unexponentiated beta 0.65 ; 95% ci : 0.131.18 ) . during the follow - up period , 226 children ( 14% ) were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder ( table 1 ) . among children with psychiatric disorders , mood or anxiety disorders were more common than adhd and conduct disorders . in the kaplan  meier analysis , 1309 ( 83.5% ) children were followed up until the end of the study period , 226 ( 14.4% ) until the diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder and 32 ( 2.1% ) until emigration from the province . the incidence of psychiatric disorders in children aged 417  years ( per 100 child - years ) was 3.3 among children of parents with ms and 2.7 among those with parents not affected by ms ( crude hr : 1.19 ; 95% ci : 0.931.54 ; table 4 ) . the incidence rate of psychiatric disorders in children was higher among boys , children whose parents had peripartum and subsequent depression and children whose parents were not married ( table 4 ) . cox regression that accounted for matching at the design stage ) the adjusted cox model showed that children with parental ms had a 34% higher rate of psychiatric disorders compared with children without parental ms ( adjusted hr : 1.34 ; 95% ci 1.031.74 ; table 5 , model 2 ) . the rate of psychiatric disorders was also higher among children whose parents had peripartum depression compared with children whose parents did not have peripartum depression ( adjusted hr : 1.87 ; 95% ci 1.32.55 ) . model 2 further showed that the relationship between parental ms and peripartum depression and child psychiatric disorders remained statistically significant even after controlling for subsequent parental depression or anxiety . peripartum depression did not modify the effect of parental ms on psychiatric disorders in children ( p value for interaction term 0.25 ) . sensitivity analyses based on mental health disorders identified using a previously validated algorithm yielded similar results . adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals from cox regression showing the association between parental multiple sclerosis ( ms ) and psychiatric disorders in children , british columbia , canada . model 1 : adjusted model with matching factors ( child s year of birth , school district and sex of the parent ) plus remaining variables listed in the table . model 2 : model 1 plus subsequent parental depression or anxiety after the peripartum period . sensitivity analyses carried out to ascertain whether the higher rate of peripartum depression among fathers with ms was secondary to their increased contact with the health care system showed that fathers with ms had an average of 11 physician visits during the peripartum period , while fathers without ms had 7 visits . the association between ms and peripartum depression among fathers was attenuated but remained significant even after adjusting for physician visits ( rate ratio : 1.96 ; 95% ci 1.143.40 ) .", "our study provides evidence that parents with ms had an increased risk of peripartum depression as compared with parents unaffected by ms . furthermore , children of parents with ms had a higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders compared with the children of parents without ms . similarly , children whose parents had peripartum depression had a higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders compared with children of parents without peripartum depression . higher rates of psychiatric disorders in children were also observed among boys , children whose parents had subsequent depression or anxiety and those who were not married . to the best of our knowledge , there have been no previous reports that have quantified the frequency of depression or anxiety in the peripartum period among parents with ms . studies in women with epilepsy show that approximately 25%29% of such women screen positive for depression . in our study , approximately 26% of mothers with ms were identified as having peripartum depression or anxiety , compared with a lower 21% rate in mothers without ms . depression is frequently missed among patients with ms and even when detected is often inadequately managed . maternal depression is particularly concerning because it is often a risk factor for a poor quality of life , paternal depression and adverse emotional , intellectual and cognitive development in children . peripartum depression in people with ms could also adversely impact an individual s adherence to treatment , and this can have important consequences on their disease course . in our study , fathers with ms had substantially higher rates of peripartum depression or anxiety ( 26% ) compared with fathers without ms ( 10% ) . the latter rate is consistent with studies which show that peripartum depression is not uncommon among fathers and has a 12-month postpartum prevalence of 4%10% . an elevated risk of depression in those with ms compared with those without ms has also been observed in other studies ; rates of depression among women with ms are 59% higher than among women without ms , while among men , rates of depression are 93% higher in those with ms compared with those without ms . the higher risk of peripartum depression in men with ms could be triggered by their new role as fathers , which may require them to confront their physical or cognitive impairments and ability to address their family s emotional and financial needs . furthermore , ms - related fatigue and physical disability and the unpredictable nature of ms symptoms can affect their ability to play an active role in caring for their young children and threaten their self - expectations of fatherhood . the association between parental ms and psychiatric disorders in children is consistent with previous work demonstrating that maternal ms is associated with a higher rate of mood or anxiety disorders in children ; this association appears to be mediated through maternal mental health morbidity . the limited research on this issue supports the notion that children of parents with ms are at greater risk of psychiatric outcomes including higher levels of depression and anxiety as compared with the children of healthy parents . our study shows that both peripartum depression and subsequent parental depression independently increase the risk of psychiatric disorders in children . other studies have also demonstrated that maternal postnatal psychological distress is a significant predictor of childhood anxiety even after controlling for distress in the prenatal and early childhood periods . studies examining the role of parental depression on child mental health suggest that the rates of psychiatric disorders among children of depressed parents are two to five times above normal and that the risk associated with maternal depressive symptoms may be comparable with that of paternal depressive symptoms . timely and appropriate interventions are key for such families ; intervention studies targeted towards treatment for parental depression have shown significant improvement in children s functioning and psychiatric symptoms within 1  year after initiation of treatment . the strengths of our study include use of a comprehensive population - based data source and the use of previously validated case definitions for ms . the robustness of our analyses was also confirmed by the supplementary analyses in which psychiatric disorders were identified using a previously validated algorithm . we also accounted for the clustered nature of the data arising from sequential births to the same parent during the study period . one limitation of our study was our inability to assess severity of peripartum depression which could have differed between mothers and fathers . furthermore , the time of onset of peripartum depression was defined as the date of the first record for a mood or anxiety disorder during the peripartum window , which may not necessarily represent the date of onset of symptoms . it is possible that more frequent contact with medical services in our ms cohort increased the opportunity to get diagnosed with a mental health disorder . however , adjustment for health services use did not abolish the association between paternal ms and peripartum depression . another limitation of our study arose because the study sample was restricted to children born between 1994 and 2006 , who had childhood developmental data . however , given that the assessment of childhood developmental outcomes has been routinely administered province - wide , the generalizability of our findings to the wider population of parents with ms was likely unaffected . finally , we did not have a family - specific variable to assess ses , but used neighbourhood - level income as a proxy for ses . our study demonstrated that parental ms , specifically paternal ms , is associated with a higher risk of peripartum depression . furthermore , parental ms and parental peripartum depression independently increase the risk of psychiatric disorders in children . given that depression and other psychiatric disorders are believed to be under - diagnosed and under - treated in persons with ms , parents with ms require special attention from health care professionals to ensure that their mental health and their children s mental health are optimized .", ""], "summary": "background : although many individuals with multiple sclerosis ( ms ) experience depression , there are no studies on the frequency

bound actin - rich tubular protrusions known as filopodia . formins are a family of large multi - domain proteins that nucleate and polymerize actin to form linear actin filaments like those found within filopodia . in this review formins function as dimers and nucleate actin by means of a formin homology 2 ( fh2 ) domain that binds globular actin monomers . interaction of the adjacent formin homology 1 ( fh1 ) domain with profilin effectively recruits actin monomers to the formin dimer , facilitating the polymerization process . a subset of formins , known as diaphanous - related formins ( drfs ) , bind to and drfs are rendered inactive by interaction of a c - terminal diaphanous autoregulatory domain ( dad ) with an n - terminal diaphanous inhibitory domain ( did ) ( fig .  1 ) . the binding of a rhogtpase to the n - terminal gtpase binding domain ( gbd ) contributes to disruption of this autoinhibitory interaction , which results in the activation of the drf . in the case of the drf fhod1 , phosphorylation of c - terminal serine and threonine residues by rock other domains found in drfs include a a dimerization domain ( dd ) and a coiled coil ( cc ) region , and some groups believe that the dd and did together constitute a loosely defined formin homology 3 ( fh3 ) domain . an n - terminal phospholipid - binding basic domain ( bd ) mdia1 has three stretches of basic amino acids in this domain , which allows it to localize to the plasma membrane , while mdia2 has two . in contrast , the drf daam1 has only one stretch of basic amino acids in its n - terminal , and the distribution of constitutively active daam1 is restricted to the cytoplasm . this might explain why only mdia1 and mdia2 have been implicated in the formation of membrane - bound cell surface protrusions like filopodia and lamellipodia , while mdia3lacking this bd  has only been reported to generate cytoplasmic actin structures . several rhogtpases and other proteins have been reported to bind to mdia1 - 3 . these are summarized in figure  1 . the shortest fragment(s ) known to bind the respective mdia isoforms is shown for each interacting protein . excluded from this diagram are ywk - ii , which binds a 223 aa fragment of hdia1 that shares 96% aa sequence identity with mdia1 ( 903 - 1125 aa ) , and inf2 , which binds to aa 1181 - 1262 and aa 1051 - 1193 of what might be longer splice variants of mdia1 and mdia3 respectively .", "mdia1 - 3 form several types of actin - based cellular structures . within the cytoplasm , mdia1 gives rise to stress fibers , and mdia2 drives the actin dynamics that power vesicle movement and creates the actin scaffold for constriction of the contractile ring during cytokinesis . at the plasma membrane , both mdia1 and mdia2 a role for formins in lamellipodial protrusion is not surprising  once thought to be structures comprised of dendritic networks of branched microfilaments , lamellipodia have recently been reported to contain linear actin filaments as well . we have found mdia3 to be capable of inducing filopodia in n1e115 neuroblastoma cells , despite not being able to detect the presence of endogenous mdia3 protein in this particular cell line . all three mdia isoforms have also been linked to invadopodia protrusion , while mdia2 alone plays a role in forming the filopodial precursors of dendritic spines . actin dynamics leading to the formation of the phagocytic cup in macrophages are believed to involve mdia1 and mdia2 too .", "previous studies have pointed to a role for mdia2 in mammalian filopodia . a decrease in filopodial protrusion was seen in mouse fibroblasts overexpressing constitutively active cdc42 and microinjected with anti - mdia2 antibodies , as well as cells cotransfected with activated cdc42 and a non - functional mdia2 mutant . in nih3t3 fibroblasts , constitutively active mdia2 , when overexpressed alone in b16f1 melanoma cells , also accumulated at filopodial tips . furthermore , knockdown of mdia2 protein in mouse hippocampal neurons reduced the formation of the filopodial precursors of dendritic spines . in more recent work , mdia1 - 3 have been shown to induce filopodia in neuronal cells when overexpressed on their own . however , only mdia1 was seen within filopodia , as observed by time lapse imaging of live cells . the lack of mdia2 and mdia3 in neuronal filopodia implies that these drfs might be involved in the initiation of filopodium formation but not the elongation of the structures . one possibility is that mdia2 and mdia3 generate short microfilaments that are subsequently elongated by mdia1 to form mature filopodia . this would tie in with the suggestion that mdia2 is a relatively strong nucleator but poor elongator of microfilaments , based on observations that it elongates microfilaments at a slower rate than mdia1 . the filopodia induced by full - length wildtype mdia2 appeared cylindrical and of even thickness along their length , and so did the filopodia formed by fh1fh2-mdia2 , a fragment of mdia2 that consists of only the fh1 and fh2 domains . this is unlike the club - shaped filopodia obtained by transfecting b16f1 cells with constitutively active mdia2 , where the structures are packed with shorter microfilaments at their distal ends but contain relatively few long microfilaments that extend toward the base of the protrusions . the high overexpression of constitutively active mdia2 could have resulted in endogenous mdia1 protein becoming a limiting factor on the process of filopodial microfilament elongation , giving rise to the club - shaped morphology of the filopodia . in addition , both full - length mdia2 and fh1fh2-mdia2 localized mostly to the cytoplasm  in these experiments it is likely that less of the protein was present in filopodia , and there was enough endogenous mdia1 to elongate the smaller number of short microfilaments generated , thus resulting in filopodia of even thickness along their shafts . these interpretations of the findings would further implicate mdia1 as the key mdia isoform that elongates microfilaments to form mature filopodia . it would be interesting to see if knocking out mdia1 affects mdia2-driven filopodial protrusion  will the resulting mdia2-induced filopodia be shorter in length ? mdia1 was seen throughout the shafts of filopodia when overexpressed alone or together with irsp53 or constitutively active rif in neuronal cells . this is in contrast to the  tip nucleation model of filopodium formation , where formins are expected to be found only at the tips of the protrusions . one possible explanation is that mdia1 dimers play a dual role in filopodium formation and are involved in not just polymerising the actin filaments but bundling them together as well . another possibility is that filopodia consist of short , discontinuous actin filaments that do not span the entire length of the filopodial shaft . this has been shown by cryo - electron tomography studies to be the nature of the actin filaments that constitute dictyostelium filopodia . superresolution microscopy studies would be able to reveal detail at the nanometre scale and help elucidate the specific locations of mdia1 and mdia2 , as well as other proteins associated with filopodial protrusion , within the structures with much greater accuracy . this would help in establishing a better understanding of the roles of these proteins in the various stages of filopodium formation .", "cdc42 works through irsp53 , which recruits to the plasma membrane the following proteins that modulate actin dynamics : n - wasp , mena , wave2 and eps8 . the rif pathway to filopodia does not require irsp53 , n - wasp , mena or wave2 . as for the mdia proteins , mdia1 appears to be the only isoform common to both pathways . in the filopodia of neuronal cells overexpressing irsp53 , mdia1 but not mdia2 was present , and was observed to interact with irsp53 within the structures . while both mdia1 and mdia2 were present in rif filopodia , only mdia1 interacted with the rhogtpase . in addition , knockdown of either of these two isoforms resulted in a decrease in rif - driven filopodium formation , while irsp53 filopodia were affected only by the silencing of mdia1 expression . taken together , it appears that mdia2 is not required for irsp53 to form filopodia , and we have found that coexpressing mdia2 with irsp53 leads to a loss of filopodia instead . it remains to be seen as to why cells need two or even moreyetundiscovered pathways to form filopodia , and why irsp53 requires only mdia1 when rif appears to require both mdia1 and mdia2 . also , rif has been shown to bind the gbd of mdia3 , however the significance of this interaction has yet to be investigated . mdia1 and possibly mdia2 are involved in stress fiber formation in addition to filopodial protrusion . these two types of actin - based cellular structures appear to be linked  in fish fibroblasts , microfilaments in filopodia can become incorporated into stress fibers , and it has been suggested that the reverse might occur in rat embryonic fibroblasts , with the actin freed up by the dissolution of stress fibers facilitating the protrusion of filopodia . rif interacts with both mdia1 and mdia2 and is able to trigger the formation of both filopodia and stress fibers . the dual role of these three proteins might point to a major role for them in controlling the balance between these two types of actin structures in cell migration .", "mdia2 appears to be specific for the rif - mediated pathway whereas mdia1 is required for the pathways controlled by cdc42 and rif . it remains to be seen how exactly rif utilizes two different formins , mdia1 and mdia2 , to form filopodia . how rif couples membrane deformation with actin dynamics to give rise to these structures has also yet to be resolved . apart from mdia1 and mdia2 , are there other proteins specific to the rif pathway to filopodium formation ? what potential roles do irsp53 family proteins ( irtks , mim , abba and pinkbar ) play in filopodial protrusion ? these are some of the important questions to address in future studies on mammalian filopodia ."], "summary": "mdia proteins are members of the formin family of actin nucleating proteins that polymerize linear actin filaments . such filaments form the core of thin , tubular , membrane - bound cell surface protrusions known as filopodia , which are a major feature of mammalian cell morphology . filopodia are dynamic structures that help cells sense environmental cues , and play a role in cell migration , axon guidance , angiogenesis and other processes . rhogtpases bind to and control the activity of mdia proteins , and several other binding partners of the three mdia1 isoforms mdia1 , mdia2 and mdia3have been documented . two independent pathways controlling mammalian filopodium formation have emerged , with one driven by the rhogtpase cdc42 , and the other by rif . while mdia2 has been the main formin implicated in forming filopodia , mdia1 has recently surfaced as the key formin utilized by both the cdc42 and rif pathways to drive filopodial protrusion .", "ranking": [0, 4, 1, 3, 2]}

conjugated antibodies against cd4 . mice were considered chimeric if they showed detectable donor cells within the myeloid lineage plus at least one lymphoid lineage . an epics xl - mcl flow cytometer ( beckman coulter , il alliance , vienna , austria ) was used for acquisition and expo32 adc software , applied cytometry systems , was used for analysis of flow cytometric data . four micrometer sections were cut from paraffin - embedded tissue fixed in 4.5% formalin ( ph of 7.5 ) , stained with hematoxylin - eosin and giemsa according to standard protocols , and analyzed by an experienced pathologist in blinded fashion according to the banff 2007 working classification of skin - containing composite tissue allograft pathology . a two - tailed student 's t - test was used for comparing percentages of v-positive populations and levels of chimerism within several cell lineages . skin graft survival was calculated according to the kaplan - meier product limit method and compared between groups by using the log - rank test . the fisher exact test was used to compare histologically categorized skin grafts   of different donor groups . a p value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant .", "three groups of mice were treated with a previously published nonmyeloablative bmt protocol [ 46 ] . bl6 recipients ( h2 ) received 2  10 bmc from different donor strains with mismatches of mhc with / without additional mhag mismatches after 3  gy tbi ( d  1 ) together with cb consisting of a single dose each of anti - cd154mab ( 1  mg mr1 , d0 ) and ctla4ig ( 0.5  mg , d2 ) . balb / c ( h2 ) , b10.d2 ( h2 , same background as bl6 ) , and b10.a ( h2 , same background as bl6 ) mice were used as donors ( figure 1(a ) ) to investigate the potential influence of mhag on top of the burden of mhc mismatch and the influence of the specific mhc haplotype on the induction of long - term multilineage chimerism ( h2 versus h2 ) . in bl6 recipients of balb / c bmc high levels of multilineage chimerism ( tested in cd4 , cd8 , b cells , and myeloid cells , figure 1(b ) ) were initially induced in 17 of 18 mice . at 16 weeks after bmt only 13 of 18 mice stayed chimeric ( pooled data of two independent experiments ) . this result is consistent with numerous previous experiments using this protocol showing that chimerism is lost in approximately 25% of recipients over time . in contrast , 21 of 21 bl6 mice receiving bmc of b10.d2 developed multilineage chimerism which remained stable in all but one animal over time ( p < 0.05 versus balb / c after week 16 after bmt , figure 1(c ) ) . interestingly the rate of chimeras also dropped in bl6 recipientsof b10.a bmc from initially 17 of 20 immediately after bmt to 13 of 20 at week 16 ( p < 0.05 versus b10.d2 , figure 1(c ) ) . these data indicate that mhag mismatches pose a barrier to establishing long lasting multilineage chimerism through bmt with cb . additionally the mhc haplotype ( h2 versus h2 ) also seems to influence bone marrow ( bm ) engraftment with this cb - based nonmyeloablative protocol . analyzing lineage - specific blood chimerism levels in successful long - term chimeras it was noted that b cell chimerism was significantly higher in recipients of b10.d2 bmc compared to recipients of balb / c bmc at each investigated time point ( e.g. , b10.d2 versus balb / c : 81.9%  7.2 versus 61.3%  9.4 at week 19 , figure 1(d ) , p < 0.01 , p < 0.05 ) , whereas cd8 and myeloid cell chimerism levels were comparable between these two groups . cd4 chimerism was significantly higher in recipients of balb / c bmc at week 19 after bmt ( b10.d2 versus balb / c : 36.08%  14.53 versus 58.75%  12.13 , figure 1(d ) , p < 0.01 ) . significantly lower chimerism levels were observed in myeloid lineages in b10.a bmc recipients compared to recipients of balb / c bmc from week 6 on . no consistent differences in t cell chimerism ( cd4- and cd8 cells ) and b cell chimerism levels were observed between long - term chimeras after bmt from b10.a or balb / c donors . nonetheless , cd4 and cd8 t cell chimerism levels were significantly higher ( b10.a versus balb / c : cd4 : 25.56  10.43 versus 13.51  4.82 and cd8 : 24.55  7.83 versus 15.48  8.86 ) in recipients of b10.a bmc 6 weeks after bmt but declined below that of balb / c bmc recipients by week 19 ( b10.a versus balb / c : cd4 : 37.71  25.44 versus 58.75  12.13 , p < 0.05 ) . the total level of donor chimerism among leukocytes was 62.41% versus 62.26% versus 53.41% in recipients of balb / c versus b10.d2 versus b10.a bone marrow , respectively ( at 19  weeks after bmt ) . these results suggest that both individual mhc haplotype and minor antigen disparities influence the degree of chimerism in distinct lineages . specific skin graft acceptance is considered as a stringent test to indicate transplantation tolerance . to investigate a possible influence of mhag mismatches on skin graft acceptance , donor and 3rd party tail skin was transplanted 2 - 3 months after bmt . among successfully established chimeras long - term donor skin graft survival ( > 130 days ) this rate is similar to our previous experience with this protocol [ 4 , 6 , 7 ] . in contrast , recipients of b10.d2 or b10.a bmc showed a significantly better long - term donor skin graft survival ( b10.d2 : 16/17 , b10.a : 12/12 , figure 2(a ) , p < 0.05 for balb / c versus b10.d2 and b10.a donors ; pooled data of two independent experiments ) . however , in recipients of balb / c bmc no significant difference in chimerism levels of long - term chimeras , which rejected donor skin grafts in comparison to tolerant animals was observed ( figure 2(b ) ) . regarding the macroscopic appearance of donor skin grafts of long - term chimeras , no shrinking , thickening , or loss of surface aspect was observed in mhag matched b10.d2 and b10.a donor grafts in contrast to balb / c grafts ( figure 2(b ) ) . histological analysis of those donor grafts that were retained until the end of follow - up revealed that balb / c donor grafts exhibited signs of chronic rejection , like sparse infiltration with lymphocytes and mast cells together with focally dense lymphocytic - mononuclear cell infiltration . in comparison no incidence of dense focal lymphocytic infiltration was seen , in b10.d2 donor grafts ( figure 2(c ) ) . skin grafts were scored by a blinded pathologist according to the banff 2007 working classification of skin - containing composite tissue allograft pathology . moderate ( grade 2 ; 2/3 ) and mild signs of inflammation ( grade 1 ; 1/3 ) were found in balb / c grafts , whereas no signs of inflammation ( grade 0 ) were seen in 4/4 b10.d2 grafts ( p < 0.05 versus balb / c donors ) and 2/4 b10.a grafts ( 2/4 grade 1 , p = n.s . versus balb / c , figure 2(d ) ) . taken together , these data suggest that mhag disparities increase the rate of chronic skin graft rejection in recipients with persistent levels of mixed chimerism . peripheral and central clonal deletion are important mechanisms for the induction and maintenance of tolerance in models of mixed chimerism induced by bmt plus cb . notably not all mice become chimeric with such a protocol and not all chimeric mice accept donor skin grafts indefinitely . we followed v11 + cd4 + t cells , which in this model recognize endogenous superantigens presented by donor mhc ii ( i - e ) but not recipient mhc class ii and thus serve as surrogate markers for donor - alloreactive t cells . like in previous experiments balb / c long - term chimeras displayed marked deletion of v11 + cd4 + t cells by week 4 after bmt ( 2.04%  0.80 [ n = 8 ] versus 5.20%  0.17 in nave bl6 mice [ n = 2 ] ) . compared to balb / c chimeras , a similar degree of deletion was observed in b10.d2 chimeras ( 1.99%  0.69 [ n = 11 ] , p = n.s . ) . interestingly , transplantation of b10.a ( h2 , mhag matched ) bone marrow led to a significantly more pronounced early deletion compared to balb / c and b10.d2 ( 0.67%  1.62 [ n = 9 ] , p < 0.05 versus balb / c and b10.d2 donors , both lineages ) . in contrast irrelevant v8.1/2 + cd4 + t cells were not deleted in either group after bmt , indicating the specificity of the deletion for superantigens presented by the donor ( figure 3(a ) ) . ten weeks after bmt the degree of deletion was significantly enhanced in long time chimeras after balb / c and b10.d2 bmt ( 0.93%  0.22 [ n = 8 ] and 1.26%  0.27 [ n = 11 ] , p < 0.01 versus week 4 for both lineages ) but still was significantly less pronounced than in recipients of b10.a bmc ( 0.23%  0.16 [ n = 9 ] , p < 0.01 versus balb / c and b10.d2 , both lineages ; figure 3(b ) ) . concluding , the type of mhc ( i.e. i - e versus i - e ) may influence the extent and kinetic of deletion of donor - reactive t cells .", "in this study we provide evidence that mhag disparities play a decisive role in the induction and maintenance of tolerance in recipients conditioned with nonmyeloablative bmt and cb , in which mhag both impede the engraftment of bm and promote the rejection of donor skin in successfully established mixed chimeras . tolerance induction through donor bmt depends on two , mechanistically separate , events : successful engraftment of donor bm and durable tolerization of all relevant donor antigens in the context of donor chimerism . the frequency of successful long - term chimeras was higher in the absence of mhag disparities when the mhc haplotype was the same ( 13/18 for balb / c versus 20/21 for b10.d2 ) . these results are in line with findings that mhc - matched bm is rejected in sublethally irradiated mice . only some of the minor antigens that drive alloreactivity in this strain combination ( balb / c to bl6 ) have been identified , with h60 provoking a particularly strong reaction . h60 is a ligand for the activating receptor nkg2d which is expressed on nk cells and on activated cd8 t cells , which are both effective mediators of allogeneic bm rejection . intriguingly , balb / c donor mice feature a higher surface expression of h60 than recipient bl6 mice . nkg2d has been reported to enhance nk cell mediated bm rejection in semiallogeneic pairs ( balb / c to f1 )   but seems to be dispensable in fully mismatched combinations ( balb / c to bl6 ) . alternatively , nkg2d can function as a costimulatory receptor to augment the response of nave cd8 t cells . this could provide an alternative costimulatory route for cd8 t cells when cd40 and cd28 pathways are blocked . the role of nkg2d in cd8 t cell mediated bm rejection has not yet been evaluated although it is well established that h60 triggers an abnormally high number of responding cd8 t cells . unexpectedly , significantly fewer mice developed long lasting multilineage chimerism after receiving bm from b10.a compared to b10.d2 donors ( both mhag matched to recipient ) . since the only difference between b10.a and b10.d2 is the h2 haplotype these results suggest that the mhc haplotype per se influences chimerism induction . distinct h2 haplotypes are known to stimulate varying numbers of alloreactive t cells and thus exhibit a varying degree of immunogenicity , which apparently also influences bm rejection versus engraftment . interestingly , if engraftment is successful , b10.a chimeras accepted donor skin grafts to a comparable extent as b10.d2 chimeras without macroscopical and histological signs of chronic inflammation . thus , distinct mhc haplotypes impede bm engraftment to varying degrees but do not affect the success of skin graft tolerance in established mixed chimeras . with regard to the second event , mhag disparities increased the rate of skin graft rejection in successfully established chimeras ( 10/13 for balb / c versus 28/29 for b10.d2 and b10.a ) . in addition , the surviving skin grafts of balb / c but not b10.d2 donors exhibited histological signs of chronic inflammation . thus , mhag disparities can drive chronic rejection in the presence of stable mixed chimerism . several groups attributed tissue specific antigens , which are not present in the bm but the skin , for this state of so - called  split tolerance  . obviously , for clinical translation this hurdle of mhag disparities with its associated risk of  split tolerance  recently , we could demonstrate that the combination of regulatory cell therapy with donor bm transplantation leads to a state of tolerance that encompasses donor mhag . critically , this regimen relies on extensive regulatory mechanisms , including linked suppression , that appear superior and indeed indispensable for tolerization of donor mhag ( pilat et al .", "this study reveals that mhag disparities have a negative impact on bm engraftment and tolerance maintenance in a nonmyeloablative , cb - based chimerism model . preclinical tolerance protocols should encompass mhag disparities to reflect the clinical setting and need to induce mechanisms capable of durable tolerization of donor mhag ."], "summary": "mixed chimerism and tolerance can be successfully induced in rodents through allogeneic bone marrow transplantation ( bmt ) with costimulation blockade ( cb ) , but varying success rates have been reported with distinct models and protocols . we therefore investigated the impact of minor antigen disparities on the induction of mixed chimerism and tolerance . c57bl/6 ( h2b ) mice received nonmyeloablative total body irradiation ( 3  gy ) , costimulation blockade ( anti - cd40l mab and ctla4ig ) , and 2  107 bone marrow cells ( bmc ) from either of three donor strains : balb / c ( h2d ) ( mhc plus multiple minor histocompatibility antigen ( mhag ) mismatched ) , b10.d2 ( h2d ) or b10.a ( h2a ) ( both mhc mismatched , but mhag matched ) . macrochimerism was followed over time by flow cytometry and tolerance was tested by skin grafting . 20 of 21 recipients of b10.d2 bmc but only 13 of 18 of balb / c bmc and 13 of 20 of b10.a bmc developed stable long - term multilineage chimerism ( p < 0.05 for each donor strain versus b10.d2 ) . significantly superior donor skin graft survival was observed in successfully established long - term chimeras after mhag matched bmt compared to mhag mismatched bmt ( p < 0.05 ) . both minor and major antigen disparities pose a substantial barrier for the induction of chimerism while the maintenance of tolerance after nonmyeloablative bmt and costimulation blockade is negatively influenced by minor antigen disparities .", "ranking": [0, 3, 2, 4, 1]}

Conclusion"], "document": ["methylmercury ( mehg ) is an environmental contaminant produced from natural or anthropogenic sources of mercury by methylation in widespread sulphate reducing bacteria . mehg enters the aquatic food chain and accumulates to become a threat for higher - order aquatic mammals and fish , but also to human health through consumption of contaminated fish . mehg has been shown to be detrimental for human health , with many studies emphasizing its neurological toxicity [ 4 , 5 ] . the molecular pathway by which mehg exerts its toxicity has been the issue for extensive research . although mehg seems to induce specific cytotoxic symptoms , one main route for mehg molecular toxicity has yet to be elucidated [ 6 , 7 ] . however , mehg has a strong affinity for thiol groups , making every cysteine - containing protein a potential target for mehg - binding and disruption , meaning that there may not exist one specific route of toxicity . in the search for a specific molecular mechanism of mehg - cytotoxicity , several mechanisms have been suggested for example , oxidative stress [ 9 , 10 ] , excito - toxicological effects , microtubule and cell - structural damage , genotoxic effects , and elevated intracellular ca leading to apoptosis [ 11 , 13 ] . the occurrence of mehg in seafood has led to a debate regarding health promoting nutrients through fish consumption , versus the risk for contaminant exposure [ 1416 ] . fish serve as an important source of nutrients , vitamins , and minerals and constitute an important part of a balanced diet . some of the beneficial nutrients in fish are the long chained marine n-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid ( epa , 20:5n-3 ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( dha , 22:6n-3 ) , which has shown to be important for optimal cognitive health and neuronal development . but in addition to its nutritional benefits , fish may also accumulate heavy metals and other environmental contaminants in edible parts , posing an exposure risk for higher - order mammals . many epidemiological studies have investigated the effects of chronic low - dose fetal exposure of mehg in different geographical locations . some of these studies report no adverse effects [ 18 , 19 ] , while other studies have reported adverse effects . .   suggest that dietary effects may be responsible for the discrepancies in mehg toxicity between different geographical localities . they argue that a study [ 18 , 19 ] , performed at the seychelles which showed no adverse effects , is based on a mainly fish consuming population , while another , performed at the pharoe island   which shows adverse effects , was based on populations consuming mainly whale meat . following this argumentation , a fish - based diet may contain certain ameliorating nutrients that will reduce the toxicity of mehg . recently there has been increasing focus on interactions between nutrients and toxicants and how nutrients and the nutrient composition of organisms may affect the toxicity of different environmental contaminants . reviews have pointed to the lack of research on nutrient - mehg interactions and suggest that an increased focus on nutrient - mehg interaction may increase understanding of mehg toxicological mechanisms . nutrients can affect mehg toxicity and retention in fish , as shown by bjerregaard et al .   who demonstrated that dietary selenite decreased mehg retention in rainbow trout ( oncorhynchus mykiss ) . marine n-3 fatty acids , in particular dha , have also been shown to modulate mehg - toxicity in rats , and to possibly modulate mehg neurotoxicity , as demonstrated by in vitro studies . the aim of this study was to elucidate possible intervening effects of n-3 marine pufa ( dha and epa ) compared to the n-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid ( ara , 20:4n-6 ) on mehg cytotoxicity in atlantic salmon kidney ( ask ) cells . human embryonic kidney ( hek293 ) cells were included in certain aspects of the study , and mehg - induced toxicity was compared between the two cell types by assessing effects on cell proliferation and death using the xcelligence system . interaction effects caused by fatty acids on mehg toxicity were screened by investigating known mechanistic effects of mehg , such as uptake of mehg in both cell lines , apoptosis in ask cells , and oxidation of rogfp in hek293 cells . additionally , we investigated the regulation of transcriptional markers for mehg toxicity and fatty acids metabolism and how dha , epa , and mehg affected these in ask cells .", "the cells were grown in leibowitz l15 media with 20% fbs and 1  penicillin / streptavidin / amphotericin ( all from sigma , st . hek293 cells were a gift from marc niere ( university of bergen , norway ) . louis , mo , usa ) supplemented with 10% fbs , 1  l - glutamine , and 1  penicillin / streptavidin / amphotericin at 37c with 5% co2 . fatty acids were coupled to fatty - acid - free bsa ( faf - bsa ) ( paa , pasching , austria ) as described by . briefly , the fatty acids were weighed and 0.04  ml chloroform per mg fa was added . furthermore , potassium hydroxide ( koh ) was added in a 1  :  3 relationship and the vial shaken in a whirl mixer for ten minutes . faf - bsa was added in a 2.5  :  1 ratio to fa . the solution was then shaken 45 minutes , sterile - filtered , and stored anoxic at 80c until use . ask cells were seeded in concentrations of 24  000 cells per cm . after 24 hours the cells were preincubated with 300  m dha , 300  m epa , or 300  m ara , all purchased from sigma , st . louis , mo , usa . the controls were preincubated with equivalent amounts of bsa as would be found together with fatty acids at concentrations of 300  m . the cells were preincubated with fatty acids or bsa for 72 hours , and the media were removed before mehg , diluted in media , or control , just fresh media , was added . hek293 cells were seeded , and similar to ask they were preincubated with the same fatty acids ; however , the incubation time was reduced to 24 hours due to a more rapid cell growth of hek293 compared to ask . mehg , or control , was added and endpoint measurements were performed within a time frame of 48 hours . 48 hours after mehg addition , the cells were scraped off using a rubber policeman and washed 3 times in 1  pbs . the cells were further divided into two aliquots , where one was added to a dma 80 mercury analyzer . the other half of the cells were lyzed , and total protein was measured using the bca protein assay ( thermo scientific pierce , rockford , il , usa ) on a labsystems iems reader ( thermo fisher scientific inc . , 24 hours after mehg addition , cells were harvested and analyzed as described previously for ask cells . in order to investigate the effect of mehg on cell viability and proliferation , we implemented the xcelligence rtca sp impedance assay from roche diagnostics ( mannerheim , germany ) where cell adherence is measured in real time . the base of the xcelligence technology is the disposable e - plates , which are similar to normal 96-well microtiter plates . these plates are connected to an rtca analyzer and computer with rtca - associated software . the e - plates contain gold - plated sensor electrodes in the bottom of each well , which enables impedance readings from a small current emitted into the system . the distance from one electrode to the next in the xcelligence system is possibly obstructed by cell media and cells adhering to the electrodes . cells will act as insulators at the electrodes and will alter impedance measurement based on cell density and cell adherence . hence , this impedance measurement will correspond to cell growth , cell toxicity , and adherence qualities ( morphology ) of the cells . a broader introduction of the xcelligence system and software has previously been presented in [ 27 , 28 ] . ask cells were seeded at a concentration of 24  000 cells per cm in a 96-well e - plate . fresh media containing bsa were added 24 hours after seeding , at a concentration of 150  m ( equivalent to the amount incorporated in fa ) . the cells were incubated another 72 hours , before they were washed twice in fresh media and mehg was added in concentrations from 1 to 4  m mehg dispersed in fresh media . impedance measurement was recorded every 30 minutes throughout the analysis and up to 48 hours after addition of mehg . hek293 cells were seeded at a concentration of 15  000 cells per cm in a 96-well e - plate . the cells were incubated for another 24 hours , before they were washed twice in media , and mehg dispersed in media was added in concentrations of 17  m . impedance measurement was recorded every 30 minutes , with the exception of the first hour after any modification to the cells , where it was measured every 15 minutes . impedance measurements were performed throughout the analysis and up to 48 hours after addition of mehg . after addition of mehg to both ask and hek293 , the xcelligence plot showed a pronounced increase in cell adherence . since this also occurred in the control , it was deemed likely that this specific effect was due to the washing of the cells with the resulting loss of cell adherence and increase in floating cells . when these cells adhered during the next couple of hours , a pseudoincrease in growth curve would be expected . moreover , the renewal of the media with fresh nutrient was also likely to impose a sudden increase in growth of the cells . in order to focus on the more long - term effects of mehg , it was chosen to normalize cells when the growth curve stabilized . in order to standardize this normalization , growth curve of control cells in both ask and hek cells was smoothed using the prism 5.04 ( graphpad software inc . , san diego , ca , usa ) , to get more continuous curves . after smoothing , the first derivate of the curve was calculated in order to investigate the slope of the curve . at the time point where the first - derivative first approached zero ( where cell growth stabilized ) , the curve was normalized in all treatments for the respective cell type . ask cells were seeded at a concentration of 24  000 cells per cm in 24-well culture plates and further treated as described in basic experimental design . after 48-hour exposure to mehg , the cells were fixed with 4% para formaldehyde ( chemi teknik , oslo , norway ) and stained with 4  g ml bisbenzimide h 33342 ( sigma , st . the fluorescent imaging was performed at the molecular imaging center ( fuge , norwegian research council ) , university of bergen .   ask cells were preincubated with the different fa and exposed to mehg in 6-well plates at a cell density of 24  000  cells / cm , as previously described . after exposure to mehg for 48 hours , the cells were harvested using a rubber policeman . cells were lysed , and total rna was extracted using rneasy columns ( qiagen , oslo , norway ) . the quantity and quality of the rna were assessed with the nanodrop nd-1000  uv - vis spectrophotometer ( nanodrop technologies , wilmington , de , usa ) . the concentration of rna in one well of a 6-well plate containing 24  000 cells per cm was approximately 50  ng l . the expression of 11 target genes and two reference genes in ask cells after fa and mehg exposure ( table 1 ) , was analyzed using a two - step real - time rt - pcr protocol . the rt reactions were run in triplicates in a 96-well plate , with 250  ng rna in each sample . for pcr efficiency calculations a 6-fold serial dilution ( 1000 - 31  ng ) in triplicates template controls ( ntc ) and rt enzyme control ( nac ) were included in each 96-well plate . the rt reaction was performed according to manufacturer 's instructions using taqman reverse transcription reagents ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) on a geneamp pcr 9700 machine ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) . reverse transcription was performed at 48c for 60  min by using oligo dt primers ( 2.5  m ) for all genes in 30  l total volume . the final concentration of the other chemicals in each rt reaction was mgcl2 ( 5.5  mm ) , dntp ( 500  mm of each ) , 10x taqman rt buffer ( 1x ) , rnase inhibitor ( 0.4  u/l ) , and multiscribe reverse transcriptase ( 1.67  u/l ) ( applied biosystems ) . diluted cdna ( 1  :  2 ) ( 2.0  l cdna from each rt reaction ) was transferred to a new 96-well reaction plate and the qpcr run in 10  l reactions on the lightcycler 480 real - time pcr system ( roche applied sciences , basel , switzerland ) . real - time pcr was performed by using sybr green master mix ( lightcycler 480 sybr green master mix kit , roche applied sciences , ) , which contains faststart dna polymerase and gene - specific primers ( 500  nm ) . pcr was achieved with a 5  min activation and denaturizing step at 95c , followed by 45 cycles of a 15  s denaturing step at 95c , a 60  s annealing step and a 30  s synthesis step , at 72c . target gene mean - normalized expression ( mne ) was determined using a normalization factor calculated by the genorm software   based on two selected reference genes , ef1ab and arp . genorm determines the individual stability of a gene within a pool of genes and calculates the stability according to the similarity of their expression profile by pairwise comparison , using the geometric mean as a normalizing factor . the gene with the highest m , that is , the least stabile gene , is then excluded in a stepwise fashion until the most stabile genes are determined . here , a normalizing factor based on two examined reference genes was used to calculate the mne . in the fluorescent vector pegfp - n , already containing a c48s mutation , serine and glutamine at positions 147 and 204 have been replaced by two cysteines to create the rogfp2 c48s / s147c / q204c . the thiol group in these cysteines reacts to changes in the red - ox environment of the cell , altering the conformation of the rogfp - protein , and subsequently its conformation and fluorescent properties . the rogfp has two emission peaks ( figure 1(a ) ) , which vary in intensity according to red - ox status in the cell . by measuring the emission of the rogfp at these two different excitation wavelengths , a ratiometric value representing the red - ox status in the cell can be obtained . the plasmid pegfp - n1/rogfp was purchased from university of oregon . a stable cell line expressing rogfp ( figure 1(b ) ) was made by transfecting hek293 using fugene hd transfection reagent ( roche diagnostics , mannheim , germany ) according to manufacturer instructions , and then the cells were selected using 400  g ml geneticin ( g418 ) ( invitrogen , by land ) . after selection , the cells were grown in media containing 200  g ml geneticin . cells containing rogfp were excited at 400 and 488  nm , and emission at the two different excitation points was measured at 510  nm using a optima fluostar plate reader ( bmg labtech , offenburg , germany ) . a ratiometric value from the emission at the two excitation points was obtained by \n ( 1)emission  at  excitation  point  488  nm  emission  at  excitation  point  405  nm  = red / ox  ratio . \n when rogfp positive cells grow , the total signal will increase , and since the two peaks measured have different emission maxima , a general increase in signal leads to a small change in the ratio . in order to adjust for this every treated sample was normalized to control at each time point : \n ( 2 )  red  ox  ratioaverage  control  red  ox  ratio  = relative  red / ox  ratio . \n in order to reduce systematic errors in the assay , the relative red - ox ratios were also normalized to their relative red - ox ratio at the start of the experiment ( t0 ) : \n ( 3)relative  red  ox  ratiored  ox  ratio  at  t0=normalized  red  ox  ratio . \n to compare red - ox ratio of fatty acids and mehg to a known oxidative inducer , a titration curve using h2o2 was run and a standard curve was calculated using linear curve fitting ( figure 1(c ) ) of the log - transformed h2o2 concentration . oxidative effects of fatty acids and mehg were then calculated into corresponding concentrations of h2o2 , to visualize oxidative effect . all statistic analysis was performed using statistica 9 ( statsoft inc . , tulsa , usa ) and graphpad prism 5.04 ( graphpad software inc . uptake data , apoptosis count , and red - ox measurement were processed using one - way anova followed by post hoc dunnett 's test . real - time rt - pcr data were processed using the nonparametric kruskal - willis with post hoc paired comparisons .", "cells were preincubated with the marine fatty acids : dha or epa , the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid ara , or bsa as control , before addition of mehg . ask cells preincubated with dha , epa , or ara showed no difference in uptake of mehg compared to mehg - control ( figure 2(a ) ) . in hek293 cells , however , dha significantly decreased the uptake of mehg ( figure 2(b ) ) . cell toxicity of mehg in both ask and hek293 cells was investigated using xcelligence impedance measurement . both cell lines showed a clear dose - response curve after titration versus mehg ( figure 3 ) . in hek293 , impedance measurements were stabilized at a concentration of 5  m  mehg , where no further decrease was measured . therefore , concentrations above 5  m were considered as too high to be statistically relevant , and only data from 05  m  mehg were used in regression analysis of dose response . impedance measurement of ask cells also seemed to reach a plateau as the mehg concentration increased similar to hek293 , but more noticeable was the early onset of toxicity from control to 1  m  mehg ( figure 3 ) . area under curve ( auc ) was calculated in ask cells from time point 102  h144  h after seeding , as a measurement of cell toxicity , and used in regression analysis . this dose - response curve of ask auc followed a nonlinear regression curve with r = 0.9824 ( figure 3(c ) ) . auc was also calculated from hek cells from time point 5396  h. the dose - response curve of hek auc followed a linear curve fitting with r = 0.9491 ( figure 3(d ) ) . apoptosis was measured using morphological analysis of ask cells after fatty acid preincubation and mehg exposure . a dose - response curve of mehg was investigated by preincubating cells with bsa , instead of fatty acids , followed by a titration to different mehg concentrations . apoptosis count was plotted , and curve fitting was performed ( figure 4(a ) ) . the dose response followed a nonlinear regression curve ( r = 0.9564 ) . from the dose response curve we chose a concentration of 2.5  m  mehg to test the effect of fatty acid preincubation on mehg - induced apoptosis , since this particular concentration of mehg induced a level of apoptosis which can be remedied by molecular intervention . cells preincubated with different fatty acids were compared to control cells preincubated with bsa and exposed to mehg using one - way anova and post hoc dunnett 's test . preincubating dha significantly ( p = 0.000014 ) increased while epa significantly ( p = 0.043948 ) decreased apoptosis induced by 2.5  m  mehg . total rna from ask cells , preincubated with the different fatty acids and exposed to mehg , was extracted and the gene expression of selected markers was investigated . when comparing all groups exposed to mehg versus control ( mehg main effect ) , the b - cell lymphoma 2 ( bcl2 ) like protein ( bclx ) , heat shock protein 70 ( hsp70 ) , and cyclooxygenase 2 ( cox2 ) were all upregulated by mehg ( figures 5 and 6 ) . fatty acid transport protein ( fatp ) , carnitine - palmitoyl transferase ( cpt1 ) , and tubulin  ( tuba ) were downregulated by mehg ( figures 5 and 6 ) . when comparing the different fatty acids ( fatty acid main effect ) versus control , no effects were observed . when comparing all groups , hsp70 was significantly upregulated in ara- and mehg - treated cells compared to control . fatp was significantly downregulated in cells preincubated with dha compared to the control , while tuba was significantly downregulated in cells preincubated with epa and exposed to mehg compared to the control . no significant effects of the treatments were observed in glutathione peroxidase 2 ( gpx2 ) or glutathione - s - transferase ( gst ) ( figures 5 and 6 ) . hek293 cells were stably transfected with rogfp plasmid and showed a clear fluorescence after g418-selection ( figure 1(b ) ) . these cells were used to investigate effects of fatty acids and mehg on oxidative status in cells . oxidative stress caused by fatty acids and mehg treatment was compared to equivalent signals generated by the known oxidative inducer h2o2 ( table 2 ) . incubating hek293 cells with epa and ara did not induce any change in oxidative status however , both dha and mehg significantly induced an oxidative state in the cells after 5 minutes of incubation ( figure 7(a ) ) . dha steadily kept cells in a state of oxidative stress during its preincubation , but after addition of fresh media a normal oxidative status was recovered ( figure 7(b ) ) . mehg also rapidly induced oxidation in the cells , but cells recovered their original oxidative status within approximately 1 hour ( figure 7(c ) ) . preincubating cells with fatty acids did not affect the change in the oxidative status caused by later mehg exposure ( figure 7(a ) ) .", "in this study , the mediating effects of the marine n-3 fatty acids dha and epa on mehg toxicity were studied . epa ameliorated the apoptotic response of ask to mehg , while dha reduced the uptake of mehg into hek293 cells . these results indicate that the metabolism of marine n-3 fatty acids may ameliorate mehg toxicity at the molecular level and that the nutrient content of a diet may affect the potential negative effect of mehg - contaminated fish . however , dha also augmented the mehg - induced apoptosis in ask cells , indicating potential potentiating effects of dha on mehg toxicity . the metabolism of nutrients into applicable energy for the cell is a vital part in maintaining cell survival . in different exploratory studies performed on fish exposed to mehg , changes in metabolic genes or proteins have been reported [ 8 , 31 ] . in our study we found a significant decrease in cpt1 and fatp gene expression as a result of mehg exposure . cpt1 is responsible for a rate limiting step in mitochondrial -oxidation of fatty acids : the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria for catabolism . the regulation of fatp is thought to be governed through peroxisome proliferator receptors ( ppars ) , hence being dependent on induction of ppar through ligand - binding . fatp is also , in part , responsible for the import of fatty acids into mitochondria by interacting with cpt1 . when transcription of both cpt1 and fatp is decreased in our cell system , this may signify a decrease in the availability of fatty acids as substrate for energy metabolism in the mitochondria and a subsequent reduced metabolic throughput . this could be a direct effect of mehg on the proteins themselves or their regulatory mechanisms , or alternatively it could be that the transcriptional expression of these genes is downregulated as a secondary response to metabolic shutdown after mehg - induced apoptosis is initiated . studies have shown that mehg can disrupt the mitochondrial energy metabolism more directly , possibly through inhibiting phosphorylation of adp to atp , or depolarizing the mitochondria . the detrimental effect of mehg on mitochondrial metabolism in the cell may also increase leakage of reactive oxygen species from mitochondria and thereby increasing ros . an important metabolic pathway for 20 carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids ( epa and ara ) is the eicosanoid pathway , where activation of cytosolic phospholipase a2 ( cpla2 ) catalyzes the breakdown of membrane phospholipids and releases ara for subsequent metabolite formation . an important enzyme in this pathway is cyclooxygenase 2 ( cox2 ) , which we showed to be upregulated in response to mehg exposure . this may be a secondary response to mehg - induced oxidative stress since cox2 expression has been shown to increase in response to oxidative stress [ 40 , 41 ] . cox2 is responsible for the conversion of ara into prostanoids , such as the prostaglandins . an increase in production of prostaglandins may increase the inflammatory response in the cell , meaning that mehg may induce proinflammatory metabolites of ara . metabolites derived from ara such as the prostaglandin e2 have also shown to increase intracellular ca in osteoblast - like cells . increase of intracellular ca is also a known toxic effect of mehg , meaning that increased cox 2 leading to increased production of prostaglandins may be part of the underlying cause of mehg - induced ca influx , with consequent increase in apoptosis . the enzymes in the eicosanoid pathway have the ability to utilize both ara and epa as substrate for production of different metabolites . however , ara- and epa - induced eicosanoids exhibit different molecular effects in the cell . in our study , epa ameliorated the apoptotic effect of mehg in the ask cells , while ara did not . if excess epa out competes ara in the eicosanoid pathway , the resulting metabolites show more anti - inflammatory effects than the respective ara metabolites . epa might even reduce the inflammatory effects of ara - metabolites created in the same system . the abandoning of aras proinflammatory and possible ca releasing effects could be part of the explanation why epa reduces mehg - induced apoptosis in ask cells . ara supplementation did not augment the toxicity of mehg , which one might expect if the proinflammatory ara - derived eicosanoids are damaging to the cell . however , the fbs added to the cell media in the mehg - control probably already contains relatively high ara - to - epa ratio , making the production of ara - derived metabolites saturated , and not dependent on cox2 or the availability of substrate . another side of the story is that by replacing ara with epa in the eicosanoid system , more epa - derived eicosanoids will be produced , which could reduce inflammation and affect mehg toxicity directly , or through apoptosis signaling pathways . the effect of epa - derived eicosanoids on mehg toxicity generally , and apoptosis specifically , is not yet known , and further investigations are necessary to elucidate this . oxidative effects of fatty acids with and without mehg were investigated using rogfp - hek293 cells , and as opposed to dha , epa and ara did not affect the oxidation of rogfp in the cells . these results are consistent with the lack of antioxidant protection against mehg of fish oil , shown in previous studies . there are , however , studies showing that epa can cause oxidative stress in muscle and liver cells of atlantic salmon [ 48 , 49 ] . however , since we did not see any indications of this , there could be other molecular mechanisms explaining the antioxidant effects noted elsewhere in the literature . epa , unlike dha , did not affect the uptake of mehg into hek293 cells , suggesting that there must be intracellular molecular mechanisms responsible for epa 's ameliorating effects on mehg - induced apoptosis . dha preincubation significantly decreased the uptake of mehg in hek293 cells , which is consistent with other studies using human cerebellar astrocytes and cerebellar neurons . no significant difference in uptake of mehg due to dha was observed in the ask cells . however , ask cells were grown at lower temperature and displayed much lower metabolic rate than hek293 cells . given that uptake of mehg is an active metabolic process linked to carrier mediated processes , the effect of dha on mehg uptake may be disguised in our experimental settings . unfortunately , this leaves our results in ask cells indicative instead of conclusive , and further research of uptake mechanisms affected by dha , in different cell types , is needed . the amended uptake of mehg observed in the hek293 cells may be due to altered membrane properties after dha preincubation . pufas are important constituents in cell membranes , where they affect several functions such as membrane organization , elasticity , microdomain formation , and permeability of the lipid bilayer . however , due to the difference in chain length and the number of double bonds , dha is thought to differ in flexibility and conformational freedom compared to epa and hence will cause different structure disorganization . by changing physical properties of cell membranes , dha may affect uptake of extracellular compounds , such as mehg , into cells . although dha decreased the uptake of mehg in the hek293 cells , we observed an increase in apoptosis of ask cells after dha preincubation and mehg exposure . this increase was profound , and real - time rt - pcr analysis of the apoptotic regulator bclx in ask cells suggested a similar effect , though not significant compared to cells only exposed to mehg . the apoptotic effect seems to be triggered by the addition of mehg , since dha treatment alone did not induce increase in apoptosis ( results not shown ) . a possible explanation for the severe apoptotic effect of dha together with mehg may be due to changes in the red - ox status in the cells . although some literature reports dha as an inhibitor of oxidative stress in certain cells , dha has also been reported to induce oxidative stress and production of ros [ 48 , 55 ] . mehg is known to be a pro - oxidant , so the observation can be explained by a potential effect of the compounds . another possible explanation could be that dha has inhibited the cells innate antioxidant defense system over time . when we investigated oxidation of rogfp in the hek293 cells , both mehg and dha were observed to oxidize rogfp . dha kept rogfp in a continuous oxidative state , whilst mehg affected the oxidation of rogfp moretemporarily . epa and ara did not oxidize rogfp in the cells , indicating that the pro - oxidative effect of these fatty acids , compared to dha , has been obliterated or kept under control in the cells . conversely , no significant effects of dha were noted on the transcriptional regulation of the two antioxidant enzymes gpx2 and gst in ask cells . however , this may be due to normalization of these levels after replenishing control cells with fresh media after the fatty acid preincubation .", "in this study we have shown that the marine n-3 fatty acid dha can decrease mehg uptake in hek293 cells as well as increase mehg - induced apoptosis in ask cells . furthermore , the proapoptotic effect of dha may depend on its ability to induce changes in the red - ox environment in the cell . to our knowledge , this is the first time that ameliorating effects of the marine fatty acid epa on mehg - induced apoptosis are reported . taken together , the effects shown by dha and epa on mehg - induced toxicity , in this study , may help explain the differing toxicity observed in response to type of dietary mehg source ."], "summary": "methylmercury ( mehg ) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant which bioaccumulates in marine biota . fish constitute an important part of a balanced human diet contributing with health beneficial nutrients but may also contain contaminants such as mehg . interactions between the marine n-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid ( 20:5n-3 , epa ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( 22:6n-3 , dha ) with mehg - induced toxicity were investigated . different toxic and metabolic responses were studied in atlantic salmon kidney ( ask ) cell line and the mammalian kidney - derived hek293 cell line . both cell lines were preincubated with dha or epa prior to mehg - exposure , and cell toxicity was assessed differently in the cell lines by mehg - uptake in cells ( ask and hek293 ) , proliferation ( hek293 and ask ) , apoptosis ( ask ) , oxidation of the red - ox probe rogfp ( hek293 ) , and regulation of selected toxicological and metabolic transcriptional markers ( ask ) . dha was observed to decrease the uptake of mehg in hek293 , but not in ask cells . dha also increased , while epa decreased , mehg - induced apoptosis in ask . mehg exposure induced changes in selected metabolic and known mehg biomarkers in ask cells . both dha and mehg , but not epa , oxidized rogfp in hek293 cells . in conclusion , marine n-3 fatty acids may ameliorate mehg toxicity , either by decreasing apoptosis ( epa ) or by reducing mehg uptake ( dha ) . however , dha can also augment mehg toxicity by increasing oxidative stress and apoptosis when combined with mehg .", "ranking": [3, 4, 0, 2, 1]}

term feeding with a high - fat diet can induce obesity with hyperlipidemia , insulin resistance , hyperphagia , and hypergluconemia [ 4 , 5 ] . nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( nafld ) is present in up to one - third of the general population and affects all ages and ethnic groups . nafld is the second leading cause of death in the general population [ 6 , 7 ] . at present , there is no pharmacological agent known to reverse nafld and effective medical interventions have focused on the modification of risk factors , such as weight reduction and diet . mistletoe is a hemiparasitic plant growing all over the world on various deciduous trees , such as oak . korean mistletoe ( km , viscum album cololatum ) extract ( kme ) has been shown to have anticancer , antioxidant , antidiabetes   and antidementia   effects , and it enhances immune system function . cellular power plants  because they generate most of the cellular supply of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) which is used as a source of chemical energy . studies have implicated mitochondria in several human diseases , including metabolic diseases , cardiac dysfunction , mental disorders , and the aging process . decreased mitochondrial respiration rates   and reduced expression of genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative capacity   have been reported in diet - induced obese rats . because kme improves mitochondrial function , we asked whether it has beneficial effects on obesity . it is well known that adipocyte differentiation and the extent of subsequent fat accumulation are closely related to the occurrence and advancement of various diseases , such as coronary artery disease and obesity [ 1 , 22 , 23 ] . 3t3-l1 cells have served as a useful in vitro model for adipocyte differentiation and function . the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes requires a variety of effectors that activate a cascade of transcription factors , such as ccaat / enhancer - binding protein- ( c / ebp- ) , peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor ( ppar- ) , and sterol regulatory element binding element protein-1c ( srebp-1c ) . this cascade begins with the ccaat enhancer -

buffered saline ( pbs ) for 24 hours . total rna was isolated from 3t3-l1 adipocytes using trizol reagent ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) . cells were homogenized by 4 - 5 passages through a 23-gauge needle . after a 5-minute reaction , samples were mixed with chloroform by vortex machine for 15 seconds . total rna was precipitated by mixing with isopropyl alcohol and centrifuging at 12,000  rpm . the resulting rna pellets were washed with 75% ethanol and dissolved in rnase - free water . total extracted rna ( 1  g ) mixed with annealing oligo dt primer and rnase - free water was incubated in a thermocycler for denaturing rna . reactant was mixed with 5x first strand buffer , 20  mm dtt , 10  mm dntp mix , rnase - free water , and superscript ii reverse transcriptase . the mixtures were incubated in a thermocycler ( 42c for 1 hour and 72c for 7 minutes ) to generate cdna . real - time rt - pcr analysis was performed with an ab 7500 real - time pcr system ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) . samples containing 2x sybr green pcr master mix ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) , 0.5 mol each of appropriate primers , and cdna were incubated in the ab 7500 real - time pcr system for an initial denaturation at 94c for 10 minutes , followed by 40 pcr cycles . each cycle -actin was used as an internal housekeeping control . to confirm amplification of specific transcripts , melting curve profiles were produced at the end of each pcr cycle by cooling the sample to 65c for 15 seconds and heating slowly to 95c , with continuous fluorescence measurement . data ( means  se ) were analyzed using graphpad prism ( version 5.04 , graphpad software , usa ) . unpaired two - tailed student 's t - tests were used to evaluate differences between means , as indicated .", "during the 15-week experiment , body weight and food intake were measured weekly . as shown in figure 1 , the kme - treated group had a slight decrease in body weight compared to the control group . however , this effect was significantly pronounced in animals that were fed an hf diet with kme . the difference between the kme - treated and control animals became significant at week 9 . at the end of the experiment , the body weight of mice fed kme was 20% lower ( p < 0.05 ) than that of the control group , whereas hf diet plus kme mice weighed almost the same as the mice that ate normal chow ( figure 1(a ) ) . these effects of kme on body weight were not due to decreased food intake , as the amount of kcal consumed per mouse over a 24-hour period remained unchanged ( figure 1(b ) ) . the data indicate that kme might have antiobesity effects in vivo , without affecting food intake . to test whether body weight loss was caused by decreased adiposity this analysis revealed that epididymal white adipose tissue was significantly reduced in the hf diet plus kme group ( figure 1(c ) ) . we performed a cold test to assess the effect of kme on adaptive thermogenesis capacity . kme - treated animals maintained higher body temperatures than nontreated animals ( figure 2(a ) ) , suggesting that it improved this capacity . to test whether thermogenesis is accompanied by changes in the expression of genes involved in thermogenesis , we examined mrna levels of ucp1 , the major contributor to heat production , by real - time rt - pcr .   figure 2(b ) shows that the mrna level of ucp1 was remarkably increased in kme - treated mice . because kme reduced body weight ( figure 1(a ) ) and increased thermogenesis ( figure 3 ) , we evaluated the effect of kme administration on a treadmill endurance test . the mice were trained to run at 16.2 meter / minutes for 10 minutes at a 5 incline the day before the running test , according to the procedure used for our previous report . the experiment was initiated at 10 meter / minutes at a 0 incline with a gradual increase in speed . the mice were run until exhaustion , which was defined as remaining on the shock grid for longer than 10 consecutive seconds . surprisingly , kme - treated mice ran twice as far as high - fat diet mice ( figure 3 ) .   one of the most common characteristics among people with obesity is the development of fatty liver [ 33 , 34 ] . histologic evaluation is regarded as the  gold standard  for assessing the presence and severity of nafld . we histologically evaluated liver sections to determine the extent to which kme attenuated hepatic steatosis development . as shown in figure 4 , the control group exhibited little histologic evidence of hepatic steatosis . however , a marked reduction in the degree of steatosis was seen in livers from high - fat diet mice treated with kme . furthermore , hepatic steatosis scores were dramatically lower in the high - fat diet mice fed kme ( grade 1 ) . to demonstrate the inhibitory mechanism of kme on adipocyte differentiation , we measured the expression levels of the transcription factors ppar- , c / ebp- , and srebp-1c in 3t3-l1 cells treated with 6  g/l of kme . our results show that ppar- , c / ebp- , and srebp-1c mrna levels were decreased by 64% , 60% , and 32% , respectively , ( figure 5(a ) ) . we also measured the mrna expression levels of adipogenic enzymes , such as fas , acs , and acc . we found that they were reduced by 69% , 55% , and 22% , respectively ( figure 5(b ) ) . lpl expression is not directly associated with lipid synthesis but is strongly associated with adipogenesis . therefore , we measured the expression level of lpl mrna and found that the level of expression in kme - treated 3t3-l1 cells was decreased by 89% compared to that of untreated cells ( figure 5(a ) ) .", "our results showed that body weight gain in groups fed a diet supplemented with kme was reduced compared to control hfd mice . this study also provides evidence that dietary supplementation of kme protects against hepatic steatosis development . we have considered the possibility that the effect of kme may be mediated by food intake because decreased food intake would be expected to significantly affect body weight , which influences hepatic steatosis . in this study , however , food intake did not differ between the groups . this suggests that kme directly protected against obesity and hepatic steatosis independent of food intake .   brown adipose tissues ( bats ) use stored triacylglycerols ( tg ) to maintain body temperature . these cells produce energy from fatty acid metabolism to generate heat through the action of uncoupling protein 1 ( ucp1 ) , a mitochondrial protein found only in brown adipose tissue . brown adipocytes contain less tg and more mitochondria than white adipocytes , resulting in their unique color . kme treatment increased ucp1 expression levels in bat , which poised the mitochondria for respiration uncoupling . this effect is consistent with the observed enhancement of cold tolerance and helps explain the increase in energy expenditure and resistance to weight gain .   this is most evident in muscle , a metabolically flexible tissue that switches between lipid and carbohydrate substrates to fulfill energy requirements . one study found that mitochondrial oxphos activity within the oxidative soleus muscle , which is resistant to fatigue and is dependent on mitochondrial activity for atp production , was more affected than in the glycolytic muscle tibialis anterior . the main changes included a reduction in respiratory chain activity with a concomitant decrease in mitochondrial atp production . in line with this finding and previously , kme significantly improved muscle oxidative capacity , resulting in enhancing the endurance . to further consolidate our hypothesis that kme inhibits obesity , we evaluated the effects of kme treatment in vitro using an adipocyte differentiation development system , which is regulated by transcriptional activators such as ppar- , c / ebp- , and some transcriptional regulators at the molecular level [ 39 , 40 ] . ppar- is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors and is dominantly expressed in adipose tissue . srebp1 is known to critically cross - activate a ligand binding domain of ppar- and activate the production of an endogenous ppar- ligand . adipogenesis can be induced through the action of some enzymes , such as fas , acc , and acyl - coa synthetase ( acs ) . the expressions of these genes are regulated by transcription factors , including ppar- , c / ebp- , and srebp1 , which are known to be crucial activators for adipogenesis and showed early changes in gene expression during adipocyte differentiation [ 44 , 45 ] . in this study , we showed that kme treatment significantly decreased srebp-1c , c / ebp- , and ppar- mrna expression in cultured 3t3-l1 adipocytes and inhibited expression of adipocyte - specific proteins ( fas , acc , acs , and lpl ) . collectively , these observations suggest that kme suppresses adipocyte differentiation by regulating the expression levels of adipogenic transcription factors . further investigation is necessary to define specific mechanisms by which kme protects against obesity - mediated hepatic steatosis . to elucidate the mechanism associated with the antiobesity effects of kme", "kme had marked inhibitory effects on the development of obesity and nafld in mice fed high - fat diets . activating endurance capacity and increasing thermogenesis are two possible mechanisms for the antiobesity effect of kme . this finding suggests that kme may be a potential dietary strategy for preventing obesity and nafld ."], "summary": "this study investigates the inhibitory effects of korean mistletoe extract ( kme ) on adipogenic factors in 3t3-l1 cells and obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( nafld ) in mice fed a high - fat diet . male c57bl/6 mice fed a high - fat diet were treated with kme ( 3  g / kg / day ) for 15 weeks for the antiobesity and nafld experiments . body weight and daily food intake were measured regularly during the experimental period . the epididymal pad was measured and liver histology was observed . the effects of kme on thermogenesis and endurance capacity were measured . the effects of kme on adipogenic factors were examined in 3t3-l1 cells . body and epididymal fat pad weights were reduced in kme - treated mice , and histological examination showed an amelioration of fatty liver in kme - treated mice , without an effect on food consumption . kme potently induces mitochondrial activity by activating thermogenesis and improving endurance capacity . kme also inhibited adipogenic factors in vitro . these results demonstrate the inhibitory effects of kme on obesity and nafld in mice fed a high - fat diet . the effects appear to be mediated through an enhanced mitochondrial activity . therefore , kme may be an effective therapeutic candidate for treating obesity and fatty liver caused by a high - fat diet .", "ranking": [0, 3, 4, 2, 1]}

holding or the presence of an underlying lung disease ( with reduced compliance ) . typical manifestations include cerebral symptoms ( weakness , numbness , confusion or unconsciousness , seizure , visual disturbances , headaches and vertigo ) when bubbles rupture into vessels , or respiratory symptoms ( pleuritic chest pain due to pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum ) when bubbles rupture into pleural spaces . however , other sites including muscles , mesenteric circulation , cardiovascular system and , as shown in the following case , the kidneys may also be involved .", "we report the first case of acute kidney injury caused by arterial air embolism injury in a 27-year - old caucasian recreational diver following three rapid ascents . he was spear fishing on surface supply hookah at a depth of 15 metres for around 15 min when strong currents took him up to the surface whilst he was holding his breath attempting to reload his speargun . he had another two attempts to rescue his gear from the seafloor , but he was taken up by the swell each time . during the third ascent he became confused and when reaching the surface , his vision became blurred and he was unable to move his limbs . on arrival at the local hospital he was normotensive and his neurological symptoms resolved within a few hours . due to initial pleuritic chest pain , a computer tomography was performed which showed normal lung parenchyma and no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum . nine hours after the incident , he developed diffuse abdominal pain with an initial lactate 10.8 mmol / l . further imaging to look for ischaemic gut was not performed as he responded well to initial therapy consisting of 100% oxygen , analgesia with paracetamol and fentanyl ( two doses , each 25 g intravenously ) and intravenous hydration and his lactate level returned to normal within a few hours . due to rapidly evolving acute kidney injury , he was transferred to a tertiary hospital for hyperbaric therapy on day 2 post - diving accident ( initial creatinine 120 mol / l , 987 mol / l on day 2 and peak at 1210 mol / l on day 4 ) . the diagnosis of ischaemic - induced acute tubular necrosis ( atn ) was supported by a high fractional urinary sodium excretion of 5.5% , elevated lactate dehydrogenase [ 486u / l ( 125250 ) ] , normal urine sediment and urinary tract ultrasound and a mag3 scan in keeping with atn ( figure  1 ) . the absence of myoglobinuria and only moderately elevated creatine kinase [ maximum 893u / l ( 30170 ) ] made rhabdomyoloysis - induced atn unlikely . he received supportive care with intravenous hydration , sodium bicarbonate combined with a total of seven sessions of hbo and recovered fully without needing dialysis ( figure  2 ) . \n 1.tc-99m-mag3 scan performed on day 4 post -

organ involvement including the kidneys as demonstrated in this case . upon rescue onto the support boat the patient was positioned supine whilst the boat was rocking in the waves , which may have contributed to embolization at multiple sites , including the central nervous system , the mesenteric circulation , as suggested by elevated lactate and abdominal pain and the kidneys . the diagnosis of decompression illness is made on clinical grounds since gas bubbles are rarely detectable on imaging . the most common symptoms of decompression sickness are localized pain , numbness / paresthesia and muscular weakness , typically presenting within the first 24 h , whereas symptoms of air embolism from pulmonary barotrauma occur immediately upon ascent [ 4 , 5 ] . although no diagnostic blood test exists for air embolism , widespread air embolization has been reported to result in elevated serum creatine kinase of up to 900 u / l , as was the case in our patient . the distinction between pulmonary barotrauma and decompression sickness is sometimes difficult and generally unnecessary as recompression is the treatment of choice for both . when hyperbaric therapy is not readily available , the best first aid treatment comprises administration of 100% oxygen and supportive care . however , early transfer to a hyperbaric treatment unit is important as symptoms may evolve over time as shown in our patient . hyperbaric oxygen ( hbo ) leads to quick elimination of gas bubbles by reducing bubble size via increased pressure ( boyle 's law ) , increasing the inert gas partial pressure gradients between tissue and alveolar gas ( increased nitrogen washout ) and also oxygenates ischaemic tissue and exerts an anti - inflammatory effect [ 1 , 7 , 8 ] . the addition of non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs such as tenoxicam may decrease the number of hbo sessions required as shown in a randomized trial , but their use does no longer make part of the routine treatment and was not an option for our patient in the setting of acute kidney injury . hbo results in complete resolution of symptoms in most cases , whereas mild residual symptoms may persist in a few and serious complications in a minority of cases . the primary goal , however , remains the prevention of pulmonary barotrauma , a potentially fatal complication of diving . divers should be screened during dive medical for conditions predisposing to barotrauma ( airway obstruction , bullae , reduced lung compliance ) and diving courses emphasize the importance of controlled ascent and avoiding breath -

{"id": "PMC4297883", "section_names": ["Introduction", "Methods", "Results", "Discussion", "Conclusions"], "document": ["patients with schizophrenia ( scz ) exhibit a wide variety of cognitive deficits , particularly with memory ( barch and ceaser , 2012 ; ranganath et al . , 2008 ) . these deficits are predictive of overall functional outcome and clinical remission ( bodnar et al . , 2008 ; green , 2006 ; green et al . , 2004 ; kahn and keefe , 2013 ) , and it has recently been suggested that schizophrenia should be viewed primarily as a cognitive disorder ( kahn and keefe , 2013 ) . understanding the nature of the memory deficits is therefore a critical goal when moving towards improved clinical interventions in scz . when considering episodic memory , one area in which patients with scz have a substantial deficit is with source monitoring ( identifying the context in which a stimulus was encountered ; johnson et al . , 1993 ) . for successful source monitoring it is necessary to bind elements of a memory together into a memory trace , along with their context ( spatial context , temporal context , etc . ) . patients demonstrate source monitoring deficits even when stimulus recognition is preserved ( danion et al . , 1999 ; this deficit in source monitoring is in many ways not surprising given that patients with scz also demonstrate difficulties with relational or associative memory ( binding items together during memory encoding , and later recalling which stimuli were presented together ) , while object memory is not as severely impaired ( achim et al . most typically , source monitoring problems in scz are considered in the context of attributing events from internal ( self ) to external sources . patients with predominant hallucinations and thought disorder have a greater tendency or bias to attribute internally generated events to an external source , while still being able to correctly identify externally generated stimuli ( brunelin et al . this bias for scz to misattribute internal sources has been observed in the absence of recognition memory deficits or false positive responses ( fisher et al . , 2008 ) . interestingly , in a repetitive magnetic stimulation trial of low frequency ( 1  hz , inhibitory ) stimulation to the left temporal parietal junction over 5 consecutive days not only improved auditory hallucinations but also resulted in an improvement in source monitoring compared to sham stimulation ( brunelin et al . , 2006 ) . the improvement in auditory hallucination was marginally correlated with the improvement in source monitoring , further suggesting the relationship between source monitoring and hallucinations . patients with schizophrenia have also been found to have a deficit in source memory ( remembering the context in which experimental stimuli occurred ; brebion et al . , 2002 ; the deficit in source memory has been related to deficits in binding contextual cues together into a holistic memory representation ( diaz - asper et al . , 2008 ; waters et al . , 2004 ) , which is an essential component of source memory . source memory errors are present in scz even for short - term recognition ( when source information is tested immediately , minimizing the need to recollect information stored in long - term memory ) , suggesting that source memory deficits in scz may be related to encoding errors rather than problems in recognition ( achim et al . , 2011 ) . ( 2009 ) performed a list learning task in scz and found that patients who hallucinate had more intrusions ( indicating a word was part of the memory set when it was not ) than non - hallucinating patients . this finding was related to source misattribution ( patients attributing an internally generated stimulus to an external source , the original memory set ) . overall , scz appears to have a noteworthy deficit in source memory which is likely intricately related to other memory and cognitive processes , such as contextual binding and episodic memory . within healthy controls , source memory involves a range of cortical regions known to be involved in episodic memory , including the medial temporal lobes , prefrontal cortex , and parietal cortex . increased hippocampal activity has been related to trials in which the source was correctly identified ( davachi et al . , 2003 ; ranganath et al . , 2004 ) , probably due to the role of the hippocampus in relational binding ( davachi , 2006 ) . one of the first fmri studies to examine source memory found greater left prefrontal activity for source memory and for old  new recognition ( nolde et al . , 1998 ) , with subsequent studies finding activity in the left lateral prefrontal cortex associated with source memory for a variety of stimuli types ( mitchell and johnson , 2009 ) . prefrontal lesions have been found to disrupt the self - initiation of processes which promote feature binding ( stuss and benson , 1986 ) , and left prefrontal damage is associated with deficits in source monitoring ( duarte et al . , 2005 ) . prefrontal activity during source recognition may be more involved in the evaluation of source information ( e.g.  does this stimuli fit with source x  ) rather than retrieving source information per se ( mitchell et al . , activity in medial parietal areas ( intraparietal sulcus and precuneus ) has been suggested to be present regardless of the type of source information being assessed ( uncapher et al . , 2006 ) , while activity in lateral parietal areas may be more dependent on how well the information has been encoded ( wheeler and buckner , 2004 ) and/or to attentional processes ( cabeza , 2008 ) . examining declines in source memory with age has proven fruitful for examining structural and functional correlates of source memory , with evidence that age - related decline in source memory is related to decreased activity mainly in the prefrontal and medial temporal lobes ( see mitchell and johnson , 2009 , for review ) . ( 2006 ) examined source monitoring in scz using a level - of - processing framework . patients were presented words with either deep ( semantic ) or shallow ( orthographic ) encoding instructions . during recognition , when participants successfully identified a previously encountered stimuli they were asked under which encoding condition the word was encountered ( the source memory aspect being recalling the context in which the word was encountered , in this case , which encoding condition ) . when contrasting correct vs. incorrect source , both patients and controls activated areas of prefrontal and parietal cortices . patients showed activity in the middle and superior temporal gyrus , thalamus , and parahippocampal gyrus , which was correlated with more severe positive and negative symptoms independent of memory performance . other neuroimaging studies of source monitoring in scz have focused on deficits related to attributing stimuli as self - generated or externally - generated ( reality monitoring ) . deficits in reality monitoring appear to involve the medial prefrontal cortex ( subramaniam et al . , 2012 ; vinogradov et al . , 2008 ; wang et al . , 2011 ) . following computerized training to improve source monitoring , activity was found to be increased in the medial prefrontal cortex ( subramaniam et al . , 2012 ) . the purpose of this study was to examine the neural correlates of source memory in schizophrenia . while most previous studies of source memory ( in both controls and schizophrenia ) have used less ecologically valid task ( e.g. identifying the color of the stimuli during encoding ) , we utilized a paradigm involving encounters ( with a person and an object in a specific place ) within a realistic 3d environment ( burgess et al . , 2001 ; king et al . , 2005 ) , which may better evaluate source memory networks used in everyday life . we examined participants with early schizophrenia ( within the first 4.5  years of treatment , with 75% of patients within the first 2  years ) thus minimizing potential confounds associated with prolonged illness such as cognitive decline , social isolation and long - term medication effects . during fmri scanning a source recognition memory task was employed , which was contrasted with an object memory task . by directly comparing source memory to object memory , we can identify regions in the cortex which are specific to source memory compared to object memory and determine if any deficits observed in schizophrenia are source - memory specific . we hypothesized that patients would show deficits in source memory relative to object memory and may show compensatory activation in source memory retrieval contrasts . furthermore , as deficits in source memory have been associated with auditory hallucinations ( woodward et al . , 2007 ) we expected to observe relationships between hallucinations and the neural activity of source memory retrieval .", "all participants with scz were treated at the douglas mental health university institute in montreal , canada , at the prevention and early intervention program for psychoses , a specialized service providing treatment to individuals aged 1435  years from a local catchment area . individuals with an iq  >  70 who had not taken antipsychotic medication for more than 1  month were consecutively admitted as in- or out - patients . patients were assessed with the scale for assessment of positive symptoms ( saps ) ( andreasen , 1984 ) and the scale for assessment of negative symptoms ( sans ) ( andreasen , 1983 ) at numerous time - points following clinic admission ( baseline ; at 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12  months ; and every 6  months thereafter ) .

five people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders were recruited , diagnosed according to the structured clinical interview for dsm - iv ( first et al . , 1997 ) and confirmed between two senior research psychiatrists ( a.m. and r.j . ) . twenty - four healthy controls were recruited through advertisements in local newspapers and were included only if they had no current or previous history of any axis i disorders , neurological diseases , or head trauma causing loss of consciousness , and no first - degree family members with schizophrenia or related schizophrenia - spectrum disorders . all patients provided written informed consent , and the study was approved by the research ethics boards of the douglas hospital research centre and the montreal neurological institute . participants performed an encoding task ( outside the mri ) using a modified version of the virtual city developed by burgess and colleagues ( burgess et al . , 2001 ; king et al . , 2005 ) , created using 3ds max ( 3ds max , 2011 ) and unity software ( unity , 2011 ) . participants navigated through a 3d virtual city , following a path indicated by green arrows to the site of an encounter ( an encoding trial , a character at a location ) . after approaching within five virtual meters of the character , the participant 's view was frozen and the character stepped aside , and a life - sized object appeared on a small table displayed to the right . participants were instructed to pay careful attention to the object , character and location , and try to remember for a later memory test . after a 5  s study delay the person and object disappeared , and participants then followed the arrows to the next encounter . there were a total of 20 encounters , each with a unique person , location and object . a total of 80 recognition trials were administered , in which participants were shown an image consisting of a typical viewpoint encountered within the virtual city ( in one of 20 places where encounters occurred ) , with a person in the center of the screen , and two objects , one on each side of the person . participants were then asked one of four possible recognition questions : ( 1 ) person ( which object was paired with this person ) , ( 2 ) place ( which object did you view in this location ) , ( 3 ) object ( which object was viewed in the city ; the other object was new ) , and ( 4 ) bright ( which object is brighter in appearance ) . participants responded on an mri - compatible button box to indicate which item ( left or right ) was selected . for the person condition , the place was not associated with either object , while in the place condition the person was not associated with either object . the person and place conditions were designed to access source memory ( in what context was an object encountered ) while the object condition assesses object memory ( old vs. new ) . including two source memory conditions allows us to better understand if the observed activity is modality specific . the bright condition was not considered in this analysis as we were specifically interested in source vs. object memory . images ( with encoding question ) were presented on the screen for 8000  ms , with a 20008000  ms isi ( in 100  ms increments ) , with an average trial length of 13  s. stimuli were presented and results were recorded through e - prime 1.0 software . 1 . a practice route was designed to allow participants to become familiar with the arrow key and mouse , and to practice following the arrows and encounter two characters with objects in independent locales . participants also practiced answering two of each of the four forced - choice recognition questions regarding the objects collected . echo - planar images were collected on a siemens 3  t tim trio mri ( tr  =  2000  ms , te  =  30  ms , flip angle  =  90 , 36 slices of 4  mm thick , 64    64  voxel plane with an fov of 256  mm 4  mm slices ) . each bold run was preceded by 4 volumes that were later discarded to allow a magnetic steady state . the anatomical scan was an mprage ( tr  =  2300  ms , te  =  2.98  ms , fov 256 , 1    1    1  mm  voxels , flip angle  =  9 ) and lasted 5.21  min . data analysis was conducted using spm 8 ( wellcome department of cognitive neurology , london , uk ) . data was motion corrected by realigning to the 3rd tr , normalized to the icbm template ( and resampled at 2    2    2  mm  voxel size ) and smoothed with an 8  mm isotropic gaussian kernel . the general linear model was implemented by convolving a standard hemodynamic response function and its first temporal derivative and dispersion . events were defined based upon recognition question ( person , place , object , or bright ) , with incorrect answers modeled as distinct event types and excluded from further analysis . accuracy data was not available for three controls and four scz patients due to technical problems during initial data collection . for these participants , contrasts were person vs. object and place vs. object ( both performed bidirectionally ) to identify voxels which are differentially activated by source or object memory . a second level analysis was performed separately for each group ( controls or scz ) using a one sample t - test . corrections for multiple comparisons were performed at the cluster level using an individual voxel threshold of p  <  0.001 ( uncorrected ) . a monte - carlo simulation of 1000 iterations ( slotnick et al . , 2003 ) resulted in a cluster extent threshold of 49 resampled voxels . to test for differences between groups , an independent - samples t - test was performed , using the contrast  value derived for each participant from the above contrasts . given that between - group differences often have smaller effect sizes , we used a slightly more liberal single - voxel threshold of p  <  0.005 , but corrected to p  <  0.01 at the cluster level ( resulting in an extent threshold of 97  voxels ) . a regression analysis in patients was performed to examine the relationship between source memory and clinical symptoms . as patients were stabilized and undergoing treatment at the time of scanning , few patients were actively experiencing positive symptoms as of the assessment closest to the date of scanning . as a result , the data did not possess sufficient variability for a regression analysis ( the majority of cases had global scores of 0 or 1 on the saps at closest assessment ) . furthermore , positive symptoms are often highly responsive to treatment ( malla et al . , 2006 ; robinson et al . , 1999 ) . as such any patient displaying continued positive symptoms may represent treatment resistant patients or those with a more severe illness , rather than relate to the symptoms themselves per se . instead , we utilized scores from the assessment at the initial visit to the clinic , prior to treatment onset . the presence of specific symptoms at initial clinical assessment was considered as a proxy of how prone to those symptoms each patient may be . we propose that the pre - treatment ratings best represent the underlying neurobiology and clinical characteristics of individual patients , as they show their symptom characteristics in an untreated state of illness . while it is not possible to make several such assessments prior to treatment onset ( which would best capture the potential symptom profile of each patient ) , such an approach may allow for a data exploration which separates patients who are prone to certain symptoms ( such as hallucinations ) from those who have experienced less or never experienced those symptoms while in an untreated state . as such , this can be conceptualized as a  trait based approach to symptom evaluation . saps scores for global hallucinations and global thought disorder were entered into a whole - brain regression model with the person  >  object and place  >  object contrasts . the global delusion score was not included as most patients were highly delusional at baseline . in order to account for differences in time since initial diagnosis , the interval between baseline assessment and mri scan ( in days ) was entered as a covariate in the second - level regression analysis . cluster threshold for the regression was 49  voxels at p  <  0.001 uncorrected ( voxel threshold ) .", "there were no significant differences in age or gender distribution between groups , though patients had a marginally significant lower parental ses and significantly fewer years of education . accuracy in the person , place and object conditions was assessed using independent samples t - test . schizophrenia patients had significantly lower accuracy in the person condition , t(40 )  =  2.247 , p  =  0.03 , but not for place , t(40 )  =  0.44 , p  =  0.66 , or object , t(40 )  =  0.07 , p  =  0.95 . numerous cortical regions showed significant increases in neural activity for retrieval of source memory over retrieval of object memory , similar to the pattern observed in previous studies using a similar paradigm ( burgess et al . , 2001 ; king et al . , 2005 ) . activated regions in the source memory contrasts ( person  >  object and place  >  object ) included bilateral activity around the parietal occipital sulcus ( including the precuneus and retrosplenial cortex ) extending into the superior parietal cortex , left inferior frontal gyrus ( vlpfc ) , fusiform gyrus bilaterally , and the occipital cortex . activity in the person  >  object contrast included the head of the caudate nucleus , the right inferior frontal ( vlpfc ) , and the medial aspect of the superior frontal gyrus . object  >  place showed widespread activity in the medial frontal cortex and parietal cortices ( supramarginal gyrus bilaterally ) and smaller clusters in the frontal and occipital cortices . for the object  >  person contrast , activity was observed in the left and right angular gyrus . 2 . when examining source vs. object retrieval contrasts in scz , a smaller number of significantly activated voxels were observed relative to the activity maps of controls . in the person  >  object contrast only smaller clusters in the head of the caudate and occipital cortex were significant . in place  >  object , mainly posterior activity was observed ( e.g. parietal occipital sulcus and fusiform cortex ) . in both the object  >  person and object  >  place , scz showed a right inferior frontal ( vlpfc ) activity which was not observed in controls . 2 . when comparing between groups , controls demonstrated regions of greater differences between conditions than scz for person  >  object condition ( including bilaterally in the precuneus and superior parietal , and left and right inferior frontal in the vlpfc ) and for place  >  object ( bilaterally in the superior parietal , and the left precuneus ) . schizophrenia patients had greater differences between conditions than controls when considering place  >  object across a wide range of areas . the group comparison was run using contrast  values , which can be positive ( e.g. if place  >  object ) or negative ( e.g. if object  >  place ) . thus , while we observed greater activity in scz than control in the place  >  object contrast , it is not clear from the activation maps if such a difference is due to changes in activity in either object or place . in order to visualize the results for each condition , beta values were extracted for an roi of 11  voxels ( 9 in - plane voxels surrounding the selected voxel and one above and one below ) . rois were selected to represent a range of representative patterns of activity across the brain ( e.g. regions in which controls showed differences from scz in both person  >  object and place  >  object , and regions in which scz showed  greater  activity in place  >  object ) . which controls had greater differences between conditions than scz , controls are showing increased activity to the source memory conditions ( person and/or place ) relative to object , while  values in scz do not show any such differentiation . interestingly , in regions in which we observed  greater  differences between conditions ( in this case , place  >  object ) in scz than controls , we again observe little differences between source memory and object memory in scz . thus , it is not that patients with scz are showing greater activity in the place condition , but that they are failing to modulate brain activity in the same way as control participants . results of the regression analysis with positive symptoms are presented in table 6 and fig . we observed significant negative correlations with the global hallucination score from the saps ( at first assessment ) and place  >  object contrast , in the right midtemporal gyrus , left prefrontal cortex , and right cerebellum ( in a region noted in at least one lesional case study to be associated with source memory deficits ; tamagni et al . , 2010 ) . in order to examine the relationship between recognition memory performance and neural activity , spearman 's correlations were run on global hallucination score , memory performance in the place and object conditions , and  values from the three clusters . while hallucinations did not significantly correlate with performance in either condition ( place , rho  =  .228 , p  =  0.32 ; object , rho  =  0.28 , p  =  0.22 ) , there was a marginally significant correlation between performance in the object condition and  value in the dlpfc cluster ( rho  =  0.38 , p  =  0.088 ) .", "this study examined differences in the neural correlates of source memory in patients with schizophrenia and controls . we examined this issue using a virtual reality paradigm , which has improved ecological validity when assessing the  source  of a memory , as compared to other studies which have used less ecologically valid tasks . furthermore , we examined a group of patients , who were within the first 4.5  years of treatment avoiding potential issues associated with illness chronicity such as cognitive decline , prolonged exposure to medications ( although medication exposure remains an issue ) , social isolation , and sedentary lifestyle ( pelletier et al . , 2005 ) . while patients with scz demonstrated some activation in the source memory contrasts , the extent and magnitude of activity were substantially less than those in controls . even in regions in which the difference appeared to be in the directions of scz  >  controls , it seems to be the case that controls differentiate between source and object memory while patients do not . as discussed below , this finding may be true of other forms of memory , and may therefore be representative of the underlying deficit across a range of memory subtypes . more specifically , patients with scz may fail to activate cortical regions which facilitate elaborative memory processes . this is consistent with previous findings of relatively intact object memory in scz ( achim et al . 2009 ) , but deficits in source memory ( johnson et al . , 1993 ) and associative memory ( achim and lepage , 2003 ) . it may be that the vr environment minimizes these behavioral differences , in that the place condition may be easier than person as locations were more distinct from each other relative to the 3d rendered characters . alternatively , our recent - onset sample may have better preserved function than the more enduring schizophrenia samples often examined . however , this lack of behavioral difference has a positive aspect , in that it removes performance as a potentially major confound in the fmri analysis . had patients with schizophrenia demonstrated profound deficits in performance , it would beg the question if any observed neural activity differences were due to disease pathology or simply related to poor performance ( and as such would be similar to poor performing healthy controls ) . we did observe a performance difference in the person condition , and interestingly very little significant activity in the schizophrenia group for person  >  object . however , some activations observed in the group analysis , particularly in the posterior regions , were present in both person  >  object and place  >  object , suggesting that these differences were not at all modality specific . negative correlations were observed between the difference in neural activity in place  >  object and global hallucinations , measured at intake baseline using the saps . this suggests that the propensity of an individual to experience hallucination may modulate differences between source and object memory in these areas . we did not observe significant correlations with global thought disorder , which is not surprising as hallucinations but not thought disorder are generally associated with source memory ( woodward et al . , 2007 ) . while these regions did not directly overlap activity observed in the healthy control group , the left frontal cluster was proximal to significant activity in place  >  object in controls , while the middle - temporal cluster was proximal to significant voxels in the object  >  place clusters in controls , suggesting that these regions are at least similar to those observed in healthy controls . however , the lack of direct overlap and given the nature of the result ( greater difference with more hallucinations ) , it is possible that these regions represent malfunctioning cortical regions which are more active in patients who have experienced hallucinations as part of their disorder . this over - activation within these regions when considering source information may play an important role in generating hallucinations , which are essentially the misattribution of internally generated stimuli to an external source . at least one study has found relationships between the left prefrontal cortex and the right temporal cortex while patients are actively experiencing hallucinations ( hoffman et al . , 2011 ) , and a meta - analysis suggests that these regions among others are frequently active during hallucination ( jardri et al . , 2011 ) . as such , the regions found to be significantly active in our regression are consistent with the existing literature on the neurobiology of hallucinations . while many studies examining hallucinations have utilized either general  state based measurements ( approximately how much the participant is hallucinating in general at the time ) or direct analysis of overall activity during hallucinations , we have attempted to utilize a  our sample of patients early in treatment makes such an approach possible with minimal confounding for chronicity ( which we attempted to control for by including length of treatment as a covariate in the regression ) . our results overall suggest a relationship between mal - adaptive neural activity related to source memory retrieval and how prone participants are to hallucinatory symptoms , further verifying the relationship between source memory and hallucinations ( woodward et al . , 2007 ) . however , some limitations must be considered as well . while we have attempted to use baseline scores as a  trait measure of how prone an individual is to hallucinations , it is well known that clinical symptoms can vary across time . as such , the appropriate method for evaluating  trait symptoms is to take repeated symptom measurements over time ( mathalon and ford , 2012 ) . it would be preferable to have several assessments of pre - treatment symptoms to have a complete picture of the symptom profile of a given patient , but this is not possible as it would require delaying treatment . as such we utilized the best available measure to assess pre - treatment symptom profile , which produced results which are consistent with the existing literature on those symptoms . however , it is important to remain considerate of the limitations of our measures when considering these results . source memory can be considered a form of associative / relational memory , as participants are binding elements together during encoding and storing these elements together as part of a larger whole . a deficit in source memory can be viewed as a failure to associate a memory item with its context . in the case of this study in particular , our source memory paradigm is not far removed from studies examining associative memory ( achim et al . , 2007 ; achim and lepage , 2005 ; murray and ranganath , 2007 ) , which is known to be more impaired in scz than object memory ( achim and lepage , 2003 ) . some studies have suggested that patients with schizophrenia do not properly differentiate between associative and item memory ( achim et al . 2012 ) , in keeping with suggestions that source memory impairments are part of associative memory impairments ( achim et al . , 2011 ) . our present study focused on source retrieval , and as such we can not definitively determine if the differences observed in our contrasts are driven by deficits in encoding ( in that the information was not properly moved into memory ) or retrieval ( in that the memories may have been encoded but are not properly accessed ) , or a combination of both ( which seems likely given the plurality of evidence for memory deficits in scz ) . ( 2011 ) found deficits in source memory even when using short term recall , minimizing the need for retrieval of information from long - term memory . this suggests that at least part of the source memory deficit in scz is related to problems with encoding . our finding of an overall pattern of lack of differentiation between conditions may be a fairly consistent finding in the cognitive neuroscience of memory in scz , regardless if one considers activity during encoding or retrieval / recognition . core regions required for task performance may be relativity intact in scz , while deficits in activity will be observed in  that is to say , the deficits in memory ( and possibly cognition in general ) are related to a lack of engagement of extended cortical regions . these extended regions are not critically required for minimal task performance , but instead serve to enhance performance ( such as regions involved in cognitive control processes ) . healthy controls will tend to utilize such areas automatically , while patients with schizophrenia will fail to do so . for example , patients with scz have been shown to have impairments in initiating elaborative encoding processes which may be beneficial during associative encoding ( brebion et al . however , when patients are specifically instructed to utilize effective encoding strategies they show an improvement in memory performance , demonstrating that patients with scz can utilize such encoding strategies when specifically instructed but fail to do so spontaneously ( brebion et al . , 1997 ) . this pattern of results is similar to that in patients with prefrontal cortical lesions ( alexander et al . , 2003 ) . bonner - jackson et al . ( 2008 ) examined memory strategies in schizophrenia by contrasting intentional but unstructured encoding ( simply instructing participant to memorize words ) with an externally imposed deep encoding strategy ( having participants perform an abstract / concrete judgement on words , deep semantic encoding which facilitates memory encoding ; craik and lockhart , 1972 ) . they observed group    encoding interactions in several regions , including the left inferior frontal gyrus and precuneus , with the most common finding being a difference between controls and scz in the incidental , unstructured encoding condition . for example , in the left inferior frontal cortex , scz patients showed no activity for unstructured encoding , but substantial activity for deep encoding . that is to say , when scz patients were provided a structured encoding strategy they activated this region , but failed to do so spontaneously . likewise , controls showed significantly better memory performance than scz patients for the deep encoding condition . further support for the importance in strategic and/or cognitive control comes from findings of changes and/or normalization of activity in scz following cognitive training ( hooker et al . , 2012 ; penades et al . , within both encoding and recognition studies in schizophrenia , the most prevalent finding is a decrease in the extent or magnitude of activity in scz patients relative to controls , although many studies also report findings in the direction of scz  >  controls ( ragland et al . , 2009 ) . while it is likely that scz often shows compensatory networks or inefficient over - activation during cognitive tasks , it can be difficult to judge from many of the published studies on cognition in scz . many papers report differences in group activities without also reporting the parameter estimates which accompany those changes . if we had done so in this study ( by only presenting the activation maps in fig . 3 and not the beta values ) we may have concluded that scz showed greater activity in some regions for place vs. object and concluded that this was compensatory of maladaptive over - activation . however , when examining the beta values , we realize that this is not the case but instead these are regions where controls show greater activity for object over place ( often in the form of a decrease in activity for place ) . this highlights the importance of carefully examining parameter estimates when performing between - group comparisons . it is possible that in at least some cases in the existing literature , the so - called  compensatory activity may instead be a lack of activity relative to the control group , such as was the case in this study . such ambiguity and misinterpretation can be avoided if studies fully report parameter estimates for contrasts which differ between groups .", "we have reported the results of a study looking at source memory retrieval in scz using a virtual reality environment on a group of patients relatively early into treatment . while controls activated a large , extensive network for source relative to object retrieval , scz showed a marked reduction in activity . this reduction was borne out in the group comparison , and appears to be related to the fact that patients with scz are failing to activate these regions or differentiate between object and source retrieval . despite the large - scale group differences , patients were still able to perform the source retrieval tasks , suggesting that at least some of the  core system involved in source retrieval is intact . instead , we propose that the observed differences are related to  supporting regions which are not critical to task performance but instead facilitate source retrieval . that is , patients may generally fail to engage extended cortical networks which facilitate task performance and facilitate overall cognitive functioning ."], "summary": "source memory , the ability to identify the context in which a memory occurred , is impaired in schizophrenia and has been related to clinical symptoms such as hallucinations . the neurobiological underpinnings of this deficit are not well understood . twenty - five patients with recent onset schizophrenia ( within the first 4.5  years of treatment ) and twenty - four healthy controls completed a source memory task . participants navigated through a 3d virtual city , and had 20 encounters of an object with a person at a place . functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed during a subsequent forced - choice recognition test . two objects were presented and participants were asked to either identify which object was seen ( new vs. old object recognition ) , or identify which of the two old objects was associated with either the person or the place being presented ( source memory recognition ) . source memory was examined by contrasting person or place with object . both patients and controls demonstrated significant neural activity to source memory relative to object memory , though activity in controls was much more widespread . group differences were observed in several regions , including the medial parietal and cingulate cortex , lateral frontal lobes and right superior temporal gyrus . patients with schizophrenia did not differentiate between source and object memory in these regions . positive correlations with hallucination proneness were observed in the left frontal and right middle temporal cortices and cerebellum . patients with schizophrenia have a deficit in the neural circuits which facilitate source memory , which may underlie both the deficits in this domain and be related to auditory hallucinations .", "ranking": [3, 0, 2, 4, 1]}

initiating cells ( cics ) . cics can lead to tumor recurrence because they escape apoptosis by effluxing antitumor drugs and degrading reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , which are related to radiation - induced apoptosis . cics are generally defined on the basis of their ability to initiate a tumor in a transplantation assay in immunocompromised mice . in leukemia , breast , lung , and colon cancers , however , recent reports reveal that in some tumor types , such as melanomas , the majority of tumor cells can initiate tumors . asymmetrical division of stem cells yields a stem cell and a more highly differentiated cell . as in the case of physiological stem cells , cics are derived from cics but not from non - cics under normal conditions . however , under some conditions , such as severe hypoxia , non - cics can yield cics ; this phenomenon is known as  plasticity  . the dynamic exchange between cics and non - cics may enable tumors to survive under unfavorable conditions . therefore , cics may not be a distinct cell type but may be a mode or phenotype of tumor cells . this review briefly describes isolation of cics from tumor cell populations and the microenvironmental factors that regulate cic phenotypes in uterine cancer and lymphoma .", "cics express high levels of cell membrane -

degrading enzymes , such as superoxide dismutase , which facilitate their escape from apoptosis by degrading intracellular ros . intracellular ros can be stained with 5-(and 6)-chloromethyl-2,7-dichlorohydrofluorescein diacetate ( cm - h2dcfda ) . when treated with hydrogen peroxide , most tumor cells are stained with cm - h2dcfda , but a small population remains unstained . these cm - h2dcfda - low cells are more tumorigenic than cm - h2dcfda - high cells , and cics are enriched in the cm - h2dcfda - low population . s lymphoma cell lines , most foxo3a - expressing cells are contained in the cm - h2dcfda - low population . a small subpopulation of hodgkin s lymphoma cells expressing foxo3a can degrade ros efficiently and is resistant to apoptosis . sternberg ( rs ) cells ; however , foxo3a - expressing cells are small mononucleated cells . the l1236 and l428 hodgkin s lymphoma cell lines include both small mononucleated and giant multinucleated cells . in these cell lines , multinucleated cells are derived from mononucleated cells , but mononucleated cells are not derived from multinucleated cells . these findings suggest that some mononucleated cells , but not rs cells , are the cics of hodgkin s lymphoma . several such markers , such as cd133 and cd44 ( cd44v isoform ) , have been reported ; aldehyde dehydrogenase ( aldh ) is one of the most commonly used . high aldh activity is present in not only normal stem cells , such as hematopoietic and neural stem cells , but also various types of cics . indeed , immunohistochemical analysis using an anti - aldh antibody revealed that a portion of uterine endometrioid carcinoma cells are aldh - positive , and cases with high aldh activity have an unfavorable prognosis ( fig . aldh - high endometrioid carcinoma cells are resistant to apoptosis , mobile , and highly invasive . sp and ros - degrading cells can only be detected while alive . by contrast , aldh - high cells can be detected immunohistochemically in formalin - fixed paraffin - embedded tissues . uterine endometrioid carcinoma cells usually express steroid hormone receptors , such as estrogen and progesterone receptors . however , double staining of clinical samples with anti - aldh and anti - hormone receptor antibodies revealed that aldh - high cells are negative for these hormone receptors . aldh - high endometrioid carcinoma cells appear to be immature and negative for  differentiation  markers , such as estrogen and progesterone receptors . because aldh - high cells are readily isolated by flow cytometry , their proteome can be investigated using mass spectroscopy ( table 1table 1 . list of proteins preferentially expressed in the aldh - high population of uterine endometrioid adenocarcinoma cells ) . these cells also exhibit impaired akt phosphorylation and matrix metalloproteinase-2 activation , which account for their impaired proliferation and invasion , respectively . elevated expression of s100a4 is related to myometrial and lymphatic invasion in well- to moderately - differentiated endometrioid carcinoma . notably , strong and diffuse expression of s100a4 is observed in tumor tissues with a microcystic , elongated , and fragmented (  melf  ) pattern , which is associated with a highly invasive phenotype . however , aldh is not an almighty marker of cics , because , for example , aldh is highly expressed in stromal cells , such as dendritic cells and macrophages , in lymphoma .", "this suggests the presence of microenvironmental factors that induce or inhibit aldh expression and suggests that intercellular signaling between tumor cells might regulate aldh expression . indeed , phosphorylated smad-2 , an indicator of tgf- signaling activation , is present at higher levels in aldh - low than -high endometrioid carcinoma cells . tgf- family members regulate cell fates in developing embryos ; for example , lefty determines the left  similarly , the development or differentiation of tumor cells might be controlled by tgf- family members . among the tgf- receptor ligands immunohistochemical analysis of clinical samples has revealed nodal - high tumor cells to be aldh - low cells , and vice versa . these findings suggest that nodal inhibits aldh expression via stimulation of tgf- signaling in uterine endometrioid carcinoma cells .", "lymphomas can be categorized using the surface markers of differentiation status expressed by lymphocytes . for example , peripheral t - cell lymphoma cells express the t - cell marker cd3 , and diffuse large b - cell lymphoma cells express the b - cell markers cd79a and cd20 . lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma ( lpl ) is a rare indolent disease that affects the bone marrow , and is associated with expression of the b- and plasma - cell markers cd20 and cd138 . mwcl-1 cells are derived from lpl , and express cd20 and cd138 as surface markers . mwcl-1 cells include three subpopulations : cd20 cd138 , cd20 cd138 , and cd20 cd138 cells . the first subpopulation expresses neither b- nor plasma - cell markers , the second subpopulation expresses only b - cell markers , and the third subpopulation expresses both b- and plasma - cell markers . when cultured , cd20 cd138 cells yield all three subpopulations , but cd20 cells do not yield cd20 cd138 cells ( fig . mwcl-1 cells derived from lpl include three subpopulations : cd20 cd138 , cd20 cd138 , and cd20 cd138 cells . when cultured , cd20 cd138 cells yield all three subpopulations , but cd20 cells do not yield cd20 cd138 cells . the cd20 cd138 subpopulation expresses the chemokine receptor cxcr7 , the ligand of which is cxcl12 . the number of cd20 cd138 cells increases in a time- and dose - dependent manner when mwcl-1 cells are cultured in the presence of cxcl12 . ) . cd20 cd138 cells have higher ros degradation and in vitro colony formation activities than cd20 cd138 and cd20 cd138 cells . when cultured in the absence of serum or the presence of an anticancer drug , cd20 cd138 cells immunohistochemical analysis of clinical samples has indicated that lpl tumor cells undergoing apoptosis are cd138 . the production of all three subpopulations , efficient ros degradation and in vitro colony formation activities , and resistance to apoptosis suggest that cd20 cd138 cells are candidate cics in lpl .   mwcl-1 cells derived from lpl include three subpopulations : cd20 cd138 , cd20 cd138 , and cd20 cd138 cells . when cultured , cd20 cd138 cells yield all three subpopulations , but cd20 cells do not yield cd20 cd138 cells . the cd20 cd138 subpopulation expresses the chemokine receptor cxcr7 , the ligand of which is cxcl12 . the number of cd20 cd138 cells increases in a time- and dose - dependent manner when mwcl-1 cells are cultured in the presence of cxcl12 . as described above , cics are plastic under stress conditions , in which non - cics are transformed to cics . indeed , hypoxia induces conversion of cd20 cd138 cells to cd20 cd138 cells , whereas normoxic conditions do not . among the proteins preferentially expressed by the cd20 cd138 subpopulation , expression of the chemokine receptor cxcr7 it is possible that the conversion from cd20 cd138 to cd20 cd138 cells is mediated by signaling via cxcr7 ( fig . this is plausible because the number of cd20 cd138 cells increases in a time- and dose - dependent manner when mwcl-1 cells are cultured in the presence of cxcl12 , a ligand of cxcr7 . recently , a constitutively active mutation of cxcr4 , a receptor related to cxcr7 , has been reported in lpl . the fact that cics are resistant to apoptosis and related to aggressive behavior is consistent with the notion that the cics of lpl utilize the cxcl12-cxcr4/cxcr7 axis .", "cics , which are resistant to anticancer drugs and escape from apoptosis , may be a good therapeutic target for cancers . however , they are , under some circumstances , derived from non - cics due to their plasticity . therefore , the regulatory mechanism of cics should be determined . reagents that block the signals controlling cics may interfere with their plasticity , leading to their complete elimination . the tgf- family member nodal regulates aldh activity in uterine endometrioid carcinoma , whereas signaling via the chemokine receptor cxcr7 regulates cics in non - hodgkin s lymphoma . therefore , investigation of the cics of each tumor type is necessary to facilitate development of novel therapeutics . aldh - high tumor cells express a large number of factors , some of which play roles in invasion and some of which play roles in mobility . although aldh - high cells are invasive and mobile , these characteristics are likely mediated by different factors . genome - editing techniques will enable determination of the function of such factors in cics , which will facilitate development of novel therapeutics ."], "summary": "tumors derive from a single cell clone but consist of heterogeneous cell subpopulations with diverse features and functions . a limited number of subclones with a selective advantage can initiate tumors when inoculated into immunocompromised mice , and are called cancer -

called \n bottom - up experiments in which well - defined nanoparticles are subjected \n to controlled environments . such studies can be performed by depositing \n nanoparticles in ultrahigh vacuum on perfect single crystal substrates , \n after which their structure is characterized under different thermodynamic \n conditions and gas environments . in this \n way , for example , oxidation  reduction - induced reversible shape \n changes in nanoparticles have been discovered . solid oxide fuel cells ( sofcs ) are devices used for energy conversion \n and are considered as an important future green technology . their \n function is largely dependent on catalytic processes taking place \n at their interfaces . two important chemical reactions between the \n surrounding gas atmosphere and the solid play a decisive role . at \n the cathode , oxygen is dissociated , and the ions enter the electrolyte . \n fuel is being oxidized at the anode side , for which the required oxygen \n reaches the interface through the solid electrolyte . both the cathode \n and the anode consist of complex materials having a large surface \n area , such as polycrystalline oxides ( cathode ) or nickel nanoparticles \n ( anode ) . usually , ni is grown on the electrolyte \n by wet - chemical methods . here we \n investigate ni nanoparticles ( nps ) deposited on a polished \n yttria - stabilized zirconia ( ysz ) substrate as sofc model anode by \n surface sensitive x - ray diffraction methods . ysz with 9.5 mol % y2o3 content is a widely used sofc electrolyte material \n because of its high oxygen ion conductivity . nickel films grown on \n mgo(100 ) have been found to show several preferential orientations , \n forming a complex epitaxial system and of which the core is stable \n toward high temperature oxidation . this \n raises the question how smaller particles in the size regime from \n 310 nm , as typically encountered on the anodes of sofcs behave \n when in contact with a solid electrolyte . their sintering behavior \n in different atmospheres is particularly important for catalytic activity \n and long - term stability . here we show the results \n of such a study , whereby the ni nps are first annealed and finally \n oxidized . we find that ni nanoparticles grow with two very distinct \n orientations on ysz(111 ) , in contrast to mgo(100 ) . the nio formed \n during oxidation grows epitaxially with repect to the ni nanoparticles . \n from the measured particle heights and widths , the energy of adhesion , \n which is an important quantity with respect to the nanoparticles \n sintering stability , is determined .", "the \n experiments presented in the following were performed at the \n mpi beamline of the ngstrm - quelle \n karlsruhe ( anka ) using an x - ray energy of 10 kev . x - ray data consist \n of x - ray reflectivity , extensive reciprocal space mapping , and crystal \n truncation rod ( ctr ) data . in addition , ex situ atomic force microscopy \n ( afm ) measurements were performed in air once the synchrotron experiments \n had finished . polished single crystals of 9.5 mol % yttria - doped zirconia \n with   orientation were used as substrate having a surface diameter \n of 10 mm . prior to the ni deposition , the substrates were annealed at 673 k \n in 10 pa o2 for 120 min , a procedure \n which was found to result in smooth and well - defined surface structures . the ni nps were grown with a substrate temperature \n of 623 k at a growth rate of 0.2 nm / min resulting in a nominal 3 nm \n of deposited material . here , we present results from two such growth \n runs with different samples , named sample i and sample ii hereafter . \n for sample i , only the as - prepared nps were structurally characterized , \n and after the in situ synchrotron experiment , the sample was investigated \n by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) in air . in a second experiment on \n sample ii , the ni nps were further treated , and extensive x - ray characterization \n was carried out . the as - prepared ni nps were first annealed at 973 \n k for 75 min , then exposed to 10 pa of methane \n at 573 k for 30 min and finally oxidized at 10 pa of o2 at 573 k for 35 min . after each of these steps , \n extensive x - ray data were taken , which allow us to determine changes \n in the orientation , size , and composition of the nps . because the \n methane exposure did not result in any notable structural changes , \n these data are not included in the present report . in addition , at \n each of the sample preparation steps , the ysz surface structure was \n investigated by measuring several ctrs with a nonzero in - plane momentum \n transfer . these data do not indicate any considerable changes after \n ni evaporation and after the oxygen treatment . because these ctrs \n probe the 3d atomic structure of the ysz(111 ) surface , which is partly \n covered by the nps , we conclude that each of these processing steps \n does not result in any significant atomic relaxations of the substrate .", "afm images \n were taken ex situ after the first growth run of nickel \n nanoparticles on ysz(111 ) without further treatments ( sample i ) . particles are clearly observed , and typical heights \n of 3 nm can be derived . just after growth , with the sample still in \n the uhv chamber , x - ray reflectivity ( xrr ) measurements were taken \n ( see figure 2 together \n with the xrr curves from sample ii described more extensively in this \n paper ) . the curves of the as - prepared states in both experiments are \n very similar . analysis of the xrr data is performed by fitting the \n electron density profile along the surface normal . here we use a so - called \n slab model , based on the fully dynamical parratt formalism . by comparison of the value obtained for the \n ni nps to that of a closed bulk ni layer , their coverage can be estimated . \n at the same time , the average height of the ni nps can be obtained \n from the xrr measurement . this information is contained mostly in \n the period of the oscillations of the reflectivity . the result from sample i gives an average height of 3.6 nm , in \n good agreement with afm performed on the same sample when considering \n that due to tip convolution effects those values will be systematically \n lower . in contrast to the height determination procedure described \n in the section nanoparticle shape and adhesion \n energy , xrr gives a value averaged over all np orientations .

bul for \n the conventional fcc ni lattice and ni-111 for the ni(111 ) hexagonal \n surface unit cell . table 2 lists different ( h , k , l ) values in the different frames . by mapping out reciprocal \n space in selected areas , we have found two preferred np orientations \n and at least one other not yet reported for the epitaxial growth of \n ni nps . the first major one corresponds to the ni ( 111)-direction \n parallel to the substrate surface normal . the in - plane directions \n of the ni lattice were found to align with the substrate surface unit \n cell directions . this orientational relationship ( or ) is described \n by yszni111 and [ 110]ysz[110]ni111 and will be \n denoted or1 in the remainder of this paper . the ( 1,0,l)ni111 bragg peaks are found in a plane \n ( h,0,l ) at h= 1.44 \n ( see figure 3 ) , indicating \n that the ni is completely relaxed and adopts its bulk lattice parameter \n because this value corresponds exactly to the ratio between the bulk \n lattice parameters aysz / ani . two peaks , which belong to -oriented particles \n as described above , at h = 1.44 but at different l - values are seen , corresponding to the ni - bul ( 11 1 ) \n and ni - bul ( 002 ) reflections . these ni peaks indicate that the ni \n atoms follow an abc - type stacking along the substrate surface normal . \n if there were only one unique stacking sequence of the ni atoms , only \n one of these peaks would be visible , because the 3-fold symmetry axis \n of the fcc ni along its body diagonal would be preserved . instead , \n the observation of both peaks indicates that the ni atoms have two \n different stackings , which results in an apparent 6-fold symmetry \n axis around the stacking direction , which was also evident from scanning \n the sample around the surface normal whereby diffraction peaks separated \n by 60 appeared ( not shown ) . this diffraction feature indicates \n that the ni nps possess an internal twin structure , that different \n nps possess different stacking sequences starting from the substrate , \n or a combination of both of these . from the peak widths along the l direction , it is concluded that internal twinning does \n not occur frequently because this effect would lead to additional \n broadening and would result in lower apparent np heights , as explained \n in more detail in the section nanoparticle shape and adhesion energy . the substrate \n bragg peak at ( 1,0,2 ) and the corresponding ctr along the l - direction . the ( 1 , 0 , 1)ni111 and ( 1 , 0 , 2)ni111 bragg peaks from ( 111)-orientated \n ni nps . at ( 1.25 , 0 , 2.53 ) a peak belonging to ( 100)-oriented \n ni nps and at ( 1.66 , 0 , 1.86 ) a peak orignating from internal \n twinning as described in the text . the peak at ( 1.02,0,3.28 ) , \n which is labeled as ( 0 , 0 , 3)ni  tilt , originates \n from the tilted nps as described in the text . table 2 gives an overview of the ( h , k , l ) coordinates \n expressed in different frames . the hk projection \n ( inset ) shows the substrate ( black ) and ni ( blue ) reciprocal lattice \n vectors . another strong ni - bul ( 111 ) peak is observed at \n ( 1,0,3.28 ) , \n which originates from np which are 41.33 tilted with respect \n to the ( 111)-oriented particles . this or2 is described by yszni111r41.33 \n and [ 120]ysz[120]ni111 , where r indicates a rotation . the full 3d information \n is confirmed by the observation of a ( 2,2,0)ni  bul reflection , belonging to or2 and which is rotated by 34.4 \n from the substrate surface plane . the angular position of this reflection \n is obtained by rotating the ( 0,2 , 2)ni  bul of or1 , which makes an angle of 30 with the plane of the rsm \n shown in figure 3 , \n around the [ 120]ysz direction by 41.33. the \n atomic - scale arrangement , schematically depicted as a side view along \n the rotation axis , is shown in figure 4 . the orientation can be understood from a so - called \n coherent tilt strain - relieving mechanism , which is rather common in \n thin film heteroepitaxy . for fcc metals , this epitaxial \n relationship originates from the diffusion of dislocations along ( 111 ) \n slip planes . the resulting edge dislocations \n line up laterally at the hetero interface , thereby reducing the strain \n and tilting the metal lattice . the energetics of this mechanism competes \n with other types of strain relaxation and can be kinetically hindered by dislocation movement . therefore , \n depending on the growth technique in combination with temperature , \n which determines the supersaturation and surface diffusion , different \n orientations are expected . nanoparticles as investigated here , would \n actually form the very early growth stage of textured polycrystalline \n thin films . the np nickel lattice is tilted such that the projection \n of ( 111 ) planes fits much better to the substrate atomic distance \n of 0.314 nm along this direction and therefore accommodates strain . the particular arrangement originates from an interfacial strain \n driven slip mechanism , which is common in fcc metals . by the diffusion \n of dislocations along the ( 111 ) slip planes toward the interface , \n the projected d - spacings have a better match with \n the substrate thereby relieving strain . as a consequence , figure 3 also shows \n much weaker peaks at ( 1.25,0,2.53 ) and ( 1.66,0,1.86 ) , \n which are ascribed to ( 100)-oriented nps and from internal twinning \n around the ni 111-direction pointing toward a side facet , respectively . \n because these orientations represent only a fraction of all the nps , \n as judged from the much weaker diffracted bragg intensities , these \n are left out of further consideration . the or1 found here has \n been reported before for a variety of different \n growth methods of ni on ysz(111 ) , like pulsed laser deposition and mbe . because \n this or results from a simple cube - on - cube stacking and most likely \n is energetically favorable , it has also been found for the ni - ysz(100 ) \n interface grown by directional solidification . these studies also report on other ors , but not on the or2 found \n by our x - ray diffraction study . interestingly , from the geometrical \n analysis of coincident lattice points , sasaki et al . find that the best match would be formed by yszni  bulk and yszni  bulk , an or that has experimentally never been verified , \n also not in this study . this point illustrates that ni - ysz lattice - matching \n alone is not enough to describe the different ors and that other energy \n terms such as chemical bonding and dislocation formation and their \n kinetic interplay during growth play a potentially more important \n role . moreover , it has been shown previously that the ysz(111 ) possesses \n a surface morphology with 2d monolayer high islands , which is expected to play a role in the np binding . the average \n size of the nps can be determined from the widths of their corresponding \n bragg peaks , under the assumption that the line broadening can be \n mostly attributed to their finite size and that nonuniform strain \n plays a minor role . the experimentally observed diffraction peaks \n are further broadened by the instrument resolution , which in the case \n here is anisotropic due to the synchrotron radiation characteristics \n in combination with the beamline focusing optics . from the single - crystal \n substrate bragg peaks the in- and out - of - plane instrument resolution \n is determined . because our sample coordinate system is chosen such \n that the hk - plane lies horizontal and the l - direction is vertical , the instrument resolution can be \n described by ( h , k,l ) = ( 0.025,0.060 ) , expressed \n in dimensionless reciprocal lattice units . all the experimentally \n determined diffraction peaks were well described by gaussians , so \n that the peak breadths are corrected for the instrumental resolution \n by  = exp2res2 . the average height of the nps \n is given by the following reciprocal relationship:1where c = 0.890 nm is the \n direct lattice parameter of the ysz(111 ) surface unit cell and l the peak width ( fwhm ) along the l - direction corrected \n for the instrument resolution . a similar expression holds for the \n determination of the average widths ( w ) , for which \n the peak profile along the h - direction must be considered together \n with the fact that the h - direction makes an angle of 30 with \n the real space atomic layers within the hexagonal surface unit cell . \n the np heights and widths have been determined after each of the treatments , \n and the resulting values are presented in table 3 . the errors that are listed are calculated \n from the spread in values obtained from several bragg peaks at different \n positions in reciprocal space . in a next step , the average \n sizes are used together with wulff s \n construction to deduce the nps \n equilibrium shape when in contact with a foreign substrate . the underlying \n principle is that the nps are faceted and that those facets with the \n lowest surface energy will have the largest surface area . this aspect \n is now combined with the geometrical constraint that the nickel nps \n are supported by the ysz substrate . it is important to note that the \n description of the nps shape used in the following is valid \n for isolated particles ( i.e. , in the absence of particle  particle \n interaction ) . from the afm measurement , shown in figure 1 , it can be concluded that \n coalescence may have set in for certain particles / areas but probably \n not for all . a more detailed analysis is hampered by the inherent \n lateral resolution of the used afm . nevertheless , the sample used \n for this study is probably not far off a model system with completely \n isolated nps . for fcc metals like ni , the wulff shape ( i.e. , without \n support ) is given by a polyhedron with predominantly ( 111)-oriented \n hexagonal facets together with smaller square ( 100 ) facets . this basic \n shape is taken as a starting point to construct the shape when in \n contact with a substrate . using the dimensions and orientation with \n respect to the substrate , the wulff shape has to be cut at particular \n positions . for the ( 111)-oriented particles , \n the wulff shape is shown in the upper part of figure 5a ) . the width of 8 nm and height of 5 nm , \n as determined previously , require a truncation of the wulff - shape , \n as shown in the lower part of figure 5a ) . the resulting shape of the ( 111)-oriented nps is \n then given by a large ( 111)-oriented top facet , six ( 111)-oriented \n side facets and three ( 100)-oriented side facets . the shape of the \n tilted nps is determined by rotating the wulff - shape by 41.3 \n in order to comply with the experimentally determined orientation . \n then this tilted particle is truncated at the experimentally determined \n height , see figure 5b ) . ( a ) wulff shape for the unsupported ( 111)-oriented np ( top ) and when \n supported by the ysz substrate ( bottom ) . the different treatments did not significantly \n change the nps shapes , although the heights and widths did \n change , as described in the text and seen in table 3 . the energy of adhesion for relatively round supported nps \n ( i.e. , \n which are not very flat and at least half as high as the wulff - constructed \n free particle ) is given by2with h the height of the \n np and h * the height of the  buried  \n part . it seems a reasonable approximation to relate the experimentally \n determined heights and widths to the geometric lengths of eq 2 as w = h + h*. taking a value of 111 = 1.89 jm , this gives wadh = 1.4 jm for the ( 111)-oriented \n ni nps after annealing . ( note : these surface - energy values were checked \n and recalculated with density functional theory ( dft ) using the latest \n perdew  burke  enzerhof ( pbe ) potential , which does not \n suffer too much from overbinding . ) because the error bar on the widths \n is relatively large , the criterion for using eq 2 might not hold anymore and they could actually \n be much flatter , in which case the following relation holds:3 this relation gives , together with 100 = \n 2.2 \n j / m ( see parenthetical note \n above ) , wadh = 2.1 j / m . the \n adhesion energy value obtained from eq 2 is somehwat smaller than typical values obtained for \n other materials systems , such as ptrh - al2o3 and pd  al2o3 . the value obtained using eq 3 is much closer to those values and is in \n very good agreement with the value obtained for much larger ( w = 200 nm , h = 150 nm ) ni particles . for the tilted nps , a higher h / w ratio is observed , pointing to a reduced adhesion \n energy . the occurrence of two distinct np growth directions can be \n related to a difference in interfacial binding which either could \n originate from a lateral chemical inhomogeneity of the ysz substrate \n or a kinetically trapped state . also a size dependence can not be ruled \n out which is difficult to investigate due to the inherent size distribution \n of the nps after growth via thermal deposition . at a temperature of 573 k , the \n nps were exposed to molecular oxygen at a pressure of 10 pa for approximately 35 min , after which the oxygen was pumped off \n again . figure 6 shows \n a reciprocal space map after oxidation from the same plane as that \n shown in figure 3 . \n clearly observable are two new bragg peaks along the l - direction at h = 1.24 , which originate \n from nio . from the position of these two peaks with respect to the \n nearby bragg peaks of the ni -oriented nps the average heights \n and widths of the -oriented and tilted nps after oxidation are \n listed in table 3 . \n additionally , the temporal evolution during oxidation of some structural \n parameters were followed as well , see figure 7 . the integrated bragg peak intensity , which \n is proportional to the amount of pure metal , is seen in the decay \n below half of its initial value , which means that about 65% of the \n ni contained by the -oriented nps transforms into nio . at the \n same time , the average height of the -oriented nps changes only \n by approximately 0.2 nm , which is equal to the estimated error , see table 3 . nevertheless , the \n data do indicate a trend , whereby the average height of the pure metal \n ( core ) is reduced . the particular bragg reflection that was followed \n during oxidation gives an average height somewhat smaller than the \n value obtained from other bragg reflections and therefore is not identical \n to the values listed in table 3 . the position of the bragg peak along l can \n be used to determine changes in the uniform strain of the nps \n ni ( 111)-planes along the substrate surface normal . by comparing its \n shift from its initial value , which relates to d0 , the relative strain state d / d0 is calculated . it is seen in figure 7 that as oxidation proceeds , \n the lattice expands along the surface normal and levels off after \n an approximately 0.5% increase , a value very close to that found during \n thin ni film oxidation . we argue that \n this can be attributed to oxygen incorporation into the ni lattice . \n from the trend in the intensity curve , it is concluded that the oxidation \n process had not yet finished , although the lattice did not expand \n anymore , which indicates that the oxygen dissolution has reached a \n final state . l plane after oxidation at 573 k and 10 pa of \n molecular oxygen for 35 min . kinetics of the 111-oriented ni np evolution during oxidation . \n shown are the average height ( top ) , relative 111 bragg peak intensity \n ( middle ) and relative strain d / d0 ( bottom ) as a function of oxidation time . in order to rationalize the obtained results , we \n postulate the \n following oxidation mechanism . one important ingredient is that small \n nps oxidize relatively faster than large ones ; their so - called burn - up \n time is even lower than expected from the oxidation rate of planar \n surfaces , because the geometry of the electric field around these \n often more - rounded particles is predicted to accelerate the oxidation \n process . larger nps will first form an oxide skin \n around them , and eventually , they also burn up completely , but with \n a much lower rate . schematically , an intermediate state of this scenario \n is depicted in figure 8a , which represents the situation after the oxidation step presented \n here . given a certain particle size distribution , the resulting bragg \n peak shape figure 8 shows the results for such a calculation , using a hypothetical \n gaussian width distribution , around an average of 8 nm and a standard \n deviation of ann = 3 nm . gaussian - shaped diffraction \n peaks corresponding to each of the np size represented in the distribution \n are used in the calculation . a cutoff value around 5.5 nm is used , \n below which the nickel nps are completely oxidized . from the resulting \n ni and nio therefore , the width of a nio np , which has \n formed from a metal ni particle , is larger by a factor of 1.19 , which \n reflects the ratio of their lattice parameters . metal ni . in this particular \n numerical example , the average ni np width before oxidation is 8 nm , \n whereas after oxidation , both ni and nio widths are 9 nm . although \n this numerical simulation certainly does not include all the details \n of the oxidation process , it does show how the average np sizes can \n in principle be affected by a preferential oxidation of small particles \n and how this can lead to average np widths that are larger after oxidation . \n the simulation presented here does not differentiate between partially \n and completely oxidized particles , although the experimental results \n point toward such a situation . this is mostly seen in the large anisotropy \n between the oxidation of the nps top 111 facet and the average widths . \n both xrr and high - angle bragg peaks indicate that upon oxidation , \n the average height of the metal ni nps is slightly reduced , at most \n by 0.2 nm . it has been observed that during the oxidation of a ni(111 ) \n single - crystal surface under identical conditions as used in this \n work , a nio skin of approximately 2 nm forms after approximately 14 \n h. therefore , it seems reasonable to \n assume that for the oxidation time investigated here , at most , only \n one single outermost layer of ni atoms , which constitute the top facets , \n form an ultrathin nickel oxide . the oxidation process at the other \n facets , like 100 , seems to proceed much faster and even leads to complete \n oxidation of nickel nps . ( a ) small nps oxidize comparatively faster and burn up \n completely , whereas at the same time , an oxide skin has formed on \n larger nps and the core is still metallic . the evolution of the diffraction \n peaks is simulated using np width distributions during this partial \n oxidation process . ( b ) np width distributions before and after oxidation : \n initial metallic ni nps ( black line ) with an average of 8 nm and a \n spread of  = 3 nm . after oxidation , the width distribution \n of the metallic core of the partially oxidized particles has become \n asymmetric and peaks at around 9 nm ( filled white ) . the width distribution \n of the oxidized metallic ni ( red ) is shifted due to the lattice expansion \n and is used to calculate the expected nio bragg peaks , see text for \n more explanation . ( c ) bragg peaks calculated as weighted averages \n using the gaussian width distributions . shown are the initial ni peak \n ( black ) , the final ni peak ( red ) , and the newly formed nio peak ( filled \n red ) . from the diffraction lines , average widths of 8 , 9 , and 9 nm \n for the initial ni , final ni , and nio particles are found , respectively . the oxidation behavior of the \n nps belonging to or2 has not been \n followed in situ , but the overall changes in height and width , as \n listed in table 3 , \n are very similar to those of or1 . the intensity loss on the metal \n ni bragg peaks is about 50% , very similar to that of the peaks belonging \n to or1 . we therefore conclude that the fact that the particles belonging \n to or1 have different facets exposed to the gas phase leads to minor \n changes in oxidation behavior and the stability of the particles is \n not much different .", "nickel nps \n were grown in uhv by pvd using an electron beam evaporator \n with a nominal average height of approximately 4 nm at substrate temperatures \n of 623 k. x - ray diffraction revealed that two distinct np orientations \n form ; there is no random orientational growth which would give rise \n to powderlike diffraction patterns . the np orientations are or1 : ni \n ( 111 ) planes parallel to the surface whereby the in - plane directions \n are also aligned ( niysz and ni[1 10]ysz[1 \n 10 ] ) and or2 : ni 111 planes tilted by 41.33 from the \n substrate normal in the plane spanned by ysz and ysz[1 10 ] . \n the average heights and widths of the nps were determined from the \n x - ray diffraction line breadths . the relatively well - defined height \n is furthermore extracted from x - ray reflectivity and afm in a separate \n growth run , which all give systematically comparable values . the average heights and width of nps in both ors increase by approximately \n 25% , indicating that the particles exhibited already equilibrium shape \n at the growth temperature . from the height - to - width ( h - to - w ) ratio , together with the ni ( 111 ) and ( 100 ) \n surface energies , the adhesion energy is determined . depending on \n the np shape being more round or flat , two different relations hold . \n because the nps average aspect ratio h / w is close to , either of the relationships might give \n representative values . this is even more likely when taking into acount \n the appreciable size distribution , which is more broad in w than in h. the more rounded nps will \n then have an adhesion energy of 1.4 j / m and the flatter \n ones 2.2 j / m . this adhesion energy calculation does not hold for the tilted nps \n forming or2 because of their asymmetric shape . when exposing \n the nps to methane at a pressure of 10 pa and \n a temperature of 573 k for 30 min , no changes are observed . \n a possible adsorption of the hydrocarbons on the nps is thus concluded not to affect the structure of the nps . the most distinct changes are caused by an oxygen treatment at \n 10 pa and 573 k for 35 min . the intensity of the \n or1 bragg reflections , which is a measure for the total amount of \n metal , decreases to less than half its initial value . after the oxidation \n step , nio bragg reflections are detected , and from their positions \n in reciprocal space , it is deduced that nio has grown epitaxially , \n in a cube - on - cube fashion , on the nps from or1 or in contact with \n the ysz ( 111 ) surface . at the same time , the average height has changed \n by 0.2  0.3 nm and the average width + 1  3 nm . \n the average size of the nio is approximately equal to that of the \n remaining pure metal particles . these results can be rationalized \n by considering a preferential oxidation mechanism in combination with \n an anisotropic size distribution , whereby the spread in h is much narrower than that in w. it has been predicted \n that small , more rounded , nps will oxidize at an enhanced rate compared \n to larger ones . on the basis of these \n and our experimental results , we postulate that ni nps smaller than \n approximately 5.5 nm have burnt up completely and that larger ones \n have a nio skin formed around them . a simulation , using a hypothetical \n gaussian width distribution , shows that indeed this scenario can explain \n the experimentally observed average widths before and after oxidation . \n this description does not include all the details of the oxidation \n process , such as exact oxidation rate and nio thickness on the different \n facets , and even assumes that part of the larger nps does not oxidize \n at all , which is not very realistic . nevertheless , it shows numerically \n the effect one important aspect of the mechanism , namely , size - dependence , \n can have on the final average size . the size - dependent oxidation behavior \n might also be related to the kink seen after approximately 3 min in \n the time - dependent intensity reduction of the 111 bragg peak of figure 7 . the average \n size of the nio particles and/or skin is of the same \n order of magnitude as the remaining pure ni metal ( cores ) because \n of two effects : ( 1 ) due to the lattice expansion after oxidation ( i.e. , \n nio has larger lattice constants than ni ) , a completely oxidized np \n will be larger than the original one . this effect shifts the average \n oxidized np size to higher values , thereby compensating for the fact \n that the smaller metal particles have prefentially oxidized . ( 2 ) the \n oxide skin on the top facet is formed by a completely structurally \n correlated nio lattice . therefore , the in - plane nio size will be comparable \n to the underying metal particle . from ni(111 ) single - crystal oxidation \n studies , it was found that an approximately 2 nm oxide forms after \n 14 h at conditions similar to the ones here . extrapolating to the oxidation time used here , it would be expected \n to have oxidized only a monolayer from the 111 facets , which is about \n 0.2 nm thin . this value corresponds very well to the reduction in \n the average height of the ( 111)-oriented nps upon oxidation and would \n imply that the oxidation proceeds mostly along the ( 100 ) facets . the results obtained here can be discussed in relation to real \n sofcs , in particular with respect to the so - called redox cycling ( i.e. , \n the oxidation  reduction process of ni ) . during sofc operation , the anode is continuously supplied \n with fuel , the amount of which is burnt depends on the availability \n of oxygen . instabilities around the ideal ratio of fuel and oxygen \n levels can lead to the formation of nio , which is known to lower the \n sofc performance and lifetime by stress development , lowering of the \n metal triple phase boundary density , and mechanical failure . our results may add another cause to sofc anode \n failure , namely , that during the time when there exists a surplus \n of oxygen , probably the smallest ni nps will completely oxidize and , \n depending on the reducing properties of the fuel , might not revert \n to pure metal anymore . after many cycles of such a process , the sofc \n might gradually loose its efficiency because the smallest particles \n are most likely to be the most reactive and therefore relatively more \n important for the functionality . moreover , such a preferential oxidation \n process , whereby the particle size distribution shifts toward larger \n values , might result in the sofc operation to drift away from complete \n reaction leaving unburnt fuel and increasing oxygen levels thereby \n oxidizing ever more ni .", "x -

secreting pituitary adenoma . rare nonpituitary causes of acromegaly include diverse entities such as hypothalamic hamartomas , small - cell lung cancers , pheochromocytomas , and bronchial carcinoids . among gh - secreting pituitary adenomas , roughly 60% are pure gh - secreting somatotrope adenomas , while the remainder are mixed mammosomatotropes , which secrete both gh and prolactin ( prl ) and sometimes thyroid - stimulating hormone ( tsh ) . the symptoms of increased gh are mediated by both the direct effects of gh binding to the gh receptor , activating the jak / stat pathway , and indirectly via insulin - like growth factor 1 ( igf-1 ) . the combined effects of gh and igf-1 on target tissues lead to bony and soft tissue growth , noted by a characteristic constellation of signs including frontal bossing , prognathism , widely spaced teeth ( due to mandibular growth ) , increased shoe or ring sizes , skin tags , carpal tunnel syndrome , and coarse facial features . these externally recognizable signs in themselves are not as important to overall morbidity as internal changes , including cardiomegaly and visceromegaly [ 4 , 5 ] . diabetes mellitus occurs in roughly 25% of patients , and cardiomyopathy with arrhythmia , hypertension , and diastolic dysfunction occurs in 30% . additionally , colonic polyps are more frequent , as is sleep apnea which occurs in 60% of patients , presumably secondary to soft tissue expansion and macroglossia . multiple studies through the 1920s to 1990s agreed on a prevalence of roughly 60 per million , a mean age of onset of 44 years , symptoms lasting on average 8 years before diagnosis , and no difference in incidence between men and women . however , more recent studies place the prevalence at 86 per million , 124 per million , and a remarkably high 1034 per million . however , in addition to being geographically and demographically restricted ( primary care patients in germany ) , this last study was based on a biochemical definition of acromegaly ( elevated igf-1 and gh ) rather than a syndrome definition , and therefore will include many patients who would otherwise not seek treatment . such a more liberal definition might be one method of discovering at - risk patients earlier in the course of their disease and permitting more time to mitigate the accruing morbidity .", "surgery is typically the first line of treatment for acromegaly due to pituitary adenomas provided there are no surgical contraindications . residual disease is then managed medically with somatostatin analogues , dopamine agonists , or gh receptor antagonists . most adenomas are resected via the transsphenoidal approach ( transsphenoidal adenomectomy , tsa ) . using either a microscope or endoscope , the surgeon enters the sphenoid sinus transnasally , then penetrates the sella , and finally debulks and removes the tumor , sparing as much of the normal pituitary as possible . for microadenomas ( < 10  mm in diameter ) , tsas lead to correction of gh levels in ~70% of patients . only 50% of patients with macroadenomas achieve normalization . for those patients who do not experience normalization of gh levels after surgery , or who are not surgical candidates , the lar ( long - acting release ) formulation of octreotide uses polymeric microspheres and is injected monthly . lanreotide atg ( autogel ) is the only formulation of lanreotide currently available in the united states and is suspended in aqueous solution in microsyringes for subcutaneous delivery by the patient . the two formulations appear to be equally efficacious and normalize igf - i levels in 5060% of patients [ 1316 ] . somatostatin analogues appear to induce tumor shrinkage in approximately 42% of patients , when data are pooled across studies . interestingly , however , tumor shrinkage appears more pronounced in primarily treated patients ( 52% ) as opposed to patients receiving adjunctive , postsurgical treatment ( 21% ) . dopamine agonists appear to work best in patients whose tumors also secrete prolactin . among dopamine agonists , cabergoline appears to be the most efficacious , resulting in normalization of igf - i levels in 34% of patients . however , no dopamine agonist alone is as effective as a somatostatin analogue , although there might be synergistic effects when used in conjunction with somatostatin analogues [ 2124 ] . pegvisomant is a pegylated growth hormone analogue that is subcutaneously injected by patients . in one study , treatment for 12 months led to normalized igf-1 levels in 97% of patients , and treatment for 24 months led to normalization in 76.3% of patients in a different study . however , the side effects of pegvisomant include transaminitis , lipodystrophy at injection sites , and , most worrisome , possible tumor progression , due to blocking of the normal inhibitory feedback of growth hormone levels of the adenoma [ 2729 ] .", "simply put , resective surgery is a means of removing unwanted tissue from the body . radiosurgery ( rs ) achieves the identical goal but , rather than directly removing cells , induces cell death instead . this cell death can be induced either directly , via necrosis or apoptosis , or indirectly , by damaging the tissue blood supply . when inducing cell death , rs uses ionizing radiation , wherein charged particles or photons strip electrons from atoms and molecules , thereby damaging dna , proteins , and other molecules within cells and in the extracellular matrix . when this damage can not be repaired , cells undergo either apoptosis or necrosis [ 30 , 31 ] . various types of radiosurgery are available , but each works by emitting charged particles or photons . proton beams , for example , generated by particle accelerators and can be used to target structures deep within the cranium . this is due , in part , to the characteristic peak and subsequent drop - off of radiation intensity in proton beams  the bragg peak . the depth of this peak can be modulated and is used to focus the effects of the radiation on particular structures , sparing healthy ones . the drawback to proton therapy , however , is the high cost and relative scarcity of facilities capable of providing therapeutic proton beams . the two major techniques are linear accelerators and radioactive isotopes . linear accelerators , like the cyberknife ( accuray inc . , sunnyvale , ca ) , produce photons which are then aimed toward deep structures within the brain or spine . to limit damage along the path of the beam thus , the target of the beam is constant , always receiving radiation , but the intervening structures are exposed only briefly [ 3032 ] . the gamma knife ( elekta ab , stockholm , sweden ) , developed by lars leksell in 1968 , each source generates a beam of photons as the cobalt decays , and these beams are focused on a central target within the brain through the use of collimators . because each individual beam is weak , intervening tissue is exposed to far less radiation than the central target , which is the common focus of all 201 beams . the gamma knife has been around longer than most linear accelerator radiosurgical devices and is therefore a better - studied tool for use by neurosurgeons , though direct comparisons between the gamma knife and linear accelerators will undoubtedly change the prevailing practices in the future . a large number of small case series have been carried out to evaluate the effects of gamma knife surgery ( gks ) on acromegaly ( table 1 ) . most use remission criterion of a normal igf-1 level and many add the criterion gh < 1 to 2  ng / ml , but it should be noted that remission criteria vary across studies . these criteria are roughly in line with the criteria set forth by the acromegaly consensus group on 2010 ( normal igf-1 and gh < 1  ng / ml ) . also variable between studies is the follow - up time , along with radiation dose , targeting protocol , and , most critically , pre - gks therapy . this last note is particularly important since most series include patients who have already received transsphenoidal surgical resection as an inadequate treatment . unfortunately , the data are not presented in the reviewed papers in such a way as to separate out response rates in patients receiving prior treatment versus those who were treated primarily with gks . overall , however , the results from these studies suggest that gks is an effective treatment for acromegaly . across the 29 studies and 964 cases examined , 43% of patients achieved remission . the time to remission is not reliably reported , but most studies agree that the further out from rs patients are examined , the more likely they are to achieve a cure . for example , vik - mo et al .   showed an increase from 58% of patients with normal igh-1 levels to 86% of patients over the time span of 5 to 10 years after rs . how exactly the effects of rs continue to evolve over such a protracted time is unknown , but consistent with how rs affects other diseases , like epilepsy   and vestibular schwannoma . interestingly , there is some ( still debated ) evidence that the use of antiacromegalic medicines prior to irradiation attenuates the effects of gks . that is , using somatostatin analogues or gh receptor antagonists has been shown in select studies to decrease a patient 's chances of remission [ 3739 ] . though this has not been thoroughly examined , the mechanism is believed to be suppression of tumor cell cycle , thereby making the cells less prone to radiation - induced damage . there does not appear to be a correlation between radiation dose and rates of remission ( figure 1 ) . however , the heterogeneity in study design , follow - up , and definition of remission makes such conclusions fraught . the most common complication of gks for acromegaly is hypopituitarism , presumably from damage to the normal gland during irradiation , ranging from 0 to 43%   ( table 2 ) . however , the degree to which such damage is a pure result of gks versus prior surgery , if done , is unclear . moreover , there is no discernible relationship between radiation dose and the incidence of this complication ( figure 2 ) , though these are very heterogeneous studies and it is possible that better - controlled or larger studies would uncover such relationships if they exist . other complications are inadequately documented but include headache , epilepsy , carotid artery stenosis , and , more frequently , cranial nerve palsies or neuropathies ( including trigeminal neuralgia and visual decline )   ( table 2 ) . the rate of visual disturbances seems to be , in the worst case , 11% [ 40 , 41 ] , though most trials either do not report these adverse events or show them to be on the order of 06% ( table 2 ) . nevertheless , these complications should be viewed in light of the complications inherent to uncontrolled acromegaly or , if being used as an alternative to surgery , the morbidity of an endonasal neurosurgical procedure .", "while surgical resection remains the first line of treatment , stereotactic radiosurgery is proving itself a feasible alternative therapy ( when surgery might be contraindicated ) and adjunct ( when surgical resection is unsuccessful in leading to complete disease remission ) . ultimately , further studies are needed to delineate which patients are most likely to receive benefit from gks , along with ways to improve gks outcomes ."], "summary": "acromegaly is debilitating disease occasionally refractory to surgical and medical treatment . stereotactic radiosurgery , and in particular gamma knife surgery ( gks ) , has proven to be an effective noninvasive adjunct to traditional treatments , leading to disease remission in a substantial proportion of patients . such remission holds the promise of eliminating the need for expensive medications , along with side effects , as well as sparing patients the damaging sequelae of uncontrolled acromegaly . numerous studies of radiosurgical treatments for acromegaly have been carried out . these illustrate an overall remission rate over 40% . morbidity from radiosurgery is infrequent but can include cranial nerve palsies and hypopituitarism . overall , stereotactic radiosurgery is a promising therapy for patients with acromegaly and deserves further study to refine its role in the treatment of affected patients .", "ranking": [0, 2, 4, 1, 3]}

based padma 28 preparations exhibited evident antibacterial effects against gram - positive bacteria and klebsiella pneumonia in vitro . from 20 herbs present in padma , 13 have well - documented antimicrobial activity . this herb also presents anti - inflammatory and immunotropic activity , enhancing th2 and suppressing th1 cytokine release by lymphocytes . recently , chemopreventive effects of cardamom on chemically induced skin carcinogenesis in mice were described . sida cordifolia , known for its regenerating properties , is active against corynebacterium diphtheria and in combination with nystatin and clotrimazole exhibited antimicrobial effects against five candida strains . terpenoid eugenol present in syzygium aromaticum expresses general antimicrobial effect ; phenolic alcohol from glycyrrhiza glabra was active against mycobacterium tuberculosis , staphylococcus aureus , and plasmodium [ 2 , 49 ] . recently , anti - influenza viral effects of nuclear export inhibitors from valerianae radix were described . another padma 28 component , saussurea lappa root , and its active principle dehydrocostus lactone inhibit prostate cancer cell migration in vitro and have been shown to have anticancer activity . santamarin , a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from this herb , represses lps - induced inflammatory response in murine macrophages and potently inhibits the growth of trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense [ 1115 ] . the plant possesses multiple activities , among them , antioxidant , antimicrobial , anti - inflammatory , and wound healing activities . some immunotropic activities of padma 28 and beneficial effect of this remedy in experimental models of inflammation and wound healing were reported [ 1724 ] . in humans , padma 28 has been used as a beneficial tonic for heart and blood vessels and as an antioxidant . padma 28 has been registered in switzerland since 1977 by intercantonal office for the control of medicines as a remedy to alleviate symptoms of claudication , impaired peripheral circulation , pain on walking , leg cramps , and paresthesia . a profitable influence of padma 28 was also observed in patients with atherosclerosis and in patients with multiple sclerosis [ 25 , 26 ] . in 1992 , its efficacy was further proved in prophylactics and treatment of some disorders with inflammatory , sclerotic , and degenerative origins . treatment of chronic infective pulmonary diseases studied in poland in a big group of children with padma has brought positive results [ 27 , 28 ] . however , as padma is being used for a variety of diseases and usually for a long time ( e.g. , couple of weeks ) and because it possesses strong antioxidative properties , it would affect various parameters of immune system , among them , oxidative burst of granulocytes . in fact , some authors reported that this remedy inhibited the respiratory burst of human neutrophils in vitro [ 29 , 30 ] . that is why we decided to evaluate in the present study , on the experimental model in mice , the in vivo effect of padma 28 ( in high dose , comparable to that recommended for humans , and in low dose , comparable to these which we used previously in studies of various other herbal extracts ) on immunological angiogenesis and , simultaneously , on granulocytes metabolic activity evaluated by chemiluminescence . this test is widely accepted as a method of measuring granulocytes oxygen - dependent killing potential . it is important to know if selected doses of this remedy do not disturb granulocytes activity and stimulate immunological angiogenesis and , accordingly , could be used as a safe drug for therapeutic angiogenesis in vascular and immune system disturbances .", "padma 28 tablets ( batch 28/6311 , padma ag , suisse ) , herbal mixture consisting of 22 ingredients : aegle marmelos fruit ( 20  mg ) , pimenta dioica fruit ( 25  mg ) , aquilegia vulgaris aerial part ( 15  mg ) , calendula officinalis flower ( 5  mg ) , elettaria cardamomum fruit ( 30  mg ) , syzygium aromaticum flower bud ( 12  mg ) , saussurea lappa root ( 40  mg ) , hedychium spicatum rhizome ( 10  mg ) , lactuca sativa leaf ( 6  mg ) , cetraria islandica thallus ( 40  mg ) , glycyrrhiza glabra root ( 15  mg ) , azadirachta indica fruit ( 35  mg ) , terminalia chebula fruit ( 30  mg ) , plantago lanceolata aerial part ( 15  mg ) , polygonum aviculare aerial part ( 15  mg ) , potentilla aurea aerial part ( 15  mg ) , pterocarpus santalinus wood ( 30  mg ) , sida cordifolia aerial part ( 10  mg ) , aconitum napellus tuber ( 1  mg ) , valeriana officinalis root ( 10  mg ) , camphor ( 4  mg ) , and calcium sulfate ( 20  mg ) . the study was performed on 48 female inbred balb / c mice 68 weeks old , weighing about 20  g , and on 24 female f1 hybrids ( balb / c  c3h ) , 6 weeks old , delivered from the polish academy of sciences breeding colony . padma 28 was administered to mice per os in daily doses 5.8  mg or 0,085  mg . higher dose was calculated according to the highest daily dose ( 6 tablets ) , recommended for humans ( applying the factor 7 for differences between mouse and human in relation to the surface to body mass ) . lower dose conforms to the range of active doses of other herbal extracts and their polyphenolic compounds used in our previous experiments [ 3135 ] . balb / c mice were fed with padma ( 5.8  mg or 0.085  mg ) by eppendorf pipette , in 40  l of water or 40  l of water ( controls ) , for 7 days , then bled in anaesthesia ( ketamine 100  mg / kg and xylazine 10  mg / kg , biowet , pulawy , poland ) and sacrificed by cervical dislocation . splenocytes were isolated from spleens of balb / c donors under sterile conditions by straining through stainless sieve and cotton gauze and centrifugation on histopaque 1077 ( sigma -

aldrich , usa ; 0.1  ml per 10  g of body mass ) . both flanks of each mouse were finely shaved with a razor blade ; each flank was injected with cells 2 - 3 times . cell suspensions were supplemented with 0.05  ml / ml of 0.01% trypan blue in order to facilitate recognition of injection sites later on . grafted balb / c splenic lymphocytes recognized c3h antigens and produced many immunological mediators including proangiogenic factors ( immunological angiogenesis ) . in this test , the number of newly formed blood vessels was the measure of  t - cell reactivity . after 72 hours the mice were treated with a lethal dose of morbital ( biowet , puawy , poland ) . all newly formed blood vessels were identified and counted in dissection microscope on the inner skin surface , using criteria suggested by the authors of the method , at magnification of 6x , in 1/3 central area of microscopic field . identification was based on the fact that new blood vessels , directed to the point of cells injection , are thin and differ from the background vasculature in their tortuosity and divarications . experiment was performed twice ( 24 balb / c mice and 24 f1 hybrids as a total ) . balb / c mice were fed with padma ( 5.8  mg or 0.085  mg ) by eppendorf pipette , in 40  l of water or 40  l of water ( controls ) , for 7 days , then bled in anaesthesia ( ketamine 100  mg / kg and xylazine 10  mg / kg , biowet pulawy , poland ) from retroorbital plexus and sacrificed by cervical dislocation . cl was measured using the method of easmon et al .   with some modifications [ 3840 ] at room temperature , in scintillation counter ( rackbeta 1218 , lkb , sweden ) . briefly , samples of 0.05  ml of heparinised blood were diluted 1  :  4 with phosphate buffered saline ( pbs , biomed lublin , poland ) and supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin ( bsa , sigma - aldrich , usa ) and 0.1% glucose ( polfa , poland ) . next , 0.05  ml of this diluted blood was mixed with 0.2  ml of luminol ( sigma - aldrich , usa ) solution ( 10 m ) in pbs and placed in a scintillation counter in the  out of coincidence  then , the cells were activated by the addition of 0.02  ml solution of opsonized zymosan ( 10  mg / ml , serva , usa ) , and chemiluminescence activity was measured for the next 15  min . counting of leukocytes and blood smears examination were performed by routine methods , and the results were shown as the maximum value of chemiluminescence ( cpm ) obtained for 10 granulocytes . for all experiments , animals were handled according to the polish law on the protection of animals and nih standards . all experiments were accepted by the local ethical committee .   statistical evaluation of the results was performed by one - way anova , and the significance of differences between the groups was verified with a bonferroni multiple comparison post test ( graph pad prism software package ) .", "the effect of padma 28 ( 0.085 or 5.8  mg ) supplementation of balb / c donors on the angiogenic ability of their splenic lymphocytes to induce newly formed blood vessels in the skin of f1 ( balb / c  c3h ) recipient mice is presented in figure 1 . according to one -

term clinical outcome .", "a systematic review of the literature was performed using pubmed and the bibliographies of reviewed articles . the medical records of six patients admitted to the university of utah health sciences center between 2001 and 2011 were reviewed retrospectively . clinical presentation , radiographic studies , treatment , histopathological confirmation , outcome , and prognosis were recorded ( table 1 ) .", "a 77-year - old man with known prostate cancer presented with a four - month history of left retro - orbital pain followed by left eye ptosis . at presentation , he had complete left third nerve palsy .   his visual acuity was intact in both eyes , with full visual fields to confrontation .   brain magnetic resonance ( mr ) imaging ( figure 1 ) showed a heterogeneously enhancing mass lesion that measured 29  17  29  mm involving the sella , with invasion of the left cavernous sinus and the upper clivus .   the lesion extended to the inferior orbital fissure and was centered in the sella turcica and the cavernous sinus . he subsequently underwent chemotherapy and focused radiation to the sellar region and was noted to have stable neurological examination findings two months after surgery , with no change in his ophthalmoplegia . an 82-year - old woman with known history of breast cancer presented with several weeks ' complaint of progressive left - sided hearing loss as well as facial pain and numbness in the first and the second divisions of the trigeminal nerve , respectively . on neurological examination , left - sided hearing loss and facial numbness along the v1 and v2 distributions were confirmed . mr imaging showed evidence of a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left petrous apex that extended to involve meckel 's cave , the lateral cavernous sinus , and the internal auditory canal ( figure 2 ) . she was discharged home on postoperative day three in stable condition for followup with oncology . a 79-year - old man with known history of prostate cancer presented with several weeks ' history of progressively worsening double vision and eventual right eye ptosis .   mr imaging disclosed an enhancing soft tissue mass involving the clivus , pituitary fossa , cavernous sinus , and posterior nasal cavity ( figure 3 ) that surrounded both internal carotid arteries in the cavernous sinuses . an endonasal transsphenoidal approach to the sphenoid sinus was carried out to obtain a biopsy of the lesion .   a histopathological diagnosis of metastatic melanoma was made , and evaluation was undertaken by the oncology team .   ) a 21-year - old man with a remote history of osteosarcoma and newly diagnosed metastatic renal cell carcinoma had complaints of worsening vision and facial pain . because there was a discrepancy in the pupillary size between his eyes , he underwent a computed tomography ( ct ) scan of the head , followed by craniofacial mr imaging , which revealed an enhancing mass in the right sphenoid sinus with adjacent extension . on neurological examination , he was noted to have complete hemifacial numbness and horner 's syndrome on the right side .   mr imaging of the face demonstrated a homogeneously contrast - enhancing lesion centered within the right sphenoid sinus measuring 33  20  27  mm ( figure 4 ) .    the lesion extended into the carotid canal , pterygopalatine fossa , and optic nerve canal with destruction of the vidian canal and foramen rotundum on the right . a 42-year - old woman with several weeks of frontal headaches initially presumed to be secondary to a sinus infection underwent mr imaging after antibiotic medications failed to alleviate her symptoms . brain mr imaging demonstrated a lobulated , 25  20-mm sellar and suprasellar lesion with extension into the right cavernous sinus and encasement of the right internal carotid artery . this lesion was isointense on t1- and t2-weighted images and heterogeneously enhancing with gadolinium administration .   a ct scan was consistent with a lytic lesion involving the central skull base extending laterally and posteriorly to involve the bilateral medial sphenoid wings and the clivus , respectively . histopathologic evaluation was consistent with a diagnosis of diffuse large b - cell lymphoma ( figure 5 ) . a 53-year - old woman presented with a known diagnosis of breast cancer and a one - year history of worsening left eye vision with a more precipitous decline in the last month . mr imaging of the brain demonstrated a skull base lesion involving the left sphenoid bone , the anterior clinoidal process , and the cavernous sinus .   on neurological assessment , the patient was noted to have an acutely diminished visual acuity in her left eye to a level of finger counting with left temporal visual field cut .   mr imaging ( not shown ) showed a homogenously contrast - enhancing lesion of the skull base involving the greater sphenoid wing and the anterior clinoidal process with encasement of the optic nerve on the left .   a left frontotemporal craniotomy was performed for biopsy of the lesion and to decompress the optic nerve and the cavernous sinus with a subtotal resection . one year after surgery , her neurological findings were unchanged , and her systemic disease was under control .", "neoplasms originating from a multitude of sites have been reported to metastasize to the sps region . breast and lung cancer account for approximately two - thirds of sps metastases , being the most common sources in women and men , respectively , [ 11 , 1821 ] . histological examinations of the tissue samples obtained during palliative hypophysectomy performed in patients with end - stage breast cancer and from autopsy series have documented metastasis to the sps region in 6% to 29% of cases [ 3 , 2225 ] . one hypothesis put forth to explain this prevalence is that the prolactin - rich environment of the pituitary enhances the proliferation of breast tumor cells . after carcinoma of breast and lung , lymphoma and prostate cancer have been reported to be the most common sources of metastasis to sps region .   liver , renal cell , colon , and thyroid cancers and melanoma are rare sources of distant metastases to this region . the relatively rarer occurrence of our other cases , prostate , melanoma , renal cell , and lymphoma , is consistent with the literature . most cases are found in the sixth or the seventh decade of life as a part of a generalized metastatic spread , commonly associated with multiple , particularly osseous metastases [ 18 , 20 ] ; however , metastases can occur in young patients . the age of presentation ranged from 21 to 82 years in our small series , with an average age of 60 years . very occasionally , these lesions are the first manifestation of an occult cancer or the only site of metastasis [ 14 , 20 ] . thus , in a patient without any prior history of cancer , an sps lesion can not be assumed to be an adenoma , just as in a patient with a known primary cancer , it is not always metastatic . clinically , metastasis is generally suspected in patients with rapid onset and progressive symptoms , irrespective of a history of malignancy .   the possible metastatic pathways to the pituitary and parasellar region include direct blood - borne metastasis to the posterior pituitary lobe , pituitary stalk , clivus , dorsum sellae , or cavernous sinus or leptomeningeal spread with involvement of the pituitary capsule [ 10 , 26 , 27 ] . there has been some controversy regarding the most common location of metastasis within the pituitary gland . authors of early series have reported that the majority of pituitary metastasis occurs in the posterior pituitary , but some dispute this claim . teears and silverman   reported that 57% of the lesions localized to the posterior pituitary alone , 13% to the anterior pituitary alone , 12% to both lobes , and the remaining 18% to the capsule or stalk . they hypothesized that the posterior pituitary , by receiving direct arterial supply , is more likely to develop metastases than the adenohypophysis , which receives its blood supply from the hypophyseal portal system . the posterior lobe has a larger area of contact with the adjacent dura , which may be another contributing factor [ 4 , 18 ] . metastatic inoculation in the anterior lobe is usually the result of contiguous spread from the posterior lobe .   these may be isolated , such as diplopia or ptosis , with the third ( oculomotor ) and the sixth ( abducens ) nerves being the most commonly involved , followed by the fourth ( trochlear ) nerve [ 14 , 2931 ] , or they may appear in a constellation of symptoms characterized by unilateral , rapidly progressive ophthalmoplegia with retroorbital pain . this latter presentation is the usual presentation of the cavernous sinus syndrome , also known as parasellar syndrome . if the branches of the trigeminal nerve are affected , alteration in the facial sensation , facial pain , or dysesthesia occurs . headache has been reported as a rather common symptom , with an incidence as high as 70% [ 14 , 34 , 35 ] ; however , the majority of pituitary metastases are clinically silent . in the autopsy study by teears and silverman , these metastases are often seen in patients with terminal malignancy who present with malaise , generalized pain , central nervous system involvement , or treatment - associated symptoms , although symptoms of pituitary insufficiency may be masked . several studies have indicated that diabetes insipidus ( di ) was the most common symptom [ 10 , 20 , 24 , 36 , 37 ] . in the series of mccormick et al . , di developed in 70% of patients ; however , if the anterior pituitary function is compromised , di may be concealed by reduced mineralocorticoid function . in some recent series , di has not been reported , which is likely because modern imaging techniques are able to detect abnormalities earlier than the timeframe required for di development . other rarer hormonal findings may be hypothyroidism and hypoadrenalism , hypogonadism , or overproduction of adrenocorticotropic hormone ( acth ) , growth hormone ( gh ) , or prolactin [ 10 , 3840 ] .   because of their invasiveness , pituitary metastatic lesions have a high potential to cause visual deficits from suprasellar extension , with an incidence as high as 50% reported by branch jr . and laws jr .   and others [ 10 , 34 , 41 ] . in both the series by chiang et al .   and that of sioutos et al cranial nerve palsies involving the third and the sixth nerves and facial pain with numbness ( trigeminal origin ) were the most common presentation ( 33% ) in our cases with cavernous sinus involvement . retro - orbital pain , vision compromise , gait instability , horner 's syndrome , and hearing loss were infrequent and associated with petroclival and sphenoorbital extension of the lesions . all these symptoms were experienced with a relatively rapid onset from a few weeks to a few months that suggested the aggressive character of the lesions . symptoms strongly suggesting metastasis in the parasellar or sellar space include painful ophthalmoplegia in association with the sudden onset of di [ 10 , 26 , 34 , 42 ] . the pain may be retro - orbital or may be due to trigeminal dysfunction [ 4345 ] . in our series , 5 of the 6 ( 83% ) patients had a previous history of malignant disease . one of the patients that had prior history developed a malignancy ( melanoma ) other than the original one . only one patient without a prior history of malignancy first presented with lymphoma metastasis to the sps region . because pituitary adenomas also present with invasion of the sellar floor , cavernous sinus , or clivus , no specific neuroimaging criteria to define metastatic lesions in sps region have been reported . the diagnostic imaging tools for sps metastasis mainly include high - resolution ct and mr imaging . although ct is superior to mr imaging in detecting the bone involvement , the latter is preferable to determine the relationship of the lesion to the surrounding neurovascular structures .   although nonspecific , the characteristics of these lesions on mr imaging are an iso- or hypointense mass on t1-weighted imaging with a usually hyperintense signal on t2-weighted imaging , and homogeneously enhancing mass in images obtained after the administration of contrast agent . invasion of the cavernous sinus , sclerotic changes around the sella turcica and clivus , isointense signal on both t1- and t2-weighted imaging , and loss of high - intensity signal in the posterior pituitary have been reported to be helpful in differentiating metastatic lesions from benign   ones [ 15 , 30 , 48 ] . .   found that thickening or enhancement of the infundibulum was the most characteristic ct or mr imaging feature . schubiger and halter   reported that the invasion of the infundibular recess by a suprasellar mass is suggestive of metastasis . because of the rapid growth of metastatic lesions , a dumbbell - shaped intra- and suprasellar tumor with indentation at the diaphragm level is generally indicative for these cases [ 20 , 37 , 49 ] . the radiodiagnostic findings that suggested a malignant / metastatic process in our cases were the involvement of multiple compartments in the anterior , middle , posterior cranial fossae , extension to the infratemporal and pterygopalatine fossae , sphenoid sinus , and nasal cavity with bony destruction in the cranial base and asymmetric or bilateral invasion into the cavernous sinus . the management of sps metastases is multimodal , including surgical resection , radiation therapy , and chemotherapy . treatment is mainly palliative and depends on the symptoms and the extent of systemic disease [ 10 , 51 ] . because of the invasiveness and the high vascularity of the tumor , total surgical resection is generally not undertaken [ 1 , 20 ] . therefore , surgical treatment should aim for symptomatic relief and the preservation of visual function , even in patients with widespread primary disease , and should be followed by local radiation treatment and/or chemotherapy [ 10 , 51 ] . the body of evidence is inconclusive on the effect of the latter two modalities on survival [ 14 , 52 ] . laws jr .   reported improvement in symptoms , especially in pain and visual field defects , with no difference in survival after complete resection compared with subtotal or partial resection [ 10 , 14 ] . on the other hand , others have supported the concept of improvement in survival after surgical resection of the lesion [ 5355 ] . surgical exploration is also essential if tissue diagnosis is likely to affect therapy in patients with no known primary malignancy . resection is most commonly done via transsphenoidal route , although subfrontal or pterional approaches are also options depending on the location and the extension of the lesion . four out of six patients in our series underwent surgical biopsy through either transsphenoidal or transcranial route and then underwent subsequent radiation / chemotherapy . one patient who had visual compromise had subtotal resection for palliation followed by radiation / chemotherapy . one patient who had renal cell carcinoma was directly referred to radiation oncology for immediate radiation and subsequent chemotherapy . besides its role as an adjunct after surgery [ 14 , 42 , 56 ] , radiosurgery or conventional radiation is recommended as the initial course of treatment in patients with systemic disease out of control , recurrence in the systemic disease with concomitant sps metastasis , or medical comorbidities that put the patient at risk for a surgical intervention [ 2 , 7 , 18 , 41 , 5762 ] . radiosurgery , which is considered less invasive than conventional radiation , has been reported to achieve good tumor control [ 63 , 64 ] . in a series of 23 patients by iwai et al . , the rates of tumor control and symptom improvement were 67% and 53% , respectively ; however , radiosurgery to the sps region is limited by its potential to cause radiation injury to the surrounding neurovascular structures such as optic apparatus , pituitary gland , or cranial nerves coursing in cavernous sinus . doses reported in the literature for these structures range from 8 to 40 gy [ 63 , 6568 ] , and the optimal dose may be quite variable depending on the proximity of the lesion . furthermore , the debate about whether the radiation should be directed to the sps region alone or to the entire brain continues . chemotherapy is commonly used alone or along with radiation therapy mostly for palliation in the treatment of metastatic disease in sps region . its value has not been adequately studied and reported in the literature .   the prognosis of patients with metastases to the sps region is grim in a majority of cases because of the aggressive character of the primary disease . even in patients with no other metastasis at the initial evaluation , the prognosis remains poor because of radiologically undetectable microscopic metastases ; however , it has been suggested that the extent of systemic disease affects survival in these patients . patients with a single sps region metastasis may have a better outcome [ 10 , 20 ] . median survival is less than 2 years independent of the management strategy [ 10 , 14 , 70 ] .    the records on the long - term follow - up of the majority of our patients are lacking because the patients were not monitored for surgical outcome , or the follow - up periods were too short .   the only patient that had palliative surgery for vision compromise was seen at one year after the surgery with stable neurological findings .", "suggestive symptoms include rapid onset of progressive ophthalmoplegia with retro - orbital or facial pain , visual impairment , and/or di . management varies depending on whether a primary source is identified , the symptomatology , the location and extent of the lesion , the stage of the primary disease , and the medical comorbidities . subtotal or partial surgical resection is aimed mainly for symptom relief . a multimodal approach involving subtotal resection of the lesion followed by radiation and/or chemotherapy is widely accepted , especially in symptomatic patients whose primary disease is under control . radiation with or without chemotherapy is generally recommended as first - line treatment in patients with advanced primary disease or in those with high - risk medical comorbidities . a biopsy usually precedes radiation therapy if the primary source of the metastasis is unknown . the prognosis for patients is generally poor , independent of the therapeutic modality , and the overall survival is less than two years ."], "summary": "the sellar and parasellar ( sps ) region is a complex area rich in vital neurovascular structures and as such may be the location of first manifestation of a systemic malignancy . metastases to this region are rare ; breast cancer is the most common source among those that metastasize to the sps region . ophthalmoplegia , headache , retroorbital or facial pain , diabetes insipidus , and visual field defects are the most commonly reported symptoms . lack of specific clinical and radiological features renders sps metastases difficult to differentiate from the other frequently encountered lesions in this area , especially when there is no known history of a primary disease . currently accepted management is multimodality therapy that includes biopsy and/or palliative surgical resection , radiation , and chemotherapy . although no significant survival benefits have been shown by the surgical series , surgical resection may improve quality of life . here we review the relevant literature and present six illustrative cases from our own institution .", "ranking": [0, 2, 4, 3, 1]}

Conclusion"], "document": ["periodontitis ( pd ) is a chronic inflammatory disease where resident cells and preformed mediators induce leukocyte infiltration and progressive destruction of the tooth supporting tissues as a result of interaction between bacterial products , cell populations , and mediators in disease - susceptible individuals [ 1 , 2 ] . this is also influenced by genetic and environmental risk factors and is characterized as a complex disease with multifactorial etiology [ 3 , 4 ] . in this context , environmental factors , including oral hygiene / bacterial plaque , smoking , and stress , play an important role in the expression of pd . furthermore , it has been evidenced by some authors that there is a joint influence of polymorphisms in multiple genes , such as the genes of il-10   and il-6 . polymorphonuclear neutrophils ( pmns ) represent the first line of defense to protect the host from periodontal pathogens in the gingival sulcus and junctional epithelium . pmns are a critical arm of defense against periodontitis , but bacterial evasion of the neutrophil microbicidal machinery coupled with delayed neutrophil apoptosis may transform the neutrophil from defender to perpetrator . actually , these cells can release a variety of factors , such as reactive oxygen species , collagenases , and other proteases , [ 1 , 9 ] , such as stimulation from a wide range of cytokines . in this scenario , macrophages can act as antigen - presenting cells , promoting the activation of lymphocytes . therefore , the cellular concentration of neutrophils in the inflammatory infiltrates decreases during the transition between gingivitis and periodontitis , in which there is a predominance of lymphocytes . it has been described that proinflammatory cytokines , prostaglandin e2 , matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp ) , nitric oxide ( no ) , and other inflammatory mediators play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of pd [ 1012 ] . moreover , an increase of tnf- , il-1 , il-6 , il-11 , and il-17 can induce osteoclastogenesis by increasing the expression of receptor activator of nf-b ligand ( rankl ) and by reducing the osteoprotegerin ( opg ) production in osteoblasts and stromal cells . in fact , it was demonstrated that il-17 and rankl were overregulated and il-10 , an anti - inflammatory cytokine , and tgf-1 were downregulated in active periodontal lesions compared with inactive lesions [ 14 , 15 ] ( figure 1(a ) ) . considering that an imbalance between bone formation and resorption is also linked to various diseases , studies suggest that pd may be a risk factor for other diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) , but without consensus . although pathogenesis of ra is not completely understood , it is recognized that the activation of the complement system is important in disease development , the abnormal response of circulating lymphocytes from patients , and an alteration in the structure of these cells , which contribute to the autoimmunity , immunosuppression , and the genesis of the disease . studies report there is a correlation between both pd and ra since the mechanisms for the development of ra have consonance with the pathogenesis of chronic pd . in fact , ra is defined as an inflammatory and autoimmune disease characterized by accumulation of leukocyte inflammatory infiltrate in the synovial membrane , as well as mediators such as pge2 , tnf- , il-1 , il-6 , il-12 , il-17 , il-18 , il-33 , granulocyte macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( gm - csf ) , monocyte colony - stimulating factor ( m - csf ) , rankl , mmps , and no , all being found in the synovial fluid [ 2024 ] , and leading to synovitis and joint architecture destruction . some studies have suggested that the susceptibility of ra may be associated with genetic or environmental factors . one of the most important genetic factors is the human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) class ii . certain alleles of this antigen are often associated with the development of rheumatoid arthritis ( hla - drb10101 , hla - drb10102 , hla - drb10401 , hla - drb10404 , hla - drb10405 , hla - drb10408 , hla - drb10410 , hla - drb11001 , and hla - drb11402 ) . other factors include the allele of 620w of ptpn22 ( protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 ) , a gene encoding tyrosine phosphatase that is involved in controlling the intracellular signaling triggered through t and b receptors ; c5-traf1 , which can interfere with disease susceptibility and severity of the alteration in the structure , function , and levels of complement component c5/factor 1 associated with the tnf receptor ; gene encoding the ctla4 ( cytotoxic t lymphocyte antigen-4 ) , the protein responsible for the regulation of t lymphocyte activation ; peptidylarginine deiminase ( pad2 ) , the enzyme responsible for the generation of citrullinated proteins , which are related to the formation of anticyclic citrullinated peptide autoantibodies   ( figure 1(b ) ) . with regard to environmental factors , smoking is a risk factor that duplicates the risk of developing ra , but its effect is limited to those with antibodies to citrullinated peptides [ 30 , 31 ] . other factors refer to the excessive consumption of coffee ( more than 10 cups daily ) which can be related to the development of the disease   and bacterial microbiota , including oral bacterial species which can participate in the etiopathogenesis of ra . on the other hand , the intake of alcohol may exert a protective effect in rheumatoid arthritis in a dose - dependent manner . the literature shows that the basic difference between both diseases is that ra is an inflammatory autoimmune disease , while pd is an immunoinflammatory disease of bacterial origin . however , it is noteworthy that many epidemiological studies seem to dilute the subtle differences expressed by some parameters , though clinically important . indeed , analyses of inflammatory mediators and other molecular markers are examples where the differences found in a trial with few participants could disappear in a large and diverse sample . in this sense , this review is a critical appraisal of studies that address potential associations of periodontitis with ra and with an overall comprehensive approach .", "for this review , the us national library of medicine national institutes of health pubmed was searched by two independent researchers who agreed with the search criteria of studies with patients with both pd and ra and checked by a third researcher separately . the keywords periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis were used and 367 articles published in english were found . the time period was limited from january 2012 to march 2015 , and 162 references were found . then , a critical reading based on titles and abstracts was made and 136 papers were excluded , such as reviews , assays in vitro and animal studies , articles that were not in english , studies not related to both pd and ra , case study , workshop , or unavailable and incomplete articles . then , 26 articles were finally included for this review , which related to pd and ra , considering epidemiological aspects , mechanical periodontal treatment , mediators of inflammation , oral microbiota , and antibodies as seen in figure 2 .", "table 1 shows demographic data , such as gender , age and habits , comorbidities and medications , and the relationship between both diseases investigated through clinical and epidemiological associations , presence of oral bacterial dna in patients with ra , proinflammatory mediators , antibodies against bacteria , and autoantibodies , as well as the effects of mechanical periodontal treatment , related to the 26 selected articles . in most articles ( 92.3% ) , the analyzed groups were mainly composed of women . regarding age , most patients were 40 years old , except for the study of dev et al . ( 2013 )   and ranade and doiphode ( 2012 ) , whose patients were above 20 and 30 years old , respectively . among the 26 articles , 57.7% [ 3436 , 38 , 39 , 42 , 5057 , 59 ] used samples with smoker patients , while 30.8% established smoking as criteria for excluding [ 37 , 41 , 43 , 4549 ] . 11.5% did not mention smoking status of patients [ 40 , 44 , 58 ] . comorbidities such as diabetes , sjgren 's syndrome , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , hyperlipidemia , renal disease , and osteoporosis / osteopenia have only been reported in studies of mikuls et al . 50% [ 3537 , 40 , 41 , 44 , 45 , 49 , 50 , 52 , 53 , 55 , 58 ] of the articles did not specify the pharmacological treatment . in the remainder of the studies , the most frequently reported treatment for rheumatoid arthritis included disease - modifying antirheumatic drugs ( methotrexate , sulfasalazine , and leflunomide ) [ 38 , 39 , 42 , 43 , 46 , 51 , 54 , 56 , 57 , 59 ] , biologic therapy ( anti - tnf- ) [ 34 , 38 , 39 , 42 , 59 ] , corticosteroids ( prednisolone ) [ 38 , 42 , 43 , 46 , 51 , 54 , 56 , 59 ] , and/or nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs [ 43 , 4648 , 51 , 54 , 57 ] . among the selected trials , eight studies broached the epidemiological and clinical relationship of patients with pd and ra [ 38 , 41 , 44 , 45 , 49 , 54 , 56 , 59 ] , indicating a higher prevalence of pd in patients with ra , which have worse periodontal parameters . the effect of mechanical removal of foci of infection in the oral cavity on the severity of ra and periodontal clinical parameters were shown by four studies [ 37 , 42 , 46 , 51 ] , which demonstrated the beneficial effects of the mechanical treatment in the improvement of clinical parameters of ra . two studies were related to the oral bacteria influence of the pathogenesis of ra [ 40 , 52 ] . seven trials highlighted the presence of citrullinated proteins and their antibodies , antibodies to p. gingivalis in patients with ra and periodontitis , and also the association between anti - p . gingivalis and periodontal parameters , and the titers of rheumatoid factor and antibodies anticyclic citrullinated peptide , which were also related to the severity of pd [ 35 , 36 , 39 , 50 , 53 , 55 , 57 ] . regarding the inflammation in both diseases , five trials considered the mediators of inflammation to the pd and ra [ 34 , 43 , 47 , 48 , 58 ] , such as mmp-9 , tnf- , il-17 , rankl , and opg . considering the relationship between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis , only two articles showed no statistical significant association , while 24 studies have established this association , either by descriptive ( 3 studies ) or statistical analysis ( 21 studies ) .", "in this review , demographic data and other aspects that can modify one or both diseases were presented , as well as the relationship between both diseases investigated through clinical and epidemiological associations , effects of mechanical periodontal treatment , presence of oral bacterial dna in patients with ra , proinflammatory mediators , antibodies against bacteria , and autoantibodies . this aspect was interesting , as a possible relationship between female sex hormones and susceptibility of rheumatoid arthritis had been reported in the literature , so that low levels of those hormones at menopause promote the risk of developing the disease early . however , a protective role of oral contraceptives on the risk for rheumatoid arthritis in women is still controversial [ 6163 ] . on the other hand , there is strong evidence that estrogen deficiency influences the severity of periodontitis , since worse periodontal parameters were observed as bleeding on probing , gingival recession , and clinical attachment loss in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis . cigarette smoking is considered an important risk factor for the development of rheumatoid arthritis , since it was demonstrated that lifelong cigarette smoking was positively associated with the risk of ra even among smokers with a low lifelong exposure . moreover , it has been related that smoking interacts with hla - dr se genes and increases the risk of anti - ccp antibodies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis . regarding the periodontium , it was shown that smokers presented greater probing depths , when compared to the probing depths of patients who never smoked . the literature shows that pd does not usually require pharmacological treatment , except for mechanical periodontal treatment as routine . in this review , this fact was also observed , while half of the studies had shown that rheumatoid arthritis involved some pharmacological approach . the use of disease - modifying antirheumatic drugs ( dmards ) aims to reverse the symptoms of the disease , reduce the progression of joint damage , and consequently improve the quality of life of patients . the conventional synthetic dmards include methotrexate , sulfasalazine , and leflunomide ; the available tumor necrosis factor inhibitors ( adalimumab , etanercept , and infliximab ) , the t cell costimulation inhibitor ( abatacept ) , the anti - b cell agent ( rituximab ) , and the interleukin-6 receptor blocking monoclonal antibody are included in biological dmards . these medications may be associated with glucocorticoids ( gc ) or nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) . the long - term , low - dose glucocorticoid and nsaids therapy were shown to reduce joint symptoms , pain , and other systemic manifestations [ 70 , 71 ] . although these benefits are present , the long - time treatment with gc and methotrexate decreased immune response and promoted oral changes , such as candidiasis , periodontitis , and oral ulceration besides impaired saliva secretion . indeed the literature demonstrated that patients on corticosteroids exhibited higher levels of candidiasis , clinical attachment loss , and probing pocket depth . these aspects , at least in part , may contribute to the worse periodontal status of ra patients when compared to healthy patients . moreover , the use of medications referred to in half of the articles could compromise the evaluation of this review . however , it is noteworthy that the other half of the articles did not use any medication [ 3537 , 40 , 41 , 44 , 45 , 49 , 50 , 52 , 53 , 55 , 58 ] . analysing the articles , it was observed that most patients with ra showed a significant increase in the incidence of pd as compared to healthy individuals , while only few articles concluded the opposite , probably due to the lack of standardization of parameters in evaluating the different types of periodontitis . although epidemiological studies outlined by dev et al . ( 2013 )   have not observed a significant ra incidence in subjects with periodontitis where these authors suggested that periodontitis is an independent factor for ra , several other studies have shown that patients with ra were more susceptible to the development of periodontitis [ 38 , 44 ] , since these patients had worse periodontal parameters , such as clinical attachment level [ 37 , 56 ] , alveolar bone loss [ 56 , 59 ] , probing depth [ 37 , 49 ] , plaque index , and bleeding on probing [ 37 , 41 , 54 ] . indeed , the mechanical periodontal treatment as scaling and root planning in the control of periodontal infection interfered not only with the severity of ra but also with the periodontal clinical parameters . this result can be explained by a reduction in the foci of oral bacteria , and therefore the low levels of inflammation demonstrated a decrease of das28 ( disease activity score in 28 joints ) and serum levels of il-1 , tnf- , c - reactive protein , and erythrocyte rate sedimentation [ 37 , 42 , 46 , 51 ] . in this sense , studies have defended the hypothesis that oral infections play an important role in the pathogenesis of ra , promoting the citrullination of proteins , which can be based on the detection of bacterial dna using the techniques of dna isolation ( pcr and dna - dna hybridization ) and high titers of antibodies against bacteria in synovial fluid and serum samples from patients with ra [ 40 , 51 , 52 ] . most of the studies have shown the presence of oral bacteria in patients with ra , highlighting p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum [ 40 , 52 ] . markedly , p. gingivalis is the most elucidated in the development of ra , and studies using animal models have demonstrated the potential of this proinflammatory bacterium promoting the development of experimental arthritis and increased serum levels of c - reactive protein , tnf- , il-1 , il-17 , mmp-13 , and rankl . furthermore , ra is an autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibodies specific for citrullinated peptide antigen ( anticyclic citrullinated peptide ) , which are synthetized by peptidylarginine deiminase and characterized as the most specific markers for the diagnosis of the disease [ 76 , 77 ] . considering that the p. gingivalis is regarded as being capable of expressing this enzyme ( pad ) , it is suggested that infection with this microorganism could influence the pathogenesis of ra [ 78 , 79 ] . these citrullinated proteins were also found in periodontal tissues , indicating a link between these peptides generated in the oral cavity and those observed in articular tissues [ 36 , 80 ] . additionally , the presence of antibodies to p. gingivalis was investigated . ( 2015 )   have not detected this , antibody titres significantly differ between early rheumatoid arthritis and healthy controls . other studies observed the antibodies to p. gingivalis in patients with ra and severe periodontitis   and were associated with probing depth and clinical attachment level and the titers of rheumatoid factor and anticyclic citrullinated peptide autoantibodies [ 35 , 50 ] , which may be found in patients with ra and related to the severity of periodontitis . in summary , the studies suggested that p. gingivalis might play a role in the pathogenesis of ra . the response in periodontitis was related to uncitrullinated peptide , suggesting that these peptides break tolerance and can be involved in pathogenesis of ra   ( figure 1(c ) ) . most of the studies have found high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and other mediators of inflammation , such as mmp-9 , tnf- , il-17 , rankl , and opg . moreover , it was demonstrated that the hypomethylated status , a single region of the il-6 , may contribute to elevated serum levels of this cytokine , implying a role in the pathogenesis of these diseases , while the anti - inflammatory cytokines in the gcf , such as il-4 and il-10 , showed no consensus among studies regarding the differences observed among individuals with pd and ra . in addition , hypotheses have been proposed to explain the relationship between periodontitis and systemic diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis . in the literature , studies have suggested that chronic periodontitis generates local constant high levels of microparticles , which have been considered inflammatory biomarkers or mediators responsible for distant cell signalling and regulation . moreover , it has been reported that these microparticles play an important role in thrombosis and angiogenesis and mediate cellular communication by transferring mrnas and micrornas from the cell of origin to target cells . thus , the microparticle participation and its spread into the bloodstream could constitute the explanation to the increased risk for systemic disease in patients with periodontitis . despite these evidences showing a link between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis , the exact mechanisms involving this association thus , well - designed longitudinal multicentre clinical trials and further studies with sufficient sample sizes are required to determine the biochemical processes and clinical relationships between these chronic inflammatory conditions . moreover , these studies should consider other potential confound factors such as the drugs administered for the treatment for each disease or differences in oral hygiene or smoking habits in these patients .", "the majority of the articles have confirmed that there is a correlation between pd and ra , since both disorders have characteristics in common and result from an imbalance in the immunoinflammatory response . although it is necessary to highlight the importance of the mechanical treatment for periodontitis and pharmacological treatments mainly for ra patients , more research is needed to assess whether the coexistence of both diseases can affect the clinical signs of periodontitis and systemic markers of rheumatoid arthritis and strengthen the capacity of oral bacteria to stimulate an autoimmune response , thus establishing that cell constituents or mediators could share common pathophysiological pathways for both diseases and therefore define the best therapy ."], "summary": "periodontitis ( pd ) and rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) are immunoinflammatory diseases where leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory mediators induce alveolar bone loss , synovitis , and joint destruction , respectively . thus , we reviewed the relationship between both diseases considering epidemiological aspects , mechanical periodontal treatment , inflammatory mediators , oral microbiota , and antibodies , using the keywords  periodontitis  and  rheumatoid arthritis  in pubmed database between january 2012 and march 2015 , resulting in 162 articles . after critical reading based on titles and abstracts and following the inclusion and exclusion criteria , 26 articles were included . in the articles , women over 40 years old , smokers and nonsmokers , mainly constituted the analyzed groups . eight studies broached the epidemiological relationship with pd and ra . four trials demonstrated that the periodontal treatment influenced the severity of ra and periodontal clinical parameters . nine studies were related with bacteria influence in the pathogenesis of ra and the presence of citrullinated proteins , autoantibodies , or rheumatoid factor in patients with pd and ra . five studies investigated the presence of mediators of inflammation in pd and ra . in summary , the majority of the articles have confirmed that there is a correlation between pd and ra , since both disorders have characteristics in common and result from an imbalance in the immunoinflammatory response .", "ranking": [4, 2, 1, 3, 0]}

Key Arguments for the Clinical Utility of the QoL Measure", "4. Difficulties in Interpreting QoL Scores", "5. Conclusion"], "document": ["while the physical disability aspect of multiple sclerosis ( ms ) , the most common demyelinating disease of the central nervous system in young adults , is of great importance , it is now well recognized that it does not reflect all of the facets that patients consider important in their life . fatigue , depression , and physical disability are only one aspect of a person 's experience with ms ; it is well documented that cognitive , emotional , and psychological functions contribute to their quality of life ( qol ) . the qol measurements are being considered increasingly important with regard to evaluating disease progression , treatment and the management of care provided to ms patients [ 2 , 3 ] . the us food and drug administration ( fda ) and the european medicines agency encourage the use of qol assessment in patients with chronic illnesses [ 4 , 5 ] , and several groups have published detailed recommendations for qol assessment [ 6 , 7 ] . in ms research , 118 studies that have reported qol as an outcome were performed with ms patients in the clinical trials registry ( clinicaltrials.gov , december 31 , 2012 ) . despite the acknowledged need to consider qol issues , qol assessment may be considered to be an  unfulfilled promise  [ 911 ] . therefore , these issues should be explored and understood to promote both the use and usefulness of measuring qol in ms clinical practice . here , we explore the difficulties for clinicians to choose and determine the most appropriate qol measure , to be convinced by the clinical utility of the qol assessment implementation in clinical practice and to interpret qol scores .", "qol is commonly assessed using self - reported questionnaires . to fully understand and explore the effectiveness of any intervention for the management of ms , it is important to have robust , valid , reliable , and universally applied measures . generic instruments are generally used to compare qol across different populations , while disease - specific instruments focus on particular health problems and are more sensitive for detecting and quantifying small changes . in ms clinical practice , ms - specific questionnaires are more appropriate due to a better ability to discern qol differences in patients than the 36-item short form . a large number of disease - specific qol instruments have been validated for use in ms patients . the most popular questionnaires are the multiple sclerosis quality of life questionnaire ( msqol54 ) , the functional assessment of multiple sclerosis questionnaire ( fams ) , the hamburg quality of life questionnaire in multiple sclerosis ( haquams ) , the quality of life index - multiple sclerosis ( qli - ms ) , the multiple sclerosis quality of life index ( msqli ) , the leeds multiple sclerosis quality of life scale , the ms impact scale ( msis-29 ) , the disability and impact profile ( dip ) , the extension of quality - adjusted time without symptoms of disease and toxicity of treatment , and more recently , the multiple sclerosis international quality of life questionnaire . while some reviews tried to describe the different questionnaires as designed specifically for ms patients [ 2 , 25 , 26 ] , a clinician contemplating these various rules and instruments may be overwhelmed by their level of complexity . the multiplicity of scales used requires describing their psychometrics and the theoretical and conceptual foundations . clinicians should be provided better guidance and training that includes evidence of the respective contributions of the various available instruments , the degree to which the tools measure what they claim to measure , and their respective strengths and shortcomings . high - level requirements for development and metric validation of qol measures , especially among the most recent instruments , are now well acknowledged [ 28 , 29 ] . briefly , we can mention some limitations about the process of validating the qol questionnaires that may compromise the robustness of the instrument . first , one important issue concerns the conceptual problems related to the definition of qol . the researchers should have well - validated questionnaires based on a clear conceptual basis for qol . one major challenge to explaining the content of the qol dimensions to be measured is to ensure that the subjects ' perceptions are accurately taken into account . interviews with patients are commonly considered as the best method to capture the patient 's perceptions [ 30 , 31 ] and provide the content of the questionnaire . few ms - specific qol questionnaires were exclusively based on the patient 's point of view . second , the  responsiveness  or  sensitivity to change ,  defined as the ability to detect a meaningful change , is a core psychometric property of a measuring instrument . given the availability of many qol instruments , little research has been conducted to test the responsiveness of the qol tools in ms . the haquams showed satisfactory responsiveness to change , the msis-29 , msqol-54 , and fams moderately detected change in health status [ 33 , 34 ] . also , clinicians should prefer the use of the haquams to detect health changes over time of ms patients . future studies should provide comparisons with responsiveness indices using a direct head - to - head comparison to make the situations in which they were tested comparably . finally , another point that should be mentioned is related to the number of available languages of the questionnaire . the msqol54 [ 15 , 3537 ] and the musiqol [ 24 , 3841 ] these questionnaires were developed simultaneously in a number of countries and thus represent a major strength . environmental barriers have been described   to explain why qol measures have not been routinely implemented in clinical practice . time and resource are both constraints on clinicians whose main role is providing patient care . a great asset of the qol questionnaire is its acceptability , which concerns the ergonomics of the questionnaire , such as the length of the questionnaire , the paper or electronic format , and the concept of computer adaptive testing . some authors have suggested that questionnaires intended for use in clinical populations should be as brief as possible because of the nonadaptability with a clinical evaluation and the difficulties of the concentration and perception faced by patients with a cognitive dysfunction [ 8 , 30 ] , such as ms patients . it is common to accept that the average time of completion of a questionnaire should not exceed 10 minutes to be fully compatible with clinical practice . providing shorter questionnaires in ms qol measures , as is already done in other chronic diseases , may contribute both appropriate and useful for use in clinical practice . a potential opportunity for questionnaire development exists in the growing use of electronic records and e - health research . to our knowledge , there are not any studies that evaluate the feasibility of e - form qol questionnaires in ms patients . however , it is not certain that e - form questionnaires would allow for obtaining qol data in an efficient real - time manner because of the logistics feasibility and the lack of computer stations and hand - held devices . while most qol questionnaires are initially fixed in content and length , future challenges now focus on the concept of computer adaptive testing . the number of items can be reduced substantially by use of item - response theory and computer adaptive testing to target questions through an iterative process in which responses determine which items are subsequently presented . this approach requires development and validation of algorithms in addition to development and validation of the original questionnaire . today , the neurology quality - of - life measurement initiative is a standardized approach based on extant items used for measuring qol across common neurologic conditions , including multiple sclerosis , for both adults and children [ 47 , 48 ] .", "the next challenge is to develop credible strategies for integrating qol data in clinical practice . to enhance the use of qol measures in clinical decision making , improving knowledge about the determinants of qol changes and the potential predictive role of qol on disability may reinforce the conviction of clinicians to use these measures in their ms clinical practice . in the same way , demonstrating that qol feedback should improve health status of ms patients may confirm the relevance of including qol in clinical practice .   clinicians can use qol assessments to check whether interventions have been as effective from the patient 's point of view as from the clinician 's , and to determine whether further action is required . knowledge of which factors are determinants of qol in patients with ms would assist clinicians in choosing the most appropriate interventions . several determinants of qol have been identified with varying strengths of association and include both disease - related variables ( disability status [ 49 , 50 ] , disease duration [ 50 , 51 ] , fatigue [ 52 , 53 ] , depression [ 49 , 54 ] ) , cognition , sociodemographic variables ( age and sex [ 55 , 56 ] , level of education , and marital status ) . a number of these factors might be amenable to treatment intervention , which might be expected to improve qol : fatigue , depression , and cognition .   predictive factors of long - term disability in patients with ms were also previously reported [ 60 , 61 ] : sociodemographic variables [ 62 , 63 ] , initial edss score or initial change in edss score [ 61 , 64 ] , number or types of relapses [ 61 , 62 ] , nature of the initial symptoms , and mri findings . the weight of these factors is poorly understood and does not explain the entire change of disability that is observed . in contrast to domains such as heart disease and cancer , few studies have examined the predictive value of qol on disability in patients with ms . longitudinal studies have described whether the qol level , in addition to conventional clinical and sociodemographic factors , provides prognostic information about the evolution of disability in patients with ms [ 6770 ] . these studies have found that scores of mental health qol [ 67 , 69 ] , scores of  physical - like  dimensions [ 68 , 69 , 71 ] , and the score of global qol   are independent predictors of disability as assessed using the edss score . there must be at least one plausible mechanism responsible for the link between poor qol and progression in disability . qol could be a more subtle measure of early disability that is not detected by the edss scale . the identification of early predictors of the long - term evolution of disability status may be useful to identify both high - risk patients who require early and more aggressive therapies and low - risk patients who could avoid lifelong , expensive , and potentially troublesome treatments . thus , this identification procedure may favor a more homogeneous selection of patients for clinical therapeutic trials . patient - reported baseline qol levels provide additional prognostic information on ms disability beyond traditional clinical or sociodemographic factors . these findings provide strong support for the integration of qol into clinical practice , in addition to other standard assessments , and reinforce the importance of incorporating a patient 's evaluation of their own qol level during patient monitoring and the assessment of treatment effects . future studies should provide data from longer follow - up times and will likely highlight other robust findings .   the impact of qol assessment on health status and other health - related outcomes of patients has already been accomplished in oncology [ 7375 ] . to our knowledge , there are no studies that have explored the effect of assessing qol in ms care management . this effect is defined by the negative expectations that derive from a clinical encounter and lead to poor health outcomes and therapy adherence . this theme constitutes an important avenue of ms research in clinical settings for the coming years .", "in some specific situations , clinicians can be perplexed when interpreting qol scores : ( 1 ) what does a qol score mean in the absence of normative / reference values ? ( 3 ) what is the meaning of qol scores for an individual with cognitive impairment ? the practical and clinical interpretations of qol data in a given disorder are difficult unless these data are presented with a reference system . one of the difficulties encountered when interpreting a qol score for clinicians is the lack of norms values . sf36 , a generic instrument , is commonly used because normative data from healthy adults and individuals with a variety of illnesses are available . to our knowledge , no norms were provided for any ms - specific questionnaire . at this time , the qol scores of the reference population described in the validation publication are implicitly used as norms . it is rare to have scores according to sex , gender , and clinical form . additionally , it becomes imperative to produce norms for the most popular ms - specific instruments . another concern expressed by clinicians is the interpretation of qol measures in longitudinal studies because qol , self - reported by the patient , might be influenced by psychological phenomena such as adaptation to illness . adaptation to illness is a potential explanation in cases where , for example , the qol of an individual who has experienced a serious health event or chronic condition is similar to the qol of a healthy individual . most people with a long - term chronic condition such as ms do not say that physical disability is their primary concern but mention involvement in everyday activities and psychological and emotional well - being . an important mediator of this adaptation process is  response shift  ( rs ) which involves changing internal standards , values , and the conceptualization of qol [ 78 , 79 ] . rs can be divided into ( 1 ) reconceptualization ( i.e. , a redefinition of qol ) , ( 2 ) reprioritization ( i.e. , a change in the importance attributed to component domains constituting qol ) , and ( 3 ) recalibration ( i.e. , a change in a patient 's internal standards of measurements ) . true change may be over- or underestimated when rs is present , leading to biased estimates of the magnitude of change . a recent meta - analysis revealed a substantial body of literature on rs phenomena and concluded that rs was common and significant in qol measurement . some studies have already investigated this phenomenon in ms populations using the most established methods : the then - test , structural equation modeling ( sem ) , latent trajectory analysis of residuals , recursive partitioning tree analysis as a data mining method , and , more recently , the random forest method . . it would be premature to conclude which method is best for detecting rs in ms patients . future explorations should be performed to compare the capacity of these methods for detecting rs and the degree of convergence of the isolated phenomena . however , the rs does not necessarily invalidate qol measures when it appears under the reprioritization component . change in values may simply represent a mechanism by which people gain true changes in qol . determining how to integrate the rs in the interpretation of qol scores in ms clinical practice is now the next challenge . prior studies of the relationship between cognitive impairment and qol have been contradictory , highlighting either negligible [ 8790 ] or strong links [ 51 , 91 , 92 ] between cognitive disturbances and qol alterations . the use of self - reported outcomes in subjects with cognitive dysfunction is of particular concern . the extent to which ms patients with cognitive dysfunction can validly self - report their qol is a crucial issue that has only partially been examined . while some authors argue that cognitively impaired individuals are unable to produce valid qol measures [ 94 , 95 ] , others reported empirical evidence suggesting that individuals with a moderate degree of cognitive impairment can perform reliable qol assessments [ 92 , 96 ] . two recent papers reported data providing strong arguments to support the conclusion that ms patients with executive dysfunction , as determined by the stroop test , and memory dysfunction , as determined by the grober and buschke test , are reliable and consistent when answering a well - validated ms - specific qol questionnaire , the musiqol [ 24 , 38 ] . these studies provided new evidence about the suitability for using self - reported qol data in these specific populations . the assessment of qol using the musiqol questionnaire could be more widely used without concern over the adequacy of this approach for cognitively impaired patients . however , it has to be acknowledged that a single test of cognitive functioning will never be entirely appropriate . an interdisciplinary approach would be most effective in addressing this deficit [ 1 , 12 ] . future studies should provide similar results according to other definitions of cognitive dysfunction that integrate combinations of different composites ( i.e. , memory , attention , and concentration ) and other qol questionnaires .", "using qol measures may provide clinicians with information regarding the general health status of their ms patients who might otherwise go unrecognized . neurologists should consider qol measures in the same way as routine objective measures such as symptomatic evaluation scales , laboratory tests , and radiographs to manage the care of ms patients . in this paper , we discussed several avenues to convince clinicians of the clinical relevance and accuracy of qol instruments and ultimately to enhance the use of qol measures in clinical practice for ms patients ."], "summary": "while the physical disability aspect of multiple sclerosis ( ms ) is of great importance , quality of life ( qol ) measurements are being considered increasingly important with regard to evaluating disease progression , treatment , and the management of care provided to ms patients . despite the acknowledged need to consider qol issues , qol assessment remains underutilized in clinical practice . these issues should be explored and understood to promote the use of measuring qol in ms clinical practice . we explore the difficulties for clinicians : choosing and determining the most appropriate qol measure and how to best integrate qol measurements into clinical practice . this paper discusses several avenues to provide to clinicians arguments of the clinical relevance and accuracy of qol instruments and ultimately to enhance the use of qol measures in clinical practice for ms patients .", "ranking": [1, 0, 4, 2, 3]}

term efficacy of laparoscopic nissen fundoplication for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in infants and children . the laparoscopic approach is feasible as a primary procedure and a secondary procedure after failure of a previous open or laparoscopic reflux operation . however , few studies have examined the efficacy of laparoscopic nissen fundoplication in infants and children after previous laparotomy for diseases or problems unrelated to reflux . the purpose of this study is to examine our experience with open and laparoscopic nissen fundoplication in a population of infants with a history of previous neonatal laparotomy for diseases unrelated to gastroesophageal reflux .", "an institutional review board - approved retrospective review ( irb # 05091500 ) of our surgical procedure database at the children 's hospital of pittsburgh was conducted to identify all infants with a history of neonatal laparotomy who subsequently required surgical therapy for gastroesophageal reflux . study dates were january 1 , 2000 through september 1 , 2005 . during the period reviewed , 32 infants were identified with a history of neonatal laparotomy and subsequent surgical correction of gastroesophageal reflux . only infants requiring surgical correction of reflux within the first year of life , and therefore less than 12 months after neonatal laparotomy , were included in this study . this 12-month time frame was selected because we specifically chose to evaluate infants , and it represented a more homogeneous subset of patients when comparing laparoscopic nissen fundoplication ( lnf ) and open nissen fundoplication ( onf ) groups . the 6 excluded patients were all older than 12 months at the time of nissen fundoplication ( 3 in each group , age range 2 to 15 years old ) . these 26 infants underwent laparotomy during the neonatal period for multiple different diagnoses including intestinal atresia ( duodenal , jejunal and ileal ) ; necrotizing enterocolitis ; meconium ileus ; gastroschisis ; omphalocele ; malrotation ; congenital diaphragmatic hernia and imperforate anus . twelve infants underwent lnf and 14 infants underwent onf , thereby forming the 2 study groups . gastroesophageal reflux was identified clinically , radiographically , or with both methods , and the infants underwent surgical correction of the reflux at the discretion of the attending surgeon . all infants had either a barium esophagram or a nuclear gastric emptying scan , which documented gastroesophageal reflux before anti - reflux surgery . a nissen fundoplication was performed in all cases either open or laparoscopically by dividing the short - gastric vessels and creating a 360-degree wrap of the fundus around the esophagus . ten of 12 infants in the lnf group had concomitant feeding gastrostomy tubes placed laparoscopically . two infants in the lnf group already had gastrostomy tubes in place at the time of fundoplication , both of which were placed by the open method , one on the first day ( duodenal atresia ) and the other at one month of age ( jejunal atresia ) . in the first infant , the tube was taken down laparoscopically at the time of fundoplication and replaced in a new position on the gastric wall to accomplish the wrap . in the second infant , thirteen of 14 infants in the onf group had a feeding gastrostomy tube placed at the time of fundoplication with 3 of these infants having relocation of an existing gastrostomy tube . outcome variables included age at initial laparotomy , number of previous laparotomies before surgical correction of the gastroesophageal reflux , age at the time of fundoplication , weight at the time of fundoplication , operative time for fundoplication , length of stay , and time to resumption of enteral feeds after fundoplication , recurrence of gastroesophageal re - flux , and mean follow - up duration . in general , infants with these neonatal diagnoses , with or without antireflux surgery , are followed for a minimum of 5 years by our group .", "of the 26 infants identified with a history of neonatal laparotomy and subsequent surgical correction of gastroesophageal reflux within 12 months of life , 12 infants underwent laparoscopic nissen fundoplication ( lnf ) , and 14 infants underwent open nissen fundoplication ( onf ) . in the lnf group , diagnoses included 4 neonates with gastroschisis , 3 neonates with intestinal atresia ( 1 duodenal , 1 ileal , 1 jejunal ) , 2 neonates with meconium ileus ( both underwent ileostomy and mucus fistula at day of life # 1 with re - anastomosis at 2 to 3 months of age ) , and 1 each with omphalocele , malrotation , and perforated necrotizing enterocolitis . in the onf group , diagnoses included 4 neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia ( all left - sided , repaired by laparotomy ) , 4 neonates with gastroschisis , 2 neonates with perforated necrotizing enterocolitis , 2 neonates with imperforate anus / tracheoesophageal fistula , 1 infant with omphalocele , and 1 infant with intestinal atresia . in the lnf group , 4 infants had intestinal stomas performed at initial operation with subsequent closure before fundoplication . in the onf group , 3 infants had stomas created at initial laparotomy and subsequent takedown before fundoplication . there was no difference between the 2 groups relative to age at the time of initial laparotomy ( 1 day of life for lnf vs 14 days of life for onf , p=0.08 ) . what may appear as a large difference in days of life at initial operation may be accounted for by the fact that 2 patients in the onf group had initial laparotomies at ages 51 days ( ileostomy/ mucus fistula for perforated nec in ex-25 week gestation infant ) and 90 days ( duodenoduodenostomy for duodenal atresia in 1.5-kg infant born at 800 g ) . there was no difference in age at the time of the fundoplication ( 5.5 months for lnf vs 6.6 months for onf , p=0.57 ) , nor was there any difference between the 2 groups with respect to infants ' weight at the time of the fundoplication ( 5.2 kg lnf vs 5.7 kg onf , p=0.51 ) . the number of previous laparotomies prior to fundoplication was similar in each group ( 1.7 laparotomies for lnf vs 1.9 laparotomies for onf , p=0.36 ) . additionally , operative time was comparable between the groups with an average operative time of 131 minutes in the lnf group ( range , 77 to 190 ) and 164 minutes in the onf group ( range , 100 to 287 ) ( p=0.10 ) . infants undergoing lnf did resume enteral feeds earlier than those undergoing onf ( 3.0 days lnf vs 6.3 days onf , p=0.01 ) . the length of stay after fundoplication was actually shorter in the lnf group ( 14 days lnf vs 26 days onf , p=0.13 ) , but this did not reach statistical significance . all infants in both groups progressed to tolerate full oral , gastrostomy , or both , feeds with appropriate weight gain during follow - up periods . subjectively , no infants in either group developed recurrent gastroesophageal reflux or wrap failure during an average follow - up period of 22 months ( range , 1 to 54 ) . follow - up length of time for the lnf group was not different from that in the onf group ( 1 to 28 months versus 1 to 54 months , respectively , p = ns ) . however , routine monitoring for recurrent reflux is not done at our institution unless an infant develops feeding intolerance after fundoplication .", "our results suggest that laparoscopic nissen fundoplication ( lnf ) is at least as safe and effective as open nissen fundoplication ( onf ) in the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in a population of infants with a history of a neonatal laparotomy . additionally , lnf appears to have a distinct advantage by allowing an early resumption of full enteral feeds after nissen fundoplication . all of the infants in this study required an operation in the neonatal period for surgical diseases unrelated to gastroesophageal reflux . both the onf and the lnf groups included infants with a variety of neonatal surgical diseases , many of which predispose to the subsequent development of gastroesophageal reflux . specifically , there is a well - documented increase in the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux in neonates with a history of gastroschisis , congenital diaphragmatic hernia , and omphalocele . the risk for the development of gastroesophageal reflux in these infants is theorized to be secondary to defects of bowel motility , increased abdominal pressure , and gastroesophageal junction anatomical anomalies . at least half of the infants in both the onf and lnf groups had a variety of abdominal wall and diaphragmatic defects . there have been few studies in infants and children that address the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic nissen fundoplication for the treatment of gastroesophageal re - flux in children with previous abdominal surgery . best studied is the role of laparoscopic nissen fundoplication for recurrent gastroesophageal reflux after either an open or laparoscopic primary fundoplication . rothenbergs has one of the largest series of laparoscopic redo nissen fundoplications with 118 patients ages 6 months to 19 years . in this study , redo laparoscopic nissen fundoplication was safe and efficacious in these infants , children , and adolescents . other authors have also documented the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic redo nissen fundoplications in infants and children of a variety of ages . however , fewer studies have examined the role of laparoscopic nissen fundoplication after neonatal laparotomy for diseases unrelated to gastroesophageal reflux . in a study by liu et al , the authors concluded that laparoscopic nissen fundoplication was feasible and safe in a population of children with previous ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement , gastrostomy placement , or both . similarly , lintula et al15 concluded that a pre - existing gastrostomy tube did not preclude a safe and effective laparoscopic nissen fundoplication in children . van der zee et al both documented the technical feasibility and safety of nissen fundoplication in children with a pre - existing gastrostomy tube . although these studies do examine redo laparoscopic surgery , none of these studies have examined the role of a laparotomy for primary neonatal surgical disease pre - existing the development of gastroesophageal reflux . there are distinct nuances in achieving safe minimally invasive access in infants after neonatal laparotomy . for infants with abdominal wall defects ( eg , gastroschisis and omphalocele ) , the umbilicus is avoided because the majority of these infants have dense adhesions in this area from prior repair . in our study , initial access for these patients was achieved through a left upper quadrant cut down approach with a 4-mm port . in patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and intestinal atresia , adhesions from a prior laparotomy thus , access via the umbilicus was attempted and successful for these patients . for some patients , extended operative times were due to optimizing port placement and extensive adhesiolysis to complete a laparoscopic nissen fundoplication . unfortunately , the actual times for this aspect of the study operations were not recorded separately , and therefore , we are unable to determine the exact time for doing the fundoplication portion of the operation . beyond the technical feasibility of a laparoscopic nissen fundoplication at any time point after a neonatal laparotomy , our study also highlights the feasibility of a laparoscopic nissen fundoplication in a group of very small infants . specifically , all of the infants in the lnf group underwent fundoplication at an average weight of 5.2 kg ( range , 2.7 to 8.8 ) . these infants were , on average , smaller than the infants and children in the largest series of redo laparoscopic nissen fundoplication , in which the lowest documented weight was 6.4 kg . however , we are not aware of any studies that have examined weight as a selection criterion for redo laparoscopic nissen fundoplication . the study dates include a period of transition in our institution with respect to surgical approaches to gastroesophageal reflux . in 2001 , an experienced laparoscopic surgeon joined the surgical group , resulting in a gradual conversion over to advanced laparoscopic approaches to historically open surgical diseases . the number as well as the approach for surgical anti - reflux operations at our institution increased and changed over the time period of this study from 41 in 2000 ( 37 onf ; 4 lnf ) to 122 in 2005 ( 118 lnf ; 4 onf ) . as advanced laparoscopic skills have developed in the group , the operative times for primary lnf have ranged from 45 minutes to 135 minutes , depending on staff and resident trainee experience . more surgeons will now consider primary laparoscopic nissen fundoplication , even in the face of previous abdominal surgery . we intend to review our experience for all anti - reflux operations in the neonatal age group or in infants under 7 kg to determine the outcomes and benefits of such an approach in this patient population . currently , a primary laparoscopic approach is our preferred approach to gastroesophageal reflux , regardless of the history of previous operations .", "outcomes following laparoscopic or open nissen fundoplication performed in infants after a neonatal laparotomy are similar . however , a laparoscopic fundoplication did allow for earlier return to enteral feeds compared with the open approach and tends toward shorter hospital length of stay . therefore , we conclude that laparoscopic nissen fundoplication is technically feasible , safe , and effective in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in infants with a previous neonatal laparotomy ."], "summary": "background : nissen fundoplication is an effective treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in infants . laparoscopic procedures after previous laparotomy are technically more challenging . the role of laparoscopic nissen fundoplication after neonatal laparotomy for diseases unrelated to reflux is poorly described.methods:this was a retrospective review of open vs laparoscopic nissen fundoplication in infants after neonatal laparotomy . of 32 infants who underwent neonatal laparotomy , 26 required a surgical antireflux operation within the first year of life . twelve infants underwent laparoscopic nissen fundoplication versus 14 infants who underwent open nissen fundoplication . parameters like age , weight , operative time , number of previous operations , length of stay following fundoplication , time to feedings , and complications were compared between the 2 groups.results:no statistically significant differences existed between most of the parameters compared following laparoscopic vs open nissen fundoplication . no conversions to open procedures were necessary in infants undergoing laparoscopic fundoplication , and these infants resumed enteral feeds earlier than those who underwent the open procedure.conclusion:laparoscopic compared with open nissen fundoplication performed in infants after a neonatal laparotomy were comparable procedures across most data points studied . however , a laparoscopic fundoplication did allow for earlier return to enteral feeds compared with the open approach . laparoscopic nissen fundoplication is technically feasible , safe , and effective in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in infants with a previous neonatal laparotomy .", "ranking": [4, 0, 3, 1, 2]}
{"id": "PMC5034395", "section_names": ["THEORETICAL ISSUES", "PRACTICALITIES AND STRUCTURE OF THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK", "WIDER SOCIETAL CONSIDERATIONS", "THE CURRENT EUROPEAN REGULATORY CONTEXT", "CONCLUSION"], "document": ["de ridder , vanneste , and focquaert address concerns relating to the definition of a ced and the distinction between treatment and enhancement . they raise a number of problems with the treatment - enhancement distinction and suggest that we need to ask  whether we are prepared to change the definition of health used by the medical devices directive. there are in fact three questions raised here . the first is whether our proposal requires a robust characterization of the treatment - enhancement distinction , the second is whether our suggestions , as we intended them , actually involve changing the definition of heath implicit in the mdd ( there is no explicit definition ) , and the third is whether the mere inclusion of ceds within the mdd will have the de facto effect of changing the implicit regulatory concept of  health or  treatment. in response to the first question , we would maintain that it is in fact an advantage of our approach that it minimizes the importance given to the treatment - enhancement distinction and thus diminishes the need to characterize it in a way that is immune to criticism . on our approach , devices intended for enhancement are regulated in a similar manner to therapeutic medical devices . thus , if some enhancement devices are misclassified as therapeutic devices , or vice versa , this will not have major implications for their regulation . what matters , from our perspective , are risks and benefits . by contrast , some alternative approaches , including the one recommended by de ridder and collaborators , would regulate ceds and therapeutic medical devices quite differently , with the result that misclassification would have more significant regulatory effects , since devices regulated under the general product safety directive alone are held to less specific and less stringent standards . in short , we agree that the treatment - enhancement distinction is problematic  and some of us have elsewhere rejected it  but we believe a desire to mitigate the problems it raises counts in favor of our approach , not against it . we would also dispute the suggestion that our approach requires any modification to the concept of health . our proposal was not to  change the definition of health ( nor  treatment ) but , rather , to bring some non - therapeutic devices , which do not aim to improve health problems , within the remit of the mdd . our proposals involved leaving the definition of a medical device used by the mdd unaltered . ceds would not be medical devices on the mdd definition . instead , an ancillary positive list is proposed to bring specific devices with a non - medical purpose within the remit of the mdd alongside those devices defined as medical devices according to the criteria employed in the directive . by proposing an ancillary list for specific cognition - affecting devices without a medical purpose , we in fact reinforce the concepts ( ie medical and non - medical ) underpinning the european commission 's proposed creation of annex xv for implantable and other invasive devices for which the manufacturer claims only a non - medical purpose . we proposed that this list should be extended to include non - invasive neuromodulation for non - medical purposes . however , the third implicit question indeed requires consideration : will there be a de facto change in what is meant by  health and  treatment if ceds are regulated under the mdd ? arguably , the mere association of ceds with therapeutic medical devices could result in an expansion of the concepts of treatment and health . the possible implications of a shift in what is seen as  health - related or  there , they suggest that medical device regulation might underscore the  illusion that devices are beneficial . however , we suggest that the idea that tdcs and tms techniques can yield cognitive enhancement in healthy adults is not a mere illusion . further , we suggested that regulatory approval of moderately risky brain stimulation devices should be dependent on evidence of at least some degree of  performance. in this respect , it would be important to notify consumers explicitly on which population the ced has shown to be beneficial while reminding that it can be ineffective or detrimental to other populations . regulation would therefore go some way towards ensuring that effects are not illusory for those devices that are approved ( although individuals could believe effects to be bigger than they are ) . whilst we concede de ridder , vanneste , and focquaert 's point that there is currently  no substantive evidence that ceds produce lasting effects outside of research and clinical settings ( p. 320 ) , there is a wealth of scientific research that provides proof of concept for the cognitive enhancing effects of tdcs and tms techniques . that the ceds on the market have not been subject to objective assessment is part of the reason why regulation is needed and counts in its favor . they argue that contemporary scholarship shows no serious harms associated with the use of neurofeedback or tdcs . in response to this , we wish to point out  particularly in relation to active devices used for tdcs and tms  that , whilst devices have indeed been use safely in the laboratory , and the regulated devices that researchers use in such contexts are indeed conducive to safe use , these facts do nothing to ensure that the unregulated devices on sale for enhancement exhibit the same safety profile . first , the exclusion criteria for brain stimulation research are much more conservative than marketed exclusion criteria . second , while brain stimulation experiments lasts usually between a single session to a dozen ( the latter is a relatively rare scenario ) , there is not safety data on the usage of brain stimulation over a long period of time such as months or years . essentially , regulation is needed to ensure that devices sold for enhancement are as similar as possible to those devices about which kuersten and hamilton make their safety claims . indeed  and to illustrate the point from another perspective  fitz and reiner raised concerns about the foc.us device in their commentary : \n the internal electrodes exceed the general safety guidelines for current density at all stimulation levels , the voltage limits do not behave as specified in the manual , the device behaves unpredictably when its connection to the head is lost , and under some circumstances the foc.us can generate small voltage current spikes . the internal electrodes exceed the general safety guidelines for current density at all stimulation levels , the voltage limits do not behave as specified in the manual , the device behaves unpredictably when its connection to the head is lost , and under some circumstances the foc.us can generate small voltage current spikes . accordingly , we emphasize : just because tdcs can be safe does not mean that all of the particular devices on sale are meeting the same level of safety . further , at the end of their commentary , and perhaps in tension with their assertion that the sorts of ceds we discuss present no significant risks , kuersten and hamilton say that low - risk devices should not be excluded from on - going oversight , since  so much concerning the brain , what affects it , and how remains unknown ( p. 347 ) . we wish here to emphasize that low - risk devices , as we envisioned them , would typically be non - active devices such as neurofeedback equipment , which they correctly claim pose no risks qua devices ( see below ) . given their comments on the safety of neurofeeback , especially considered simply as a device , we would be surprised if they would think that such equipment required on - going oversight . thus , even if there is room to disagree about whether ced is the right label for non - active devices ( as we discuss below ) , we in fact seem to agree on the lack of need for the continual regulation of low - risk devices , such as those that do not transfer energy through the skull . kuersten and hamilton object to our inclusion of neurofeedback as a ced . however , in offering our definition of ceds , we were not aiming to provide the definitive view on what does and what does not fall within this category . our interest in offering a definition was only to facilitate identification of a class of non - therapeutic devices that should receive regulatory attention and , on that definition , neurofeedback plausibly does qualify as a ced . note also that doubts about whether neurofeedback equipment qualifies as a ced on a precise understanding of that term could also be raised regarding tdcs equipment , which kuersten and hamilton believe does qualify . they argue that  what actually affects the brain is therapy used with [ neurofeeback equipment] ( p. 341 ) . but tdcs also only enhances cognitive performance when combined with cognitive training exercises , so could be excluded from the category of ceds on similar grounds . nevertheless , kuersten and hamilton are right to highlight that tdcs directly modulates brain activity whereas neurofeedback modulates it through psychological mechanisms . we have no problem with the suggestion that this is a significant difference , and indeed it informs our suggestion that tdcs and tms should be classed as iia or iib devices , due to their active nature , and neurofeedback should be in class i , if regulated at all . kuersten and hamilton next argue that including ceds under the definition of a medical device would not result in our suggested problem of overbroadness ( which we suggested would occur if the definition of a medical device were to be altered ) , since devices , they claim , would be limited by the definition to those that  investigate , replace or modify the anatomy or a physiological process. their claim is based on the assumption that ceds could fall under the definition as it is currently articulated . however , it was the possibility that an altered definition would be overbroad that we thought counted in favor of a supplementary positive list . in setting out our proposals , we worked on the assumption that the current definition did not in fact capture ceds ( due to the principal criterion that a medical device be intended to treat , prevent or diagnose ) and that changing the definition to remove this principal criterion across the board would have the result that it would then be overbroad . if the principal criterion were simply that a medical device investigate , replace or modify the anatomy or a physiological process then all sorts of devices would fall under the remit of the mdd  from earrings to nail extensions . indeed , the european commission used precisely this argument to support the creation of a positive list of implantable or other invasive devices without a medical purpose . according to their impact assessment on the revision of the regulatory framework for medical devices , the definition of a medical device stipulates that it be intended for treatment , prevention or diagnosis , and the removal of this criterion would result in overbroadness , making a positive list the preferred solution in the case of certain cosmetic devices . our argument for an analogous list for ceds is based on the assumption that the european commission is correct in its understanding of the mdd and the implications of the current and possible definitions employed therein .", "fitz and reiner broadly support our proposals and endorse our central claim , viz . that the regulatory framework for medical devices should be extended to include ceds . nevertheless , they raise a concern about the ability of ced users to evaluate the risks of ceds , saying that  evidence that consumers are in a strong position to evaluate the risks associated with ced use is lacking ( p. 323 ) . whilst we agree that consumers will not be perfect rational calculators , we emphasize that our proposals would eliminate devices from the market that were manifestly dangerous or far more dangerous than needed to serve their intended function . in addition , our liberal view is committed to the contention that allowing some room for error in consumers weighing of benefits vs. risks in relation to their individual well - being can be a justifiable cost of allowing individuals greater autonomy and freedom of action . we stress also that what the risks of devices are  their nature and likelihood  is something that would , in line with the procedure for medical devices , be assessed by a group of experts prior to approval for the market . so , although we agree that leaving some room for consumer valuation of risk leaves open the possibility that individuals will not factor this carefully into their decision whether to use a product , we contend that this is an acceptable cost of a liberal approach to regulation . further , we would like to emphasize that the current lack of regulation implicitly signals to home users that there are no real concerns with ceds , as otherwise they would have been regulated  ie the perception is likely to be that , given the lack of regulation , there are no risks for consumers to evaluate at all . thus , even if consumers are not perfect risk calculators , the current situation it likely to be more misleading than one in which risks have been identified by regulators . king , gavaghan , and mcmillan provide an interesting critique of our proposals relating to consumer assessment of ceds , and in particular their risks and benefits . they agree that the concept of medical benefit is not always appropriate for ceds ( especially where designed and sold only for enhancement ) and that well - being would be the theoretically appropriate construct when assessing such ceds . however , they suggest that well - being , harm and risk are difficult to assess in the pre - market approval process and raise a particular concern about the phenomenon of  risk compensation. the central feature of this phenomenon is that some individuals have a propensity for taking a certain level of risk and will increase the riskiness of what they are doing until this propensity is met . they therefore challenge the assumption that pre - market approval will make the use of ceds safer overall , especially in the context of experimental home use . they suggest that , where users are determined to use devices in a risky way , they will do so despite safety standards . in response to this , we raise a point of empirical uncertainty , and emphasize what can still be achieved through regulation , despite the phenomenon of risk compensation instantiated in some individuals . it might be true that people will tend to fulfill their propensity for a particular total amount of risk in their lives , but it is unclear whether they do this by assuming superfluous risk to achieve a particular goal or seeking further risky goals . perhaps , as king and colleagues suggest , achieving one goal more safely allows one to assume additional risk in relation to other pursuits . however , a risk quota might also be met by increasing or maintaining the level of risk one exposes oneself to in pursuit of one 's current primary goal . which is the case is likely to depend on the number of goals one believes to be valuable to pursue . if ceds are made safer , would users with high risk thresholds seek to obtain riskier devices , or would their risk quota be freed up to pursue additional risky activities ? the question is essentially whether individuals tend to increase riskiness across all activities until their risk propensity is met , or whether they increase the riskiness of every activity to some threshold level for each activity , regardless of how superfluous this risk may be . if the former , risk reducing regulation could still have benefits in the form of facilitating pursuit of other risky , but perhaps all - things - considered valuable , activities . even if individuals with a high risk threshold are inclined to practice riskier use as the device itself becomes safer , we assume that king and colleagues would agree that it is still better that the devices available pose as low a risk as possible to achieve their effects , and that unjustifiably dangerous devices are prohibited from placement on the market . eg by using failsafe mechanisms , audible warnings , and limits on stimulation duration and strength . an individual 's propensity to take risks with a product does not render consideration of that product 's safety redundant . by analogy , just because some individuals routinely drive dangerously , this does not negate the need to try to make cars as safe as possible . even if those engaging in risk compensation reap no overall benefit from making ceds safer , failing to minimize risks would unfairly jeopardize those who do not so compensate . johnson , gillett , and snelling suggest that the most convincing argument in favor of our position is based on the regulatory assessment of risk , which they believe should be the sole consideration in pre - market assessment . we suggest here that our respective proposals are not as different as they may have seemed , as we proposed that risk should be the primary regulatory concern . however , we diverge from the position advocated by them in our contention that objective improvements to cognitive capacities are amenable and relevant to assessment . baseline ( or , we infer ,  upper limit ) level of risk that society feels an individual should be able to take ( eg skydiving or climbing ) , and then require manufacturers to quantify risks only . they argue for this position by pointing out that when technologies are new , and particularly when new technologies are used for an innovative application , variation in the effects on individuals and useful endpoints my not be obvious ab initio . our first response is to note that the same applies for risks  novel applications may present novel and variable risks that are as difficult to predict as the cognitive improvements one might obtain from such applications . our second response is to emphasize that the model we proposed is actually quite close to a risk - only model ; at least , it is a risk - first model . we suggested using risk as the primary way of categorizing a device and that benefits should only be considered in terms of objective improvements  eg demonstrated improvements in a cognitive capacity , such working memory  which are precisely the sorts of effects about which manufacturers make their claims . importantly , this consideration of objective benefit is not intended to downplay the broader benefits that an individual might attain from using a device . whilst objective benefits can be considered , they must not be thought to constitute the only determinants of well - being . nonetheless , regulators should still ensure that consumers are provided with information on objective benefits . indeed , the distinction between  thick and  thin considerations of well - being drawn by king , gavaghan , and mcmillan is illuminating in this regard . thin well - being , they say , consists only in  all - purpose goods , whereas a thick well - being incorporates the individual agent 's conception of value and his particular circumstances . an objective impairment in , say , verbal working memory ( that occurs as a trade - off of an objective improvement in , say , visuospatial working memory ) , will present the very same challenges for quantification , despite such impairment constituting a risk rather than a benefit . to the extent , as the risk only model assumes , that objective risks can be quantified ( and impairment in verbal working memory indeed permits such quantification ) objective benefits along the same sorts of dimensions can also be quantified ) . further , we suggested that room should be made to account for the difficulty of measuring effects ( positive or negative ) on thick well - being . our proposal was that , once the manufacturer had made it clear what the objective benefits and risks are for moderately risky devices , the consumer should have the freedom to decide whether that benefit  risk ratio is acceptable for them ( for example , because they expect it to result in a net gain in thick well - being ) . on the other hand , we proposed that high - risk devices , presenting risks that might be classed  all - purpose bads ( eg a high risk of seizure ) , should be prohibited for sale on the consumer market . whatever the individual 's life plans , in the preponderance of cases of healthy adult use , a seizure is unlikely to promote these plans . where there is scope for disagreement about the value of an effect  for example as to whether a small impairment in verbal working memory is a reasonable price to pay for a similarly sized improvement in visuospatial working memory  level of acceptable risk therefore plays a greater role than quantification of benefits in our overall framework . as an objection to our model , king , gavaghan , and mcmillan present the example of the surgical insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt to treat normal pressure hydrocephalus . they note that this would be a high - risk procedure on our proposals , as it comes with the risk of seizures , stroke , paralysis , and death . moreover , there has never been a comprehensive multicenter randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the performance of this product . this is thus a high - risk procedure for which there is no good evidence of benefit . nevertheless , they seem to suggest , the use of this procedure should be permitted . it might seem , then , that consistency requires permitting the use of some high - risk ceds as well , calling into doubt our claim that high - risk ceds should not be allowed on the market . in response , we would note that patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus typically have much more to lose from non - intervention than do healthy individuals considering whether to employ ceds . indeed , one might think that advancing dementia is amongst the worst fates that might befall a person . there is thus a case for tolerating much greater risk in devices intended to treat this condition than in ceds . king and collaborators also use the ventriculoperitoneal shunt example to suggest that it may not be practical to enforce the provision of evidence - based measures of efficacy to consumers for ceds . in response to this , we emphasize that we do not have in mind a requirement such that each manufacturer must perform a randomized controlled trial using their device . research investigating tdcs and tms in healthy adults is demonstrating efficacy , and we envisage that manufacturers should be required to show how their device complies with design parameters equivalent to those that have been shown in the scientific literature to produce enhancement effects . for example , devices with electrodes positioned in locations on the scalp that have no evidence of producing the particular effect claimed by the manufacturer should not be approved for sale alongside such claims . manufacturers must be able to identify a credible body of scientific literature that supports the claimed efficacy and safety , given the product 's characteristics  electrode location , stimulation intensity , duration , and so on . further , we agree with king , gavaghan , and mcmillan that manufacturers should be required to state clearly the lack of evidence for any unsubstantiated claims , if they are to be allowed to make them at all . kuersten and hamilton also comment on the risk  benefit assessment of ceds , and the standard to which we proposed they should be subjected . they argue that there is a lot of room for maneuver in the mdd to assess  acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits ( p. 346 ) . this is true , but we nonetheless think a framework for assessment is helpful , especially when the devices in question purport to offer  non - medical benefits , a concept for which medical device regulators have little precedent . indeed , we argued against adopting the approach originally suggested by the mhra for cosmetic devices , which is very risk - averse : according to their approach such devices must present  no or the minimum acceptable risk , as they confer no  clinical benefit. conceding that some framework could be helpful , kuersten and hamilton suggest that , because the concept of benefit is  nebulous , in the case of ceds , only risk should matter for pre - market approval . in fact , as discussed above , we are broadly in agreement with such a position  benefits become increasingly harder to quantify and assess as they move beyond the sorts of benefits that enable individuals to pursue the standard range of activities most people wish to pursue . for example , not being in great pain would count as a benefit for most people , regardless of what they valued , but a small improvement to mathematical ability , for example , would not permit such evaluative consensus . as noted above , our inclusion of regulatory consideration of benefits for moderately risky devices was intended only to refer to objective improvements  about which consumers should not be misled . for example , if manufacturers claim that their device improves , say , the user 's linguistic fluency , this is a claim that can be tested and measured objectively . beneficial such an objective improvement is to any particular person will vary depending on their goals , but there will be a fact of the matter about whether the device is able to confer such an improvement aside from the subjective question of how valuable this improvement might be . certainly , we would advocate regulating the claims that manufacturers make in relation to what their devices can achieve . however , far from our proposals being  overly paternalistic , we argued that where there was room for disagreement about how to quantify a benefit in relation to risks , regulation should err on the side of consumer freedom .", "further to their concerns regarding individuals abilities to weigh risks , fitz and reiner emphasize the remaining problem of  do - it - yourself ( diy ) users who , in constructing devices from scratch , will be afforded no protection by the regulation of direct - to - consumer devices . one of their proposals , with which we agree , is to bolster our recommendations with additional attempts at  active harm reduction. they suggest that members of the professional community could join together to create an  inclusive online community , where information could be gathered and disseminated with professional oversight . we are broadly sympathetic with much of what they propose and would support the creation of an inclusive online community , were there to be sufficient expert interest in creating and maintaining it . indeed , we are currently exploring how expert advice could be dispensed via existing fora , such as reddit . de ridder , vanneste , and focquaert also raise the problem of unsupervised use and suggest potential solutions in the form of age limits , safety - by - design , and requiring user licenses . we agree that the unsupervised use of ceds needs consideration , but do not agree that this should lead to their apparent conclusion that we should regulate the use of ceds rather than their placement on the market . the first task must be to ensure that the devices that people use ( unsupervised or otherwise ) are not unnecessarily dangerous or simply defective by design . this can be achieved for example through european medical device law , which focuses on premarket requirements and reporting on post - market experience , even though it does not regulate use ( apart from requirements related to the instructions the manufacturers must provide ) . there is no point carefully regulating use if the devices being used are not safe to begin with . further , the authors suggestion that ceds should be made safe by design requires enforcement beyond that granted by the general product safety directive , and this is precisely the sort of thing that could be achieved by a model of the sort we propose . de ridder , vanneste , and focquaert raise the concern that the societal benefits of enhancement might be lost if devices are in fact effective but regulated . in relation to this , we emphasize that the regulation we advocate is not akin to prohibition . to the extent that our proposals would prevent devices from being placed on the market , this would be limited to very dangerous devices or devices making implausible claims  hardly the sorts of devices that would confer net societal benefits . the important point that many other commentators on our model appear to overlook is that the effectiveness of brain stimulation techniques as a type of intervention does not guarantee the effectiveness of particular token devices claiming to be of this effective type . moreover , as low risk , effective devices are developed , these would be available under our proposal and a vigorous market will emerge . de ridder , vanneste , and focquaert raise concerns about the misuse of resources , which assumes a position markedly different from that which we set out in our paper . they argue , persuasively , that resources should be directed to the most important causes and that enhancements might not be of a high enough priority to warrant use of our limited resources . we agree that limited resources need to be allocated carefully , but our proposal does not threaten such allocation : the devices that would be prohibited under our proposal are ones that would certainly not warrant significant investment of public resources , and our proposal leaves open how resources should be allocated among those that would be permitted . perhaps de ridder and collaborators assumed us to be advocating the inclusion of ceds under the healthcare funding arrangements , but this is not what we envisaged . the extension to the scope of the mdd , as we recommend it , has no direct implications for the distribution of healthcare resources . relatedly , the authors ask whether the regulation of ceds requires new regulations regarding who can use them . again , the answer is for the most part no : our proposals merely affect what can be placed on the market for consumers to purchase . the only exception should be restrictions governing the use of ceds on children or vulnerable adults through contraindication labeling and the criminal law . in contrast , adult consumers will not need a prescription to purchase and use ceds on themselves . indeed , king , gavaghan , and mcmillan provide a compelling argument in their commentary for why medical practitioners should not serve as gatekeepers to cognitive enhancement . also of relevance to the question of the correct place of enhancement in healthcare , king , gavaghan , and mcmillan suggest that our reference to formally trained practitioners was not developed . we used this phrase in relation to the use of ceds in children and vulnerable adults , since our proposals envisaged that healthy adults would be able to directly purchase and use ceds , with no medical intermediary . they ask whether we envisage a further tier of regulation and raise a number of interesting points that would need to be addressed if medical professionals or those offering alternative therapies were to serve as gatekeepers to the use of ceds in such populations . they are correct that the regulation of such practice would indeed introduce a  further tier of regulation , and we acknowledge that this issue was not addressed in our original paper . however , we believe that the scope for the permissible use of ceds on children may be limited . further , neuromodulation offered to vulnerable adults overseen by medical professionals will primarily be governed by existing medical ethical guidelines , since such use is likely to be therapeutic and hence occurs within the clinical domain . in relation to children , king , gavaghan , and mcmillan are correct that further thought is needed to establish how use in adolescents should be controlled , and with whose oversight . however , ensuring the safety of devices that might be used for enhancement in children and placing controls on such use are separate issues and both are important . whilst our proposals were concerned with controlling which devices are sold directly to consumers , we agree that the regulation of services , especially those offered to children needs close attention .", "kuersten and hamilton object that we fail to cite much law on the remit of the mdd . the suggestion seems to be that this has left us underinformed . attempting to clarify the current regulatory situation , they say that instead of the definition of a medical device being the significant factor in the non - application of the mdd to ceds , ceds are instead unlikely to fall under the mdd because  manufacturers targeting the general market are discouraged from intending them  for a medical purpose ( which they argue manufacturers have  considerable latitude to do ) ( p. 344 ) . manufacturers are deterred , they say , because intending that a device be used for a medical purpose mandates costlier and more time - consuming requirements . we suggest that this is precisely the problem : manufacturers should not be able to evade regulation just because they deem it to be too burdensome . we are fully aware that it is the manufacturers intentions identifiable from the claims they make in relation to their products  that are instrumental in bringing a device within the definition of a medical device . we argue that , particularly in the case of brain stimulation devices , opting not to fall under the definition of a medical device should not be a possibility . however , kuersten and hamilton suggest that manufacturers intentions will in fact not matter once a new definition comes in to force , which will  specifically define a medical purpose. they cite the mhra 's overview of the current proposals for the current revision of medical devices legislation , proposals with which we are very familiar . they quote the document as follows , saying that the definition of medical purpose will  remove this decision from manufacturers : \n  [ m]edical device means any instrument , apparatus , appliance , software , implant , reagent or other article , intended by the manufacturer to be used alone or in combination , for human beings for one or more of the specific medical purposes of :  investigation , replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological process or state ( pp .   [ m]edical device means any instrument , apparatus , appliance , software , implant , reagent or other article , intended by the manufacturer to be used alone or in combination , for human beings for one or more of the specific medical purposes of :  investigation , replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological process or state ( pp .  , we suggest that it can not be seen how the manufacturer 's intentions become irrelevant ; on the contrary , they are referred to explicitly . further , rather than the indents defining medical purpose , the scope of medical purpose is constrained to the specific instances given in the indents . indeed , the consultation documents from the european commission and the uk 's medical and healthcare products agency underscore the continued relevance of the medical / non - medical purpose distinction in relation to devices that replace or modify anatomy : their proposal of a positive list ( in annex xv ) of implantable or other invasive devices without a medical purpose would be redundant if any replacement or modification of anatomy were to constitute a medical purpose . again , the indents in the definition of a medical device serve to constrain , rather than define , medical purpose . thus , we rely not only on the court of justice decision , but also on the interpretation of the mdd offered by the mhra and other european commission documents . kuersten and hamilton perhaps think that there should not be a gap , or may think that the definitions should be interpreted differently . but the fact is , given the way the definitions are currently being understood by the relevant parties , it will take more than the cited revised definition of a medical device to bring ceds within the scope of the mdd .", "we were gratified that our paper prompted so much discussion . in reading the commentaries and articulating our responses , it became apparent that the comments and critiques served foremost to highlight the modest scope of our original proposals . whilst we still believe that pre - market approval is highly important for ceds especially for those that transfer energy across the skull  the further proposals made in these commentaries serve to set an agenda for continued discussion of the optimum integrated policy response to ceds and , indeed , other new and emerging technologies designed for enhancement ."], "summary": "our ( 2014 ) model for the regulation of cognitive enhancement devices ( ceds ) received a great deal of interest from those involved in european device regulation and from academic commentators . further , since the publication of our recommendations , the number of manufacturers of brain stimulation devices for non - medical purposes has increased , underscoring the need for a regulatory response . in this paper , we clarify aspects of our original proposal and address additional regulatory issues beyond our original focus on the sale of devices . we begin with theoretical points pertaining to the definition of a ced and the distinction between treatment and enhancement . we then respond to practical challenges raised by the prospect of implementing our regulatory framework . next , we address some wider societal considerations relating to users and other stakeholders . finally , we revisit the broader regulatory context within which the various discussions are situated .", "ranking": [0, 3, 4, 1, 2]}

less forensic cases where the evidence dna sample does not match either a suspect s dna profile or any in a criminal dna database . in such cases , geographic information derived from crime scene samples is expected to reduce the potential pool of suspects by allowing police investigations to concentrate on specific groups of people , i.e. , those from a restricted geographic region . numerous human genetic markers have been suggested for inferring human genetic ancestry mostly to the continental level [ 47 ] , and a recent study indicated that inferring the subregion of origin of an unknown european may be feasible from autosomal genetic data . however , direct ancestry inference based on human genetic markers is currently far from perfect , initiating the question whether microbial dna may be used to supplement human dna markers in reliable ancestry reconstruction of unknown persons . recently , it has been shown that the gastric pathogenic bacteria helicobacter pylori has intimately coevolved with its human host [ 9 , 10 ] . although this example may be of limited direct relevance for forensics , because samples containing h. pylori are usually not found at crime scenes ( with the exception of bodies in cases of missing persons ) , it shows that in principle human geographic signatures are inferable from microbial genomes . the human skin is a complex microbial ecosystem consisting of multiple niches , which can differ drastically from each other . interactions between skin microbes and the human host , as well as between the microbial occupants , are still poorly understood . the current knowledge on skin microbiota primarily derives from cultivation - based studies [ 12 , 13 ] , although molecular fingerprinting techniques have been employed more recently [ 14 , 15 ] . if a comparable relationship exists between humans and their skin microbiota , as has been observed for h. pylori , new methods for human geographic origin determination could be developed based on dna analysis of fingertip microflora , with interesting new applications to molecular analyses of physical fingerprints left at crime scenes .", "volunteers and microbiological procedures five dutch european subjects from rotterdam and three volunteers from dhaka , bangladesh , placed their right index finger on a colombia iii blood agar plate ( biomerieux , marcy - letoile , france ) . fingerprint sampling for dutch volunteers was performed in rotterdam whereas that of bangladeshi volunteers was performed in dhaka . after washing this finger with hospital soap and air drying , another fingerprint , from the same finger , was placed next to the first . whereas the first fingerprint was expected to provide a mixture of transient and resident microbiota , the second one was assumed to provide resident microbiota only as soap removes the upper dead - skin layers including their transient microflora . after overnight incubation at 37c , colonies with different morphologies were isolated , with 20 per fingerprint ( two each ) from the five dutch individuals ( n  =  200 strains ) . three weeks later , this procedure was repeated for assessment of bacterial persistence in the dutch volunteers . agar plates from bangladeshi volunteers were shipped by courier to rotterdam after overnight incubation at 37c for further analyses . given the diversity in genotypes encountered in the time - wise resampling experiments using dutch volunteers ( see below ) , this procedure was not repeated for the volunteers from bangladesh . gram staining and the determination of catalase activity were applied for the identification of staphylococci using commercially available test kits ( biomrieux , marcy - letoile , france ) . staphylococcus epidermidis sensu stricto was identified among the isolates by a species - specific polymerase chain reaction assay as described elsewhere . a coagulase test with slidex staph plus ( biomrieux , marcy - letoile , france ) was performed to detect staphylococcus aureus isolates . were classified with the i d 32 staph api system ( biomrieux , marcy - letoile , france ) . genotyping bacterial isolates in order to generate dna fingerprints for the most relevant bacterial isolates , all staphylococcal isolates were subjected to pulsed - field gel electrophoresis ( pfge ) . pfge can be used to electrophoretically separate dna restriction fragments ranging in length between 50 and 1,000  kb . after lysostaphin and proteinase treatment and smai macrorestriction , pfge was performed in a 1% incert agarose ( fmc ) gel in 0.5 tbe at 14c , using a constant electric field of 6  v cm with pulse ramping from 0.1 to 30  s at a 60/60 angle for 18  h. pfge patterns were analyzed for levels of similarity with bionumerics 4.5 ( applied - maths , sint martens latem , belgium ) .", "developing forensic dna markers for human host inferences from physical fingerprints relies on the examination of the transient exogenous microflora left behind together with the physical fingerprint . however , any human host inference from fingertip microflora using physical fingerprints would require that the transient microflora is representative of the resident endogenous microflora of the same individual and is not simply reflecting microbial species / strains picked up from the environment . to test this prerequisite , we investigated and compared by means of dna fingerprinting techniques the transient superficial skin microbiota and the resident endogenous microflora of human fingertips within several individuals . in addition , we collected data at two time points to investigate time - wise microflora persistency within individuals . to this end , we used samples from five dutch volunteers and gram staining as well as catalase activity testing revealed that all bacterial skin isolates that were selected were gram - positive cocci . most isolates were staphylococcus spp . , a small number of colonies represented micrococci ( ~5% of total isolates ) , and the vast majority ( 97% ) of staphylococci were coagulase negative . healthy skin is known to harbor gram - positive pleomorphic bacilli , including corynebacterium , brevibacteria , and propionibacteria sp . , but these were not detected here . pfge is the most discriminatory typing method that is currently available for typing of staphylococci . transient microflora ( tm ) was collected from physical fingerprints before washing with soap and endogenous microflora ( rm ) after soap washing ( see  materials and methods  the tm showed higher numbers of pfge types than those seen in the rm in three of the five dutch subjects ( table  1 ) . this can be explained by nonendogenous species picked up from the environment and being transferred . significant variability between the subjects was seen for both the tm and rm , as has been previously reported for other skin areas [ 10 , 13 ] . notably , the rm types encountered after washing were very similar intraindividually but very different interindividually . this suggests that certain types of bacteria are able to efficiently and persistently colonize the skin of a given individual . within the rm , all dutch subjects had one or two dominant types , mostly staphylococcus warneri species . these types were also present within the tm of three of the five subjects , while s. epidermidis was present at various time points in all of the subjects tm . only one subject ( subject 1 ) showed the major rm type as the major tm type . in several subjects , the dominant rm type did not appear at all in the tm , although there was considerable overlap in nondominant species between the tm and rm in many subjects . in general , pfge types within the rm and within the tm for the same subject appeared consistent over time . although the degree of variability changed in the 3-week period for every subject , in some subjects , it changed more drastically than in others . at time point 1 , overlapping pfge types were seen in four of the five subjects in the tm and rm . however , by time point 2 , only one subject ( subject 4 ) showed any overlap . in one subject ( subject 4 ) , the major rm type did not occur in the tm of the same sampling time point 2 but was present in considerable frequency in the tm of the earlier time point 1 . thus , although we see some resemblance between rm and tm as well as some time - wise consistency , the pattern detected is far from perfect . by viewing our results only qualitatively ( ignoring type frequencies ) , rm signals were detectable from the tm analyses in only 50% of the dutch experiments ( combining individuals and time points ) , which appears discouraging as basis for developing molecular markers for forensic applications to infer individual host information . \n table  1staphylococcus species and pfge types from dutch fingerprints before washing with soap representing elements of the transient ( tm ) microflora and after washing representing resident fingertip microflora ( rm ) staphylococcus species and pfge types from dutch fingerprints before washing with soap representing elements of the transient ( tm ) microflora and after washing representing resident fingertip microflora ( rm ) we chose geographic inference as a test example for the type of human host information that would be interesting to retrieve from physical fingerprints by means of microbial dna analysis for forensic applications . a prerequisite for developing microbial skin markers for inferring human geographic origins would be that the endogenous fingertip microflora of humans from different parts of the world shows differences in their genetic diversity and that retrievable microbial genotypes cluster according to geographic origin of the host individuals . to test this , we obtained fingerprint microflora from native inhabitants of bangladesh collected in dhaka , bangladesh , and compared their microbiological profiles with those of the dutch volunteers . fingertip microflora of three bangladeshi volunteers were isolated and processed in the same manner as for the dutch volunteers , although only at one time point ( three individuals , two fingerprints each and 20 bacterial isolates per fingerprint , hence 3    2    20  =  120 strains ; table  2 ) . correspondence between rm and tm was observed in two of the three subjects for one pfge type , although the persistent pfge type found differed between the subjects . notably , subject 3 from bangladesh showed an unexpectedly higher variety of staphylococci in the rm compared to tm . comparing pfge types between dutch and bangladeshi subjects revealed some differences , e.g. , bangladeshi skin microbiota contained less s. warneri and much less s. epidermidis types compared with the dutch ones . were found among the tm in bangladeshi ( 45% ) than among the dutch ( 7% ) . furthermore , none of the pfge types from the bangladesh fingerprints were seen in the dutch collection , indicating extensive geographic heterogeneity within the staphylococcus species . however , when each pfge type obtained during this study was subjected to dice - based cluster analysis for visualizing geographic structure in the skin staphylococci ( see supplementary material fig .  1 ) , the bangladeshi pfge patterns efficiently mixed with the dutch ones . hence , information about geographic origin of the dutch and bangladeshi donors was not obvious among genotype data of the staphylococci inhabiting the human fingertip skin . although in general a limited number of five and three persons tested would not allow for cluster analysis , the full absence of clusters as identified in the present study already shows that individual geographic inferences for forensics purposes is not possible using the approach employed here . \n table  2staphylococcus species and pfge types from bangladeshi fingerprints before washing with soap representing elements of the transient ( tm ) microflora and after washing representing resident fingertip microflora ( rm ) staphylococcus species and pfge types from bangladeshi fingerprints before washing with soap representing elements of the transient ( tm ) microflora and after washing representing resident fingertip microflora ( rm ) to conclude , we see only limited geographic differentiation between microbial dna fingerprints from dutch europeans and bangladeshi south asians , indicating that geographic inferences of human hosts from fingertip microbial dna analysis is not feasible . furthermore , our results from dna profiling of transient and resident fingertip microflora show that human fingertip microflora is too dynamic and thus does not fulfill the criteria required for forensic marker developments to infer any human host information from physical fingerprints .", ""], "summary": "human fingertip microflora is transferred to touched objects and may provide forensically relevant information on individual hosts , such as on geographic origins , if endogenous microbial skin species / strains would be retrievable from physical fingerprints and would carry geographically restricted dna diversity . we tested the suitability of physical fingerprints for revealing human host information , with geographic inference as example , via microbial dna fingerprinting . we showed that the transient exogenous fingertip microflora is frequently different from the resident endogenous bacteria of the same individuals . in only 54% of the experiments , the dna analysis of the transient fingertip microflora allowed the detection of defined , but often not the major , elements of the resident microflora . although we found microbial persistency in certain individuals , time - wise variation of transient and resident microflora within individuals was also observed when resampling fingerprints after 3  weeks . while microbial species differed considerably in their frequency spectrum between fingerprint samples from volunteers in europe and southern asia , there was no clear geographic distinction between staphylococcus strains in a cluster analysis , although bacterial genotypes did not overlap between both continental regions . our results , though limited in quantity , clearly demonstrate that the dynamic fingerprint microflora challenges human host inferences for forensic purposes including geographic ones . overall , our results suggest that human fingerprint microflora is too dynamic to allow for forensic marker developments for retrieving human information.electronic supplementary materialthe online version of this article ( doi:10.1007/s00414 -

{"id": "PMC3399300", "section_names": ["INTRODUCTION", "METHODS", "RESULTS", "DISCUSSION", "CONCLUSION"], "document": ["hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) is a major public health problem all over the world ; it is currently estimated that about 85% of those infected with hepatitis c virus will become a chronic carrier and may develop severe end stage liver diseases including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma . currently , the most important risk factor for infecting by hepatitis c is intravenous drug use ( idu ) which is the most associated with the sharing of drug injection equipments especially needles , syringes and other paraphernalia . infection with hcv among prison inmates is usually higher than that among the general population mainly because of past history of intravenous drug use and possibly high risk addiction - related behaviors in prison . during the last few years , much attention has been given to the prevalence of blood born diseases including hepatitis c among prisoners . according to limited research studies in iran , prevalence of hcv infection among prisoners with a history of drug injecting varies between 31.5% to 47% in different parts of the country.[68 ] however , a study in a local prison in fars province revealed 78% prevalence rates of hcv infection among incarcerated drug users . to address the often hidden phenomenon of hcv infection in prisons , considering the limited data on the epidemiology of hcv infection and related risk behaviors in our region , in this study we have focused on this infection and transmission risk factors among prisoners with history of idu in isfahan that could potentially be incorporated into current and future harm reduction initiatives us in iran .", "in a cross - sectional study , according to self - report and confirm by head of prison 's healthcare , the prison inmates who had intravenous drug history or current idus entered into study at march 2009 . since the most of our enrollees had sclerosis in peripheral vessels , blood sampling was mostly taken from the femoral vein by the health personnel of the prison setting . blood samples were then sent to the laboratory of infectious diseases research center during 3 hours in cold box to be tested by eilsa ( diapro - italy ) for the presence of hcv antibody . incarcerated with idu histories were also asked about their demographic characteristics and hcv - related risk behaviors with an interviewer assisted questionnaire . face and content validity of the questionnaire were evaluated by specialists and its reliability was confirmed by chronbach alpha = 0.74 . the research protocol was approved by the ethical committee of isfahan university of medical sciences in iran . all available means were used to guarantee privacy during interviews and confidentiality . instead of a block for the patient 's name , each questionnaire and test tube had an anonymous identification code , which was used for reporting laboratory results , too . statistical analysis was performed using spss for windows ( version 16.0 , 2007 , spss inc , chicago , il , usa ) . univariate analysis was used to assess association between being hcv positive and related risk factors . the variables that were significant in the univariate analysis ( p - value < 0.05 ) were included in the multiple logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratio ( aor ) and 95% confidence intervals ( ci ) .", "a total of 943 incarcerated idus ( 938 male and 5 female ) participated in the study . the median age of participants was 32.6 years ( range : 18 - 67 ) . the majority of participants ( 98.6% ) were iranian and 523 ( 55.5% ) had ever been married . among the married persons 451 ( 92% ) had been married once , 35 ( 7% ) had been married twice and 5 ( 1% ) had been married more . 143 ( 15.1% ) cases mentioned a history of traveling to another countries . the socio - demographic characteristics of participants overall , the prevalence of hcv - ab seropositivity was 41.6% [ table 1 ] . the median frequency of iv injections was 30 times per month ( range 1500 ) , the median duration of addiction was 12 years ( range 0.5 - 57 ) , the median frequency of incarceration was 3 times ( range 1 - 37 ) , and the median of total duration of incarceration was 3.66 years ( range 0.08 - 35 ) . frequency of hcv transmission related factors within study population 71.76% of the participants had illegal sex ( contact with other than spouse ) . among whom , 43% of men had history of having sex with another man ( msm ) , 64.2% had an intercourse with commercial sex workers and 30.9% of them had idu sexual partner . according to self reports , only 31% of them had ever used a condom during sex . within all studied samples with idu history , 13.3% had a single sexual partner and the others had 2 or more , in their lifetime . table 3 shows the odds ratio for some risk characteristics of idus using the logistic regression model .", "the results of this study indicated that overall prevalence of hcv ab seropositivity among idu inmates in isfahan province is 41.6% . in similar studies in iran , similar results were observed . in zakizad study , the seroprevalence of hepatitis c infection in sari addict prisoners has been reported as 30.8% . in another study by khani et al . the prevalence of hcv was 47.7% among drug addict prisoners in zanjan . in a study which was done in 3 provinces in iran ( isfahan , chahamahal bakhtiary and lorestan ) in 2003 , 34.7% of male prisoners who had been imprisoned for various drug - related offenses including purchase or sale and consumption , were hcv ab positive . in mashhad , the seroprevalence of hcv in incarcerated idus had been reported as 59.4% . in mohammad alizadeh study , the hcv antibody positivity among drug abusers in the central prison of hamedan was 30% . in a study on drug abusers admitted to prison in guilan province , of 460 inmates , 45.4% were hcv antibody positive which in intravenous drug abusers the prevalence reached to 88.9% . the prominent aspect of our study in comparison with other similar studies in iran , is the high number of participants whom all of them had history of intravenous addiction . as a matter of fact , this is one of the first large prevalence studies of blood- born infections among incarcerated idus in iran . in this study , the history of shared drug injection inside prison was one of the main incarceration - related risk factors . this association , has also been reported in other studies in the world.[1315 ] it seems that , the lack of access new needle / syringe in prisons and consequently needle sharing practice is the main reason of the hepatitis c epidemic in prisoners . our data , highlight for comprehensive and integrated interventions for incarcerated idus to prevent hcv transmission among idu population and community . effectiveness of needle programs in reducing needle sharing among idus has been shown in many countries . in our country , an outreach program for blood born infections prevention was supported by the united nation and the ministry of health of iran in 2003 . multiple incarcerations was the another independent risk factor in our subjects which show that the high rates of arrests and incarcerations lead to drug - related offences or other confounding factors inside prison , such as violence . our findings suggest that preventive interventions are compelling now for idus to ensure their safe passage throughout incarceration . in our study , other important modes of transmission were frequency and length of drug injection . according to these results , harm reduction strategies need to be expanded to prevent new hcv infections , particularly among young injectors.[1920 ] in our study , history of marriage was a protective factor for hcv - infection in the subjects after controlling for all other variables in the logistic - regression model . sexual transmission could play a role in sporadic or community - acquired hcv infections . however , there is contradictory finding regarding the association between marriage and hcv infection in the world . vandelli and colleagues indicated that the risk of sexual transmission of hcv within heterosexual monogamous couples is extremely low or even null . it is shown that , those who have multiple sexual partners , including female sex workers , men having sex with men , and attendees of sexually - transmitted diseases ( stds ) clinics are the main risk groups for hepatitis c. in the acute hepatitis surveillance study in usa , 18% of newly infected individuals reported sexual contact with an hcv - infected person or multiple sexual partners as their only risk factor for hcv acquisition . for the individual with chronic hcv infection , the estimated risk of sexual transmission of virus was 0% to 0.6% per year for those in monogamous relationships , and 1% per year for those with multiple sexual partners . so , it will be useful to encourage young people to get married to prevent sexually transmitted diseases in our society .", "in conclusion , according to progressive reported prevalence rates of hcv in the world and the importance of the current and potential burden of hcv - related complications , it is important to primary prevention of hcv infection that will be addressed through implementation of safe injection practices . the mortality associated with hepatitis c is expected to double in the next 10 - 20 years . it is conservatively estimated that the direct costs related to hepatitis c will be $ 10.3 billion during the years 2010 - 2020 . the indirect costs of hepatitis c ( eg , the loss of productivity during that era ) are estimated to total another $ 54.3 billion due to premature death and $ 20.6 billion due to disability . in addition , the total cost of therapy for hepatitis c is estimated to be $ 10,000-$12,000 . so , primary prevention will be more cost - effective than secondary prevention of morbidity and mortality from hcv infection through provision of interferon - based therapy . it is good opportunities in prison to have large number of idus over longer period to do specific preventive activities such as needle / syringe exchange and counsel imprisoned idus ."], "summary": "objectives : hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection is a major public health problem worldwide with serious complications . according to the importance of intravenous drug use ( idu ) as the main risk factor for hcv infection and transmission and prison as the main source of risky behaviors , this study conducted to define hcv infection and related risk factors in prison inmates with history of idu in isfahan province , iran.methods:this is a cross sectional study which the prison inmates with idu history in voluntary basis were enrolled . a validated questionnaire was asked and blood sample was obtained from each subject for the presence of hcv antibody . odds ratio and logistic regression were used for data analysis and p -

( 2 ) we could expose amphipods to ch3hg and hg at environmentally relevant levels . ( 3 ) unlike radiometric tracer studies , this \n technique enabled hg species transformation to be traced throughout the experiment . because ae of ch3hg is much higher than that of hg , methylation of hg will increase \n availability to the biota . methylation \n occurs in anoxic zones in sediment and \n has also been observed in algal cultures . if hg speciation is not monitored \n during incubation in uptake experiments , bioaccumulation of hg species \n may be misinterpreted . enriched stable isotopes of hg species have \n been used as a powerful tool to study hg cycling and uptake into freshwater \n foodwebs . in this study , we applied the technique to identify trophic transfer \n of hg species from live phytoplankton in water and sediment compartments \n in estuarine benthic infauna .", "all solutions were made up \n using ultrapure water ( > 18 m cm ) produced \n by a purelabpluswater purifier ( us filter , ma , usa ) . enriched stable \n isotopes of hg ( as hgo , hgo , and hgo ) single isotope spikes of hg and hg were prepared by dissolution of \n hgo in hcl , followed by dilution to 400 mg / l in 5% hcl ( fisher optima \n grade , pittsburgh , pa , usa ) . solutions of ch3hgcl and ch3hgcl were synthesized by conversion \n of hgo to hgcl2 followed by \n reaction with methylcobalamin . stock \n solutions were diluted to 50 mg / l of ch3hg and 5 mg / l of ch3hg in \n 0.5% acetic acid and 0.2% hcl ( fisher optima ) . isotopic abundances \n of natural hg and the enriched isotope spikes are given in the supporting information . the marine \n phytoplankton species , i. galbana , \n was used as the food source for the ch3hg and \n hg exposures of l. plumulosus . cells of i. galbana were grown in \n a 19 l carboy of 20 ppt artificial seawater ( instant ocean prepared \n in ultrapure water ) to a density of 1.3  10 cells \n per milliliter and then reduced by centrifugation to 800 ml . the concentrated \n culture was then divided into four 200 ml solutions , and each algal \n solution was spiked with one isotopically enriched hg species . in \n experiment 1 ( ch3hg uptake ) , the suspensions \n were tagged with 2.5 g ch3hg or ch3hg and in experiment \n 2 ( hg uptake ) , with 34 g of hg or hg . the isotopically labeled \n cultures were allowed to equilibrate for 24 h and then spun down into \n pellets and the supernatant discarded . aliquots ( 1 ml ) of each cell suspension \n were removed and then centrifuged , and the resulting algal pellets \n were freeze - dried and weighed . the pellet and supernatant solutions \n ( both n = 4 ) were analyzed for ch3hg and thg , and the fraction of algal - bound hg was determined \n ( 94  1% for ch3hg , and \n 95  2% for ch3hg ; 98.1 \n  0.1% for hg and hg ) . concentrations of hg spikes in the algal slurries are \n included in tables 1 and 2 . leptocheirus \n plumulosus was purchased \n from aquatic research organisms ( hampton , nh ) and cultured according \n to epa method 1994 . similarly sized ( > 1 \n mm ) amphipods were retrieved from culturing tanks prior to the experiment \n and depurated for 4 h in salt water . microcosm \n experiments were conducted in \n 100 ml ( 5 cm diameter , 10 cm height ) glass jars ( qorpak , bridgeville , \n pa , usa ) . the \n organic carbon content was determined to be 3.2  0.1% by loi \n ( dry sediment was heated at 550 c for 4 h ) . for each experiment , \n 16 identical microcosms were assembled . in each microcosm , 1 ml of \n algal suspension containing enriched isotope ch3hg ( experiment 1 ) or hg ( experiment 2 ) was mixed \n with 16 g of wet sediment , and the other enriched isotope - tagged \n algae was mixed with 60 ml of 20 ppt artificial seawater ( table 2 ; henceforth isotopically enriched hg species are \n denoted by a subscript ( hgsed or hgwater ) indicating \n the compartment to which the spiked algae was added ) . the sediment \n was added to a jar ( 1 cm depth ) , along with 5 amphipods , and \n overlying water was added . microcosms were kept in an environmental \n chamber ( 20 c , 10:14 ( l / d ) h photoperiod ) , covered loosely with \n plastic to minimize evaporation , and slowly agitated on an orbital \n shaker ( 100 rpm ) to maintain aeration and suspension of algae . a water \n sample was taken from four microcosms immediately after assembly ( t = 0 ) ; then four microcosms were dismantled for analysis \n after 12 , 24 , 36 , and 48 h. this two - day time series was chosen to \n monitor relative accumulation of hg from different sources in amphipods \n over time , and to minimize the effects of algal death and decay on \n bioavailability of ch3hg and hg   associated with longer incubation \n periods . changes in hg concentration and speciation were monitored \n in whole and filtered water and sediment throughout the time series . \n a second set of microcosms was assembled under the same conditions \n but using algae suspensions not spiked with hg species , to monitor \n dissolved oxygen ( do ) , ph , and oxidation reduction potential ( eh ) \n throughout the experiment . results are reported in the supporting information ( si ) . to dismantle \n microcosms after each time point , a 15 ml aliquot was filtered \n through a 0.45 m poresize 25 mm syringe tip filter ( fisherbrand ) , \n and a second 15 ml sample was collected unfiltered . both filtered \n and whole water samples were acidified to 0.5% hcl ( fisher optima ) . \n amphipods from each microcosm were removed from the sediment by pasteur \n pipet and thoroughly rinsed in two sequential water baths and placed \n in a preweighed 15 ml glass vial ( i - chem ) . sediments were removed \n from the microcosm jars and placed in 60 ml pfa vials ( sarstedt , nmbrecht , \n germany ) . amphipod and sediment samples were freeze - dried ; all concentrations \n are reported on a dry weight basis . all sample containers were double \n bagged and stored refrigerated in the dark until analysis .", "freeze - dried \n amphipod samples were weighed and extracted in glass vials . to each \n vial , 1.5 ml 4 m hno3 was weighed , and samples were heated \n overnight at 60 c . a 50 l \n aliquot of each extract was transferred to a 40 ml amber glass vial \n with teflon - lined septa ( brooks rand laboratories , seattle , usa ) . samples ( 8 ml ) of filtered and whole overlying \n water were weighed into 40 ml vials . portions ( 0.5 g ) of freeze - dried , \n homogenized sediment samples were leached with kbr / h2so4/cuso4 , extracted into ch2cl2 , then back extraction into 10 ml water ; then 2 ml of the extract was weighed into 40 ml glass vials . samples were buffered and derivatized , then analyzed using \n a merx - m methylmercury analysis system ( brooks rand laboratories , \n seattle , usa ) coupled with a 7700x agilent icp - ms ( agilent technologies , \n santa clara , usa ) ; the details of this technique are given in taylor \n et al . isotope deconvolution was used \n to separate hg species derived from three sources : the ambient hg \n in the sample ( determined from the hg signal ) and hg \n inputs from two enriched hg - tagged algal spikes added to the water \n and sediment compartments . external calibration was \n performed using six standards ( 0.025 to 25 ng / l ) , and a secondary \n source calibration check was analyzed every 10 samples . method detection \n limits ( mdl ) were 0.05 ng / g ( sediment ) , 5 ng / g ( amphipods ) , and 0.13 \n ng / l water . recoveries for ch3hg were 85  13% ( n = 2 ) in bcr-580 estuarine sediment ( irmm , geel , belgium ) \n and 106  10% ( n = 3 ) in nist 2976 mussel ; spike \n recoveries in water were 99  5% ( n = 5 ) . quantification of total \n hg from biological tissues was determined from 4 m hno3 extracts . aliquots ( 0.5 ml ) of amphipod \n extracts were diluted 10 times by weight and analyzed directly by \n icp - ms ( agilent 7700x ) , with a mdl of 20 ng / g . portions of sediment \n samples ( 0.25 g ) were weighed into 60 ml pfa tubes ( sarstedt ) and \n 5 ml of 45% hno3 : 5% hcl v / v was added to each tube . samples \n were digested in an open vessel microwave ( mars xpress , cem corps , \n matthews , nc , usa ) at 95 c for 1 h. digested samples were diluted \n to 50 ml with ultrapure ( 18 m ) water , and weighed , then analyzed \n by icp - ms , with a mdl of 0.1 ng / g . signal intensities were deconvoluted \n ( si ) prior to conversion to concentration \n by external calibration . recovery of standard reference materials \n nist 2711a ( n = 2 ) and nist 2976 ( n = 3 ) were 80  1% and 115%  11% , respectively . filtered and whole overlying water and supernatant samples from algal \n suspensions were analyzed by cold vapor - icp - ms , using an automated \n merx  t purge and trap system ( brooks rand ) coupled with icp - ms \n based on epa method 1631 . samples ( 8 \n ml overlying water or 0.4 ml supernatant ) were weighed into 40 ml \n clear glass vials with teflon - lined septa ( brooks rand ) and diluted \n to 25 ml with 1% hcl . samples were digested overnight in capped vials , \n by the addition of 0.1 ml freshly prepared brcl ( 0.16 g kbr was dissolved \n in 15 ml hcl , then 0.38 g kbro3 added and stirred for 1 \n h ) . to each sample , 0.1 ml sncl2 and 0.1 ml hydroxylamine \n ( brooks rand ) were added , then vials were recapped for analysis . bioaccumulation \n factors ( baf ) were calculated for each uptake pathway to normalize \n body burden to different exposure concentrations . body burdens of \n isotopically enriched hg from 36 and 48 h time points were divided \n by sediment concentrations in each microcosm ; e.g. , in experiment \n 1 , baf for ch3hgsed was calculated as the concentration of ch3hgsed ( ng / g ) in amphipods relative to its \n concentration in sediment . metal accumulation from ingestion has been described \n by the model \n in eq 1(40,41)1where the body burden of a metal species taken \n up from food , css , is calculated from \n the metal concentration in food ( cf ) , \n the assimilation efficiency of the metal species ( ae , unitless ) , the \n ingestion rate , ir ( mg food / g body wt / d ) , the metal efflux rate constant \n following uptake from food , kef ( 1/d ) , \n and the growth rate constant , g ( 1/d ) . the equation \n was rearranged to calculate ir . reported values of ae ( ch3hg = 80% , hg = 6% ) , kef ( ch3hg = 0.052 d , hg= 0.089 d ) , and g ( 0.07 d ) for l. plumulosus were applied , and \n concentrations of isotopic tracers in algae cf and amphipods css were used to \n distinguish ingestion from benthic and pelagic sources . nonparametric \n analyses were chosen because distribution could not be ascertained \n due to small sample sizes . significant trends in spike concentrations \n in sediment , water , and amphipods with time were assessed by kruskal  wallis \n rank tests ; specific differences in concentration between time points \n were determined using the mann  whitney rank sum statistic .", "using the two enriched isotopes , \n ch3hg concentrations \n from spiked algae added simultaneously to the water column and sediment \n were tracked in the sediment , water column , and in amphipods over \n time ( table 1 ) . for sediment , differences in \n concentrations of both enriched isotope hg species were not significant \n between time points ( kruskal  wallis : d.f . \n = 3 , p > 0.05 ) , so data for all time points were \n pooled for each experiment . only 0.2% of the recovered ch3hgwater was suspended in the \n water column after 12 h , whereas concentrations of ch3hgwater and ch3hgsed in the homogenized sediment samples \n were similar . variation in ch3hg tracer \n levels occurred in the water column between time points ( table 1 ) . levels of ch3hgwater in the initial whole water sample ( t = 0 ) were elevated and variable between microcosms . concentrations \n of ch3hgwater decreased \n from 0 to 24 h and then reached a steady state between 24 and 48 h \n ( mann  whitney u , p > 0.05 ) . in the filtered \n water fraction , low levels of \n the ch3hgsed tracer \n were also present in the water compartment . enriched isotope \n ch3hg tracers were present \n in amphipods after 12 h ( figure 1 ) , and concentrations \n of both tracers in amphipods did not vary significantly across time \n series ( kruskal  wallis , d.f . = 3 , p > 0.05 ) , although variance between replicates at each \n time point was large ( 1646% ) . body burdens of isotopically enriched ch3hg tracers in l. plumulosus over time \n ( experiment 1 ) . the two \n enriched isotopes of hg were tracked over time in microcosms \n ( table 2 ) . as with experiment 1 , both tracers \n were present in the bulk sediment , including 99.9% hg - tagged \n algae added to the water column . concentrations of hg tracers in sediment did not vary with time ( kruskal  wallis d.f.= 3 , p > 0.05 ) , whereas tracer concentrations \n in the whole water fraction were variable . whole water samples were \n elevated in hgwater at t = 0 ( mann  whitney u , z = 2.3 , p = 0.02 ) immediately following the addition of spiked algae \n to the surface water but reached an apparent steady state from 24 \n to 48 h ( p > 0.05 ) . concentrations of hgwater in the filtered water were also highly \n variable at t = 0 but did not change significantly \n from 0 to 48 h ( kruskal  wallis , d.f . methylation of the hg spikes was evident during incubation \n of the i. galbana suspensions ( table 2 ; 0.70.8% ch3hg ) . \n the % ch3hg of tracers in sediment increased \n slightly relative to the starting algal suspension ( mann  whitney \n u , % ch3hgsed : z = 2.5 , p = 0.01 ; % ch3hgwater : z = \n 2.0 , p = 0.04 ) . the % ch3hg in \n the hgsed tracer , mixed with \n the sediment , was slightly higher than in the hgwater tracer initially added to the water column ( mann  whitney \n u , z = 2.2 p = 0.03 ) , although \n variability in % ch3hg in tracers among microcosms \n was high ( rsd = 5863% ) . in the whole and filtered water samples , \n % ch3hgsed was higher \n than in the algal suspensions ( table 2 ) prior \n to addition to the sediment ( mann  whitney u , z = 2.5 , p = 0.01 ) . in the overlying water , \n % ch3hgsed was not \n significantly different than in the sediment ( p > \n 0.05 ) . there was no difference between % ch3hgwater in the water column and in the algal \n suspensions or sediments ( p > 0.05 ) . neutral ph \n ( 8) \n and oxic conditions ( do > 6 mg / l ) in the sediment and water column \n were maintained over the time course under these experimental conditions \n ( si ) . body burdens of isotopic tracers \n in amphipods , as thg , ch3hg , and % ch3hg are shown throughout the time \n series in figure 2 . ambient thg in amphipods \n ( from hg ) was 15 ng / g with 39  12% ch3hg ( all time points ;

hgsed ( as % ch3hgsed ) . because 99.8% ch3hgwater and 99.9% hgwater added to the water column were recovered \n in the bulk sediment , bafs for both enriched isotopes were calculated \n as body

of pelagic origin \n was 23 higher than from algae mixed with the sediment . \n for experiment 2 , bafs for hg were 0.9  0.2 for hgsed and 5.8  2.0 for hgwater , and bioaccumulation from \n settling algae was only 6 higher than for sediment sources . for the ch3hg experiment , \n ir was determined to be 65 mg / g / day from ingestion of \n algae added to the water column and 3.1 mg / g / day for ingestion of \n algae mixed in with the sediment . for the hg experiment , \n ir was 30 mg / g / day for algae originating in the water column and 5.2 \n mg / g / day for sediment feeding . the ir is a measure of the milligrams \n of food consumed ( per body wt / day ) and should not vary with metal \n species , although its calculation does depend on the accuracy of the \n applied constants ( ae , kef , g ) as well as the experimentally derived food concentration and body \n burden .", "microcosm studies using \n enriched stable isotopes showed trophic \n transfer from sedimenting algae was a major source of hg to benthic - dwelling \n amphipods . this suggests that newly deposited phytoplankton is an \n important and potentially overlooked source of hg to benthic infauna \n in ecosystem studies and toxicity testing . enriched stable \n isotopes are a powerful tool for studying accumulation \n of hg in aquatic food webs ; we applied this technique to a microcosm study to compare trophic \n transfer of hg by two ingestion pathways . microcosms were scaled down \n from recommended conditions for culturing l. plumulosus , to minimize the quantity of enriched isotopes needed , but maintaining \n recommended amphipod densities ( < 1.5 cm ) , sediment \n depth ( 1 cm ) , and water conditions ( 20 ppt , 20 c , do > 4.4 \n mg concentrations of ch3hg and thg in sediments and whole surface waters \n in microcosms \n were within ranges found in new england and estuaries worldwide , although dissolved \n water concentrations were slightly higher . body burdens of hg from \n tracers were up to 6 higher than those found in new england \n estuaries ( chen , unpublished : 17105 ng / g ) . in estuaries , \n sediment characteristics \n and food quality have been shown to affect ae and kef in amphipods , as well as survival \n and reproduction , but specific effects \n on amphipod feeding behavior have not been reported . because amphipods \n feed selectively , behavior may change with habitat and food availability . \n accumulation of hg species from sediment mixed with algae was shown \n to be higher than from sediment alone , suggesting the abundance of high quality food spiked with hg in \n this experiment may lead to higher accumulation in amphipods than \n in a natural environment . homogenized sediment and standardized conditions \n used in this experiment allow for direct comparison of metal accumulation \n from different feeding modes under optimal conditions . algae \n added to the water column was rapidly deposited to the sediment \n surface , such that > 99.8% of ch3hg and hg were recovered from the \n bulk sediment \n within 12 h. concentrations of hg species added to the water column \n varied over time , due to settling of algae added to the water , and \n diffusion / suspension of tracers added to the sediment . variability \n between samples was high at initial time points due to the capture \n of large suspended particles during sampling . while sediment concentrations \n were similar for both tracers added to the microcosm , spiked algae \n originating in the water column was deposited to the sediment surface , \n whereas the spikes originating in the sediment were thoroughly mixed \n in the bulk sediment . tracking speciation throughout the experiment \n proved important \n as methylation of hg spikes was observed . in radiometric \n methods , hg species can not be distinguished , and species transformation \n alters the bioavailability of hg , which \n could lead to inaccuracies in uptake modeling . methylation of tracers \n was observed in spiked algal cultures ( 0.70.8% ) and has previously \n been observed in cultures of periphyton . further methylation was also \n evident during sediment incubation ( 23% ch3hg ) , despite maintaining oxic conditions throughout the experiment . \n this may also occur during toxicity testing , where sediment incubation \n conditions are similar to those used here , altering the bioavailability \n of hg to test organisms relative to natural environments . because \n the experiment focused on uptake , a short exposure duration \n was used to minimize artifacts from algal decay , water quality changes , \n and amphipod death / reproduction . the body \n burden of ch3hg reaches an apparent steady \n state after 12 h in this experiment , although variability at each \n time point was high , possibly due to feeding behavior , and to variable \n metal distribution in the algal food source . lawrence and mason reported \n an apparent steady state in amphipods sampled at three and six days , \n but calculated much longer exposures ( 50 day ) are needed to \n achieve equilibrium . the apparent steady \n state in body burden may be due to the long time intervals ( 12 h ) \n used in this study , relative to reported gut passage times of 35228 \n min for l. plumulosus fed i. galbana . longer exposure \n to hg sources may lead to higher accumulation if a true steady state \n was not reached in this experiment , but body burdens represent relative \n accumulations from different feeding pathways . because tracers were \n ingested simultaneously and prepared from the same algal source , ae \n and kef will be the same for both ingestion \n pathways . amphipods \n in this study were not depurated , although for ch3hg , this is likely to have little effect on the determined body \n burden due to its high ae where rate \n of loss from excretion is negligible relative to growth dilution . variability in body burden of hg tracers was high , \n likely due to spatial variability of tracers in both food sources . \n the body burden of hgsed increased \n significantly between time points , but hgwater did not . the pattern may be explained \n by preferential uptake of hgwater from settling algae during the first time interval ( t = 0 to 12 h ) , then increased consumption of hgsed as amphipods stir up sediment while they burrow . \n this may be explained by the \n higher ae of ch3hg ( 80% ) than hg ( 6% ) , causing hg to be \n excreted while ch3hg is mostly retained . this \n difference in assimilation should be consistent for both isotopic \n tracers , however , but was not significant for ch3hgwater . uptake \n of hg tracers initially added to the water column and deposited on \n the sediment surface was significantly higher than for tracers mixed \n in the sediment , suggesting ingestion from the sediment surface is \n the major feeding mode in amphipods . while bafs are useful to normalize \n body burden to different exposure concentrations , they can be difficult \n to evaluate between different food sources and habitats . in this study , \n because the same algal food source was added to both compartments , \n bafs were used to compare relative uptake from different sources . \n for both spikes , bafs were determined using concentrations in amphipods \n relative to the sediment ; this assumes that ingestion from the sediment \n surface or the bulk sediment were distinct uptake pathways and ignores \n accumulation from the water column . conversely , if both sediment sources \n of ch3hg were assumed to have the same baf , \n then bafch3201hg+ ( for bulk sediment ) could be applied \n to the concentration of ch3hgwater in the sediment compartment , to predict an amphipod \n body burden of 45 ng / g ch3hgwater . to \n accumulate another 625 ng / g of ch3hgwater from the fraction of algae suspended in the \n water , a 5 mg amphipod would have to ingest 3.9 ng of ch3hgwater ( assuming ae = 80% ) . \n whole water ch3hgwater concentrations were 2.7 to 16.5 ng / l ( 12 to 48 h ) , meaning that \n only 0.15 to 1 ng of ch3hgwater was available for uptake from the entire in 60 ml water \n compartments . similar calculations suggest amphipods would need to \n acquire 40 ng of hgwater from \n suspended algae to achieve determined body burdens , whereas only 1.54 \n ng of hgwater were present in \n the microcosms . only a small portion of hg spikes was present \n in the dissolved water fraction . lawrence and mason found an inverse \n effect of doc - binding on hg uptake and derived a laboratory - based \n relationship between doc concentration ( mg / l ) and water bioaccumulation \n factor ( wbaf ) : log wbafch3hg = 1.740.173[doc ] , where wbafch3hg is the \n concentration of ch3hg in amphipods ( ng / g wet \n wt ) divided by the dissolved concentration of ch3hg in the water column ( ng / l ) . using this equation , wbafch3200hg was estimated to be 7.5 for a doc concentration \n of 5 mg / l measured in this study . for a dissolved ch3hg concentration of 2 ng / l ( experiment 1 ; time \n points 12 to 48 h ) , amphipod concentrations are calculated to increase \n 100 ng / g ( dry wt , assuming 15% dry / wet weight ratio ) , which is less than 15% of the determined ch3hgbody burden . wbafhg2 + is reportedly \n 10 times lower than wbafch3hg , under the same \n conditions . ng / l ( experiment 2 ; time points 12 to 48 h ) , \n amphipod concentrations are calculated to increase 80 ng / g ( dry wt ) , \n which is also 15% of the determined body burden . uptake from both \n dissolved and suspended algae sources was therefore considered minor \n in this study , and while newly deposited algae may be considered part \n of the sediment , this study suggests accumulation was much higher \n from this new surface layer than from the bulk sediment . as \n expected , bafs for ch3hg were significantly \n higher than for hg . in phytoplankton , ch3hg accumulates predominantly in the cytoplasm of algal cells , \n whereas hg adheres to the cell membrane ; the fraction of metal in the \n cytoplasm is attributed with higher ae during trophic transfer . comparing the bioaccumulation of the two hg \n species , bafch3hg was relatively higher than \n bafhg for tracers originating in the water \n column than for sediment sources . uptake of ch3hg into the cytoplasm of phytoplankton only occurs in live cells , whereas \n both hg species are bound to the cell membrane in dead cells , causing lower assimilation of ch3hg during trophic transfer . accumulation of ch3hg in some invertebrates ( copepods ) was shown to decrease \n with decay of the marine algae , thalassiosira weissflogii ; however , ch3hg assimilation in l. plumulosis was not affected , which is thought \n to be due to this species being well adapted to detrital feeding . release of trace metals from decaying algae \n decreases exponentially with time and varies between elements . in this study , death and decay may have occurred \n more rapidly in the phytoplantkon mixed in the sediment , which would \n explain this relative difference , but the microcosm incubation time \n was relatively short ( 48 h ) , and algal decay has been shown not to \n affect ch3hg assimilation in amphipods . although amphipods were rinsed , residual particle \n binding may lead to adsorption of hgsed to the amphipod exoskeleton elevating apparent body burdens \n from the sediment . given that hg is strongly particle \n reactive , adsorption of hgsed to the exoskeleton may have been higher \n than for ch3hgsed , \n causing the relatively higher baf from sediment sources . to \n advance biokinetic modeling studies , ir for both feeding pathways \n of l. plumulosus were calculated . values \n of ir for surface feeding determined here are in reasonable agreement \n with values for suspension feeding determined from five different \n metal species using radiometric techniques ( 50 to 151 mg / g / day ) . in this study and in williams et al . , ir was \n calculated using values of ae determined by radiometric techniques , which may have led to overestimation of ae for \n hg if methylation of hg spikes occurred \n during incubation . this would lead to underestimation of ir , which \n was lower for hg than for ch3hg in both studies . no other studies report ir from deposit feeding \n in amphipods , although shlekat et al . reported a single measurement \n of 3 g / g / day , which is much higher than was observed here . this may reflect variation in feeding behaviors \n and effects of food substrate on test organisms . phytoplankton rapidly accumulate ch3hg , but rapid algal growth \n has been shown to dilute hg in algal food sources and therefore decrease \n uptake into higher trophic levels . deposition \n of phytoplankton blooms is a major source of organic carbon flux to \n sediment surfaces , and this study suggests \n deposited algae are a source of hg species to primary benthic infaunal \n consumers . in estuaries , increases in growth and reproduction of l. plumulosis have been correlated to chl \n a production associated with sedimenting algae . in a study of c - labeled \n tracers , however , phytodeposition was found to be a less prominent \n food source than microphytobenthos production for benthic fauna , including \n amphipods . however , the study also demonstrated that pelagic organic \n carbon sources were consumed during pulses which mimicked deposition \n of spring phytoplankton blooms . . \n turbulence and resuspension of sediment can increase transfer of sediment \n ch3hg into organisms , and sedimenting algal blooms have also been shown to increase ch3hg production in surface sediments . previously , bioavailability of hg species in \n estuaries has been inversely correlated with sediment organic matter . this study suggests hg in suspended and freshly deposited algal \n cells are an important uptake source , and that newly deposited algal \n particles should be distinguished from bulk sediment organic carbon \n as compartments controlling hg accumulation . in field collection , \n bulk sediments are typically collected from the top 4 to 15 cm . field \n collection of amphipods is reported within the top 57 cm of \n the sediment , but imaging of amphipod \n burrows in sediment incubations show the highest burrow volume within \n the top 1 cm of sediment . our findings \n suggest that amphipods feed primarily from the sediment surface , suggesting \n much smaller sampling depths ( < 1 cm ) are appropriate for assessing \n hg sources to benthic infauna . l. plumulosus are routinely used \n in both acute and chronic toxicity tests for estuarine sediments . in acute ( 10 d ) tests , sediments are the only food source , whereas \n during 28 day chronic toxicity tests , l. plumulosus are fed by an external uncontaminated food source 23 times \n per week . if in natural systems , algae \n originating in the water column are a preferred food source , these \n tests do not accurately assess exposure to contamination , as both \n tests overlook the influence of contamination originating in the water \n column , and acute toxicity tests ignore ingestion pathways completely . \n bioaccumulation varies with feeding behavior , suggesting uptake pathways \n in test organisms need careful investigation to relate to sediment \n and water quality criteria ."], "summary": "mercury \n is a widespread contaminant in marine food webs , and identifying \n uptake pathways of mercury species , ch3hg+ and \n hg2 + , into low trophic level organisms is important to \n understanding its entry into marine food webs . enriched stable isotope \n tracers were used to study benthic vs. pelagic pathways of ch3hg+ and hg2 + uptake via food to the \n infaunal estuarine amphipod , leptocheirus plumulosus . algal cells differentially labeled with isotopically enriched ch3hg+ or hg2 + were added simultaneously \n to the sediment and water column of microcosms , and hg species were \n monitored in amphipods and in sediment and water compartments . methylation \n of hg2 + occurred during the course of the experiment , enhancing \n the uptake of hg2 + spikes . trophic transfer of hg from \n algae added to the water column was determined to be the major uptake \n route for amphipods , suggesting inputs of contaminated organic matter \n from the pelagic zone are important to mercury bioaccumulation even \n in organisms living in sediments .", "ranking": [4, 0, 3, 1, 2]}

prot and both databases benefited from each other . many patterns were identified by annotating protein families in swiss - prot ( often before any description in the literature ) . prosite generated an immediate interest and it then grew regularly to reach 1000 entries 6 years later . such regions are typically enzyme catalytic sites , prosthetic group - attachment sites ( haem , pyridoxal phosphate , biotin , etc . ) , metal ion - binding amino acids , cysteines involved in disulfide bonds or regions involved in binding a molecule . but this syntax is very sensitive to any sequence  exception , whether due to a bona fide divergence or to a sequencing error . patterns are thus not adapted to identify less - conserved regions or whole domains . in 1994 , all profile methods are more or less statistical descriptions of the consensus of a multiple sequence alignment . they use position - specific scores for amino acids and position - specific penalties for opening and extending an insertion or deletion .  generalized profiles , compared to previous profiles ( 3 ) , use a more rigorous syntax for insertion , deletion and match states . generalized profile scores can be mapped to hmm parameters used by hmmer ( 4 ) . it is thus possible to convert an hmm profile into a  generalized profile format and several prosite profiles are in fact hmm profiles that were converted with the pftools program htop ( 5 ) . , prosite has provided extensive documentation and detailed annotation of domains , families and functional sites . this information was mainly stored in free text and used by biologists who read the various documents and made their own decisions on the function of their protein according to the prosite matches . but with the rapid growth of sequence databases during the last 10 years , there was an increasing need for a reliable tool that could generate automatically precise and accurate functional annotation in standard format . in 2005 , we decided to group some functional information stored in prosite in a database of rules that can easily be read by a program and applied on proteins that are recognized by prosite profiles ( 6 ) . the main characteristic of prorule is that it generates conditional annotation : the annotation is dependent on the presence of given amino acids at precise positions , on the occurrence of other domains or on taxonomic specificity . for example , an enzymatic active site is annotated only if the correct amino acid is found at the required position ( for an example of prorule , see figure 1 ) . as prorule uses prosite profiles that are mainly directed against protein domains , it is well adapted to annotate modular proteins . the swiss - prot group has also developed a complementary database of rules ( hamap ) , which uses the same format of rules but which is specific for well - conserved bacterial protein families ( 7 ) . \n niceview format from the prosite web page showing the different types of annotation that can be generated by prorule . the rule pru00298 is used to annotate proteins matched by the animal peroxidase profile ( ps50292 ) on the scanprosite web page . it can annotate comment lines , kw , go terms and various ft lines . in this rule , catalytic activity is generated only if the condition ftgroup(2 ) is fulfilled ( a h in the sequence must align with position 96 of the profile and a r with position 235 ) . to column in the features tables correspond to specific columns in the profile ( for more details on the prorule format see : ftp://ftp.expasy.org/databases/prosite/unirule.pdf ) . niceview format from the prosite web page showing the different types of annotation that can be generated by prorule . the rule pru00298 is used to annotate proteins matched by the animal peroxidase profile ( ps50292 ) on the scanprosite web page . it can annotate comment lines , kw , go terms and various ft lines . in this rule , catalytic activity is generated only if the condition ftgroup(2 ) is fulfilled ( a h in the sequence must align with position 96 of the profile and a r with position 235 ) . to column in the features tables correspond to specific columns in the profile ( for more details on the prorule format see : ftp://ftp.expasy.org/databases/prosite/unirule.pdf ) .", "a pattern or regular expression is a qualitative descriptor : it either matches or it does not . it does not produce a score that can help to estimate the significance of a match . there are currently various quantitative methods producing scores that are more efficient than regular expressions ( 8) , but patterns are still very popular because of their intelligibility for users , and because , when used to scan protein databases , they are not cpu expensive compared to quantitative methods . we thus still maintain patterns , but to make them more accurate , we have developed a new method to estimate the significance of their matches . a profile has been constructed and associated to each pattern and used to assign a status to pattern matches . when a pattern matches a protein , the corresponding profile is run on this protein and , if it is also identified by the profile , the match is tagged as true positive , otherwise the status is unknown . the advantage of this approach is that it does not influence the rapidity of the search algorithm and it keeps the user - friendly format of patterns . for each pattern , prosite maintains a manually curated match - list , in which a status is assigned to each pattern match on uniprotkb / swiss - prot entries . the status can be true positive ( tp ) , unknown ( ? ) , false positive ( fp ) , false negative ( fn ) or potential ( p ) . for each pattern , we have extracted the sequence of each tp match . as the efficiency of a motif descriptor is partly dependent on the size of the sequences in the seed alignment ( 9 ) , we have increased the length of each tp matched fragment . the average size of prosite patterns is 20 amino acids , and we noticed that it is difficult to construct good profiles smaller than 50 amino acids . we also did not want to increase too much the size of the profile as the scanning time of a profile is proportional to its size . starting with multiple sequence alignments of an average size of 60 amino acids is thus a good compromise . the sequences were then aligned with t - coffee ( 10 ) , the alignment was used to construct a profile for each pattern ( hereafter miniprofile ) and the miniprofile was then calibrated on a randomized protein database . if a prosite profile was already associated with a pattern and was of better quality than the automatically generated one , we used the prosite profile to assign the status . each automatically generated miniprofile was then tested on the corresponding pattern match - list and the cutoff calculated to recover all tp and no fp , and the maximum of fn . when a miniprofile did not recover all tp it was reconstructed with different profile construction parameters or different multiple sequence alignment programs ( clustalw and probcons ) ( 11,12 ) . when it was not possible to recover all tp , the cutoff was set just above the highest fp . the rule is that none of the miniprofile should recover uniprotkb / swiss - prot proteins tagged as fp with the corresponding pattern and indeed 95% of the profiles recover 100% of the tp and only 65 profiles do not recover all tp . since a miniprofile is always run on a subset of the database ( proteins matched by the pattern ) the e - value is always very low ( < 0.001 ) . even though miniprofiles were not designed to be scanned alone , and must be run on proteins matched by a pattern , 80% of the miniprofiles produce only matches with e - value bellow 0.01 ( n_score = 9 ) on uniprotkb . this subset of miniprofiles is thus safe enough to be run alone on a database of proteins . in our search algorithm , miniprofiles are run only on proteins matched by patterns , and this procedure does not drastically impact the calculation time . it takes about 10 min on 1 cpu ( pentium 4 , 3.4 ghz ) to run all the prosite patterns on the whole escherichia coli proteome ( 4339 protein sequences ) . it is also possible to download the different tools to use it locally from the prosite ftp site ( ftp://ftp.expasy.org/databases/prosite/tools/ ) .", "the sensitivity and specificity of descriptors can be enhanced by taking into account some contextual information , such as the co - occurrence of other domains , the position of a match in a protein , the taxonomic distribution , etc . such information can be used to promote some weak matches or to demote some irrelevant strong matches . prosite profiles normally use two cutoff levels , a reliable cutoff ( level = 0 ) and a low confidence cutoff ( level = 1 ) . the low - level cutoff covers the twilight zone where few true positives that can not be separated from false positives , might be present . by default , only matches higher than the reliable cutoff are shown . we have added a post - processing step in our scanning procedure , which allows the display of weak matches or the masking of strong ones according to the occurrence of other specific features in the protein . the required features for the post - processing step are stored in a new line type in the profile ( pp ) . we have defined three types of post - processing : \n when at least two matches overlap , only the one that has the highest score is reported . this is mainly used when two or more families are very closely related , like the different types of hth dna - binding domains , or when it makes sense to define subfamilies of a larger protein family ; for example the abc transporter family was subdivided into subfamilies to predict the type of transported substrate . the format is : pp /competes_hit_with : ps -

rays ( except third molars ) were 5331 teeth , 784 teeth ( 361 teeth for males and 423 teeth for females ) received endodontic treatments ( there was a radioopaque material in the root canals or pulp chambers ) . we recorded the type of the final fillings as following : type of coronal restoration \n no filling in 39 teeth ( 5%)filling in 320 teeth ( 42.1%)prefabricated post & filling in 26 teeth ( 3.3%)crown in 304 teeth ( 38.8%)post & crown in 85 teeth ( 10.8% ) . \n  no filling in 39 teeth ( 5% ) filling in 320 teeth ( 42.1% ) prefabricated post & filling in 26 teeth ( 3.3% ) crown in 304 teeth ( 38.8% ) post & crown in 85 teeth ( 10.8% ) . the quality of the final restorations and root canal fillings had been classified as : adequate or inadequate according to tronstad et al . inadequate coronal restoration : final restoration appears radiographically with overhang , open margin , recurrent caries , temporary filling or no filling . adequate root canal filling : all canals obturated with dense fillings ending about 2 mm shorter than the radiographic apex . inadequate root canal filling : root canal fillings end more than 2 mm shorter than the radiographic apex or grossly overfilled . periapical status was assessed by periapical index ( pai ) proposed by rstavik et al . 1986 , who scored the periapical area of the radiographic images as follows : \n normal periapical structures.small changes in bone structure.changes in the bone structure with little mineral loss.periodontitis with well - defined radiolucent area.severe periodontitis with exacerbating features . \n  normal periapical structures . according to this index we classified periapical tissue as : normal or healthy periapex : absence of radiographic evidence of diseased periapical tissues . the worst score of all canals was taken to represent the pai score for multicanal teeth . spss software was used for statistical analysis ( spss inc , chicago , il ) .", "out of 784 endodontically treated teeth , the mandibular molars were the most frequent treated teeth . 459 cases ( 58.54% ) had been classified as having adequate coronal restoration , and 325 ( 41.46% ) cases as having inadequate one [ table 1 ] . illustrate the type of the teeth in the study and the adequacy of the final coronal restoration in the 459 teeth with adequate final restoration , the status of periapical tissues was healthy in 353 teeth ( 76.9% ) and diseased in 106 teeth ( 23.1% ) . in the 325 teeth with inadequate coronal restoration , the status of periapical tissues was healthy in 169 teeth ( 52% ) and diseased in 156 teeth ( 48% ) [ table 2 ] . illustrate the status of periapical tissues according to the adequacy of final coronal restoration chi - squared test was used to evaluate the major differences in the status of periapical tissues according to the adequacy of final coronal restoration as illustrated in table 3 . evaluation of the major differences between studied groups statistical analysis revealed that the healthiness of periapical tissues affected by quality of coronal p < 0.01 [ table 4 ] . the effect of coronal restoration type on the status of periapical tissues the study showed that 72% of the cases with final restoration absence accompanied with a clear radiographic radiolucency . teeth with prefabricated post and filling or cast post and crown accompanied with periapical pathosis ( 38.5% and 31.8% ) respectively . overall , the post presented in 111 cases ( 14.1% ) , 74 cases accompanied with healthy periapical tissues and 37 cases with diseased tissues . endodontic treatments had been evaluated as adequate in 145 teeth ( 18.5% ) , and inadequate in 639 teeth ( 81.5% ) . when we compared the status of periapical tissues according to the adequacy of root canals fillings we noticed that 95.2% of the teeth were with adequate root canal fillings , and about 60.1% of the inadequate endodontically treated teeth were with healthy periapical tissues ( score one and two rstavik et al . periradicualr disease ( pai > 2 ) had been found in 262 teeth ( 33.4% ) . 7 cases of there were with adequate treatment and 255 cases were inadequate [ table 5 ] . the status of periapical tissues according to the adequacy of the root canal filling the difference in the number of teeth with healthy periapical tissues and adequate root canal filling were significant when compared to teeth with inadequate root canal filling . ( p < 0.001 ) . the impact of the adequacy of the coronal restoration and root canal filling on the status of periapical tissues had been studied ( separately and in concomitant ) . classification of teeth according to the adequacy of the final restoration and root canal filling in this study the status of periapical tissue were healthy in 96.6% of cases when both final coronal restoration and root canal filling were adequate . but the status of periapical tissues was healthy in 88.5% when only the root canal fillings were adequate and 70% when only the coronal restoration was adequate . the status of periapical tissue was healthy in only 48.8% of cases when both the endodontic treatment and the final restoration were inadequate [ table 7 ] . the effect of endodontic treatment and the final coronal restoration on the status of periapex for cases with both adequate restorations and adequate root canal filling , the success rate was 96.6% . healthy periapex was observed in 88.5% of the teeth with adequate root canal filling and inadequate restoration . when only the final restoration was adequate ( root canal treatment inadequate ) the success rate was 70% ( p = 0.04 ) . the difference when both the final restoration and the root canal filling were inadequate was significant when compared to the other three groups .", "this epidemiological study used x - rays to evaluate the presence of periapical radiolucencies , the quality of the root canal fillings and restorations with all limits of the 2 dimensional images . one of this study disadvantages is the inability to collect detailed information about the endodontic treatment : when it was done ? if the periapical pathosis is pre or post treatment disease ? whether the periapical periodontitis is healing or expanding ? in fact , radiographic image represents a snapshot of a continuous process of a dynamic disease . according to the study of petersson et al . the number of healed lesions equals the number of developed ones after 10 years of follow up , indicating the reliability of epidemological studies for recording the long - term success of endodontic treatments . this type of studies gave us valuable information about the level and development of dental practice in different periods , the common endodontic errors and the prevalence of periapical pathosis in subpopulations . to overcome the disadvantages of this type of studies , the sample was expanded and radiographs had been evaluated by using good illumination and magnification . all panoramic x - rays in this study were taken in dental school clinics of damascus university . many studies did not find significant differences between periapical and panoramic x - rays in evaluation of periapical pathosis . one of the most important questions is whether the study represents the syrian subpopulation ? to come up to an answer we should mention that dental school clinics of damascus university is one of the biggest dental clinics in damascus that offers consultations and treatments to so many people from damascus and its province . the criteria of sample selection was : the patient should have received his previous treatment outside dental school clinics ( by general practice dentists ) , did not receive any dental treatment for at least one year of attendance to give a chance for any radiographic radiolucency to be healed by that time . according to rstavik d ( 1996 ) 89% of lesions would heal after one year of endodontic therapy . the number of endodontically treated teeth was 784 teeth ( half of them were upper and lower molars ) . the prevalence of periapical lesions was about 33.42% , 58.5% of the coronal restorations were evaluated as adequate with different type of restorations , while 5% of the sample lost its restorations . the incidence of apical periodontitis associated with adequate coronal restorations was lower with significant difference than inadequate ones . the effect of the type of the coronal restorations on the status of periapical tissues was not crucial . in 111 cases out of 784 cases , some studies indicated that the presence of canal posts accompanied with higher percentage of periapical pathosis due to leakage during post space preparation or infrequent irrigation or weakening the remaining gutta percha . root canal filling was adequate in 18.5% of cases which is so low when compared to other studies that consider root canal therapy as predictable treatment . in this study , the correlation between periapical pathosis and inadequate root canal treatment was highly significant , other studies confirmed these results . when each factor ( root canal filling or coronal restoration ) was evaluated separately , it had a significant influence on periapical health ; in fact , these two factors are un separated . to evaluate which factor had the greater impact on outcome , we statistically analyzed the results of combination of these two factors . success rate ( the presence of healthy periapex ) scored in 96.6% of cases with adequacy of both factors and decreased to 88.5% in cases with adequate root canal fillings and inadequate coronal restorations but with non - significant difference ( it means that root canal treatment exert greater impact on outcome ) . in cases with adequate coronal restorations and inadequate root canal fillings success rate was recorded in 70% , which again indicates the importance of root canal filling in the success of the endodontic treatment . the worst results were obtained when both factors are inadequate which accompanied with lower successful results and high significant difference compared to all studied groups . that indicates the importance of a complete treatment ( adequate root canal filling and placement of adequate final coronal restoration ) .", "overall results indicate that the factor that plays the key role in the success of a treatment is the quality of root canal filling without neglecting the effect of the coronal restoration . the prevalence of periapical lesion in syrian subpopulation is high which indicate poor dental practice . thus , considerable efforts should be spent to improve the level of endodontic treatment and promote periradicular health ."], "summary": "background : the purpose of this study was to determine the status of periapical tissues of endodontically treated teeth according to coronal restorations and root canal fillings separately and in concomitant in adult syrian subpopulation.methods:784 endodontically treated teeth from two hundred randomly selected syrian adult patients were radiographically evaluated . according to predetermined criteria , the quality of coronal restorations and root canal filling of each tooth was scored as adequate or inadequate . the status of periapical tissues was also classified as healthy or diseased . results were analyzed using chi - squared test.results:adequate coronal restorations were determined in 58.54% of cases which was accompanied with less periapical pathosis than that in teeth with inadequate restorations ( p < 0.01 ) . 14% of teeth were restored by posts which showed no significant impact on the periapical tissues health . 18.5% of endodontic treatments were evaluated as adequate with less number of periapical radiolucencies than that of inadequate root canal fillings ( p < 0.01 ) . absence of periapical pathosis was 96.6% in cases with both adequate coronal restorations and root canals fillings . the rate was 88.5% in cases with only adequate root canals fillings , and about 70% in cases with only adequate coronal restorations . when the treatment was inadequate in both coronal and root canals fillings , success rate was only observed in 48.8%.conclusion : the most important factor with regard to the periradicular tissue health is the quality of root canal filling without neglecting the influence of coronal restoration ( regardless of its type ) . there is a high prevalence rate of periapical pathosis in syrian subpopulation due to poor dental practice .", "ranking": [4, 2, 0, 3, 1]}

invasive oxygen saturation for at least the first 48 hours . transient electric stimulation through epicardic wires was used for severe bradycardia or atrio - ventricular ( av ) block until restoration of heart rhythm . all symptomatic arrhythmic episodes or asymptomatic atrial fibrillation lasting more than 15 minutes at ecg monitoring were considered as poaf and included in the analysis . patients who did not recover sinus rhythm ( sr ) within 30 minutes were usually treated with intravenous amiodarone ( 300 mg in 1 hour followed by 900 mg/24 h e.v . electrical cardioversion was considered when sinus rhythm was not restored within 24 hours after the beginning of pharmacological treatment . perioperative complications including bleeding needing transfusion of at least 2 units of packed red blood cells and/or surgical revision , severe hypotension requiring amines ( norepinephrine , epinephrine , dobutamine or dopamine ) , and new onset av block or severe bradycardia requiring electrical stimulation were recorded . postoperative pericardial inflammation was diagnosed in the presence of pericardial rubs and/or ecg or echocardiogram signs of pericardial involvement . in the end , the study was approved by the ethic committee of our institution and all participants gave their informed consent . holter monitoring was performed every 3 months during the first year and thereafter every 6 months . primary end point of the study was the evaluation of recurrence of atrial fibrillation and related hospitalization ; secondary end points were all cause hospitalization and mortality . finally we evaluated the role of surgical technique ( cpb -

hospital outcomes . overall incidence of poaf during hospitalization was 24.4% ( 56 of 229 patients ) , 38 males and 18 females . patients who developed af after surgery were older than ones in stable sinus rhythm ( 70.5 vs 64.9 years , p=0.005 ) . poaf was not related to clinical indication to surgery ( elective vs urgency / emergency ) , number of diseased vessels or graft performed ( table 3 ) . comparison of clinical , echocardiographic characteristics and conduits used for grafting between patients with and without poaf according to surgical technique . * bleeding requiring transfusion at least 2 units of packed red blood cells or surgical revision . * * hemodynamic deterioration with the need to infuse amines . poaf = postoperative atrial fibrillation ; op = off pump ; cpb = cardipulonary -

blockers , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ace ) inhibitors / angiotensin a1 receptor ( at1 ) blockers and statins did not influence the prevalence of postoperative af . patients with af did not show a different prevalence of intra - aortic balloon pump use or treatment with vasopressors or inotropic drugs after surgery . transient electric stimulation after surgery was needed in 2 patients with poaf and in 3 who did not develop arrhythmias . multivariate analysis revealed that only antero -

cabg were on average 7 years older than cbp - cabg ( 74.3 vs 67 years , p<0.001 ) . length of hospitalization was on average 2 days longer in patients with poaf after cpb - cabg . the 56 patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation were followed - up for a median of 685 days . age was not significant different in those patients ( average age 72.5 vs 71.3 years ) . among those patients , preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction was not different in patients with af in comparison to patients without recurrence ( 48% vs 49% ) , while mean left atrium anterior - posterior diameter was respectively 42 mm and 40 mm . on average ultimately , in the last patient sinus rhythm could not be restored . at the end of follow up", "incidence of atrial arrhythmias after cardiac surgery has been reported to range from 10 to 65% . according to a large multi - centre study , poaf after cabg occurs in near 30% . several factors , including type of surgical procedure , patient demographics , criteria used for diagnosis and methods of ecg monitoring , may account for the wide range of poaf incidence reported in literature . dispersion in atrial refractoriness induces multiple local re - entry wavelets ; therefore , atrial fibrillation may be induced by several factors . among these : trauma from surgical dissection and manipulation , myocardial ischemic damage , an exaggerated local inflammatory response with or without pericarditis , an elevation in atrial pressure from post operative ventricular stunning a chemical stimulation due to postoperative support with catecholamine and other inotropic agents , a reflex sympathetic activation from volume loss , anemia or pain , parasympathetic activation , fever from atelectasis or infection , hypoglycaemia , metabolic and electrolyte imbalance , fluid overload , prolonged post operative electrical stimulation . cardiopulmonary by - pass related hemodynamic changes may induce intraoperative atrial ischemia that has been hypothesized to play a role in the development of poaf . .   reported at 6 months after surgery a significantly higher mortality in af patients compared with patients without af ( 9.4% vs 4.2% ) . .   showed in 6475 patients undergoing first isolated cabg that poaf was associated with at increased risk of death ( odds ratio = 1.5 ; 95% ci [ 1.3 , 1.8 ] ) . in this study , cumulative survival rate at 1 and 4 years was 87% and 74% in poaf patients versus 94% and 87% for non - af population . in more than 8500 isolated cabg patients a significantly increased risk of death was observed among those who developed postoperative af compared with those who did not ( odds ratio = 1.2 ; 95% ci , 1.1 to 1.3 ) . patients affected by postoperative af had an increased 1-year mortality ( 4.6% versus 2.0% ) , and af was confirmed to independently predict late mortality ( hazard ratio , 1.7 ; 95% ci [ 1.2 , 2.5 ] ) . results from present investigation do not support an association of poaf with an increase of late mortality in patients undergoing surgical revascularization . only one patient died at 2 years follow - up and not for cardiovascular cause . restoration of sinus rhythm in all patients during hospitalization and low recurrence rate may have significantly decreased the risk of mortality , in particular due to stroke or complications of oral anticoagulant treatment . decreased risk of ischemic damage in beating heart cabg initial favourable results [ 6 , 7 ] has not been confirmed by other authors [ 4 , 12 ] . siebert et al   during the postoperative intensive care unit stay reported a 9.8% rate of poaf in patients after cpb - cabg , 10.2% after op - cabg , and 21% after cabg combined with valve replacement . a recent meta - analysis suggested a decreased incidence of af in op - cabg although overall mortality was not affected . a not significant difference in the incidence of poaf between the two techniques was reported by several other studies [ 14 , 15 ] . two randomized , controlled trials and one large scale concurrent cohort study addressed the issue of beating - heart cabg . ascione et al   found a significantly lower rate of postoperative af in the op - cabg group ( 11.0% ) than in the cbp - pump cabg group ( 45.0% ) in 200 patients who had been randomized to undergo cabg either with or without cpb . a significant difference in postoperative af favouring the op - cabg group ( 21.2% ) compared to the on - pump cabg group ( 6.3% ) in contrast , in 281 patients randomized to cabg with or without cpb , van dijk et al   reported no difference in the rate of postoperative af . in patients undergoing emergency revascularization for acute coronary syndromes off - pump surgery vs cpb surgery was performed in patients with more severe clinical conditions : op - cabg patients were more frequently in cardiogenic shock , had an impaired renal function , a log euroscore > 20 or a left ventricular ejection fraction < 30% . overall survival and event rate , however , were similar at 5 five year follow - up . postoperative af occurred in 30.2% patients undergoing cpb - cabg vs 29.3% in op - cabg surgery while the incidence of stroke was two - fold in the former group ( 6.7 vs 2.5% , p < 0.035 ) . noteworthy the incidence of af was two folds in patients with cardiogenic shock undergoing cpb versus op surgery ( 62.5 vs 39.8% ) , with a significant increase in the number of stroke ( 33.3 vs 9.6% , p<0.009 ) . 0.901 ng / ml at icu admission has been identified as cut - off value for prediction of af in patients undergoing elective cabg . patients with serum tni   > of 0.901 ng / ml showed an 11.5 times increased risk for the onset of af after elective cabg . in present investigation no significant relation was found between tni serum concentration after surgery and the risk of af ( odds ratio = 0,96 - 95% ci [ 0,85 , 1,08 ] , p=0.17 ) . in our experience , the incidence of poaf resulted not significantly different in patients undergoing op - cabg in comparison to cpb - cabg . the two groups were comparable for severity of coronary disease , number of grafts performed and clinical presentation ( urgent versus elective surgery ) . however , mean age of patients undergoing op - cabg was on average 7 years older in comparison to patients treated with cpb - cabg . the present study was limited by its observational nature , by a relative short follow - up period ( 2 years ) , and by the low number of patients investigated . otherwise the short time of enrolment ( 1 year ) , the similar characteristics of the two groups , with the cited exception of age , and the limited number of operators decreased the risk of non homogeneity of the population under investigation . the low number of recurrences occurred , similarly to other studies , may be related to potential bias due to the reliance on self - reporting for follow - up cardiac rhythm data . although scheduled holter monitoring in our investigation did not reveal paroxysmal episodes of atrial fibrillation , only continuous monitoring systems may provide definitive data . similarly , the use of questionnaires and clinical examination during follow - up may not accurately identify paroxysmal episodes of af and may potentially have underestimated the incidence of the arrhythmia recurrences .", "despite the reported limitations , our study does not support the hypothesis that postoperative af is associated with an increased late mortality , rate of stroke or rehospitalization . restoration of sinus rhythm before hospital discharge may have significantly limited the negative prognostic effects of post operative atrial fibrillation . at present , the guidelines of the american college of chest physician state that op - cabg can not be recommended to decrease post operative af because of conflicting results resulted from randomized controlled trials or large - scale concurrent cohort studies ."], "summary": "introductionpostoperative atrial fibrillation after isolated coronary revascularization has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality . aim of present investigation was to evaluate incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation and its prognostic role in patients undergoing isolated coronary artery by -

Conclusions"], "document": ["the conventional definitions of pediatric adiposity depend on a measured body mass index ( bmi , kg / m ) interpreted relative to a reference distribution ( bmi normative growth charts ) for sex and age [ 13 ] . because it has body weight in its numerator , bmi reflects generalized ( total - body ) enlargement with a simplified correction ( as height ) for skeletal size . pediatric adiposity has been defined alternatively by abdominal size , most commonly a waist circumference , because increased truncal adipose tissue is correlated better than generalized adiposity with cardiometabolic dysfunction [ 4 , 5 ] . since waist circumference is a regional measurement , it reflects specifically only abdominal or central enlargement . thus , waist circumference also requires interpretation relative to its own reference distribution for sex and age . comparisons of risk assessments in youth have generally found little difference between bmi and waist circumference in the ability of these indicators to identify cardiometabolic risk [ 6 , 7 ] . the waist - to - height ratio ( whtr ) is an adiposity indicator with waist circumference in the numerator and a simplified correction ( as height ) for skeletal size . whtr does not depend on sex- or age - specific reference criteria [ 810 ] . in a large sample of us sixth - graders , we examined the performance of bmi z - score ( bmiz , referenced to cdc 2000 growth charts for the united states ) and whtr for the purpose of cardiometabolic risk assessment .", "participants came from the baseline enrollment ( sixth - grade students in 2006 ) of the healthy study , a cluster - randomized , controlled , primary prevention trial designed to improve indicators of adiposity and glycemic dysregulation among us middle - school children [ 12 , 13 ] . seven research centers recruited 42 middle schools with at least 50% of students eligible to participate in the federally subsidized national school lunch program or belonging to an ancestral minority group at increased risk of type 2 diabetes ( hispanic , non - hispanic black , or native american ) . a detailed protocol and background details about the healthy study are available for download at http://www.healthystudy.org/. we restricted a priori our analytic sample to students with integer ages of 11 or 12 years who were able to participate in physical education and did not have known diabetes . from 5950 eligible enrollees , we excluded 13 students due to missing or invalid data for the adiposity indicators ( height , weight , and waist circumference ) . additional 239 students were excluded for lack of outcome cardiometabolic risk variables , and 216 were excluded for lack of information on pubarche ( an adjustment variable associated with adrenarche , growth pattern , and insulin resistance ) [ 1416 ] . participant ancestry ( hispanic , non - hispanic black , non - hispanic white , other ) and sex were self - reported . the study was approved by each research center 's institutional review board , and informed consent from parents and assent from students were obtained prior to data collection . from measured height and weight , we calculated the sex- and age - specific bmiz based on the centers for disease control and prevention 2000 growth charts [ 11 , 17 ] . waist circumference was measured to the nearest 0.1  cm on bare skin just above the iliac crest following procedures of the national health and nutrition examination survey , and the whtr was calculated . blood pressure was recorded three times using an omron automated blood pressure monitor ( with appropriate - size cuff ) after the participant sat quietly for 5 minutes . pubarche was identified dichotomously from the participants ' response to a standardized question on the appearance of underarm and pubic hair . fasting blood samples were processed onsite and shipped to the healthy central blood laboratory ( northwest lipid research laboratories , university of washington ) . insulin was measured by an immunoenzymometric assay using a tosoh 1800 autoanalyzer ; the interassay and intra - assay precision analysis consistently showed a coefficient of variation ( cv ) < 10% . the assay had low cross - reactivity with human c - peptide ( 0% ) and proinsulin ( 2% ) . the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( homa - ir ) was calculated from glucose ( mg / dl ) and insulin ( u / ml ) concentrations using the following formula : \n ( 1)homa - ir=(glucose0.05551)(insulin)22.5 . measurements of total plasma cholesterol , cholesterol in the lipoprotein fractions , and triglycerides were performed enzymatically on the roche modular - p autoanalyzer using well - standardized methods . the interassay cvs were consistently < 1.5% for total cholesterol and triglycerides and < 2% for hdl cholesterol . we calculated the total - to - hdl cholesterol ratio ( tc / hdlc ) , a variable that strongly predicts cardiovascular disease in adults   and may be more strongly associated than ldl - cholesterol or hdl - cholesterol concentrations with pediatric adiposity [ 22 , 23 ] . in addition to stratification by sex , we chose a priori to stratify our analyses by  high fatness  or  lower fatness  because the ability of adiposity indicators to identify adipose tissue mass , ectopic fat , and cardiometabolic risk variables may be stronger among children in a higher fatness category [ 2326 ] . as defined for this report , the high - fatness level included students who were above the sex - specific median value for both bmiz and whtr ; any student below the median for either adiposity indicator was designated lower fatness . for each fatness level , we prepared sex - specific , linear - regression models adjusted for ancestry ( 4 categories ) and pubarche ( yes / no ) to estimate the associations of continuous adiposity indicators with the continuous cardiometabolic risk factors ( outcomes ) . since blood pressure varies with height in children [ 27 , 28 ] our models for blood pressure outcomes included an additional adjustment for height which was entered as a continuous variable . for all variables except bmiz , we calculated descriptive statistics without using reference - based corrections for sex or age . for indicators or outcomes that departed markedly from a normal distribution ( whtr , homa - ir , tc / hdlc , hdl cholesterol , triglycerides , and ( only for lower - fatness students ) diastolic blood pressure ) , we transformed the variable by loge or inverse square root to approach normality prior to their use in regression models . our adjusted models estimated standardized beta coefficients ( change in the outcome variable ( in standard deviations ) associated with change of one standard deviation in the adiposity indicator ) for each cardiometabolic risk factor . cary , nc ) was used to account for variability both within and between the school clusters . in these mixed models , the proportion of variation explained ( r ) by each adiposity indicator was calculated as the full model r minus r for a model omitting the adiposity indicator . to compare linear slopes among ancestral groups , mixed - regression models estimated nonstandardized , beta - regression coefficients ; interactions were tested between each adiposity indicator and the three ancestries represented prominently in our sample ( hispanic , black , and white ) .", "characteristics of the analytic sample are presented by sex in table 1 . as expected for sixth - grade students , following further stratification by fatness level , the distributions of adiposity indicators and ancestry are summarized in table 2 . compared to the high - fatness groups in our sample , the lower - fatness groups had bmi and whtr distributions that resembled more closely the general population of us youth in the same age range [ 31 , 32 ] . within the high - fatness subpopulations of either sex ( table 3 ) , adiposity indicators explained 19%28% of the variation in homa - ir , 4%9% of the variation in circulating lipids ( tc / hdlc , hdl cholesterol , triglycerides ) , and 5%9% of the variation in diastolic blood pressure . adiposity indicators explained < 3% of the variations in systolic blood pressure and fasting glucose . for each outcome variable in these high - fatness subpopulations , the effect sizes ( standardized beta coefficients ) associated with bmiz were similar to those associated with whtr . within the lower - fatness subpopulations of either sex ( table 4 ) , adiposity indicators explained 8%13% of the variation in homa - ir and 2%7% of the variation in circulating lipids . for tc / hdlc and triglycerides , the standardized beta coefficients tended to be weaker for bmiz ( 0.130.20 ) than for whtr ( 0.170.28 ) . adiposity indicators in these lower - fatness subpopulations explained < 1% of the variations in systolic blood pressure , diastolic blood pressure , and fasting glucose . a comparison between the two levels of fatness ( table 3 versus table 4 ) demonstrates that for either adiposity indicator the associations with homa - ir were stronger among the high - fatness students ( beta coefficients 0.430.52 ) than among the lower - fatness students ( 0.300.37 ) . similarly , both adiposity indicators were associated with diastolic blood pressure more strongly among high - fatness students ( 0.230.32 ; p < 0.001 for each of 4 beta coefficients ) than among lower - fatness students ( 0.030.05 ; p > 0.05 for each of four beta coefficients ) . for identification of lipid outcomes , however , we found steeper beta coefficients only among high - fatness boys ( compared to lower - fatness boys ) whose adiposity was assessed by bmiz . for both sexes assessed by whtr , the associations between adiposity indicators and risk variables were not notably different between the hispanics , non - hispanic blacks , and non - hispanic whites except when related to blood pressure outcomes . although adiposity explained 5%7% of variation in diastolic blood pressure in the complete sample of high - fatness girls ( table 3 ) , this relationship was extremely weak for high - fatness girls who were black , as indicated by slope point estimates close to zero ( figure 1 ) . however , for high - fatness girls who were hispanic or white , bmiz and whtr had significant associations ( p < 0.05 ) with diastolic pressure . among high - fatness boys systolic blood pressure was not significantly associated with bmiz or whtr for high - fatness blacks of either sex , but the association was present for high - fatness students who were hispanic or white . an ancestral contrast ( blacks compared to whites ) related to systolic blood pressure was significant , however , only among the high - fatness girls assessed by bmiz ( figure 1 ; p < 0.01 ) .", "in this large sample of middle - school students at increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes , we found that adiposity indicators bmiz ( with reference to cdc 2000 growth charts ) and whtr ( without reference to sex and age ) had similar utility for identifying adverse levels of cardiometabolic variables . our findings are generally consistent with previous published reports , most of which were based on populations that had a wider age range or included less ancestral diversity . earlier cross - sectional studies that compared continuous whtr against bmi either without a normative growth reference [ 3335 ] or with reference - based bmi z - scores / percentile ranks [ 23 , 36 ] generally found that whtr provided stronger associations with lipid outcomes , but bmi was superior for blood pressure outcomes . a recent report on sixth - grade students from switzerland found that bmiz ( referenced to cdc 2000 growth charts ) and whtr provided associations with blood pressures that were weak but nearly identical . in studies of youth from the southern us , bmiz provided a slightly stronger association than whtr with homa - ir   and fasting insulin , a relationship that was complicated by nonlinearity . nationally representative , cross - sectional data from the us demonstrated that whtr at ages 417 years was more strongly associated than bmiz with resting heart rate . a longitudinal analysis from the same survey of adolescent and young - adult participants found that categorical whtr predicted all - cause mortality before age 55 better than categorical bmiz ( baseline ages 1218 years ) or bmi ( ages 1939 ) . from the united kingdom , a large study recently reported that whtr and bmiz obtained at ages 79 years had similar associations with cross - sectional and prospective cardiometabolic risk factors in adolescence . given an approximately equal utility of bmiz and whtr for pediatric health assessments , we should consider how these adiposity indicators might perform in different settings or in the future . bmiz values reported in the research literature depend on standardized protocols for measuring height and weight using calibrated , high - quality scales . in nonresearch settings , however , staff training and time pressures might not be so favorable to careful measurements . the dependence of bmiz on normative growth references can be problematic because bmi - for - age reference values can yield discrepant inferences between populations , time periods , and ethnicities within a single country . worldwide  bmi growth reference based on large datasets from six countries , but subsequent reviews found that this international growth reference provided no advantage over national bmi growth references for the definition of excessive fat mass in youth   or prediction of subsequent cardiovascular risk in adulthood . the world health organization ( who ) more recently developed a bmi - based growth reference , the utilization of which has been described as a cumbersome task in need of simplification . surveys from various clinical settings have found generally that the use of bmi - for - age reference values is suboptimal [ 4750 ] . advocates of the whtr must address problems associated with the available protocols for measuring waist size . while tape measures are inexpensive and generally need little calibration , protocols for circumference measurement are still unfamiliar to many pediatric practitioners or clinic assistants . our study carefully measured the waist circumference just above the iliac crest , an anatomic location endorsed by prominent researchers in the united states [ 18 , 51 ] and canada . the who , however , recommends measuring waist circumference at the approximate midpoint between the lower margin of the last palpable rib and the top of the iliac crest . minimal waist ,  and other sites [ 54 , 55 ] . in an anthropometric study of diabetic youth , the iliac - crest protocol and who protocol demonstrated comparable reproducibility , but these alternative protocols yielded notable differences in the absolute value of a waist circumference obtained from the same participants . a study of overweight youth found that the who waist - circumference protocol had a stronger association than the iliac - crest protocol with cardiometabolic risk , and studies of adult waist circumference have likewise suggested an advantage for the who protocol [ 5860 ] . it follows that the whtr values calculated from the iliac - crest and who protocols should not be casually substituted for each other . it is possible that if our healthy study had adopted the who instead of the iliac - crest protocol for its baseline anthropometry , the re - calculated whtr indicator might have demonstrated stronger associations with cardiometabolic risk variables than those we report in this paper . standardization of a single waist - circumference protocol would probably advance the widespread adoption of the whtr as a low - cost adiposity indicator [ 55 , 61 ] . as an alternative to the circumference , some pediatric investigators have described waist size in selected participants by measuring the external diameter sagittally ( back - to - front ) in the supine position [ 6264 ] . protocol might further enhance studies that are cross - sectional or involve short - term follow - up of central adiposity , but this anthropometric method needs to be tested in larger datasets that represent general youth populations . the physiological importance of tissues accumulated in the waist may help to explain why whtr was more closely associated than bmiz with variations in the levels of circulating lipid markers among our lower - fatness participants ( table 4 ) . an increase in waist size primarily marks expanding amounts of adipose tissue , including notably the visceral depot which is most strongly associated with an adverse metabolic phenotype [ 5 , 65 ] . variation in the waist circumference can explain more than 64% of the variance in the area   or volume   of visceral adipose tissue . an increase in bmi , by contrast , may substantially mark also the variations in gain of muscular weight or subcutaneous fat patterning that precede adulthood . along with the changes in fat mass , these variations in lean mass or superficial adipose tissue contribute to the bmi calculation while contributing relatively little to metabolic risk . although high - fatness hispanic and white girls in our study demonstrated the expected associations between adiposity and blood pressure , we found among the high - fatness black girls ( but not black boys ) that neither bmiz nor whtr had a significant association with blood pressure outcomes ( figure 1 ) .  in comparison to young hispanics and whites , young blacks tend to have abdominal adipose tissue relatively less in the visceral depot and more in the abdominal subcutaneous regions . another study has also reported that black girls ' waist circumference around the same age was unrelated to their diastolic blood pressure . since both the bmiz and whtr indicators demonstrated similar patterns of nonassociation with black girls ' blood pressure , it may be that this absence of a correlation with blood pressure is due to factors operating primarily outside the abdominal region . perhaps black girls benefit from an increased capacity to expand their lower - body ( gluteofemoral ) , subcutaneous , adipose - tissue stores in a manner that would increase their total body weight yet protect them from cardiometabolic risk [ 7073 ] . if this protective characteristic of black girls extends into their later years , it could help explain why adult black women in the us experience no increased cardiometabolic risk   or mortality   until their bmi reaches approximately 33  kg / m .", "if a well - standardized waist measurement comes into widespread use for clinical assessments of pediatric adiposity , patients and their families may improve their intuitive understanding of how excess adiposity contributes to adverse health risk . pediatric health care providers , too , may find it more useful to recognize risk associated with a waist increment ( corrected for height ) than with a weight increment ( corrected for height squared ) . adoption of the whtr could optimize both patient education and the tracking of risk . compared to bmi , the whtr allows a simpler calculation without the necessity of squaring the child 's height . of interest to those concerned with child adiposity and cardiometabolic risk observed in different cultures or distinct time periods , the whtr will facilitate comparisons based directly on anthropometric observations without using normative reference tables that may not be suitable to all populations [ 7779 ] ."], "summary": "convention defines pediatric adiposity by the body mass index z - score ( bmiz ) referenced to normative growth charts . waist - to - height ratio ( whtr ) does not depend on sex - and - age references . in the healthy study enrollment sample , we compared bmiz with whtr for ability to identify adverse cardiometabolic risk . among 5,482 sixth - grade students from 42 middle schools , we estimated explanatory variations ( r2 ) and standardized beta coefficients of bmiz or whtr for cardiometabolic risk factors : insulin resistance ( homa - ir ) , lipids , blood pressures , and glucose . for each risk outcome variable , we prepared adjusted regression models for four subpopulations stratified by sex and high versus lower fatness . for homa - ir , r2 attributed to bmiz or whtr was 19%28% among high - fatness and 8%13% among lower - fatness students . r2 for lipid variables was 4%9% among high - fatness and 2%7% among lower - fatness students . in the lower - fatness subpopulations , the standardized coefficients for total cholesterol / hdl cholesterol and triglycerides tended to be weaker for bmiz ( 0.130.20 ) than for whtr ( 0.170.28 ) . among high - fatness students , bmiz and whtr correlated with blood pressures for hispanics and whites , but not black boys ( systolic ) or girls ( systolic and diastolic ) . in 11 - 12 year olds , assessments by whtr can provide cardiometabolic risk estimates similar to conventional bmiz without requiring reference to a normative growth chart .", "ranking": [0, 3, 2, 1, 4]}

Conclusions"], "document": ["biofilm growth on the surface of biomaterial implants is generally recognized as a cause of biomaterial - associated infection ( bai ) . regardless of the high sterile conditions and improved techniques in the operating theatre , both perioperative and postoperative contamination by microorganisms suspended in the air and from the skin flora continue to be the most common pathway for the contamination of biomaterial implants and medical devices [ 1 , 2 ] . the biofilm mode of growth protects the organisms against the host defense system and antibiotics . therefore complete removal of an infected implant or device is often the final result of bai . bai starts with the initial adhesion of microorganisms and then subsequently grows to form a biofilm . .   showed that bacterial adhesion was on materials with different wettabilities . a hydrophilic polymer brush coating is included , since these have been shown to discourage microbial adhesion . several attempts have been made to develop nonadhesive coatings , such as polymer brush coatings , in order to prevent bacterial adhesion and subsequent biofilm growth [ 8 , 9 ] . polymer brushes are end tethered polymer chains , having high density of chains per unit surface area due to which it stretches away from a surface into the adjacent solution . polyethylene oxide ( peo ) brush coating forms a highly hydrated layer of chains that is compressed upon bacterial approach , leading to a repulsive osmotic force and weak repulsive forces and reduced mobility of the polymer chains . though most types of brush coatings show significant reductions in microbial adhesion [ 1113 ] , bacteria adhere more weakly to the surface , being capable of growing into a mature biofilm . moreover these brush coatings only prevent adhesion and are incapable of killing the bacteria present . nanoparticles are less than 100  nm in diameter and as a result properties such as surface area , chemical reactivity , and biological activity alter dramatically . the antibacterial efficacy of metal nanoparticles has been suggested to be due to their high surface - to - volume ratio rather than to the sole effect of metal - ion release . a high surface - to - volume ratio is generally accompanied by increased production of reactive oxygen species , including free radicals [ 17 , 18 ] . these characteristics allow nanoparticles to interact closely with microbial membranes , damaging their structure and inactivate bacteria . metal oxide nanoparticles are of particular interest as antibacterial agents , as they can be prepared with extremely high surface areas and unusual crystalline morphologies with a high number of edges and corners and other potentially reactive sites . iron -

Conclusions"], "document": ["while developed countries have seen increasing incidence rates over the past several decades , developing countries have begun to experience the rising trend of cancer incidence and mortality . breast and cervical cancers are the most common cancers in women and lung cancer is the most common cancer in men in developing countries . developing countries with the highest rates of cancer are mostly in asia and south america , with incidence rates greater than 260.4 per 100,000 . africa , a continent that is much slower in its development , only sees about 94.8127.5 cases per 100,000 , with relatively higher rates in northern africa . morocco , a country with development and epidemiological transitions growing faster than most other countries in africa , falls into the relatively higher incidence rates within africa . are from developing countries and half of all cases of gastric cancer are in eastern asia . globocan statistics of 2012   show gastric cancer rates as highest in asia and lowest in africa . globocan   estimated an age standardized rate of gastric cancer in morocco as 5.1 per 100,000 for males and 3.0 per 100,000 for females . as a reference , the world age standardized rate of gastric cancer is 17.4 per 100,000 in men and 7.5 per 100,000 in women for 2012 . in recent years , rates of gastric cancer have been declining in most countries in europe , asia , and north america ; however , with limited data from africa it is difficult to make this generalization to african countries as well . impressions from local oncologists in marrakech , morocco , suggest that gastric cancer may be seen more frequently in marrakech than other regions in morocco . thus , this study was conducted to determine the age- and sex - specific and total crude incidence rates of gastric cancer in marrakech and compare them to the rates in casablanca , the largest city with a population - based cancer registry in morocco .", "this study was conducted at the center hospital university mohammad vi ( chu ) in marrakech , morocco . this hospital is the largest of the 4 hospitals in marrakech and the only public hospital for diagnosis and treatment of cancer in the city . the hospital serves patients from the city of marrakech ( population of 1.063 million in 2012 ) and its surrounding region , marrakech - tensift - al haouz . a limited number of patients also come from the neighboring regions of souss - massa - dra and tadla - azilal . in 2012 , the hospital diagnosed and/or treated 1,573 cancer patients who were covered by government health insurance . a majority of the patients seen at the hospital were from low- and middle - income socioeconomic levels of this community . the smaller portion of the patients who are from upper middle - income and upper socioeconomic levels seek care at the few private clinics and hospitals in marrakech . due to possible long waiting times for histopathologic examination of biopsy and resection specimens in government hospitals in morocco , government health insurance allows patients to have the histopathologic examination done at private pathology laboratories . cities of residence of patients found in the hospital medical records in this study included 47 cities , of which 32 were within either the region surrounding marrakech , the marrakech - tensift - al haouz region , or the nearby regions of souss - massa - dra or tadla - azilal . of these 32 cities , 22 were reported as being from the region surrounding marrakech . from this information and the referral patterns of all cancer patients seen at the hospital , we believe that most patients who come to the hospital in marrakech were from one of these 3 regions ; thus , these regions became our study area . we were unable to get a reported residence from the patients collected from private pathology labs , because it is not part of the standard pathology form , and therefore had to assume their referral patterns matched that of the hospitals and patient 's residence fell within one of the three regions . the study identified 327 new gastric cancer patients diagnosed and/or treated in chu in the 5-year period ( 20082012 ) . logbooks and medical records of gastric cancer patients were retrieved and abstracted . a manual search of the oncology records information for age , sex , place of residence , clinical diagnosis , and histopathologic features of the tumor was abstracted . clinical and pathological information including symptoms and signs at presentation , endoscopic and abdominal ct scanning results , histopathologic type of tumor , tumor differentiation , presence of intestinal metaplasia , and any results on h. pylori infection was collected . to supplement the pathology information of the patients identified from the study hospital and identify other patients who were treated at other healthcare facilities the review of the records of gastric cancer patients diagnosed in these laboratories during the period of 20082012 revealed 470 additional gastric cancer patients . information obtained included name , pathology reference number , age , sex , histopathologic type , differentiation , and h. pylori infection ( if noted ) . the population data used for calculating the incidence rates of marrakech was obtained from the 2004 census data . population data for each region , province , and city in morocco was obtained . for each city , percent growth change and natural population increase rates were used to estimate the population in marrakech and the surrounding regions for the years in which data was abstracted from the medical records and pathology reports . the incidence rates of casablanca were obtained from the most recent editions of the population - based cancer registry of the region of grand casablanca for years of 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , and 2007 . this registry information is collected and stored within the oncology center at the centre hospital ibn rochd , within a specific data processing department . the casablanca registry data covers cancer patients in all clinics , laboratories , and government hospitals in casablanca . since patient data was gathered from medical records as well as pathology reports from private laboratories , having data twice for one patient was possible . thus , to eliminate duplicates , the pathology reference number used in the laboratories and recorded in the medical records was used to identify and remove duplicated data for one patient . the name of the patient was also used to verify possible duplicate records . to prepare for data analysis , medical records and pathology reports were merged into a final database and a unique study i d was given after stripping the names of patients . after removal of duplicates , we were able to identify 774 patients of gastric cancer in 20082012 of which 447 were found in the reports of 4 large pathology laboratories and 327 from medical records of the hospital . after review of records , 49 patients were excluded because of reported residence outside of the three 3 regions defined as the at - risk population surrounding marrakech or because of histopathologic diagnosis of stomach lymphoma , which was not included in the incidence rates from the casablanca registry ( figure 1 ) . to obtain a total 4-year incidence rate for casablanca , the sum of the total number of cases reported for each year in the registry was divided by the sum of the population for each corresponding year . at the time of publication casablanca only had registries for a 4-year period and thus the incidence reported is a 4-year incidence rate . descriptive statistics and incidence rate analyses were completed using sas ( version 9.3 , sas institute , cary , nc ) . because the last available census data from morocco was 2004 , it was necessary to estimate the population of the 3 regions surrounding marrakech for the study years ( 20082012 ) . natural population change since the time of the census was determined by applying the annual growth rate to the census data to estimate the population during the study years . additionally , in order to compare rates from marrakech to rates from casablanca , age - adjusted incidence rates were calculated for 8 age categories . the 8 categories , determined by those given in the census information from morocco , were < 19 , 2024 , 2534 , 3544 , 4554 , 5564 , 6574 , and > 75 . data from the cancer registry in casablanca had been standardized by using the who world population . therefore , we used the who world ( 20002025 ) standard population , adjusted to match the 8 age categories , to calculate age - adjusted incidence rates in marrakech . incidence rate ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated to determine differences in rates from marrakech to rates from casablanca .", "for males , the median was 62 with a range of 1994 and , for females , median was 58 and range was 2388 . most ( 79% ) patients reported being from a city that was considered an urban city center by the moroccan census information . patients were clinically diagnosed with gastric cancer by both endoscopy and ct scan ( table 1 ) . the vast majority ( 90% ) of patients had histopathologic diagnosis of gastric cancer by biopsy ; few ( 15% ) were diagnosed by resection , including those that had both biopsy and resection . adenocarcinoma represented 83% of the histological types of gastric cancer ; carcinoma and gastric intestinal stromal tumors represented 13% and 3% , respectively ( table 2 ) . age - specific incidence rates for all patients , males , and females for marrakech and casablanca are presented in tables 3 , 4 , and 5 , respectively . in nearly all age ranges , rates of gastric cancer in marrakech were higher than the rates in casablanca . the exceptions were all patients , male and female patients under 19 years ; all patients aged 2024 years ; and all patients aged 4554 years . in males , in nearly all age ranges , the rate was significantly higher in marrakech . however , in females , only the age ranges 4554 , 5564 , and over 75 had rates that were significantly higher in marrakech . the incidence rates of marrakech for 20082012 and casablanca for the years available from their registry data , 20042007 , are presented in table 6 . the rates of gastric cancer in marrakech for all patients , males , and females were 5.50 , 7.19 , and 3.87 per 100,000 , respectively .", "first , age - specific incidence rates of gastric cancer were higher in marrakech in nearly all age groups for both males and females compared to respective rates in casablanca . second , when comparing total incidence rates by sex , males in marrakech had a significantly higher rate than males in casablanca . amongst females , while the rates between the two cities were statistically significant , the difference was not as prominent as that of the males . finally , the majority of the residence of patients found in the medical records was concentrated in the 3 regions surrounding marrakech . with the exception of a few age groups , marrakech had higher age - specific incidence rates of gastric cancer than casablanca . rates appeared higher in casablanca in the  under 19  age group , because the casablanca cancer registry included pediatric cancer cases , while the patient records of cancer in marrakech did not . gastric cancer is known to be a cancer of elderly populations , so this does significantly impact the results found . the variation of rates between sexes is not altogether surprising as gastric cancer is more common in males than females . many patients who visit the hospital in marrakech travel many miles across rough geographic terrains and , due to travel costs or gender and cultural norms in morocco , women may simply seek care less often than men . in many developing countries , the presence of gender inequalities combined with factors affecting health behaviors can limit a woman 's ability to make the decision to seek care . compared to the nearby country of tunisia , women in morocco sought health care less often , due to geographic obstacles that make traveling difficult . observing that the majority of gastric cancers were from the region of marrakech and the 2 surrounding regions is a reasonable finding because chu in marrakech is the only public cancer hospital serving marrakech and the surrounding regions . while all patients in this study were from 3 regions surrounding marrakech , there is a possibility that other patients from less populated regions might have been missed in this study because of not seeking medical care in marrakech . symptoms of early onset gastric cancer are similar to other nonmalignant gastrointestinal conditions ; thus , patients are not likely to travel far to seek care until symptoms become severe . previous studies assessing patterns of gastric cancer reported low rates of the disease in africa compared to rates in other countries , despite widespread infection by h. pylori in africa [ 4 , 15 , 16 ] . however , these same studies also noted limited availability of cancer registries in africa , which limits the ability to generate true incidence and prevalence rates . this study is the first to assess incidence of gastric cancer in marrakech , allowing for comparison within the country to identify rate differences and future investigation of risk factors in relation to geographic locations . previous research from marrakech identified gastric cancer as the most common digestive cancer in the city which helps to verify our results . both studies identified an average age of diagnosis of 59 years ; and 6470% of all cases were in males . the significant difference in gastric cancer incidence found between marrakech and casablanca is the first to be reported for these cities . a 25-time higher rate was found in a town in the andes mountains in colombia compared to the rate in a city that is 200 kilometers away on the coast . the difference in rates was attributed to a mismatch in the ancestry of the host and the microbe , which resulted in more carcinogenic gastric lesions in the high rate area . similar differences were reported in chile and guatemala where higher gastric cancer rates were found among higher altitudes . increased gastric cancer risks associated with environment and genotypic variations of the h. pylori strains have been well documented and these factors may explain the variations in gastric cancer rates in populations that have nearly identical infection rates [ 2022 ] . inclusion of data from the major cancer hospital and the main private pathology laboratories in marrakech assured the comprehensiveness of data sources . obtaining records from the largest private pathology laboratories andpublic hospital in the city allowed for a wider representation of socioeconomic backgrounds of patients and increased inclusion of the majority of gastric cancer patients in the region . the existence of census information for the population and age and sex strata allowed us to calculate incidence , age - specific , and sex - specific rates for marrakech . availability of a quality population - based cancer registry in casablanca and the opportunity to compare its results to marrakech increased the efficiency of region comparison of rates in this study . lack of information about the residence of the patients from the private pathology laboratories limited our ability to calculate region - specific rates . however , there is no reason to believe that patients from distant regions of morocco would seek histopathologic diagnosis in these laboratories in marrakech . due to possible cultural norms of not seeking medical care or limited availability of health professionals in peripheral regions one of the main focal points of the study was to examine the most recent 5-year period of gastric cancer in marrakech rather than choose a previous matching period with the casablanca cancer registry . the reason was that the new cancer center in marrakech was opened in the 5 years preceding the study and the flow of patients was much larger and inclusive . also , we are not aware of significant changes in the healthcare or exposure factors related to gastric cancer that occurred in marrakech between the 2 data intervals of 20042007 and 20082012 . however , this nonoverlapping period might be a limitation of the study . a unique mix of cultural and lifestyle factors and regional differences in morocco present an opportunity for future research into the investigation of risk factors that may contribute to the higher gastric cancer rate in marrakech . previous research has shown that risk factors for gastric cancer could be categorized into ( a ) h. pylori infection , ( b ) nitrogen compounds and other chemical carcinogens , ( c ) high intake of salted , smoked , and cured foods [ 2 , 26 ] , and ( d ) other social and behavioral factors [ 25 , 2729 ] . with scarce current data from morocco , these risk factors should be investigated in future studies in marrakech and other parts of morocco to elucidate the risk factors of gastric cancer in this population .", "in conclusion , a significantly higher rate of gastric cancer was found in marrakech when compared to the rates of casablanca . notably , the difference in incidence in males between marrakech and casablanca was much more distinct than the difference in females . the incidence of the disease in marrakech could be higher than what is reported in this study because of the possible missed patients who did not seek medical care and die without diagnosis or documentation . future studies should further evaluate the possible underestimation of gastric cancer in marrakech and explore the variable rates in other regions of morocco . future studies should also explore the risk factors of the disease including infectious , dietary , and environmental factors and possible regional differences ."], "summary": "gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer globally with over 70% of new cases occurring in developing countries . in morocco , oncologists in marrakech suspected higher frequency of gastric cancer compared to casablanca , a city 150 kilometers away . this study calculated age - specific , sex - specific , and total incidence rates of gastric cancer in marrakech and was compared to the casablanca population - based cancer registry . using medical records from center hospital university mohammad vi and reports from 4 main private pathology laboratories in marrakech , we identified 774 patients for the period 20082012 . comparison of rates showed higher age - specific incidence in marrakech in nearly all age groups for both genders . a higher total incidence in marrakech than in casablanca was found with rates of 5.50 and 3.23 per 100,000 , respectively . incidence was significantly higher among males in marrakech than males in casablanca ( 7.19 and 3.91 per 100,000 , resp . ) and females in marrakech compared to females in casablanca ( 3.87 and 2.58 per 100,000 , resp . ) . future studies should address possible underestimation of gastric cancer in marrakech , estimate incidence in other regions of morocco , and investigate possible risk factors to explain the difference in rates .", "ranking": [0, 2, 4, 3, 1]}

linked primary immunodeficiency characterized by the classic triad of microthrombocytopenia , eczema and recurrent infections . multiple autoimmune manifestations and tumors are serious complications and the life expectancy of was patients is severely reduced , unless they are successfully cured by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . was is caused by mutations in the was gene   impairing the  expression and/or function of the was protein ( wasp ) , a  hematopoietic - specific regulator of cytoskeletal reorganization also involved in signal transduction of cells . the absence or reduction of wasp compromises multiple processes of different immune cell types involved in innate and adaptive responses , resulting in a variable and progressive immunodeficiency . susceptibility of was patients to develop autoimmune diseases has been mainly attributed to the breakdown of self tolerance sustained by dysfunction of both natural t regulatory and effector t cells ( reviewed in ref . ) . however , b - cell intrinsic defects have been demonstrated to critically contribute to was - associated autoimmunity in was mouse model . in humans , the contribution of b - cell defects in the pathogenesis of was has been partially investigated . b cells from patients exhibit lower motility , migratory and adhesive capacities , likely due to defective f - actin nucleation . in contrast , despite the role of wasp in b - cell receptor ( bcr ) signaling , abnormalities in b - cell activation still remain controversial . a skewed distribution of serum immunoglobulin ( ig ) classes   and the inability to mount a proper antibody response , particularly to t -

deficiency affects critical stages of central and peripheral b - cell differentiation contributing to abnormalities in humoral immunity and b - cell tolerance in humans .", "the diagnoses were clinically defined and confirmed by genetic analysis . a description of all patients is reported in supplementary table  1 . human samples were obtained according to the code of ethics of the world medical association ( declaration of helsinki ) with the approval of the local medical ethical committees of the erasmus mc and the san raffaele scientific institute internal review board ( tiget02 ) . all results obtained from samples of was patients were compared to age and sex matched healthy donors ( hds ) . the composition of the precursor b - cell compartment was analyzed by flow cytometric immunophenotyping as described in the supplementary material . for the analysis of replication history and somatic hypermutation , four b - cell subsets were isolated from thawed peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) using a  facs diva cell sorter ( bd biosciences ) . gating on cd19 cells ,  transitional ( cd27cd24cd38 ) , mature nave ( cd27igdcd24cd38 ) , natural effector ( cd27igd ) and memory ( cd27igd ) b - cell subsets were sorted with a purity of > 95% for all fractions . for intracytoplasmic detection of human wasp , cells were fixed and permeabilized using a cytofix / cytoperm kit ( bd pharmingen , oregon , usa ) . the anti - wasp antibody 503 ( a kind gift from prof h. d. ochs , seattle , wa , and l. d. notarangelo , boston , ma ) was used , followed by detection with pacific blue - labeled anti - rabbit igg secondary antibody ( invitrogen , san diego , usa ) . cd20 positive cells were purified from pbmcs of pediatric was patients and age - matched hds by immunomagnetic beads ( miltenyi biotec , germany ) or facs sorting . the purity of the isolated cells were analyzed by facs and ranged from 84% to 98% .  after isolation , cells were left overnight at 37  c in culture medium composed of rpmi-1640 , 10% fbs , 2  mm glutamine , 100  iu / ml penicillin and 100  g / ml streptomycin ( lonza , basel , switzerland ) . in  vitro chemotaxis assay was performed using 5  m pore - size transwell inserts ( costar corporation , corning , ny , us ) in 24-well plates . filters were prewet 30  min at 37  c in presence of 600  l of medium supplemented with 250  ng / ml of recombinant human stromal cell - derived factor ( sdf)-1 ( cxcl12 ; peprotech , rocky hill , us ) . fifty thousand cd20 positive or negative cells were resuspended in 100  l of culture medium , seeded in the upper chamber and incubated at 37  c for 3  h. transmigrated cells , collected in the lower chamber , were counted for viable cells and stained with anti - cd19 , anti - cd24 , anti - cd38 , anti - cd27 and anti - cd3 ( bd biosciences ) for the phenotypical analysis by facs . migration frequency was estimated as the [ ( cell n at the lower chamber / the initial b cell input in the upper chamber )    100 ] . levels of b - cell activating factor ( baff ) were measured in duplicate in plasma samples of was patients and hds using a quantikine human baff / blys / tnfsf13b immunoassay kit ( r&d systems , minneapolis , usa ) . the assay was performed according to manufacturer 's instructions and the od was determined using a microplate reader set to 450  nm . ig and igh gene rearrangements were amplified and analyzed as described in the supplementary material . dna was extracted from sorted b - cell subsets with the genelute mammalian total dna miniprep kit ( sigma  aldrich ) and used to perform the ig-deleting recombination excision circles ( krec ) assay . the amounts of coding and signal joints of the ig-deleting rearrangement were measured by real - time quantitative pcr on an abi prism 7000 sequence detection system ( applied biosystems ) . ig restriction enzyme - based hot - spot mutation assay ( igrehma ) was performed on genomic dna isolated from sorted b - cell subsets . briefly , v3 - 20-j rearrangements were pcr - amplified and the pcr products ( 500  bp ) were first digested using the restriction enzyme fnu4hi and then kpni . the unmutated gene products can be visualized as 244 or 247 bp hex - coupled fragments and the mutated as 262 bp hex - coupled fragment . comparisons between proportions were calculated by using the chi - square test (  test ) ( with continuity correction ) .", "until now , the composition of the b - cell compartment in the bm of was patients has not been reported . to evaluate the effect of wasp - deficiency on b - cell development in the bm , we characterized five stages of b - cell differentiation   in three was patients . we observed a decreased frequency of immature b lymphocytes in was patients ( fig .  this observation was further assessed in four additional patients , focusing on late stages of b - cell differentiation based on the expression of cd10 and cd20   ( gating strategy is shown in suppl .  we confirmed a significant decrease in the frequency of immature b cells compared with age - matched hds ( fig .  in addition , at the earliest differentiation stages , we observed a significant increase of small pre - b - ii cells in was patients ; while no statistical difference was detected in large pre - b - ii cell frequency ( fig .  these findings might reflect a partial block in the bm b - cell differentiation between the small pre - b - ii and immature b - cell stages in was , or an early egress of immature b cells into the periphery . next we examined the distribution of b - cell subsets in the peripheral blood of was patients and age - matched hds . when available , we evaluated the absolute count of total b cells , which was found significantly reduced in patients less than three years old ( < 3y ) , while no differences were observed in the older was group ( fig .  four b - cell subsets were identified according to the expression of cd24 , cd38 , igd and cd27 : transitional , mature nave , memory and plasmablasts ( fig .  transitional b cells ( cd24cd38 ) are the most immature peripheral b - cell population that were significantly increased in both was age groups as frequency ( fig .  2c ) and absolute number ( suppl .  the next maturation stage , represented by mature nave b cells ( cd27igdcd24cd38 ) , was significantly decreased only in was patients less than 3 years old both in frequency ( fig .  finally , the frequency of plasmablasts ( cd24cd38 ) was significantly increased in the older group of patients ( fig .  2c ) , while the absolute number of both memory b cells ( cd27igdcd24cd38 ) and plasmablasts were significantly decreased in the younger group of was patients ( suppl .  altogether , these findings demonstrate that was patients have a perturbed peripheral b - cell distribution . the overrepresentation of transitional b cells in the blood of was patients led us to hypothesize that an early egress of immature b cells from bm could occur . cxcr4 , the chemokine receptor for sdf-1 , has an important role in retaining b - cell precursors within the bm in order to prevent premature migration to the periphery [ 2224 ] . we tested the chemotactic response to sdf-1 of b lymphocytes of was patients and hds by transwell migration assay . as shown in fig .  3 , both transitional and mature peripheral b cells were less responsive to sdf-1 in  the absence of wasp ( fig .  this defect was specific for b  lymphocytes since cd3 positive cells of was patients showed a normal migratory capacity to sdf-1 ( suppl .  thus , we hypothesize that a diminished retention signal mediated by cxcr4/sdf-1 could explain the premature egress of immature b  cells from the bm leading to an increase of transitional b cells in periphery . to further characterize the peripheral b - cell distribution , we focused our analysis on b - cell subsets found expanded in autoimmune diseases and potentially autoreactive [ 2528 ] . we found a significant increase of cd19cd21cd35 subset in both was age groups ( fig .  4a ) , confirming data previously reported by park and  colleagues . we also analyzed the frequency of cd19cd21cd38 cells ( referred to as cd21 ) described to be expanded in autoimmune diseases and immunodeficiencies \n . interestingly , we observed that the frequency of this unusual population was markedly increased in was patients , both in the younger and older groups ( fig .  in addition , higher levels of soluble baff were found in the plasma of was patients as compared to pediatric hds ( fig .  this finding was also associated with a decreased expression of its receptor , baffr , in transitional b cells of was patients ( fig .  because of the role of baff in b - cell homeostasis and peripheral b - cell tolerance , high baff levels may affect the stringency of peripheral b - cell selection thus favoring the survival of b - cell subsets containing potentially autoreactive clones . in order to evaluate the effect of wasp - deficiency in an antigen dependent context , we analyzed in detail the memory b - cell compartment of was patients . we identified six distinct memory b - cell subsets   ( gating strategy is shown in suppl .  igm - only  ) and cd27igg deriving from primary germinal center ( gc ) responses ; igg cd27 and iga cd27 switched memory b cells originating from secondary gc responses ; cd27igd ( named  natural effector  ) and cd27iga generated in a ti manner in the gastrointestinal tract or in the splenic marginal zone area , respectively . we did not observe differences in memory b - cell populations deriving from both primary and secondary gc responses between was patients and hds ( fig .  a marked reduction in natural effector b cells was found in both age groups of was patients both as frequency ( fig .  the frequency of cd27iga b cells was decreased in 312 years old patients compared with hds ( fig .  , the absence of wasp mainly affects ti responses of b cells , whereas only mildly impairs the generation of early memory b cells in gc without influencing the class - switched memory b - cell compartment . we determined the in  vivo b - cell proliferation history by krec assay and in parallel shm by igrehma in sorted transitional , mature nave , natural effector and memory b cells . as expected , transitional b lymphocytes did not undergo cell divisions and mature nave b cells had a limited number of cell divisions in hds ( fig .  both b - cell subsets were characterized by the absence of shm ( fig .  6b ) and we did not find differences in transitional and mature nave b cells of was subjects ( fig .  in contrast , the memory compartment showed less proliferation in was memory b cells in association with a reduced shm level ( fig .  interestingly , the defect in maturation was even more pronounced in natural effector was b lymphocytes . to study shm also in the ig heavy chain ( igh ) , we analyzed the frequency of mutated nucleotides in rearranged variable region of igh ( ighv ) genes by cloning and sequencing the most frequent ighv subgroups , the ighv3 and ighv4 gene families , of both - and -chain of constant regions ( c and c ) . the mutational frequency of was b cells was significantly lower for both c and c transcripts in all domains of v region ( fig .  thus , the decreased in  vivo proliferation and shm levels of was memory b cells could be responsible of a lower protection against infections and persistence of pathogens that finally lead to autoimmunity . was b cells showed an increased frequency of ighv3 - 30 in both ig classes ( fig .  7a ) and the absence of ighv3 - 48 genes in c sequences ( suppl .  7a ) . in ighv4 transcripts , we noticed a dominant usage of the ighv4 - 34 genes in was c ( fig .  moreover , the antibody repertoire of was b cells was devoid of ighv4 - 59 , a gene commonly used in b cells from hds . the distribution of d families was only slightly altered in was patients ( suppl .  finally , we evaluated the csr process in total b cells by analyzing the frequency of ig subclasses in sequenced igh transcripts . a preferential usage of -chain c region 3 ( c3 ) and c1 , igh - proximal genes ( the igh locus is schematized in fig .  7d ) , accompanied by a reduction in the expression of distal c2 and c4 , were detected in was patients ( fig .  the analysis of iga transcripts showed no significant difference in the subclass usage ( fig .  7e ) . in conclusion was patients show a skewed ig gene usage suggesting an altered selection of the antibody repertoire during b - cell development .", "we reported herein that wasp - deficiency affects many aspects of b - cell development , first in the bm and then in the periphery . indeed , precursor b - cell as well as memory b - cell development and selection appear affected by the absence of functional wasp . in the bm we have observed a decreased frequency of immature b cells , while in the periphery an overrepresentation of transitional b cells likely due to a reduced retention in the bm and/or a decreased migration to peripheral lymphoid tissues . the interaction of the chemokine receptor cxcr4 with its ligand sdf-1 is required for the retention of developing b cells in the bm . wasp is actively involved in cxcr4 signaling [ 3739 ] and was murine b cells show defective migratory response to sdf-1 . consistently , here we demonstrate in was patients that b cells migrate less to sdf-1. thus , was immature b cells could be unable to properly sense retention signals derived from cxcr4 in the bm leading to a premature release in the periphery . the increase of transitional b cells could also reflect an altered migration to the peripheral lymphoid organs resulting in a prolonged persistence in the circulation . consistently , our data allow us to exclude that the expansion of transitional b cells is due to homeostatic proliferation since we demonstrated the absence of replication history in this subset . transitional b cells are found expanded in immunodeficient conditions   or autoimmune diseases   and represent a reservoir of autoreactive b cells . the cohort of patients analyzed here did not show any overt sign of autoimmunity , probably due to their young age . however , the analysis of serum autoantibodies performed in four patients showed positivity for anti - nuclear antibodies in three patients . one of them also showed the presence of anti - platelet antibodies ( data not shown ) . these cells are enriched in anergic autoreactive clones   and expanded in systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) , rheumatoid arthritis and in common variable immunodeficiency groupia patients developing autoimmune syndromes . baff levels and signals through baffr coordinate the maintenance of the primary b - cell pool and the fate of self - reactive b cells . herein , we report for the first time increased baff levels and decreased baffr expression in was patients . elevated baff serum levels are often present in immunodeficiencies , autoimmune diseases   and viral infections   and may lower the thresholds for the survival of autoreactive b cell clones . the enrichment of cd21 b cells and the alterations in baff levels and expression of its receptor suggest that the mechanisms of b - cell selection could be altered in was patients . our data also suggest the presence of a defective selection of was b cells producing high - affinity antibodies . indeed , we noticed a restricted or null presence of ighv3 - 48 and ighv4 - 59 gene families and a preferential usage of ighv3 - 30 and ighv4 - 34 . in particular , ighv3 - 48 gene is selectively used against polysaccharide antigens   and its decrease in was could account for an inefficient antibody response . in contrast , ighv3 - 30 is highly represented among anti - platelet autoantibodies from patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura   and in sle patients . additionally , ighv4 - 34  encoded antibodies are intrinsically autoreactive when unmutated , as observed in our patients . this peculiar antibody repertoire reflects an altered selection of both protective and autoreactive ig gene families . the perturbation of b - cell homeostasis present in was patients supports the administration of anti - cd20 mab in the conditioning regimen of gene therapy to deplete b cells . in the memory b - cell compartment , the frequency of isotype - switched igg b cells we observed a normal frequency of memory b cells and of switched cd27igg and cd27iga b cells in our cohort of was patients . this suggests that t - cell dependent antigen response is induced normally in was patients . in contrast , the frequency and the shm level of ti memory b - cell subsets were reduced , likely due to their reduced in  vivo proliferation . the marked reduction in the natural effector b - cell subset , resembling marginal zone b cells in the spleen , mirrors the decreased number of splenic marginal zone b cells and the histological defects in the marginal zone area of the spleen already described in was mice   and patients . in addition , both the reduction in natural effector and igacd27 b cells , which are generated during ti responses , provide evidence of a defect in b - cell function independent from the cross - talk with t lymphocytes . the mutational status of both heavy and light ig chains is reduced in was in presence of a diminished rate of proliferation in the total memory b - cell pool . in addition , the analysis of ig gene selection showed a preferential use of igh - proximal genes ( ighg1 and ighg3 ) accompanied by reduced shm suggesting that was b cells have undergone less gc reactions . reduced igg2 switching in was patients could account for the poor response to ti antigens which is typical of the syndrome . the cytokine profile of was patients shows an impairment in the production of th1 cytokines   that could explain their reduced switching to igg2 subclass . moreover , the isotype - switching outcome is also influenced by two additional factors : cell division   and antibody affinity to antigens . the defective proliferation of memory and natural effector b cells and the reduced affinity maturation found in was might contribute to these alterations in class switching . our results in was patients show an early egress of immature b cells from bm leading to an overrepresentation of transitional b cells in the periphery . the memory compartment is characterized by a reduced maturation status that could affect the b - cell effector functions contributing to a lower clearance of pathogens and leading to chronic inflammation that can break tolerance . in conclusion , our results add novel immunological features of was b - cell phenotype that can complement the evaluation of the efficacy of various treatment approaches .", ""], "summary": "wiskott  aldrich syndrome protein ( wasp ) regulates the cytoskeleton in hematopoietic cells and mutations in its gene cause the wiskott aldrich syndrome ( was ) , a primary immunodeficiency with microthrombocytopenia , eczema and a higher susceptibility to develop tumors . autoimmune manifestations , frequently observed in was patients , are associated with an increased risk of mortality and still represent an unsolved aspect of the disease . b cells play a crucial role both in immune competence and self -

dentist relationship and obscure proper diagnosis of the actual dental problem8,25 . taani15 ( 2002 ) showed that the levels of dental anxiety were higher among jordanian public school children than those from the private schools . yet , dental fear and anxiety were found among the most reasons that underlie the irregular attendance in two thirds of the public school children and half of those from the private schools . it is a simple , easy to score , short , valid and reliable test for dental visit - associated anxiety5,13,19,22 . humphris , morrison and lindsay21 ( 1995 ) provided a modified scale from the original corah dental anxiety scale . the modified dental anxiety scale was shown to be more comprehensive , highly valid and reliable , with a simpler and more consistent answering system . the modified dental anxiety scale will be , therefore , used to measure dental anxiety in the current study . lack of educational courses specialized in increasing dental awareness amongst non - dental university students in jordan , in addition to shortage of information about correlation between field of study and dental anxiety levels in the dental literature have raised the idea of investigating the level of dental anxiety among the different student populations . this study was therefore designed to investigate the subjective ratings of dental anxiety levels among dental , medical and engineering jordanian university students . in addition , the present study aimed to explore the sources of dental anxiety and the impact of gender on the perceived dental anxiety .", "anxiety related to dental treatment was assessed by means of corah 's dental anxiety scale ( das ) . however , the modified version of das was used21 where an extra item has been included referring to the respondent 's feelings toward local anesthetic injection with especial reference to the site of the injection , because the pain experienced with local anesthetic injections varies according to its location in the mouth14 . moreover , a simplified 5-point scale - answering scheme was devised ranging from not anxious to extremely anxious . the modified dental anxiety scale ( mdas ) contains 5 multiple - choice items including the followings : = if you went to your dentist for treatment tomorrow , how would you feel ? if you were about to have your teeth scaled and polished , how would you feel ? if you were about to have a local anesthetic injection in your gum , how would you feel ? the scores for each of the 5 item responses were summed up to give an estimated value of dental anxiety . the questionnaire was distributed to the third to fifth year undergraduate dental , medical and engineering students at the jordan university of science and technology . students were personally approached in the classrooms by the authors at the end of their class . the students were informed about the study and all the points in the questionnaire were explained and clarified . descriptive statistics were obtained and the means , standard deviation and frequency distribution were calculated . group comparisons were analyzed using twotailed student 's t tests as well as one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) test . statistical significance was based on the probability values of p= 0.05 . furthermore , as a total score of 15 or more almost indicates highly anxious patient19 , the frequencies of subjects with a score of 15 or more in the 3 student groups were also reported .", "the total number of the participants in the current study was therefore 535 , which accounts for a response rate of 89.2 percent . the distribution of the participants according to gender and field of study is presented in table 1 . \n table 2 presents the means and standard deviations of individual items and total scores of the modified corah dental anxiety scale with the results of one - way anova analysis comparing the various groups based on the field of study . out of the several anxiety scale items , the highest anxiety score ( 3.4 ) was given for tooth drilling ( item 3 ) and scored by the engineering students . the next most anxiety - producing item was the local anesthetic injection ( 3.32 ) which was scored by the medical students . however , for the items 1 , 2 , and 5 , the only statistically significant differences were found between the dental and the medical students ( f=7.92 , p = 0.00 ; f=4.69 , p= 0.01 , f=3.39 , p=0.03 , respectively ) . dental students were significantly less anxious about scaling and polishing of teeth ( f = 8.99 , p = 0.00 ) and about tooth drilling ( f = 19.58 , p = 0.00 ) than other groups . however , there were no statistically significant differences between medical and engineering students in relation to these items ( table 2 ) . as expected , dental students scored the lowest total dental anxiety scores ( table 2 ) which were significantly lower than those scored by either medical or engineering students ( f = 14.13 , p = 0.00 ) . generally , in terms of total anxiety scores , women were relatively more anxious than men ( t = -2.21 , p = 0.03 ) ( table 3 ) . women were particularly more anxious than men concerning items related to waiting in the dentist 's sitting room ( t = -2.56 , p = 0.01 ) and local anesthetic injection ( t = -2.62 , p = 0.01 ) . however , such gender variation was not significantly different when items related to going for dental visit tomorrow , having teeth drilled or having teeth scaled or polished were considered . sd = standard deviation the numbers and percentages of subjects who had a total score of 15 or more are shown in table 4 . surprisingly , medical students were found to be the most frequent among those who scored 15 or above .", "this study revealed that dental students do have lower levels of dental anxiety than their engineering and medical counterparts ( p < 0.01 ) . the mean total scores for the mdas showed that severe dental anxiety was mostly associated with drilling and intraoral local anesthetic injection . surprisingly , the medical students showed the highest total anxiety scores and the greatest percentage of subjects scoring 15 or more . the engineering students were already expected to score the highest anxiety scores as they do not receive health or dental awareness education , whilst the medical students are supposed to be more familiar with stress management related to health measures . however , some of the highly anxious patients may avoid showing their anxiety in order not to interfere with the dentist 's procedure . thus , the dentist should be aware of the patient 's possible adverse reaction or distress19,21 . however , when the data are critically appraised , statistically significant difference between groups related to total anxiety scores or the scores of individual items of the anxiety scale could be seriously misleading and possibly do not always reflect an actual clinical significance . this could be attributed to the fact that the sample size is large , which added to the power of the study and revealed even the minor statistical differences between the groups . thus conclusions made on actual differences in numbers and on absolute statistical significance should be drawn with caution . lack of dental health education might result in patients ' fear and anxiety which in turn might end with poor patient compliance and attitudes . this will make it more difficult to manipulate patients and yield difficult patients and thus increase the levels of dental profession - related stress1,12 . assessing the level of patient anxiety before commencing the dental treatment may offer invaluable insight into the probable patient attitudes and behavior towards the dental treatment . this information will be further utilized in developing the best strategies to manage patient anxiety . health - related behavior depends on oral health knowledge14 . in jordan , only students related to the dental field receive adequate dental health education as it is an integral part of their curriculum . jordanian schools and universities pay little attention to the dental health education of their students . students not related to the dental field receive little , if any , dental health education and their curricula lack such courses . since the dental health education is generally ignored in the pre - university stage , medical and engineering students still possess the same ideas about dentistry and dental care at the university . on the other hand , dental field - related students do have the chance to formulate new and better ideas and understanding of the dental health care and for the above mentioned reasons , the dental treatment will still be considered mysterious and stressful for the non - dental students while the dental students will feel better during the dental treatment . this could partly explain the relatively higher scores of dental anxiety among the non - dental students compared to their dental peers . irregular dental attendance may play a major role in increasing the levels of dental anxiety15,23 . if this is added to the lack of dental health education in jordan , the high levels of dental anxiety could be explained and clearly demonstrated among the non - dental students . this might form the bases for explaining the presence of higher levels of dental anxiety among women as well as medical students in this study . female students were found to have higher levels of dental anxiety in all groups and they were more anxious about waiting in the sitting room and taking anesthetic injections . this corroborated the results from previous studies that showed higher levels of dental anxiety among women,11,21,24 . this finding might be explained on the basis that women have higher levels of neuroticism than men and that anxiety is positively associated with neuroticism9,10,20 . however , in the current study , the statistically significant difference between men and women was marginal and the difference in anxiety scores for both genders was minimal ( men 12.29% , women 13.17% ) . therefore , it could be inferred that statistical significance might not be necessarily interpreted as a clinical one . medical students might be prone to have higher levels of neuroticism , due to their courses and stressful field of study2 and thus demonstrate higher levels of dental anxiety than engineering students . on the other hand , although dental students are leading stressful courses and profession they are yet still exposed to better dental health education and knowledge and thus develop favorable dental behavior . presence of suitable dental health education and knowledge seems to be capable , to some extent , of overruling the effect of stress and personality factors on dental anxiety among dental students . the control of dental anxiety might be aided via good dental health education , regular dental visits , good patient - dentist relationship and suitable communication with the patients6 . for a successful dental treatment , a gentle , supportive , professional , sympathetic , quiet and more considerate approach should be followed when managing patients with dental anxiety . on their first visit , patients should be dealt with more sensitively in order to avoid increasing their anxiety and thus avoid their repulsion to the dental care9 . in view of the current available data , it appears that further dental health education measures are required to be applied among the jordanian non - dental university students and the population in general in order to control the levels of dental anxiety and thus improve patient dental attitudes and compliance . suitable standards of dental health knowledge and education could overcome the negative effects of personality and reduce dental anxiety . interception of dental anxiety at early stages will reduce the chance of resistant dental anxiety and fear which are difficult to deal with in the dental clinic . the importance of dental health education can not be overemphasized in the reduction and control of dental anxiety . pre - university as well as non - dental university curricula should include dental health education in order to help reduction of dental anxiety among the population .", "although the current study utilized the modified anxiety scale and investigated the levels of dental anxiety among university students from different fields of study and the sample size was representative and large , further studies are required to investigate the effect of various correlates on dental anxiety ."], "summary": "objective : this study was designed to investigate the subjective ratings of dental anxiety levels among university students enrolled at jordan university of science and technology . in addition , the present study aimed to explore the sources of dental anxiety and the impact of gender on the perceived dental anxiety and the correlation between field of study and dental anxiety level.material and methods : the modified corah dental anxiety scale was used to measure dental anxiety among the study population . six hundred subjects were recruited into the study from jordanian undergraduate students from the faculties of medicine , engineering , and dentistry.results:five hundred and thirty five complete questionnaires were returned , which accounts for a response rate of 89.2% . the totals of the mean anxiety scores were the following : medical students , 13.58% ; engineering students , 13.27% and dental students , 11.22% . about 32% of the study population has scored 15 or more . dental students had the lowest percentage of those who scored 15 or more . surprisingly , the medical students were responsible for the highest percentage of those who scored 15 or above . although women demonstrated statistically higher total dental anxiety scores than men ( p= 0.03 ) , the difference between both genders was small and could be clinically insignificant . the students were anxious mostly about tooth drilling and local anesthetic injection.conclusion:lack of adequate dental health education may result in a high level of dental anxiety among non -

Conclusions"], "document": ["new - onset diabetes after transplantation ( nodat ) represents a common comorbidity after solid organ transplantation . nodat after kidney transplantation is associated with inferior outcomes , including higher risk of infections , decreased graft survival , higher rates of cardiovascular disease , and increased overall mortality [ 15 ] . risk factors for nodat include use of immunosuppressants , in particular corticosteroids and calcineurin - inhibitors , as well as traditional risk factors for type 2 diabetes including obesity , family history , age , and ethnicity [ 68 ] . metformin is the first - line agent of choice for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the general population . though some data suggests metformin is safe in the setting of chronic kidney disease , the use of metformin in kidney transplant patients is still quite controversial due to the concern about lactic acidosis and lack of data regarding metformin use in this patient population [ 911 ] . therefore , it is important to identify an alternative first - line oral agent for the treatment of nodat in kidney transplant recipients . short - term studies have shown some oral antihyperglycemic agents to be effective in patients with nodat [ 1214 ] . however , use of these agents is limited by adverse effects including fluid retention and bone loss with pioglitazone and hypoglycemia and weight gain with insulin secretagogues [ 12 , 15 , 16 ] . sitagliptin , an oral dipeptidyl - peptidase-4 ( dpp-4 ) inhibitor , was approved in the united states in 2006 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes . sitagliptin has a low incidence of hypoglycemia and does not promote weight gain , and the dosage can be adjusted based on renal function . additionally , in a 3-month trial of kidney transplant recipients , sitagliptin use did not alter immunosuppressant levels . however , evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of long - term use of sitagliptin in kidney transplant recipients is lacking . we hypothesized that in kidney transplant recipients sitagliptin would improve nodat control , as assessed by hemoglobin a1c ( hba1c ) , with a favorable safety profile including no effect on immunosuppressant levels or graft function .", "in this single center study , we performed a retrospective analysis of kidney transplant recipients in the multidisciplinary transplant clinic at the university of nebraska medical center ( unmc ) between october 2006 ( release date of sitagliptin in the united states ) and december 2012 . all subjects in this study received their kidney transplant at unmc . between 2009 and 2013 , 125 to 149 kidney transplants were performed per year at unmc ( http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/ ) . we have previously reported an incidence of nodat of 18% in our kidney transplant population . the study was approved and monitored by the unmc institutional review board . a general query was performed to identify all kidney transplant recipients who had been prescribed sitagliptin during the study dates . data for the query and subsequent data collection for the study were obtained from review of the electronic medical records  centricity ( ge healthcare ) , ottr ( ottr chronic care solutions ) , and epic ( epic systems corporation ) . inclusion criteria for the study included diagnosis of nodat by the 2003 international consensus guidelines criteria ( fasting plasma glucose 126  mg / dl or 7.0  mmol / l after no caloric intake for at least 8 hours or random plasma glucose 200  mg / dl or 11.1  mmol / l with symptoms of diabetes or 2  h plasma glucose in a 75  g oral glucose tolerance test ( ogtt ) 200  mg / dl or 11.1  mmol / l ) and diabetes care received at the unmc diabetes center to allow for accurate record of diabetes medication changes and reporting of side effects . additionally , to specifically understand the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin for the treatment of nodat , patients included in the study either used sitagliptin as the initial agent for nodat or had other diabetes medications stopped prior to or at the time of sitagliptin initiation . exclusion criteria included diagnosis of diabetes prior to transplant and death or loss of followup prior to 12 months after initiation of sitagliptin . sitagliptin dosing was performed based on the patients ' renal function , as directed by the prescribing information for sitagliptin ( https://www.merck.com/ ) . initiation of sitagliptin therapy marked the start of followup for each patient and patients were followed up until discontinuation of sitagliptin or december 2012 , whichever came first . the first was a 12-month followup to assess the subacute efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in terms of diabetes control , side effects , immunosuppressant levels , and graft function . the second endpoint was at discontinuation of sitagliptin or , for those patients who continued on sitagliptin through the entire study , in december 2012 . this longer followup allowed for assessment of long - term efficacy and safety in terms of diabetes control , acute rejection episodes , allograft function , and other side effects . the patient medical records were reviewed in detail for a number of different diabetes and transplant - specific outcomes including dates of sitagliptin initiation / discontinuation ; dates of initiation / discontinuation of any other diabetes medications ; patient or physician - reported side effects ; reason for discontinuation of sitagliptin ; acute rejection episodes ; graft loss ; immunosuppressant regimens and dosages ; opportunistic infections ; and death . body mass index ( bmi ) was obtained at the time of transplant , at the time of sitagliptin initiation , after 12 months of sitagliptin therapy , and at the end of followup . as part of routine posttransplant and diabetes care , patients underwent fasting labs weekly to monthly at the clinical laboratory of the nebraska medical center including serum creatinine , tacrolimus and/or sirolimus trough levels ( as appropriate ) , and fasting glucose levels . hba1c was performed every 3 months and fasting lipid panel every 3 to 6 months . serum creatinine , fasting serum glucose , hdl cholesterol , and ldl cholesterol measurements were performed using standard calibration protocols and dedicated analyzers and were assayed by colorimetric means . tacrolimus and hba1c was performed on a national glycohemoglobin standardization program ( ngsp ) certified high -

two patients were analyzed at the end of 12 months of sitagliptin therapy . of these , 19 patients remained on sitagliptin alone as their only diabetes medication , one patient required initiation of an additional oral diabetes medication , and 2 patients had sitagliptin discontinued in favor of other diabetes medications due to hyperglycemia . diabetes control , as noted by hba1c , was significantly improved at the end of 6 months and this effect persisted at 12 months ( figure 2(a ) ) . significance remained when analyzing just those patients ( n = 19 ) who remained on sitagliptin alone for the entire 12 months ( data not shown ) . there was a modest but significant decrease in bmi from the start of sitagliptin to the 12-month followup ( figure 2(b ) ) , though certainly this weight loss may have been due to multiple factors including lifestyle modifications . ldl and hdl cholesterol values remained unchanged with sitagliptin therapy ( figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) . at the 12-month followup , graft function as noted by serum creatinine and estimated gfr ( egfr ) was no different than at start of sitagliptin ( figures 3(a ) and 3(b ) ) . we then reviewed immunosuppressant levels over the 12 months of followup and also meticulously reviewed medical records for immunosuppressant dose changes and , if changes to dose were made , the impetus for doing so . tacrolimus and sirolimus levels remained stable throughout the 12-month followup ( figures 3(d ) and 3(e ) ) . in tacrolimus - treated patients , for the remainder of tacrolimus - treated patients only 3 patients required a single protocol dose adjustment and the rest maintained consistent tacrolimus doses . similarly , the patient with noncompliance required frequent sirolimus dose adjustments during the follow - up period while 3 patients had single , protocol - related sirolimus dose adjustments . to assess the long - term efficacy and risk for adverse effects of sitagliptin in kidney transplant recipients , we followed our cohort from the initiation of sitagliptin until december 2012 or discontinuation of sitagliptin , whichever came first ( mean followup for all 22 patients = 32.5  17.8 months ) . in the cohort , 17/22 patients remained on sitagliptin throughout the study period , for a mean duration of sitagliptin use of 37.9  16.5 months . of these 17 patients , 9 remained on sitagliptin alone for the entirety of the study ( 31.8  18.7 months ) . diabetes was well controlled in this group , with hba1c maintained below 7% ( 6.5  0.5% ) at the end of followup ( figure 4(a ) ) . eight patients continued on sitagliptin for the duration of the study ( 44.9  10.9 months ) but required addition of other diabetes medications to maintain glycemic control ( oral agents , n = 4 ; insulin , n = 4 ) . hba1c remained well controlled in this group ( figure 4(b ) ) and two of the four patients on insulin required only basal insulin in addition to sitagliptin . therefore , five patients discontinued sitagliptin in favor of other diabetes medications after 14  4.2 months . of these , 4 patients discontinued sitagliptin due to worsening hyperglycemia ( figure 4(c ) ) and need for intensive insulin therapy while one patient was switched from sitagliptin to a sulfonylurea due to cost . hemoglobin a1c was significantly lower at baseline in patients who were able to continue on sitagliptin alone for the duration of the study ( n = 9 ) compared to patients who discontinued sitagliptin and were switched to more aggressive diabetes management ( n = 5 ) ( figure 4(d ) ) . change in bmi , from sitagliptin initiation to the end of followup , was no different between these groups ( sitagliptin alone : 0.8  2.2  kg / m versus sitagliptin discontinued : 1.1  1.7  kg / m , p = ns ) suggesting the need for intensification of diabetes therapy in the sitagliptin discontinuation group was not necessarily related to weight gain . glucagon - like peptide-1 ( glp-1 ) therapies have been implicated to potentially increase the risk of pancreatitis , a matter of significant controversy . in the current study , no episodes of pancreatitis were reported during the follow - up period . additionally , other transplant - specific adverse events were rare in our cohort , including one episode of acute rejection ( 47 months after sitagliptin initiation ) ; two episodes of opportunistic infections ( 13 and 14 months after sitagliptin initiation ) ; no graft loss ; and one death ( due to end - stage liver disease ) .", "our study represents the largest cohort investigating the safety and efficacy of sitagliptin for the treatment of nodat in kidney transplant recipients . though our study was retrospective , through meticulous review of the medical records of patients followed up primarily in our transplant endocrine clinic we were able to closely follow medication prescribing changes , laboratory values , and reports of potential side effects and transplant - related comorbid events . in our cohort , sitagliptin was efficacious with a majority of patients meeting a goal hba1c < 7% . specifically , sitagliptin alone was adequate to improve and maintain glycemic control in a majority of patients ( 19/22 ) for 12 months after sitagliptin initiation , consistent with its efficacy in the nontransplant population [ 21 , 22 ] . sitagliptin inhibits dpp-4 with several subsequent effects that improve blood glucose control including potentiation of insulin secretion and inhibition of glucagon secretion . in studies utilizing animal models of type 2 diabetes , sitagliptin has also been shown to reduce islet inflammation and protect beta cell mass [ 2325 ] . beta cells exposed to glp-1 in vitro are resistant to toxicities associated with immunosuppressants , suggesting another potential benefit to dpp-4 inhibitor therapy for the treatment of nodat . these beta cell - specific protective effects of sitagliptin may explain why , in our cohort , patients with lower baseline hba1c responded better to sitagliptin monotherapy as these patients may have been earlier into the disease and may have had more beta cell mass that was subsequently protected by sitagliptin . overall , these findings suggest that initiating sitagliptin therapy early in the treatment of nodat , when average glucose levels are only modestly elevated , may provide long - term benefits in terms of glycemic control . larger cohorts are needed to investigate this point further . in solid organ transplant recipients , drug - drug interactions and adverse effects of medications on graft function we set out to better define the safety profile of sitagliptin in kidney transplant recipients in terms of effects on immunosuppressant levels / dosing , graft function , and other side effects . renal function and tacrolimus and sirolimus dosing and trough levels remained stable during the initial 12-month follow - up period , indicating sitagliptin does not adversely affect renal function or interfere with immunosuppressant dosing . hypoglycemia was not encountered in our cohort , consistent with reports of sitagliptin use in the nontransplant population . the use of dpp-4 inhibitors for the treatment of hyperglycemia and nodat in kidney transplant recipients is gaining more interest . recently , a 3-month clinical trial of vildagliptin , another oral dpp-4 inhibitor , revealed that this agent improved oral glucose tolerance test outcomes and modestly improved hemoglobin a1c in kidney transplant recipients with impaired glucose tolerance ( igt ) . similarly , a small , randomized control trial recently revealed vildagliptin to be a safe and effective therapy for the treatment of nodat in kidney transplant recipients . finally , a 24-week retrospective study of linagliptin suggests this agent may be beneficial for treating nodat , as well . however , data regarding sitagliptin for the treatment of nodat in kidney transplant recipients is scarce . a single pilot study of 15 patients followed up for 3 months revealed no significant effect of sitagliptin on renal function ( as measured by estimated gfr ) or tacrolimus or sirolimus levels . additionally , iuppa et al . presented an abstract discussing the use of sitagliptin in solid organ transplant recipients and , although most of the subjects were liver transplant recipients , 18 kidney transplant recipients were reported on with a median followup of all patients ( kidney and liver transplant recipients ) of 178 days . these small trials and a case report of a single kidney transplant recipient treated with sitagliptin for 2.5 years encompass the entire literature available on this subject . our study provides the most person - years of followup of any trial of sitagliptin for the treatment of nodat in kidney transplant recipients . additionally , though retrospective , our study provides the longest followup of any dpp-4 inhibitor used for the treatment of nodat in kidney transplant recipients . limitations of our study include the retrospective nature of our study and the small cohort size . however , large , prospective studies regarding glucose - lowering therapy for nodat do not exist currently ( as reviewed ) and our study represents the largest study to date examining the use of sitagliptin in the setting of nodat after kidney transplantation . our cohort was comprised mostly of caucasian males and steroids were not part of the maintenance immunosuppressant regimen . these factors may limit the ability to generalize our findings . finally , our mean time to diagnosis of nodat ( 56.3  57.7 months after transplant ) was longer than many studies of nodat . this likely reflects that the patients in our cohort had slower , less aggressive development of nodat and did not require insulin therapy . kidney transplant recipients with viable grafts remain at higher risk of diabetes development , a significant portion of the risk being ascribed to immunosuppressant therapy . safe , effective therapies are needed for patients who develop nodat regardless of the timing of the diagnosis , and sitagliptin may be useful for this purpose given the favorable side effect profile and lack of interaction with immunosuppressant medications .", "in conclusion , we have shown that , in a small cohort of kidney transplant recipients who developed nodat , sitagliptin was efficacious as a single agent or in combination with other glucose - lowering medications . sitagliptin was also well tolerated and renal function and immunosuppressant levels and dosing were stable during 12 months of therapy . sitagliptin may be valuable as a first - line agent in kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with nodat who are candidates for oral therapy ."], "summary": "new - onset diabetes after transplantation ( nodat ) is a common comorbidity after renal transplantation . though metformin is the first - line agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , in renal transplant recipients , metformin is frequently avoided due to concerns about renal dysfunction and risk for lactic acidosis . therefore , alternative first - line agents for the treatment of nodat in renal transplant recipients are needed . sitagliptin , a dipeptidyl - peptidase-4 ( dpp-4 ) inhibitor , has a low incidence of hypoglycemia , is weight neutral , and , in a small study , did not affect immunosuppressant levels . however , long - term sitagliptin use for the treatment of nodat in kidney transplant recipients has not been studied . we retrospectively analyzed renal transplant recipients diagnosed with nodat and treated with sitagliptin to assess safety and efficacy . twenty - two patients were started on sitagliptin alone . after 12 months of followup , 19/22 patients remained on sitagliptin alone with a significant improvement in hemoglobin a1c . renal function and immunosuppressant levels remained stable . analysis of long - term followup ( 32.5  17.8 months ) revealed that 17/22 patients remained on sitagliptin ( mean hemoglobin a1c < 7% ) with 9/17 patients remaining on sitagliptin alone . transplant - specific adverse events were rare . sitagliptin appears safe and efficacious for the treatment of nodat in kidney transplant recipients .", "ranking": [0, 3, 4, 1, 2]}

oncology curriculum for a 5-day workshop at pmh to a multidisciplinary group of 30 health care workers in botswana . whereas most training focused on the care of a child with cancer and was based at pmh , training that focused on timely recognition and referral by primary health care workers throughout the country was necessary . therefore , a pediatric cancer awareness training program was developed to reach health care workers at hospitals throughout botswana .", "botswana is similar in size to the state of texas , with a population of 2.2 million people . it has 25 government medical hospitals , including primary , district , and two of which are referral hospitals . there are also two faith - based mission and government partnership hospitals , and there is one psychiatric hospital . hospitals are strategically located across the country , with district and referral hospitals in the population centers . hospitals and clinics in rural botswana have long relied on outreach from pmh and gaborone for medical education and clinical assistance . the goal of the pediatric cancer recognition program was to visit at least 50% of the hospitals throughout botswana to educate health care workers on warning signs of pediatric cancer and to inform health care workers of pediatric cancer services available at pmh . pediatric cancer recognition training workshops were organized with leadership at each hospital . the full - time bcm / txch pediatric hematologist - oncologist based at pmh developed and delivered the teaching . the teaching format was open - forum didactic sessions , with lectures using pictures of physical exam , radiographic , hematological , and/or pathological findings to illustrate presentations of pediatric cancers . the length of the workshops was determined by hospital leadership and varied from 2 hours to 1 day . all health care workers were welcome to attend with a focus on physicians and nurses who typically have the most patient contact and are the decision makers with respect to clinical care . all attendees of the training sessions were asked to complete a pretest evaluation assessing their knowledge of the burden of cancer in children , survivability of pediatric cancer in ideal settings , and the most common types of cancer in children . additionally , attendees were asked about any training in pediatric oncology either during their preservice and/or clinical training years . finally , attendees were asked to indicate their comfort with caring for children with cancer and their understanding of the referral process to pmh . following the presentations , they were asked to complete the same questions regarding pediatric cancer , their comfort level with pediatric cancer patients , and their ability to refer a child with suspected cancer to pmh as well as an evaluation of the speaker and the presentations . statistical analysis of the questionnaires included expressing responses as percentages , evaluating ordinal data as means , and  analyses of respondents responses by medical specialty . statistical analyses were done using stata , version 11 ( statacorp lp , college station , tx ) .", "pediatric cancer recognition training workshops were offered at 14 ( 53.8% ) of the 26 government / mission hospitals in botswana , excluding pmh , over a 10-month period ( figure 1 ) . of the 362 health care workers who attended a workshop , 279 ( 77.1% ) completed the pretest , posttest , self - assessment , and evaluation . nurses represented the majority of attendees who identified their profession , at 49.2% ( 178/362 ) , whereas physicians represented 30.1% ( 109/362 ) . only 7.4% ( 20/272 ) of attendees completing the evaluations indicated that they had some formal training in pediatric oncology , including a fellowship , clinical rotation , and/or workshops . most of those who had some formal training were physicians ( at 23.5% [ 12/51 ] ) , whereas only 1.8% were nurses ( 2/114 ; p  .01 ) . when asked if their clinical training program included a pediatric oncology component , 26.8% ( 64/239 ) confirmed that their training program had either clinical or didactic pediatric cancer components , with the most common group being physicians ( 63.8% , 30/47 ) when compared with nurses ( 15.8% , 16/101 ; p  .01 ; table 1 ) . pediatric cancer training by profession before the workshop , the majority of attendees were not familiar with the worldwide incidence of pediatric cancer ( 42.0% , 107/255 , answered correctly ) or the survival percentage of pediatric cancer in an ideal setting ( 43.5% , 113/260 , answered correctly ) . when attendees were asked if they understood how to refer a child with suspected cancer to pmh , only 32.7% ( 84/257 ) answered positively ( 4 - 5 on a likert scale of 1 - 5 where 1 = strongly disagree , 3 = neutral , 5 = strongly agree ) prior to the seminar . physicians were most aware of the process ( at 54.9% 28/51 ) compared with nurses ( 25.9% , 28/108 ) and others / unidentified ( 28.6% , 28/98 ; p  .01 ) . after the workshop , 79.5% indicated that they understood how to refer a child with suspected cancer to pmh ( table 2 ) . attendees were asked to critically evaluate the workshop for clarity and content . on a 1 to 5 likert scale , with 5 denoting strongly agree , all criteria had a mean of 4.49 or greater ( figure 2 ) . pre- and post - test responses by profession evaluation of workshop by health care workers ( mean scores on a 1 - 5 likert scale where 1 = strongly disagree , 3 = neutral , 5 = strongly agree ) .", "in visiting 50% of government hospitals in botswana , 362 health care workers were trained on how to recognize and refer children with suspected cancer to pmh , the only hospital in the country with pediatric oncology services . assessment of attendees found that the majority of health care workers in botswana had no prior training or clinical experience in pediatric oncology . though treatment is available at pmh for children with cancer , recognition of suspected cancer and timely referral are essential to offer curative options for batswana children . delayed presentation and diagnosis of pediatric cancer is a major issue in lmics . the reasons for delay of diagnosis are multifactorial , including the malignancy type , patient / family demographics , and multiple factors within health care systems in lmics . a south african study found that the median time of physician delay , the time from the child s presentation to the health care system until diagnosis of cancer , was 20 days , contrasted with patient delay , the time lapse between onset of symptoms until the first health care encounter , which was 5 days . a turkish study had similar results , with a median physician delay of 28 days versus 3 days for the patient / parent delay . this study also found that the physician delay was longer when the first patient contact was with a general practitioner instead of a pediatrician and even longer if the first contact physician was a nonpediatric specialist . of the 109 workshop attendees in botswana who identified as physicians , only 10 ( 9.2% ) identified as a pediatrician . because of the late presentation of childhood cancers in south africa , the southern african children s cancer study group ( saccsg ) developed the saint siluan warning signs of childhood cancer . the warning signs were distributed throughout the johannesburg area , with a catchment area population of 6 million , over a 6-month period , through lectures ( 610 attendees ) and posters . public awareness was also included through a multimedia campaign . compared with the 12 years that preceded the awareness campaign , new referrals and new cancer diagnoses increased in the 6 years following the program from a mean of 78.4/year to 109.3/year . in botswana , the pediatric hematology - oncology program at pmh has primarily relied on 1 bcm / txch pediatric hematologist - oncologist to serve the entire country , including a busy hematology service with the country s only comprehensive hemophilia program for adults and children . because of the addition of a second physician through the baylor international pediatric aids initiative ( bipai)/texas children s hospital global health corps and a txch project manager / care coordinator based at pmh , the full - time pediatric hematologist - oncologist was able to engage in nationwide outreach for the first time since the program s inception in 2007 . with limited time and resources , more than 50% of government hospitals were reached , with 362 health care workers attending the training . the long - term impact on referral patterns and new cancer diagnoses remains to be seen , but the short - term impact can be seen in the respondents increased awareness of basic pediatric cancer knowledge and the services available at pmh for children with cancer . although this cancer recognition program met its goals , limitations of the program emerged that will inform future pediatric cancer education initiatives . expenses for this training program included travel costs for the physician , educational materials , and catering at some sites . the overall cost of the program was $ 4054.02 or $ 11.20 per health care worker trained . with limited full - time staffing in botswana , it is not possible for the pmh oncologist to engage in prolonged educational initiatives while maintaining the quality of the clinical service . future training models may involve intensively training representatives from hospitals and clinics throughout botswana to serve as a local resource for their colleagues and as a direct link to the pediatric hematology - oncology service at pmh . txch is also currently developing a web - based didactic teaching model to include both physician and nurse education . with only 26.8% of attendees of the pediatric cancer recognition workshops indicating that their clinical training program had a pediatric oncology component , there is a tremendous need to incorporate pediatric cancer training into preservice training programs for physicians , nurses , and all health care workers in botswana . engaging the government and other stakeholders to promote pediatric cancer modules in training programs will be paramount . there are many challenges to improving diagnosis and survival of pediatric cancer in lmics . even where programs exist to treat children with cancer , such as the program at pmh , successful treatment is dependent on children being appropriately recognized and urgently referred to advanced care by health care workers in the primary care setting . despite significant deficiencies in human resources , a pediatric cancer recognition program was presented at half of all government / mission hospitals throughout botswana . sustained efforts are necessary to maximize the impact of such programs to lead to improved survival of pediatric cancer patients in lmics .", "jss contributed to the conception and design ; contributed to acquisition , analysis , and interpretation of data ; drafted the manuscript ; critically revised the manuscript ; gave final approval ; and agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy . ei contributed to the conception and design ; critically revised the manuscript ; gave final approval ; and agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy . psm contributed to the conception and design ; critically revised the manuscript ; gave final approval ; and agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy ."], "summary": "delayed presentation of children with cancer is a significant barrier to improving the survival from children s cancer in low- and middle -

Ocular Manifestations of Alzheimer's Disease in Animal Disease Models", "5. Conclusion"], "document": ["alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) is a form of dementia affecting 26.6 million people worldwide as of 2006 ; a figure predicted to quadruple by 2050 . it manifests clinically with progressive cognitive impairment that can be divided into a predementia phase and mild , moderate , and severe dementia phases which are increasingly accompanied by noncognitive and neurological disturbances .   there has been much work investigating the pathogenesis of ad which has resulted in several key findings allowing formation of several hypotheses .   the most well - regarded theories as to the pathology underlying the degeneration of neurons in the brain are the formation of extracellular senile plaques ( sps ) via amyloid - beta ( a ) deposition   and formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles ( nfts ) via hyperphosphorylation of tau protein . indeed the presence of sps and nfts remain the mandatory pathological findings to make a definitive diagnosis , a stipulation that has not changed since they were first described in 1906 by alois alzheimer . the exact mechanisms as to how a deposition and nft formation cause neurotoxicity and neuronal loss remain unclear although several factors have been postulated . these include increased oxidative stress by production of reactive oxygen species by a [ 7 , 8 ] , increased oxidative stress mediated by metal ions within a , and interaction of a peptides with the n - methyl - d - aspartate ( nmda ) receptor resulting in neurotoxicity . in fact , to go back a step in the pathogenesis of ad , it is also not clear what causes the aggregation of a as amyloid plaques ; however , there is much evidence that it involves the dyshomeostasis of metal ions . a is known to precipitate out in the presence of primarily zinc but also copper and iron ions   due to a high - affinity metal - binding site , and occupation of this binding site has been shown to prevent the formation of a from app by inhibiting the initial cleavage of app by -secretase . the relevance to ad is clear in that pathology only seems to occur when a precipitates out and forms plaques . many studies have demonstrated that a plaques contain high levels of zinc and copper [ 23 , 24 ] . the potential significance of zinc in the aetiology of a formation and therefore ad is underscored by the fact that the a plaque load experienced by app transgenic mice is attenuated by crossing with mice that lack a zinc transporter and are thus unable to transport zinc into synaptic vesicles . in the same vein , it is also worth noting that a plaques are concentrated in the most zinc - rich area of the brain , the hippocampus , and levels of hippocampal zinc have been shown to be higher in ad brains than age - matched controls . much of the insight we have gained with regards a and tau pathology has been obtained from specific genetic mutations that account for a subset of ad ( approximately 1% of the disease as a whole ) which is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner . there are three genes that have been identified that cause familial ad ( fad ) . so far , twenty different mutations affecting the app gene causing fad have been defined . the two other locations of fad mutations are presenilin 1 ( ps1 ) on chromosome 14 [ 32 , 33 ] and presenilin 2 ( ps2 ) on chromosome 1 [ 34 , 35 ] .   although much progress has been made in our understanding of ad , this has not as yet been translated into either effective treatments or , crucially , an earlier or more accurate diagnosis . currently , a firm diagnosis of ad requires histological analysis of central nervous system ( cns ) tissue to find the pathological changes described above and is thus a postmortem one . making a clinical , premortem diagnosis relies on assessment of cognitive impairment and memory loss and has been reported to be inaccurate in 1015% of cases , presumably due in part to the similarity of symptoms to other diseases such as depression and other forms of dementia . in addition , a clinical diagnosis is less than ideal because , firstly , it is difficult in the early stages to distinguish ad from normal ageing effects and , secondly , the ability to detect cognitive impairment implies a significant amount of damage has occurred already , making possible treatments less likely to be effective .   these problems have led to significant efforts in identifying biomarkers that could be used to diagnose and monitor ad . there has been some promise in using magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) to determine differential patterns of brain atrophy   as well as using positron emission tomography ( pet ) scanning to detect labelled a plaques . other studies have shown that ad patients have higher levels of tau protein and lower levels of a42 in their cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) [ 3841 ] . as worthy as these efforts are , they are not yet accurate enough to be useful for diagnosis with , for example , the use of mri to detect atrophy only able to differentiate from normal subjects in 85% of cases [ 37 , 42 , 43 ] , which is not an improvement on clinical diagnosis . there is also the not inconsiderable cost of these techniques to consider , especially in the context of the prevalent nature of ad , as well as the difficulties of compliance in this group of patients .   although reluctant to quote a clich that has been adapted by the scientific community from an even more hackneyed phrase , it is true that the eye can be considered a window to the brain . the retina exists as an extension of the cns , and , thanks to its purpose of receiving light and translating into vision , it is optically transparent . changes that occur in the retina can be visualised noninvasively and directly with increasingly sophisticated imaging techniques . as impressive as noninvasively detecting labelled a plaques with pet imaging is , it is a far cry from the ability to detect changes in single neurons as is now possible in the eye [ 4447 ] . historically , the visual symptoms that have long been reported in ad patients ( see later ) have been attributed to neuronal damage to the visual pathways in the brain rather than the retina [ 48 , 49 ] ; however , there is increasing evidence that the specific pathological findings in the brain occur in the retina also , both in ad patients and transgenic ad animal models .", "various different aspects of vision have been reported to be affected in ad since cogan 's findings in 1985 . these include abnormalities in visual acuity , [ 50 , 51 ] , contrast sensitivity [ 52 , 72 ] , colour vision [ 54 , 55 ] , and motion perception [ 73 , 74 ] .   as would be expected , the majority of the changes that have been observed in ad eyes are in the retina .   cross - sectional imaging of the retina using optical coherence tomography ( oct ) has demonstrated in various studies that ad is associated with thinning of the peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer ( rnfl ) [ 6264 ] with the loss occurring superiorly initially . these in vivo findings correspond with the predominantly inferior visual field loss experienced by ad patients   and are corroborated by histopathological findings of reduced number of rgcs and axonal degeneration in postmortem ad retinas [ 7577 ] . in vivo imaging has also suggested a correlation of ad severity and reduced thickness of the rnfl ( presumably due to loss of rgcs and axonal degeneration ) at the macula   as well as a decrease in rnfl thickness and neuroretinal rim of the optic nerve head . in vivo doppler imaging techniques have demonstrated a decrease in retinal blood flow   analogous to cerebral blood abnormalities demonstrated in ad , although whether this is a primary phenomenon or simply a consequence of a thinned retina is hard to say . changes in pattern electroretinograms ( perg ) and visual evoked potentials ( veps ) have been noted in ad patients [ 6668 ] with specific changes being correlated with rnfl thickness . app and a immunoreactivity has been detected in an age - dependent manner   in the retinas of ad patients , and , even more excitingly ( in terms of finding a retinal biomarker for ad ) , a plaques have been demonstrated as a postmortem finding in the retinas of ad patients . a comprehensive review has been published on this topic elsewhere . ad patients have been noted to suffer from a particular type of cataract , namely , equatorial supranuclear , with a deposition localised to the opacities . similar cataracts have been noted in down 's syndrome subjects , further supporting deposition of a in the lens as the cause . this raises the intriguing possibility that one could detect a in the lens as a screening tool for ad although clearly this would require the changes in the lens preceding the symptoms of ad which has not as yet been proven . it would be interesting indeed if an ocular biomarker was found for ad that is not connected to the cns . a summary of these visual pathway signs and symptoms that have been described in ad patients is presented in table 2 . these findings make a compelling case to investigate ocular manifestations of ad further , and , for the remainder of this paper , we shall look at what has been discovered using animal models of ad .", "fad accounts for less than 1% of ad cases [ 83 , 84 ] and has been shown to be due to the three genes mentioned above ( app , ps1 , and ps2 ) inherited in an autosomal dominant manner . their relatively small contribution to the ad burden as a whole is inversely proportional to the amount of information we have gleaned from them , both in terms of forming and confirming hypotheses about the pathogenesis , and providing animal models . the use of animal models in investigating any disease process is important as they provide a way of standardising the disease among subjects and can be experimented on in ways that are simply not possible in human subjects . most of the animal models of ad are mice as , firstly , they are mammals and therefore have a similar cns structure to humans , and , secondly , it is relatively easy and inexpensive to produce transgenic strains expressing one or more of the elucidated genes .   currently , transgenic mice come in three varieties : single , double , or triple transgenic simply referring to the number of genes they express . the earliest mice models were single transgenic which increased a by increasing app via a mutant app gene . early examples include the pdapp mice which express an fad mutation containing a valine residue substitution at position 717 using a platelet - derived growth factor- promoter   and the tg2576 mice which express a different fad mutation characterised from a swedish family of fad sufferers ( k670n / m671l ) using a hamster prion promoter . both these lines expressing different fad - associated mutations and various others that have been designed since [ 8789 ] have shown amyloid deposition and glial activation that increases with age [ 86 , 90 ] and overall have been successful in mimicking these neuropathological aspects of ad as well as cognitive deficits .   although these different models do show significant similarities across different studies , there are differences such as timing of onset of the amyloid plaques   which is presumably explained by the different host strains , different promoters , and different specific mutations of each model . app mutations account for only a small proportion of fad , and mice expressing fad mutations of ps1 and ps2 have also been created . transgenic mice containing either fad ps1 or ps2 mutations show elevated levels of the relatively amyloidogenic a42 ; however , these lines do not go on to develop plaques [ 92 , 93 ] , a finding that can be explained by the fact that mice and rats lack two histidines that make up the a metal binding site [ 20 , 94 , 95 ] and highlight further the potential importance of zinc dyshomeostasis mentioned earlier .   a natural follow on from this is to create double transgenic mice containing both app and ps1 or ps2 mutations . various combinations have been created and investigated , and , in general , the addition of a ps1 or ps2 mutant gene to the app mutant gene accelerates the rate of amyloid deposition and plaque formation [ 9699 ] . a triple transgenic mouse model was created in 2003 containing app , ps1 , as well as tau transgenes   which successfully recapitulated the amyloidogenic as well as the nft features of ad with the mice developing amyloid plaques as well as nfts . more recently , rat models using the same principles have been established that show similar rates of amyloid deposition [ 101103 ] and have the theoretical advantage that behavioural studies will be more achievable than in mice . other avenues explored in rodent models are over expressing endogenous app , knockout mice , mutations in beta , gamma , and alpha secretase , apoe , however , it is beyond the remit of this paper to describe all these in detail and the reader is directed toward a database of ad animal models kept by the alzheimer research forum at http://www.alzforum.org/res/com/tra and two comprehensive reviews on ad animal models from spires and hyman and from duyckaerts et al . worth briefly mentioning are nonrodent models of ad which , while having the obvious disadvantage of being so phylogenetically distinct from humans , have the advantages that they are easier , cheaper , and quicker to perform experiments on . the drosophila fruit fly contains a homolog of app   and presenilin   as does the nematode ceanorhabditis elegans [ 107 , 108 ] . overexpression of these endogenous proteins as well as transgenic expression of human mutant app , ps , and tau genes in these species has certainly contributed to this field however not to the same extent as their rodent counterparts . the remainder of this paper will focus on what we have learnt specifically from the eyes of these animal models .", "several studies using transgenic ad mouse models have demonstrated the presence of a in the retina . one study by liu and colleagues   used the previously described single transgenic tg2576 mouse model which contains the app double swedish mutation and shows an age - dependent deposition of extracellular a and amyloid plaques in the cerebellum , hippocampus , and cortex as well as displaying cognitive deficits . in this study , they demonstrated extracellular a immunoreactivity and plaque like formation using four different monoclonal antibodies as well as congo red staining in tg2576 retinas . the a deposition occurred predominantly from the ganglion cell layer to the outer nuclear level with plaques even found in the photoreceptor layer and optic nerve head . another study that utilised the tg2576 mouse model was less successful however in detecting a deposition . here , a immunoreactivity was tested using the a monoclonal mouse antibody 1e8 and was only found in the retinal periphery with no plaque like structures detected . of relevance is the fact that , in the same study , plaque - like structures were found in the cerebral cortex of the same animals using the same antibody . also interesting to note is that the differences in the studies can not be explained by a disparity in age of the animals as liu et al . retinal a deposition has also been found in double and triple transgenic mouse models expressing app and ps mutations . one study used two different strains of app / ps mice . in the first strain which contained mutant human app and ps1 genes ( tg2576  tg1 ) , they found that extracellular a deposition , as determined by immunoreactivity to a monoclonal mouse a antibody , was present predominantly in the nerve fibre layer and ganglion cell layer in animals aged 27 months but not at the younger age of 7.8 months . in the second strain containing the same app mutant gene but with a different ps1 gene ( appswe / ps1e9 ) , there was a similar pattern of a immunoreactivity predominantly in the nerve fibre and ganglion cell layer although these animals were at an intermediate age of 10.5 months . this second strain ( appswe / ps1e9 ) has been used in two subsequent studies facilitating a comparison of sorts . in one of these studies by perez and colleagues , a plaques , as determined by thioflavin - s and confirmed with immunostaining , were found from 12 months old but predominantly in the inner and outer plexiform layers with far fewer plaques present in the gcl , inl , and onl . another study utilising the same mouse model is from dutescu and colleagues . in this study , moderate a deposition was detected in the gcl , ipl , inl and opl in 9-month - old mice . overall these results seem rather inconclusive ; however , the lack of a plaques found in ning and dutescu 's work is potentially explained by the fact that they were looking at an earlier time point than the earliest point at which plaques were detected ( 12 months ) in perez ' study . one study has further characterised that the relatively amyloidogenic form of a , a42 , is deposited in the gcl , inl , and onl of app single transgenic and app / ps1 double transgenic mice .   recent studies using a triple transgenic mouse model expressing app , ps1 , and tau mutations have also demonstrated increased a deposition across the retina , particularly in the gcl and the inner segments of photoreceptor [ 47 , 115 ] .   a particularly exciting finding is that , in double transgenic mice ( appswe / ps1e9 ) , retinal a plaques can be stained with curcumin and imaged safely in vivo . in the same study , they demonstrated that the retinal plaques detected ex vivo occurred prior to plaques in the brain . this is hugely relevant as it suggests that retinal changes could potentially be used to make a diagnosis of ad , noninvasively , prior to even the current gold standard of postmortem histological analysis . a has also been detected in the retinal and choroidal vasculature of animal models in keeping with the corollary in the brain ; cerebral amyloid angiopathy [ 110 , 116 , 117 ] . in 27-month - old double transgenic mice ( tg2576  tg1 ) , a immunoreactivity was detected in both retinal and choroidal microvasculature which was not present in younger ( 7.8 months ) animals . at an intermediate age ( 10.5 months ) a immunoreactivity was present in the choroidal vasculature only . it should be noted that the intermediate aged animals , although double transgenic for app and ps1 as with the 7.8- and 27-month old animals , contained different mutations . another study using tg2576 single transgenic mice   detected a deposition in retinal capillaries of 14-month - old mice . interestingly , administration of amyloid peptide vaccinations increased this vascular deposition despite decreasing the extracellular plaques which mirrors what occurs in brains of mice models   and supports the theory that immunotherapy solubilises a allowing it to drain via the vascular system . as one would expected app has been detected in the retina of the same animals that exhibit a deposition .   in single transgenic tg2576 mice which overexpress app , liu et al .   this was corroborated in a separate study using the same animals of a similar age .   in double transgenic mice ( tg2576   tg1 ) , app was likewise detected in the gcl and inl of 27-month - old animals although was not present in younger , 7.8-month - old , mice . unlike the tg2576 single transgenic mice , app was detected to a small degree in the rpe and photoreceptors . in the same study , a different double transgenic strain ( appswe / ps1e9 ) exhibited app immunoreactivity only in the gcl at an intermediate age of 10.5 months . the same animal model in a different study   showed moderate app staining in the ipl and opl in 9-month - old animals . app immunoreactivity has also been detected in the retina of a double transgenic mouse model containing the swedish app mutation and a ps1 knock in , although this study did not clarify in which layers this was confined to . the hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule - associated protein tau and subsequent deposition as neurofilbrillary tangles is associated with various neurodegenerative disorders ( collectively called tauopathies ) such as progressive supranuclear palsy , frontotemporal dementia , and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 and ad [ 120 , 121 ] . tau inclusions have been observed in the brains of ad transgenic mice [ 100 , 122 , 123 ] and appear to be a feature of the ad retina as well . in single transgenic tg2576 mice overexpressing app , hyperphosphorylated tau was detected using the at8 antibody adjacent to the a deposition from the gcl through to the onl . a different mouse model that expresses the human p301s tau transgene and develops tau inclusions throughout the central nervous system   is used as a model for tauopathies rather than specifically ad . in this transgenic line , hyperphosphorylated tau was found in the rnfl which progressed to tau inclusions in the gcl with associated deleterious effects on axonal growth . activated microglia and astrocytes are thought to initiate neuroinflammation in ad and have been shown to be upregulated in the brains of mouse models of ad [ 125 , 126 ] . it is then relatively unsurprising that significant upregulation of inflammation has been detected in the retinas of ad mouse models . in tg2576 single transgenic mice , there was increased activation of astrocytes and microglia in all layers of the retina compared to wild - type controls as detected using cell - specific markers gfap for astrocytes and iba1 for microglia . immunisation with amyloid peptide vaccinations in the same study led to increased neuroinflammation in the retina in accordance with similar findings in the brains of ad mouse models . in double transgenic mice ( appswe / ps1e9 ) , microglial activation was significantly higher than in age - matched controls as detected using a macrophage marker f4/80 . the same study used gfap to look for astrocytic activation and found that there was no measurable upregulation . in the same double transgenic model aged 10.5 months , another study found that monocyte chemotactic protein ( mcp ) 1 , a relatively nonspecific marker of inflammation was increased in the gcl ( the same area as a deposition was occurring ) compared with wild - type controls although f4/80 immunoreactivity was not significantly different . a different double transgenic model ( tg2576  tg1 ) in the same study found that , at a younger age , f4/80 and mcp-1 immunoreactivity was significantly less than at a higher age of 27 months leading them to conclude that this was due to progression of ad and that the mcp-1 but not f4/80 immunoreactivity in the intermediate aged mice represented a relatively early stage of inflammation prior to microglial activation . while this may well be true , the lack of a wild - type control at the young and old ages makes it hard to be sure that this is not merely an ageing effect independent of ad . another finding that suggests an important role of neuroinflammation in the propagation of ad and indeed other neurodegenerative disorders is a consistent downregulation of complement factor h ( cfh ) in ad brain . cfh is a cofactor that acts to suppress the alternative complement pathway ; hence , low levels of cfh have a proinflammatory effect . one paper evaluated the presence of cfh and a40 and a42 peptides in the brains and retinas of several different transgenic ad mouse models ( tg2576 , psapp , 3  tg - ad , and 5  fad ) and found that there was a consistent inverse correlation between levels of a and cfh in the retinas of these transgenics   suggesting that an environment promoting complement activation is a feature of ad retinas . interestingly , cfh has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of amd , another neurodegenerative disease affecting the retina suggesting , perhaps , a similar contribution of neuroinflammation to these diseases . zinc has been shown to cause aggregation of cfh monomers   which , combined with the high levels of cfh and zinc   that are found in the sub - rpe deposits ( drusen ) that characterise this disease , suggest a critical role for zinc analogous to the one it is postulated to play in ad . unfortunately , to the best of our knowledge , there is no research that has looked at levels of zinc in the retina of ad animal models . in common with other neurodegenerative diseases , cell death and loss of neurons is an end stage of ad .   in double transgenic mice ( tg2576  tg1 ) , a significant increase in apoptosing cells in the gcl of 27-month - old animals compared with 7.8 month old animals was detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dutp nick end labeling assay ( tunel ) . the same study also found an increase in tunel - positive cells in the gcl of a different double transgenic model ( appswe / ps1e9 ) compared with age - matched controls . in single transgenic tg2576 mice , using retinal thickness as a measure of neuronal loss , a reduced thickness was detected compared with wild - type controls . in addition , administration of amyloid peptide vaccinations attenuated the reduction of retinal thickness in conjunction with a reduction of a deposition in these animals . using tunel to look at nmda - induced apoptosis in app and ps1 single transgenic mice and app / ps1 double transgenic mice has yielded potential insight into how a may cause retinal degeneration . in this study , app and app / ps1 transgenic mice displayed fewer tunel - positive cells in the gcl following injection of nmda than wild - type controls suggesting that deposition of a may prevent activation of nmda - receptor pathways and mediate retinal dysfunction in ad in this way . in the same study , however , there was no detected difference in rgc number or inl thickness ( obviously a relatively crude measure of neuronal loss ) between the app overexpressing single transgenic mice , app / ps1 double transgenic , and ps1 knockin mice and their wild - type controls . this is clearly at odds with other studies and may represent a difference in the strains used as well as less sensitive methods of counting cells . a relatively recent development now allows direct visualisation of apoptosing ganglion cells in the retina . using a fluorophore labelled annexin v protein as a marker of apoptosis and confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscopy to detect the fluorescence , it is possible to image single apoptosing ganglion cells in real time and in vivo [ 44 , 46 ] . this technique has been refined and used to visualise apoptosing ( labelled with annexin v ) and necrosing ( labelled with propidium iodide ( pi ) ) cells in a triple transgenic mouse model of ad . in this study , the triple transgenic mice displayed increased rgc apoptosis and decreased rgc necrosis compared with wild - type controls . for obvious and very sensible reasons , the retina has been the target of most of the research looking at ad in the eye . it has though been established that the lenses of ad patients , as mentioned earlier , contain a aggregates that colocalise with a specific type ( equatorial supranuclear ) of cataract . this appears to be similarly manifested in ad mouse models with the epithelial cells of the corneas and lenses of single transgenic tg2576 mice and double transgenic app / ps1 mice , being immunopositive for app and a .", "the idea of using the retina as a means of diagnosing or measuring progression of ad or any other neurodegenerative disease is an inherently attractive one for the reasons outlined above , and the studies discussed here provide much to be optimistic about . perhaps one of the main advantages of using the retina is the ability to noninvasively look directly at the nervous system . much of the evidence discussed above shows that changes in the retina occur later than in the brain . the single transgenic tg2576 mouse model has been shown to develop a plaques in the brain at 9 months , while similar changes occur in the retina at 14 months [ 109 , 111 ] . there is a similar pattern when looking at double transgenic mouse models with the tg2576  tg1 model showing increased levels of a40 and a42 in the brain by 3 - 4 months   while not being raised in the retina of 7.8-month - old animals .   however , a recent study looking at double transgenic mice has shown very clearly that a plaques appear earlier in the retina than in the brain by examining the same animals over time   and , further , that they can be imaged noninvasively at this early stage . this finding raises the profile of the retina as a potential source of an earlier diagnosis in ad although it remains to be seen whether this finding is replicated in other studies and in human subjects . as discussed earlier , the role of zinc in the formation of a plaques appears to be significant and the fact that the retina is a particularly zinc - rich tissue   bodes well for any plaque pathology being detectable relatively early in the disease .   the rationale for investigating the retina is that , as an extension of the cns , it is reasonable to expect to find similar changes as occur in the brain . a side effect of this research , however , has been the finding that a deposition occurs in the lenses of ad subjects   and has been found in lenses and corneas of single and double transgenic animal models . a deposition and hyperphosphorylated tau have also been detected in the lenses and corneas of triple transgenic mice   raising the slightly unexpected but equally welcome possibility that an ocular biomarker for ad may exist that is not connected with the cns . firstly , a plaques have only been detected in human ad subjects in one study , and it is this same study that provides the only evidence that retinal pathology precedes brain pathology ; both findings that need to be corroborated . secondly , there appears to be significant crossover of ad with other causes of neurodegeneration . glaucoma , for example , is a neurodegenerative disease that results in loss of rgcs and manifests with rnfl thinning and visual field defects ( i.e , . similar findings as those described for ad patients ) , that have been reported as having a higher incidence in ad . it is possible that the changes thus far reported in the eyes of ad patients and animal models are not as specific for ad as we might hope .   thirdly , putting aside the question as to whether changes in the eye precede those of the brain , it is suggested that cognitive deficits of ad may come before detectable amyloid pathology in the brain   meaning that a holy grail of detecting ad before its symptoms manifest ( implying significant loss of neurons ) by detecting amyloid plaques may not be possible .   nevertheless , as an absolute minimum , the ability to image the retina ( and rest of the eye ) noninvasively and relatively cheaply and quickly can not but massively aid in assessing possible treatment effects of anti - ad , therapies as well as improve our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of this and other forms of neurodegeneration . in common with ad there is much evidence linking zinc dyshomeostasis with the onset of amd , the leading cause of blindness in the developed world , with large amounts of zinc found in drusen . an apparent contradiction is that zinc supplements ( presumably in their antioxidant role ) have been shown to be beneficial in the nonneovascular type of amd ( so called dry amd ) . this is putatively explained in a review by nan et al .   by the fact that , as mentioned above , zinc causes aggregation of cfh . the high concentration of zinc found in drusen leads to a localised aggregation of cfh causing the sustained inflammatory response necessary for initiation of the disease . later in the disease , the tissue surrounding the zinc - rich drusen is relatively zinc depleted and hence supplementation is beneficial . this is a typical example of the commonalities between different neurodegenerative diseases and highlights how research into one area is likely to benefit in others . overall , the research looking at manifestations of ad in the eyes of animal models is notable by its paucity and it is difficult at this early stage to draw any firm conclusions other than that this is an extremely promising area of investigation and certainly warrants further research ."], "summary": "alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) is the most common form of dementia , and the pathological changes of senile plaques ( sps ) and neurofibrillary tangles ( nfts ) in ad brains are well described . clinically , a diagnosis remains a postmortem one , hampering both accurate and early diagnosis as well as research into potential new treatments . visual deficits have long been noted in ad patients , and it is becoming increasingly apparent that histopathological changes already noted in the brain also occur in an extension of the brain ; the retina . due to the optically transparent nature of the eye , it is possible to image the retina at a cellular level noninvasively and thus potentially allow an earlier diagnosis as well as a way of monitoring progression and treatment effects . transgenic animal models expressing amyloid precursor protein ( app ) presenilin ( ps ) and tau mutations have been used successfully to recapitulate the pathological findings of ad in the brain . this paper will cover the ocular abnormalities that have been detected in these transgenic ad animal models .", "ranking": [4, 3, 1, 2, 0]}

Conclusions"], "document": ["in september 2007 , the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists ( acog ) in its committee 's opinion recommended that labium minus operations can be performed to alter the size or shape ( labioreduction ) for the following medical indications :  labial hypertrophy or asymmetrical labial growth secondary to congenital conditions , chronic irritation , or excessive androgenic hormones .  additionally , the acog committee opinion suggested that  clinicians who receive request from patients for such procedures should discuss with the patient the reason for her request and perform an evaluation for any physical signs or symptoms that may indicate the need for surgical intervention .  also , acog viewed that women should be discouraged from cosmetic gynecologic surgery based upon variation of the anatomical appearance of female external genitalia . there are several surgical techniques that have been applied for labia minora labioplasty such as straightforward or partial amputation , central v - plasty ( the wedge resection ) and its modification , deepithelialized labioreduction , central wedge nymphectomy with a 90-degree z - plasty , inferior wedge resection and superior pedicle flap reconstruction , and laser labioplasty [ 28 ] . existing surgical techniques of clinical applications for labioreduction of the labia minora had been detailed by ostrzenski elsewhere [ 9 , 10 ] . reviewing labium minus labioreduction techniques and performing some of those techniques , ostrzenski was guided to establish hypothesis that a surgical intervention for labium minus labioreduction should offer reduction of the height and length , should establish symmetry , should preserve natural color and contour of the labium minus , and should restore or create natural appearance of the labium minus frenulum ( posterior edge of the fossa navicularis ) . in the observational prospective , multiple time case series clinical study , this hypothesis was tested , with study 's objectives , to develop and to present a newly developed surgical intervention of labium minus labioreduction to determine applicability of this procedure , to evaluate aesthetic surgical outcomes , and to assess potential complications of this procedure . today , woman 's demands for labia minora labioplasty either for aesthetic motives or medical indication(s ) are growing ; therefore , such a new surgical intervention is very important not only for gynecologist but also for cosmetic - plastic surgeons , urologists , and general surgeons who perform labium minus labioreduction .", "two out of three subjects presented with physical symptoms associated with the labium minus enlargements and one subject presented with dissatisfying appearance of her labia minora . the first subject was a 22-year - old caucasian woman , g0p0 , unmarried , and a college student , who has been sexually active . the disproportionately protuberant labia minora were responsible for her symptoms such as persistent irritation leading to discomfort during physical activities and following voiding and defecation . blood flow during menses significantly increased irritations and discomfort due to difficulties in maintaining personal hygiene related to enlargement of the labia minora . also , she reported superficial dyspareunia , which was caused by twitching and inadvertently pulling the enlarged labia minora into the vaginal pool . although she learned how to separate her labia minora enough to introduce a penis into her vagina to minimize superficial dyspareunia on insertion , during the act she could not control her discomfort caused by labia minora being brought into the vaginal introitus and the distal vagina . the second subject was a 27-year - old caucasian woman , g3 p3003 , married , high school teacher , and sexually active . the symptoms included discomfort associated with rubbing while walking or wearing close - fitting underwear and superficial dyspareunia , which precludes her from reaching an orgasm during sexual intercourse . the third subject was a 22-year - old caucasian woman , g0p0 , single , and a professional ballet dancer . this abnormality forced her to use specially designed compression underwear during her practices and performances . she does not report any physical discomfort when she does not wear compressive underwear on the vulvar area . however , when she wears it , she has significant discomfort , particularly , during her professional dancing . this condition caused a negative body image perception , which led to decreased self - confidence and a social phobia and anxiety . the subject requested to reduce the volume of both labia minora , which she has considered to be responsible for her deteriorated professional , social , and emotional well - beings . aesthetic dissatisfaction with the subject 's external genitalia led to social embracement and emotional disturbances . she felt extreme embarrassment not only during her professional dancing but also during her intimate life due to significant and disproportional overgrown of the labia minora . the subject requested to reduce the length and height and to create symmetrical and uniform appearance of the labia minora . all three women were subjected to newly developed fenestration labioplasty with inferior flap transposition under local infiltration . a search for the existing literatures was carried out from 1900 to may 2010 , using medical subject headings ( mesh ) and keywords of fenestration labioplasty , fenestration labioreduction , cosmetic gynecology , labial reduction , labioreduction , labia minora labioplasty , labioplasty , labia minora procedures , female genitalia , labial hypertrophy , vaginal rejuvenation , vaginoplasty , designer vaginoplasty , designer vagina , and labium minus which were selected and used in a search on isi web of science ( including conferences proceedings ; 1950 pubmed ) , acognet , proquest , ovid , cochrane collection , the lancet on line collection , mdconsultant , new england journal of medicine , american college of physician on line resources , highwire journal , and citation index reference , and a manual search was utilized . an informed consent was structured in accordance with the existing recommendation of the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists . additionally , all women authorized ostrzenski to use their clinical data and digital photo images of their genital organs for publishing in medical peer - reviewed journals . the procedure was executed under local anesthesia without conscious sedation . a thick layer of lidocaine - prilocaine ( 2.5%/2.5% ) cream was applied to the labia minora and immediately adjacent areas bilaterally ; the region was covered with sterile gauze for 1 hour , the last 30 minutes before procedures an ice pack was added to this area . upon removing the ice pack , the remaining anesthetic cream was wiped off and the operative field was prepped with betadine solution . half way between the posterior commissure and the upper part of the anus in the middle and the ischopubic ramus , just under the superficial transverse perineal muscle , 510  ml of plain 1% lidocaine was injected with the 27  g  1/2 inch needle and 10  cc syringes ( terumo , elkton , md , usa ) in one side for local anesthesia . the superficial part of the deep branch of the perineal nerve and the posterior labial nerves were infiltrated with one injection and provided with adequate local anesthesia for this procedures . neither conscious sedation nor pudendal block was used . upon determining the size of labia minora volume being reduced , the base of the lower margin of incision was determined and outlining of the amount of the tissues being removed was marked in the shape of a  bicycle helmet  within the anterior labial surface ; see figures 1 , 5 , and 6 . also , in this process the arch of the new labium was determined ; see figure 1 . shape was accomplished and excised , see figures 2 , 5(b ) , and 6(a ) . by doing so , the labium was divided into two fragments : the superior strip was partially detached from the rest of the labium and the inferior part at the base of the labium minus . immediately , the superior strip of the labium was sutured to the lower base edge of the labium minus . the anterior labial lamina and posterior labial lamina were sutured on both sites separately without suturing the erectile tissues between the labial laminae . below the arch , the labium inferior flap is gradually reduced in the wedge shape ( the proximal part of the flap being bigger and then the distal segment ) gradually getting smaller and thinner to create natural look of the labia . the distal labium part of the inferior flap is modeled in the arch shape to meet in the midline with the opposite distal labium just above the posterior commissure . such a tissue transposition creates the labium minus frenulum ( posterior border of the fossa navicularis ) . the length of the inferior flap of the labium is trimmed and sutured in the same manner as presented above . the procedure was executed bilaterally in all the subjects ; see figures 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 . postoperatively , discomfort was controlled with external application of dermoplast , an antiseptic and pain relieving spray ( medtech , jackson , wy , usa ) .", "the electronic and manual searches failed to identify fenestration labioreduction with inferior flap transposition or similar surgical intervention . therefore , this presentation is the first description in the scientific - clinical literature of a fenestration labioreduction with inferior flap transposition technique . the disproportionately protuberant , enlarged , and asymmetrical labia minora were confirmed in each subject . all subjects reported feelings of decreased body image perception , being sexually inadequate and undesirable , and decreased self - image and confidence . two women reported symptoms of persistent irritation leading to discomfort during physical activities , following voiding , defecation , and getting worse during menses as a result of difficulties in maintaining personal hygiene and reported superficial dyspareunia during sexual intercourse . the third subject presented with aesthetic dissatisfaction from her appearance of enlarged , asymmetrical labia minora . the newly developed operation of fenestration labioreduction with inferior flap transposition was applied without intraoperative , short- and long - term complications . in all subjects , the fenestration labioreduction with inferior flap transposition operation reduced the height and length , established symmetry , preserved natural color and contour of the labium minus , and restored or created natural appearance of the labium frenulum ( posterior edge of the fossa navicularis ) . postoperatively , medical and emotional symptoms and signs resolved ; pleasing surgical outcomes exceeded subjects ' aesthetic expectations . additionally , body self - image and confidence improved meaningfully in all subjects . none of the subjects verbally reported feeling of regret and described reduction of the emotional tension , which was generated by conflict of being different and dilemma of feeling of being helpless . social openness improved and intimate interaction increased , and their body image perception improved following the operation . there were no intraoperative , short- , or long - term complications recorded in all three subjects . the average time of surgery measured from the initial incision to completion of fenestration with inferior flap transposition was 36 minutes . all subjects engaged in vaginal sexual intercourse with their respective male partners 6 weeks following the surgery .", "this clinical study 's results indicated that practitioners should look at the enlarged labia minora not only for physical symptoms ( irritation , difficulties in maintaining personal hygiene , discomfort during physical activities , and discomfort during voiding or defecation ) but also from the prospective of sexual dysfunction ( pain during vaginal sexual intercourse ) or emotional disturbances related to this condition ( feeling inadequate , decreased feeling of body image perception , and being embarrassed socially ) . therefore , not only clinical symptoms but also an aesthetic aspect plays significant roles in the labium minus enlargement . implementation of fenestration labium minus labioreduction with inferior flap transposition demonstrates the use of clinical settings and eliminates potential for denuding the posterior vaginal introitus . analyzing existing surgical techniques for labioreduction such as central v - plasty , central v - plasty , and central wedge nymphectomy with 90 z - plasty and w - plasty one can draw a conclusion that these surgical techniques will leave transverse single or multiple scars on longitudinal organ such as the labium minus [ 2 , 4 , 7 ] . an inferior wedge resection technique leaves completely denuded areas around posterior and lateral vaginal introitus , which lead to high superficial dyspareunia and unaccepted high rates of wound separations [ 5 , 8 ] . consequently , this technique will not only compromise aesthetic outcomes but also can be responsible for sexual dysfunction ( superficial dyspareunia ) . other labioreduction surgical interventions such as labial partial amputation , deepithelialized reduction labioplasty , inferior wedge resection and superior pedicle flap reconstruction will be appropriate for clinical implementations [ 2 , 3 , 6 , 8 ] . liao et al . and ostrzenski presented detailed evaluation of each surgical technique relating to labioreduction of the labia minora [ 9 , 10 , 13 ] . differences between existing surgical procedures and the fenestration labioreduction with inferior flap transposition ( flft ) technique are significant . none of existing surgical interventions will encompass reduction of the height and length , established symmetry , preserved natural color and contour of the labia minora , and restored or created natural appearance of the labium frenulum ( posterior edge of the fossa navicularis ) in one procedure and only the fenestration labioreduction with inferior flap transposition technique incorporates all of them . when compared to partial labial amputation , flft preserved natural color and contour of the labium minus and restored or created natural appearance of the posterior edge of the fossa navicularis and partial amputation does not [ 2 , 3 ] . deepithelialized reduction labioplasty can only be offered for very thin and elongated labia minora , since it makes the labia minora much thicker or bulky at the base and flft will not do it . deepithelialized reduction labioplasty can only reduce the height of the labia minora ; flft will reduce both the height and the length of the labia minora . deepithelialized reduction labioplasty will not restore or create the posterior boarder of the fossa navicularis and flft will . the inferior wedge resection and superior pedicle flap reconstruction will not restore or create the posterior boarder of the fossa navicularis and flft will . the inferior wedge resection and superior pedicle flap reconstruction will create unnatural appearance of the proximal labia connection and flft will not . the inferior wedge resection and superior pedicle flap reconstruction has tendency to stretch the superior pedicle flap and flft has not . the inferior wedge resection and superior pedicle flap reconstruction often creates undesirable permanent wrinkling and irregularity at the proximal approximation of the incision and the flft procedures are free of it . by all means , ostrzenski does not make any suggestion that flft is the only procedure that should be used in all cases . therefore , the clinical judgment should be exercise , and all four relevant procedures ( labial partial amputation , deepithelialized reduction labioplasty , and inferior wedge resection and superior pedicle flap reconstruction , and fenestration labioreduction with inferior flap transposition ) should be taken into account and the surgical intervention which suits patient 's needs should be selected . small power of the study can be considered as a weakness ; however , to test the established hypothesis the numbers of cases were sufficient to determine surgical applicability of flft . the importance of this study 's results strongly suggest that not only aesthetic pleasing results can be accomplished in well - selected women by applying this surgical intervention but also the results imply that the clinical symptoms as well as emotional disturbances related to the enlarged labium minus can be eradicated .", "in this study group , fenestration labioreduction with inferior flap transposition surgical intervention can be executed effortlessly without complications and the method can be reproduced ;

sensitive staphylococcus aureus ( mssa ) was identified in 9/37 ( 23.4% ) and methicillin - resistant coagulase - negative staphylococcus ( mrcns ) in 11/67 ( 13.4% ) of patients . preoperative ear culture studies identified pathogens in 39/67 ( 58.2% ) of the patients : the most commonly identified species was staphylococcus [ mrcns 26.9% , methicillin - sensitive coagulase - negative staphylococcus ( mscns ) 1.5% , mrsa 13.4% and mssa 11.9% ] . mrsa was found in 3/40 ( 4.5% ) ears , mssa in 2 ears ( 3.0% ) , mrcns in 2 ears ( 3.0% ) and mscns in 1 ear ( 1.5% ) . after the surgery , 11 of the 67 patients developed otorrhea within 1 month postoperatively . the postoperative culture studies identified mrsa in 3/11 ( 27.3% ) and acinetobacter species in 1/11 ( 9.1% ) and fungus in 2/11 ( 18.1% ) patients ( table 2 ) . preoperative ear culture results and nasal swab culture results showed significant difference ( p=0.001 ) , as well as intraoperative middle ear cultures and postoperative otorrhea culture results showed significant difference ( p=0.023 ) . however , no significant difference was noted between preoperative ear and postoperative otorrhea culture results ( p=0.493 ) . then we compared the culture results according to the presence of bacterial growth and reports of no growth ( fig . no significant difference was noted between preoperative ear culture , and nasal swab culture results ( p=0.055 ) , between preoperative ear and postoperative otorrhea culture results ( p=0.068 ) , or nasal swab and postoperative otorrhea culture results ( p=0.094 ) . lastly , the culture results were compared according to the presence of antibiotic resistance ( fig . no significant difference was noted between the antibiotic - susceptible and resistant strains identified between preoperative ear culture and nasal swab cultures ( p=0.098 ) , or between preoperative ear and postoperative otorrhea cultures ( p=0.053 ) . then we analyzed the correlation of isolated organisms from the nasal swab and other cultures in patients with nasal colonization of antibiotic -

resistant pseudomonas in 1 , and no growth in 2 patients .", "increasing incidence of antibiotic - resistant bacterial strains in csom patients poses a challenge to not only the selection of appropriate antibiotics therapy , but also to prevent the emergence of resistance to glycopeptides , the main drugs chosen for mrsa . it has been reported that patients who are colonized with s. aureus are the main source of s. aureus in hospitals , and that nasal carriage of mrsa increases the risk of postoperative infection . since the rate of methicillin resistance is higher in korean csom patients compared to other countries , we examined the rate of nasal mrsa colonization . the rate of nasal carriage of mrsa in csom patients was higher than among healthy individuals reported as 0.2 - 2.8% of the united states population.7 ) although this study was limited to small number of patients , the finding may suggest that in addition to nosocomial infection , community - acquired mrsa infection may contribute partially to the relatively higher rate of mrsa in csom patients in korea . on the other hand , the rates of bacterial isolation from preoperative ear discharge , intraoperative middle ear discharge , or postoperative otorrhea cultures in our patients were lower . also , the perioperative culture studies frequently reported no growth of pathogens . given that the patients were prescribed with antibiotics prior to surgery , it may signify that current antibiotics are effective in infection control during the tympanomastoid surgery . furthermore , the interpretation of the culture results from postoperative otorrhea is limited since antibiotics were routinely used postoperatively in all patients and culture samples were taken from the external auditory canal in cases with overt otorrhea or from wet surface of the grafted tympanic membrane immediately after removal of the packing material at 2 weeks postoperatively . the culture results can only reflect that mrsa infection that could not be controlled by routine antibiotics , which may be clinically significant . mrsa has been identified not only in csom patients,2,3,5,13 ) but also in patients with external otitis.14 ) \n s. aureus has been implicated in biofilm formation complicating cochlear implants.15 -

based solutions is used to reduce the density of skin colonization of mrsa preoperatively.18 - 20 ) a recent study compared the rates of mrsa infection in otolaryngology surgeries , before and after implementation of preoperative screening and treatment of nasal mrsa carriage.21 ) further studies are warranted to investigate the possible benefit of preoperative treatment of mrsa colonized patients undergoing middle ear surgeries .", "the rate of nasal mrsa colonization among patients with csom was higher than among the general community . further studies are warranted to investigate the possible benefit of preoperative treatment of mrsa colonized patients undergoing middle ear surgeries ."], "summary": "background and objectivesmethicillin -

being and spiritual health .", "the present research was a quasi - experimental project of pretest - posttest type with a control group carried out between march and june 2011 , in collaboration with shiraz university of medical sciences . the study population was selected from among patients referring to amir hospital and omid hospital . for the purpose of this research , among a large number of patients suffering from breast cancer and aged between 18 to 65 years , 24 individuals were selected after clinical interviews through the available sampling method . all the 24 participants were tested using the research tools , comprising structured clinical interview for dsm - iv ( scid - i ) , quality - of - life questionnaire ( whoqol-26 ) , and spiritual health scale ( swb-20 ) . the test group members thereafter received 12 sessions of group spiritual treatment ( table 1 ) , whereas the control group members did not receive any kind of treatment until the test group members were fully treated and the second group of questionnaires was collected . treatment sessions in brief the inclusion criteria for the present research were as follows : \n having elementary education and literacy levelbeing at least 18 and at most 60 years of agenot having the diagnostic criteria for clear psychiatric disorders such as psychosis , major depression , obsessive - compulsive disorder , and personality disorders based on the scid - i conducted by the researcher \n  having elementary education and literacy level being at least 18 and at most 60 years of age not having the diagnostic criteria for clear psychiatric disorders such as psychosis , major depression , obsessive - compulsive disorder , and personality disorders based on the scid - i conducted by the researcher subsequently , all the participants under test completed the research questionnaire in 2 rounds . the test group participated in the 12 group - treatment sessions in the form of a 120-minute session in a week .", "from the 24 participants , 43% were 50 and 57% under 50 years old , while 21% were single and 79% were married . apropos education , 37.5% of the study population were below the high school diploma , 50% had a high school diploma , and 12.5% had college education . also , 65% of the participants in each group underwent chemotherapy or there were significant differences in quality of life and some of its dimensions ( psychological and social dimensions ) between the 2 groups following the spirituality group - therapy sessions among the experimental subjects . however , as regards the physical dimension , no significant difference was observed between the 2 groups after the therapy sessions . comparison of the results of the statistical analysis of covariance at pretest and posttest in the experimental and control groups the eta - squared in this table shows that 39% , 5% , 26% , and 2% of the changes in the scores of quality of life , physical , psychological , and social aspects were created by the implementation of our treatment method . with respect to the spiritual health dimension additionally , 36% , 2% , and 38% of the changes in these variables were caused by the implementation of our treatment method . as is demonstrated in table 3 , there was no significant difference in the social aspect of quality of life between the 2 groups .", "in parallel with the findings of the present research , it has been previously observed that religiosity and spirituality can play a significant role in enhancing quality of life among patients with cancer . abedi et al . suggested that prayers and religious practices could affect not only emotional moods but also physical quality and that such practices could sometimes improve a patient with physical disease in a few moments or in a few days . quing , mccola , and larson also reported that many of their patients acknowledged the positive effects of religion on their mental and physical health . concluded that spiritual / religious group therapy could generally be effective in mental improvement in patients with schizophrenia . rocha and falek concluded that spirituality and religion could have no impact on the social dimensions of quality of life . prayer reduces anxiety , promotes spirituality , and is an appropriate method for coping with diseases . in a research conducted by hojjati et al . , a direct relationship was reported between prayer and well - being : more prayer was correlated with better health.one study probed into well - being , religious adaptation , and quality of life among african - american women who had undergone treatment for breast cancer and reported that the women who probed into well - being and religious adaptation had more positive adaptation and that there was a meaningful relationship between spiritual well - being , physical and emotional aspects of quality of life , and performance health . askari et al . posited that religious beliefs and optimism were predictors of spiritual health . spiritual and religious beliefs and practices are effective in promoting adaption to cancer by affecting existential concerns such as the search for the meaning of life and hope . today , faith and spirituality are regarded as some of the most significant sources of physical health and quality of life . evidence shows that spiritual interventions could be helpful in preventing or improving an extensive range of physical problems and coping with acute pains , diseases , and death . various studies have confirmed a meaningful relationship between spirituality and religion and quality of life , spiritual well - being , and meaning of life . our results revealed that spiritual group therapy enhanced quality of life and its psychological and social dimensions as well as spiritual well - being and its religious and existential aspects . furthermore , there is a great deal of evidence indicating that religion is a protective factor against depression and that it facilitates recovery . prominent among the salient points of spiritual group therapy is that it can improve the patient s attitude toward life or disease . the importance of stressors is determined through cognitive evaluations under the influence of beliefs and personal values such as self - control and existential and spiritual beliefs . individuals make use of available resources and various coping strategies in order to manage their stress . based on this standpoint , it can be argued that values affect significant cognitive evaluations in the process of dealing with a problem ; thus , spirituality can help individuals assess negative events in different ways . hence , spirituality offers a stronger sense of control and herewith leads to more psychological compatibility . the second factor that should be taken into account is the coordination of therapy sessions in groups . in addition , when surrounded by others afflicted with the same problem , the individual does not consider the problem as something exclusive and tends to become more hopeful . the third factor of note is the particular characteristics of patients suffering from cancer and some national and cultural features of our society . conflicts , diseases , and severe traumas usually drive individuals away from their routine course of life and make them aware of temporary values and goals . individuals in such situations need some tool to seek more long - lasting goals and values . experts believe that spirituality is described and formed by acceptable actions and beliefs in a certain culture . the fourth noteworthy factor in regard to spiritual group therapy is related to some procedures and techniques and also the impact of prayer , benediction , and communication with god . essa zadegan reported that therapeutic metaphor could be an innovative method whereby patients utilize their power of imagination to achieve better insight . the therapist had inadequate experience in treating patients suffering from cancer via group therapy and spiritual therapy .", "according to our patients statements as well as the results of our statistical analyses , spiritual group therapy could be deemed a suitable method for treating disorders such as depression and promoting the quality of life as well as the religious and existential dimensions of spiritual health in patients suffering from breast cancer ."], "summary": "cancer is deemed the century s major health problem , and its increasing growth during the last decades has made experts concerned more than ever . of all types of cancer , breast cancer is regarded as the second most common disease among women . the aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of spiritual group therapy on quality of life and spiritual well -

( specific goals include health , fairness in financial contribution and meeting the non - treatment expectations of the public ) . one of the most important packages of this plan was to promote vaginal delivery ( 10 ) . it was expected that by the end of 2014 the rate of cesarean section would be reduced by as much as 10% ( 11 ) . iran was the second highest country in the world to have caesarian section at the start of the project ( 8) . who guidelines emphasize that countries must improve maternal and infant health , by reducing the rate of cesarean section . the present study was conducted to assess the impact of healthcare reform plans on the rate of vaginal delivery and cesarean section . furthermore , the frequency and deviation of deliveries in public and private hospitals of provincial capitals were compared . in order to gain suitable strategies for policy makers in shiraz university of medical sciences , a comparison was made on the statistics related to 2013 ( one year before implementation of project ) and 2014 ( one year after implementation of project ) .", "the main aim of this study was to examine the impact of the healthcare reform plan on the number of vaginal deliveries and cesarean sections , and its impact on the government adopted policies toward increasing vaginal delivery . the rate of vaginal delivery and cesarean section in public and private hospitals were compared . first , descriptive statistics , related to the investigated period ( 20132014 ) were mentioned based on the number and percentage . then the normality in the data was tested using kolmogorov - smirnov test . according to data distribution , finally , paired - samples t - tests and wilcoxon tests were used for assessing the hypotheses . the accurate date registration , honesty in data analysis , presenting correct statistics according to the collected data , publishing the results in a simple language and presenting them to the authorities for correct decision and policy making , were taken into consideration and emphasized by the researcher .", "the average number of vaginal delivery in 2013 was less than the average number of vaginal delivery in 2014 ( table 1 ) , it revealed that there is a significant difference between the number of vaginal delivery in 2013 and 2014 ( p  0.01 ) ( table 2 ) . by observing the average number of deliveries , it was concluded that the health evolution plan was effective in increasing the number of vaginal delivery ( table 1 ) . however , the number of cesarean sections in 2014 had decreased in comparison to 2013 ( table 1 ) , was not significant ( p=0.772 ) ( table 2 ) . in this study , different indications for cesarean section were not considered . by observing the average number of deliveries , it is obvious that the healthcare reform plan has been influential in increasing the number of vaginal delivery . in addition , implementing healthcare reform has increased the number of vaginal delivery in public hospitals and decreased it in private hospitals . statistical analysis indicated that there was a significant difference between implementing the healthcare reform plan and the number of vaginal deliveries in public hospitals ( p=0.019 ) ( table 2 ) . the findings showed that there was not a significant difference between implementing the healthcare reform plan and the number of painless deliveries ( p=0.652 ) . despite the increasing number of painless deliveries in 2014 , ( due to the limited number of hospitals contributing in painless delivery ) , no significant difference could be seen and it could be concluded that the healthcare reform plan was not influential in this aspect . this study also revealed that there was not a significant difference between implanting the healthcare reform plan and the number of deliveries carried out by midwives ( p=0.428 ) . despite the increasing number of deliveries done by midwives in 2014 , due to the limited number of hospital using private midwives or lack of equipment for physiological delivery ,", "promotion of vaginal delivery and reducing the rate of cesarean section are the primary objectives of the healthcare reform plan in iran . various surveys have shown that the main reason of cesarean section is the repeated cesarean ( 12 ) . hence , proper planning is needed to reduce the number of cesarean sections in nulliparous women in order to prevent repeated cesarean sections in future . fear of vaginal delivery , mother s age and physician s recommendations are the most influential factors which encourage mothers to undergo cesarean section . so , holding consultation sessions before and during pregnancy could help mothers to choose the best method of delivery ( 13 ) . furthermore , familiarity with delivery room , staffs , equipment , analgesia , presence of visitors and making the delivery room pleasant ( 14 ) are the factors reducing maternal anxiety , and aid the mother in choosing the best method of delivery . based on the instructions of mother - friendly hospitals , training staff and physicians , limiting the use of elective cesarean section and cross section on uterus for possible vaginal delivery after cesarean section , were other factors which had influenced mothers choice and it had increased the number of vaginal delivery , and had decreased the number of cesarean section ( 15 ) . after the implementation of the health evolution plan , due to increase in the number of vaginal delivery , the government decreased the franchise of vaginal delivery to zero . it was expected that with the zero franchise of vaginal delivery , the number of patrons in public hospitals would increase and the number of vaginal deliveries would increase too . the results of the present study showed that the percentage and number of vaginal delivery in public hospitals has been increased . however , implementation of healthcare reform not only decreased the number of vaginal delivery in private hospitals but also increased the number of cesarean section in those hospitals . the main reason of decline in vaginal delivery in private hospitals was making vaginal delivery free in public hospitals and physicians limitations for cesarean section in public hospitals . fear was the most important reason - and also the main reason for nonmedical demand of mothers for elective cesarean section ( 11 ) . increase in the number of painless delivery was another policy adopted by the ministry of health to promote vaginal delivery . despite the increased number of painless deliveries after the reform so , the number of samples for this type of delivery was little , and no significant difference was found between implementing healthcare reform and painless delivery . it can be predicted that the development of painless delivery facilities in other centers not only increase the number of vaginal delivery , but also improve equity in access of painless delivery . another reason for mothers willingness for cesarean section is the fear of maternity units and lack of visitors . by the presence of trained visitors and providing the facilities with physiological delivery in hospitals , using midwives and making contracts with them in hospitals is another adopted policy to promote vaginal delivery ( 17 ) . despite the increased number of deliveries performed by midwives in 2014 , in comparison with 2013 , the limited number of hospitals having the facilities for vaginal delivery , and private midwives , led to the fact that there was no significant difference between the healthcare reform plan and delivery by midwife . with the launch of physiological delivery in all hospitals and benefiting from private midwives who have private offices , tabrizi et al . also evaluated the health evolution plan . according to their nationwide study , the rate of cesarean section was 56.1% in 2013 , and in the first quarter of the project it had been decreased to 53.6% . besides this , the rate of cesarean section in public hospitals decreased from 47% to 42% after the reform however , the rate of cesarean section in private hospitals was 88% . it was revealed that the highest rate of decrease in cesarean section was related to public hospitals ( 5.3% ) . other hospitals such as social security hospitals ( 0.2% ) , and private hospitals ( 0.4% ) did not have any significant decrease . it indicated that the success of this project is in the public hospitals with more slope , thus more intervention is needed in private hospitals ( 18 ) . in 2013 afshari et al . carried out another study to show the rate of cesarean section in the first eight months of implementing the healthcare reform plan in the hospitals affiliated to isfahan university of medical sciences . finally , it can be concluded that implementation of the healthcare reform plan has been effective on the rate of vaginal delivery but it did not have such influence on private hospitals . according to the negative impact of the healthcare reform plan in the private hospitals , it is suggested to increase tariffs of basic and supplementary insurance for delivery in private hospitals ( 20 ) . furthermore , in a number of private hospitals there are no facilities for vaginal delivery . as a result of equipping these centers with delivery rooms and vaginal delivery facilities , developing physiologic delivery rooms , performing painless delivery , having contract with midwives , the number and percentage of vaginal delivery would be increased . it is suggested to determine the causes of cesarean section and separate the nulliparous cesarean section from repeated cesarean section in the study ( 21 ) . first , data for painless delivery and delivery by midwives in some centers were not available . second , we were not able to compare the reform with other studies because no similar reforms had been implemented in other countries .", "one of the main aims of the health sector evolution plan in iran was to decrease cesarean section and increase vaginal delivery . our study showed that however the number of vaginal deliveries has increased during the reform , cesarean section has not been changed after the reform . policy makers must find solutions to decrease cesarean section in the health care private sector . in this article , it is suggested that other effects of the reform on iran health care delivery should be tested ."], "summary": "introductionthe uncontrolled increase in the rate of cesarean section is one of the most controversial issues , and is a primary challenge among health policy makers . this study was conducted to examine the impact of the iranian health evolution plan on vaginal delivery rate and cesarean section.methodsthis cross -

acting antiviral agents , pegylated interferon alpha ( peg - ifn ) and ribavirin numerous extrahepatic features are associated with chronic hcv infection , of which essential mixed ( type ii ) cryoglobulinaemia is well recognised . mixed cryoglobulinaemia is a systemic vasculitis affecting small and medium - sized arteries and veins . it is characterized by the deposition of immune complexes containing rheumatoid factor , igg , hcv rna and complement on endothelial surfaces , eliciting vascular inflammation through poorly understood mechanisms . these signs and symptoms tend to occur in the setting of detectable circulating hcv rna levels and normally respond to therapy with peg - ifn and ribavirin . exacerbations of vasculitic symptoms have been reported during interferon therapy , but they have almost always occurred in those with pre - existing vasculitis or cryoglobulinaemia [ 4 , 5 ] . occurrence of de novo cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis after successful viral suppression late in the course of interferon therapy is unusual , especially with use of the pegylated form . we report a case of severe de novo cryoglobulinaemic mononeuritis multiplex ( mnm ) that occurred during week 30 of antiviral treatment for chronic hcv infection . cryoglobulins had been undetectable in the pre - treatment period and at the time of presentation the patient was hcv rna - negative .", "a 47-year - old caucasian man was referred by his primary care physician to the hepatitis clinic at our institution following the finding of abnormal liver function tests and elevated serum ferritin . risk factors for liver disease included a brief period of injection drug use 20 years previously . his alcohol intake was within the national recommended limits ( 20 units / week ) and there was no prior history of neurological , psychiatric or rheumatological illness . on examination screening blood tests showed positive serology for hcv , genotype 1a , with a viral load of 1.68  10 iu / ml ( pcr , abbott ) . an exhaustive screen for other causes of chronic liver disease ( including hfe gene mutation analysis ) was negative and abdominal ultrasonography was unremarkable . percutaneous liver biopsy revealed incomplete cirrhosis ( ishak fibrosis stage 5 ) , with a necroinflammatory score of 6/18 , there being no histological evidence of iron overload . in view of the advanced hepatic fibrosis , antiviral treatment this included potential side effects such as  flu - like and neuropsychiatric symptoms , haematological side effects and the small risk of hepatic decompensation . pre - treatment bloods tests were as follows : haemoglobin 15.3 g / dl ( 13.518 ) , white blood cells 5.5  10/l ( 4.011.0 ) , platelets 203  10/l ( 150450 ) , bilirubin 9 mol / l ( 021 ) , alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) 226 iu / l ( 041 ) , alkaline phosphatase 68 iu / l ( 40129 ) , albumin 44 g / l ( 3448 ) , inr 1.0 ( 0.81.2 ) . rheumatoid factor was elevated at 88 iu / ml ( 014 ) and c4 complement low at 0.03 whilst anti - nuclear antibody ( ana ) had been positive on initial referral ( 1:160 titre ) , this was negative on repeat testing and cryoglobulins were undetectable . in accordance with current guidelines , antiviral treatment with peg - ifn 2a ( pegasys , roche ) 180 g weekly and weight - based ribavirin ( copegus , roche ) 1,000 mg early virological response ( evr ; undetectable hcv rna at week 12 of treatment ) was achieved and in the initial stages antiviral treatment was well tolerated , except for mild lethargy . the patient presented to hospital during week 30 of antiviral therapy with progressive painful bilateral foot drop of 2 weeks duration , associated with left ankle monoarthritis and weakness and sensory loss in the distribution of the left ulnar nerve . a week later the right ulnar nerve had become involved although less severely . a clinical diagnosis of mnm was made , corroborated by compatible neurophysiology studies suggesting an asymmetrical mixed sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy . cerebrospinal fluid analysis and magnetic resonance imaging of the spine showed no abnormality . when repeated , cryoglobulin levels were found to be significantly elevated ( 8% ) and analysis demonstrated a mixed ( type ii ) picture . ana was again positive ( 1:160 titre ) with an elevated rheumatoid factor ( 201 iu / ml vs. 88 iu / ml at initiation of antiviral therapy ) and low c4 ( 0.03 g / l , unchanged from pre - treatment levels ) with normal c3 levels . peg - ifn and ribavirin were discontinued immediately and oral prednisolone 40 mg daily was commenced . despite immunosuppression the patient 's clinical state worsened over the following week with the development of cutaneous vasculitic stigmata and progressive bilateral median and common peroneal nerve palsies . in view of the progressive disease and persistence of cryoglobulinaemia , plasma exchange was performed ( 5 sessions over 1 week ) and cylophosphamide initiated ( 150 mg / day ) . cyclophosphamide was well tolerated and continued for 2 months before changing to azathioprine 75 mg twice daily . prednisolone was increased to 80 mg daily and subsequently weaned progressively , aiming to taper completely over 12 months . a slow but steady partial neurological recovery was observed in the outpatient clinic over the following 4 months , with resolution of median and common peroneal nerve palsies and improvement in the other affected areas . given that the severe mnm occurred during the course of antiviral therapy , we deemed it appropriate to discontinue peg - ifn and ribavirin . this was a difficult decision in view of the advanced hepatic fibrosis and encouraging initial response to treatment with achievement of evr . however , since mnm was the more immediately life - threatening condition with progressive weakness affecting all four limbs , discontinuation of antiviral therapy was justified . not unsurprisingly , the patient developed virological rebound in hcv rna ( 5.6  10 iu / ml ) approximately 1 month after the withdrawal of antiviral therapy and initiation of immunosuppression . the time course of alt , hcv rna , rheumatoid factor and cryoglobulin levels in relation to antiviral treatment , the development of mnm and immunosuppression are shown in fig . 1 . unfortunately , 3 months after the onset of neurological disease the patient 's mood worsened with the development of biological features of depression . antidepressants were commenced but his depression worsened , and regrettably the patient died following a drug overdose 10 months after the onset of mnm . post - mortem examination indicated that the cause of death was unrelated to liver disease or cryoglobulinaemia .", "we have described a patient with hcv - related cirrhosis who developed de novo cryoglobulinaemic mnm late in the course of antiviral therapy with peg - ifn and ribavirin . at the time of neurological presentation he had received 30 weeks of antiviral treatment with negative hcv rna since week 12 of therapy . there was no prior history of vasculitis and pre - treatment testing for cryglobulins had been negative . our case is unique as occurrence of de novo cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis after successful viral suppression late in the course of interferon therapy is most unusual . exacerbations of vasculitic symptoms have in fact been reported during interferon therapy , but almost always occur in those with pre - existing vasculitis or cryoglobulinaemia [ 4 , 5 ] . mnm is a well - documented complication of chronic hcv infection , normally associated with hcv viraemia , and typically responds to antiviral treatment . in our case the temporal association ( both in terms of onset and recovery ) between neurological symptoms , cryoglobulinaemia and the use of antiviral treatment raises the intriguing possibility that mnm could have been induced by antiviral therapy . however , it must be emphasised that at present this presumed association between peg - ifn 2a and mnm remains speculative . the various immunomodulatory effects of interferon that may have contributed to the development of mnm include upregulation of mhc class i and downregulation of mhc class ii expression , increased cytolytic activity of natural killer cells , increased dendritic cell activation and antigen uptake and presentation from apoptotic cells and finally increased production of autoantibodies [ 7 , 8 ] . the association between hcv and vasculitis is well established , related usually to the development of cryoglobulinaemia or , less commonly , a non - cryoglobulinaemic polyarteritis nodosa - type disease . estimates of mixed cryoglobulinaemia prevalence in patients with hcv infection vary widely from 10 to 70% , perhaps a reflection of population selection and lead time biases . high viral titres and the presence of type ii cryoglobulinaemia , as present in this case , increase the likelihood of clinically apparent vasculitic disease . when present pre - treatment these diseases usually abate and improve with the initiation of peg - ifn and ribavirin and hence antivirals can be used for treatment of symptomatic cryoglobulinaemia associated with hcv infection . however interferon therapy has also been associated with the development / exacerbation of various underlying autoimmune diseases including hcv - associated vasculitis , systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis [ 11 , 12 ] . there are also reports of the development and/or exacerbation of cryoglobulinaemic disease upon commencement of pegylated interferon therapy [ 4 , 5 ] , though these have almost always occurred in those with pre - existing vasculitis . the time span between the initiation of interferon therapy and the development or exacerbation of vasculitis is usually short , typically within the first few doses . de novo mnm during pegylated interferon therapy for hcv is more unusual , with only two prior published cases [ 13 , 15 ] . in the case the patient achieved a rapid virological response ( undetectable hcv rna by week 4 of treatment ) and first presented with mnm 6 weeks into antiviral therapy . describe a case of mnm occurring later in the course of peg - ifn treatment , with the onset of neurological symptoms at week 40 in a patient with negative hcv rna since week 24 . similar to our case report , these two patients were also men and at least one also had advanced hepatic fibrosis . however in both cases it is unclear whether there was pre - existing cryoglobulinaemia before the initiation of antiviral therapy . in contrast , cryoglobulins were undetectable in our patient prior to therapy , though pre - treatment work - up did reveal a positive ana ( titre 1:160 ) , elevated rheumatoid factor and suppressed c4 level . the significance of these findings in the absence of detectable cryoglobulins or clinical evidence of vasculitis is uncertain . conceivably they could be representative of low - level cryoglobulinaemia below the threshold for detection , resulting in an increased propensity to develop a nascent autoimmune process . when performed , nerve biopsy in patients with mixed cryoglobulinaemic mnm typically shows a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate . however , as indicated above , it is possible for the direct neuropathic effects of both hcv and peg - ifn to result in an ischaemic rather than vasculitic neuropathy . our patient did not undergo nerve biopsy and it may be argued that histology is required in order to discriminate between direct ifn-induced and mixed cryoglobulinaemic neuropathies . in the case we describe there was a significant deterioration in symptoms following withdrawal of peg - ifn and disease only stabilised and subsequently ameliorated once specific therapy for cryoglobulinaemic disease had been initiated . additionally , the clinical picture was that of mnm rather than progressive peripheral neuropathy usually associated with ifn . we would therefore maintain that the clinical course in this case strongly favours mixed cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis over ifn-induced neuropathy .", "in summary we report a patient with hcv - related cirrhosis who developed de novo mnm associated with cryoglobulinaemia during week 30 of antiviral therapy , having achieved evr . while interferon therapy is the treatment of choice for hcv - related mnm , exacerbations have been reported during its use . usually this has been reported in those with pre - existing cryoglobulinaemia and in the setting of detectable hcv viraemia . the de novo development of mnm during hcv therapy with undetectable hcv rna is most unusual . this raises the possibility that mnm could have developed as an adverse immunomodulatory effect of interferon therapy . however it must be re - emphasized that at present this association remains speculative . nonetheless , such patients with advanced hepatic fibrosis present a challenging dilemma as the inevitable virological rebound after discontinuation of antiviral therapy can have grave implications . clinical trials exploring interferon - free hcv treatment regimens are ongoing and these could ease the management of such patients in the future .", ""], "summary": "cryoglobulinaemic mononeuritis multiplex ( mnm ) is an extrahepatic manifestation of chronic hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection for which interferon - based antiviral therapy is currently the treatment of choice . rarely mnm can be associated with hcv treatment though generally in the setting of pre - existing cryoglobulinaemia and detectable hcv viraemia . we report an unusual case of de novo mnm occurring late during the course of pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy for chronic hcv infection , following a prolonged period of viral suppression . the patient had no evidence of cryoglobulinaemia prior to hcv treatment and undetectable hcv rna levels at the time of presentation with mnm . the case raises the possibility that mnm could develop as an adverse immunomodulatory effect of pegylated interferon therapy .", "ranking": [0, 2, 3, 1, 4]}

they were handed over to the next team during shift changeover . in addition , three tlds were kept in nursing stations in icu , and one tld was placed in the pacu . one tld was kept in the doctors ' duty room which was within the premises of the icu , and the last was kept as a control in the office of the department of anesthesia , critical care and pain , remote from icu and pacu , and where no radiological procedures were performed . the layout of icu and pacu is represented by figures 1 and 2 respectively and locations of tlds are marked with filled triangles . the participating resident doctors were instructed to wear the tlds at all times during their duty hours . staff not required to be present during radiographic procedures were kept at least 3 m away from the patient ( a distance at which exposure from scattered radiation is considered negligible ) . it was ensured that patients who were shifted from icu to the radiology suite were accompanied by one icu resident and that the resident was wearing his tld throughout . residents , if required to be directly involved in the radiologic procedure in suites , wore lead aprons , and the tld was underneath the lead apron . bedside chest x - rays in the icu were done by siemens multimobil 2.5 ( manufactured by siemens ltd , goa , india ) , ct and ct guided biopsies were performed on siemens somatom emotion 16 ( manufactured by siemens shanghai medical equipments ltd , shanghai china ) and ge light speed 16 ( manufactured by general electric co. , milwaukee , usa ) respectively . interventional radiology procedures were carried out using ge innova 4100 iq ( manufactured by ge medical systems , france ) . the study was carried out in two phases of 3 months each . at the end of the first phase , the tlds were handed over to department of nuclear medicine for analysis and another set of tlds was issued at the same time . during the period of the study , we maintained a database of procedures performed both in the icu and in the radiological suites along with the bed number and the patient 's hospital registration number . the primary outcome of this study was to quantify the cumulative radiation exposure to the resident doctors working in the icu over a period of 6 months in the course of their duties . the secondary outcomes were to measure the cumulative scattered radiation exposure in various areas of the icu calculated as the average of readings of icu tld badges over 6 months and the estimated cumulative radiation exposure to the resident doctors per year .", "the control tld placed in the department of anesthesia served as a measure of baseline atmospheric ionizing radiation , and all other values are reported above this baseline . the results of dosimetric analysis of residents tlds during the two phases are shown in table 2 . readings from tlds placed in the nursing station and doctors ' duty room during both phases were immeasurable . the mean values in the first and last 3 months were 0.052 and 0.069 msv respectively , though the highest individual value approached 0.1 msv . since this was recorded in a 3 month period , the projected reading for similar exposure throughout the year , even assuming a 24 h duty period , would be 0.4 msv , which is well below the safety limit of 20 msv / year .", "revolutionary progress in the field of medical imaging has given a big leap to advances in medical diagnostics and therapeutics . this development has also infiltrated the field of critical care medicine , and radio - diagnosis and interventional radiological procedures now play a key role in the management of critically ill patients . while this advancement offers the advantages of rapid bedside diagnosis , and cost - effective and minimally invasive treatment options to critically ill patients , it carries the danger of exposure of patient and physician to radiation . the detrimental effects of exposure to even low - level ionizing radiation have always been known ; however , there is renewed concern because of its wide - spread use in medical radio - diagnosis and therapeutics in critically ill patients . it is , therefore , natural that there may be concerns about the long - term effects of radiation exposure to doctors working for long periods of time in the icu . in addition , where icu doctors are responsible for transport of patients to the radiology suite , the extent of radiation exposure is increased . it is reassuring that the results of our study confirm that the extent of radiation exposure to critical care physician during the course of his duty is well within acceptable limits . there is considerable literature on occupational hazards of radiation exposure among radiologists ; however , it is difficult to directly extrapolate the conclusions of these studies to the icu . working conditions in the icu do not mimic those in radiology suites - working hours tend to be long , there is a need to accompany mechanically ventilated and hemodynamically unstable patients inside the radiology suite for procedures , and icu doctors may sometimes take radiation safety norms lightly . a study performed in a trauma icu ( ticu ) has concluded that radiation exposure is not a significant occupational hazard for the ticu personnel . similarly , another study looked into the radiation exposure to icu nurses and found that the exposure was well below the permissible level . the strength of our study is that it was planned in a more pragmatic way - apart from bedside radiological procedures , we also took into account the radiation exposure to icu residents accompanying the patient to radiological suites for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures . ionizing radiation from fluoroscopy in the ct scan or interventional radiology suites may be significant and were not considered in the previous studies . we also tried to measure the amount of scattered radiation within the icu and the pacu , which contributes to overall radiation exposure . even after taking these additional sources of radiation exposure into account , we found that the cumulative radiation exposure was negligible . the number and types of bedside and out - of - icu radiological procedures can vary on a day - to - day basis according to the case - mix of the icu population , and this may affect the overall radiation exposure ; however , this study was carried out over a period of 6 months , and the data obtained would have been adequately representative . the other limitation relates to the generalizability of the study ; differences in the types of cases , working pattern of resident doctors , quality and maintenance of radiological equipment between hospitals may restrict the applicability of these results to other hospitals . however , given the large margin of safety that our study has shown , it is unlikely that exposure levels would be dangerously high in any other setting . though , with advances in technology , the number and types of radiological procedures performed on patients are likely to increase . furthermore , there is a growing trend toward using radionuclide - based positron emission tomography scans for diagnostic procedures in critically ill patients especially when they are admitted to icu during their diagnostic work - up . some of these patients may continue to emit radiation long after their procedures are completed . though none of these patients featured in our study , it will add to the radiation exposure to doctors . the results of this study do not in any way underrate the need to follow safety precautions , while carrying out radiological procedures in critically ill patients . the levels of exposure found in this study should be interpreted bearing in mind that standard protection norms were used by all personnel involved in the study . with these precautions in place , radiation exposure to doctors managing critically ill patients in the icu is minimal and acceptable .", "literature on radiation exposure among icu doctors is scarce . in addition to bedside radiological procedures , the risk of exposure may be increased if the same doctors accompany icu patients for out - of - icu radiological investigations . however , we found that if standard safety precautions were followed , cumulative radiation exposure to icu resident doctor was well within permissible limits and was not the cause of concern and hence routine personal dosimetric monitoring is not needed for residents in icu . however , in view of changing practice , there is a need to repeat such audits periodically to monitor radiation exposure ."], "summary": "background and aims : with the expanding use of diagnostic and therapeutic radiological modalities in critically ill patients , doctors working in intensive care units ( icus ) are increasingly exposed to ionizing radiation . this risk of radiation exposure occurs not only during bedside radiologic procedures , but also when icu physicians accompany patients to radiology suites . the aim of this study was to quantify levels of radiation exposure among medical professionals working in the icu.materials and methods : the study was carried out prospectively over 6 months in the icu of a tertiary - referral cancer hospital . two teams consisting of 4 icu resident doctors each were instructed to wear thermoluminescent dosimeters ( tlds ) during their duty shifts . standard radiation protection precautions were used throughout the study period . tlds were also placed in selected areas of the icu to measure the amount of scattered radiation . tlds were analyzed at the end of every 3 months.results:the readings recorded on tlds placed in the icu were almost immeasurable . the mean value of residents ' radiation exposure was 0.059 msv , though the highest individual reading approached 0.1 msv . the projected maximum yearly radiation exposure was 0.4 msv.conclusions:if standard radiation safety precautions are followed , the cumulative radiation exposure to icu resident doctors is well within permissible limits and is not a cause of concern . however , with the increasing use of radiological procedures in the management of critically ill patients , there is a need to repeat such audits periodically to monitor radiation exposure .", "ranking": [4, 3, 1, 0, 2]}

Conclusions "], "document": ["the revolution in hiv treatment brought about by combination antiretroviral therapy in 1996 had altered the course of the disease among those living with hiv in high - income countries but had only reached a fraction of people in low- and middle - income countries . in resource - poor countries , access to antiretroviral therapy ( art ) has improved during the last years and mortality rates among treated patients have declined substantially . ethiopia is one of the seriously affected countries in sub - saharan africa , with more than 1.3 million people living with hiv . in 2003 , the government of ethiopia introduced its art program with the goal of reducing hiv - related morbidity and mortality , improving the quality of life of people living with hiv , and mitigating some of the impact of the epidemic . the country has scaled up its art program and is planning to decentralize the service further to existing health facilities providing art reaching 517 in december 2009 . in ethiopia although some studies demonstrate that the incidence of hiv - related wasting syndrome has also declined in the haart era , data from the nutrition for healthy living ( nfhl ) cohort showed that weight loss and wasting are still common in hiv - infected people and that even a 5% weight loss in 6 months markedly increases the risk of death . nevertheless , mortality has been high compared to high - income countries and factors contributing to this high mortality are poorly understood in resource - limited countries like ethiopia . few studies have evaluated the usefulness of such simple markers as predictors of clinical events in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy ( haart ) . in ethiopia , we treated and followed patients using the who clinical stage , hemoglobin level , and the tlc as criteria for beginning treatment . but there is no proper understanding of these factors of paramount importance in tackling the factors of mortality after initiating art . the aim of this study was to assess predictors of survival rate in hiv patients treated with haart .", "a retrospective cohort study design was carried out from january 2008 to february 2012 at zewditu memorial hospital in addis ababa , the capital of ethiopia . the study population consists of all hiv - infected patients aged 14 and above who were seen at zewditu memorial hospital hiv clinic , addis ababa . the study participants were plwh who had been on art in the hospital from january 2008 to february 2012 , who have complete registration , intake , and follow - up forms . patients who transferred out , lost to follow - up ( drop , lost ) , women who were pregnant at the time of art initiation , lactating mothers in who stage i or ii who started art exclusively to prevent vertical transmission , and patients with competing causes of death other than hiv were excluded . profiles of all patients on art between january 2008 and february 2012 were evaluated , and exposure status was first identified as stages i - ii ( unexposed ) versus stages iii - iv ( exposed ) . finally those who fulfill inclusion criteria were given unique i d number in increasing order for both exposed and unexposed art groups separately . then , simple random sampling technique was employed separately to select 416 samples using computer - generated random number table . data collection format was developed from art entry and follow - up form being used in the art clinic of the zewditu memorial hospital . data quality was ensured by designing proper data collection materials , by checking the collected data daily for completeness , and thorough continuous supervision . all the completed data collection forms were examined again for completeness and consistency during data management , storage , and analysis by principal investigator . the main outcome measure was survival rates from the initiation of art to the end of follow - up date . the independent variables were sociodemographic characteristics , baseline clinical , laboratory , and art information . spss version 20 was used for survival analysis to measure the association of patient 's characteristics with time from art initiation to death . cox proportional hazard model was used to identify independent predictors of mortality using hazard ratios with 95% ci . significant predicator in a bivariate analysis with p < 0.05 was included in a multivariable cox regression analysis . ethical clearance for the conduct of this study was obtained from the research and ethical committee of school of public health of the college of health sciences at addis ababa university . names or identification numbers of hiv / aids patients were not included in the data sheet .", "a total of 416 patients aged 14 years and above , who started art , were included in this study . from the study participants , 231 ( 55.5% ) of them were males and the mean age was 36.4 ( sd = 8.93 ) . fifty - four percent ( 54.3% ) of the cohort started art on the late stage of the disease ( stages 3 - 4 ) . the mean hemoglobin level was 12.9  gm / dl ( iqr = 1114 ) . the median bmi of patients at the initiation of art was 22  kg / m . three hundred ninety - five ( 97.5% ) of the patients had adherence rate of more than 95% . two hundred twenty three ( 53.6% ) of patients were placed on 3tc - tdf - efv regimen , 11% of patients had been treated for tb in the past prior to this study , and 96.9% of the patients were not given opportunistic infection prophylaxis . regarding substance use , 29% ( 119 ) , 21.4% ( 88 ) , 8.3% ( 34 ) , and 33% ( 137 ) had been using alcohol , tobacco , hard drug , and soft drug , respectively ( table 1 ) . the minimum follow - up time was 0.25 months and the maximum was 43 months . the majority 59.5% of deaths occurred within the first 3 months of starting art . in univariable cox regression analysis who clinical stage , anemia and having past tb coinfection were all associated with progression to death . in a multivariable cox regression analysis , significant predictors of mortality were who clinical stage ( hr = 2.99 at 95% ci ( 1.26 , 5.31 ) ) , anemia ( hr = 5.54 at 95% ci ( 2.58 , 11.86 ) ) , and having past tb coinfection ( hr = 4.13 at 95% ci ( 1.79 , 9.51 ) ) ( table 2 ) . the majority of deaths occurred the first three months of the treatment ( log rank test , p < 0.001 ) ( figures 1 , 2 , and 3 ) .", "this 5-year retrospective cohort study of aids patients on art gives an insight into survival and its determinants in a hospital setting in zewditu . the spectrum of patients enrolled in this center was similar for many other start - up art programs in resource - poor settings . in this cohort , mortality was highest during the first three months of treatment of art initiation . the who clinical stages 3 - 4 , hemoglobin level < 10  gm / dl , and past tb coinfection treatment the findings have practical implications for managing hiv - infected patients in resource - limited settings . the high early mortality in patients with advanced disease implies the need for starting treatment earlier . the majority of deaths occurring during the first three months might be due to the fact that large proportion ( 54.3% ) of the cohort in our study was found to start art with who stages 3 and 4 . the pattern of mortality observed in our cohort is consistent with findings from other resource - poor settings . in arba minch hospital patients , mortality in the first year of follow - up was 15.4/100 person - years and most of deaths occurred within first three months . the incidence mortality rate of 3.8/100 person - years in our cohort is comparable to arbaminch hospital cohort in the first year . in tanzan , a regular decline in mortality from 35.7 during pretreatment follow - up to 17.5 per 100 person - years during the first month of treatment is reported . another similar study conducted by johannessen et al . estimated mortality was 19.2 , 24.5 , and 29.0% with respect to at 3 , 6 , and 12 months , respectively , with the majority of deaths occurring within three months of starting art . these findings are similar to what has been reported elsewhere [ 11 , 12 ] . patients with severe anemia had nearly 6 times higher risk of dying during the first year on art compared to those with a normal hemoglobin level ( ahr = 5.54 , 95% ci ( 2.58 , 11.86 ) ) . several studies from africa and ethiopia have shown that anemia is an independent predictor of mortality in patients on art , even after controlling for cd4 cell count . recently , studies from developing countries have found the same association [ 10 , 12 , 13 ] . indeed , study conducted in tanzania shows anemia as a strong predictor of mortality ; patients with severe anemia had nearly 15 times higher risk of dying during the first year on art as compared to those with a normal hemoglobin level . another study conducted in cameroon indicated that patients with hemoglobin  8.5  g / dl had two times more risk of death than those with hemoglobin level  8.5  g / dl . as shown by others , we found that the who clinical stage was an independent marker of mortality in patients treated with haart [ 12 , 14 ] . compared to anemia , the who stage was a stronger predictor of death in the first month of treatment . while the ultimate goal should be to treat patients before they progress to such advanced stages , doctors in new settings will continue to treat such patients because of poor testing practices in africa . therefore , careful documentation of the patient 's disease stage will be helpful in identifying patients who need more intense follow - up . improving the counseling and testing practices should be viewed as a more sustainable strategy . a study conducted in arba minch and malawi who clinical stage 4 was important predictor of death [ 8 , 12 , 16 , 17 ] . koenig et al . found that patients with aids who receive a diagnosis of tb during the first months after art initiation had a mortality rate of 27% , which was 3 times higher than that among other patients . , patients who delayed art greater than 6 months after tb diagnosis had higher mortality rate than those who initiated art less than 6 months after tb diagnosis . study conducted in durame hospital , ethiopia , showed that patient with positive tb test had 3.9 times more risk than others . our study also showed similar result ; patients having past tb coinfection had 6.5 times more risk than the referent group . we believe that the delay in diagnosis and treatment and not giving tb prophylaxis contributed to the higher mortality . bmi is described as important prognostic markers either independently or in combination with the tlc both in untreated and in treated patients [ 8 , 16 , 17 , 19 ] . < 16  kg / m ) had six times higher risk of dying than relatively nourished patients . another study conducted in cameroon showed that bmi < 15  kg / m had three times higher risk of death than bmi > 18.5  the rate was two times higher for patients who began art with a severe immune - depression cd4 < 50 cells/ . this was comparable to what was reported in study done in tanzania by johannessen et al . . study conducted in durban , south africa , indicates that cd4 cell count < 50  cell/l was the most predictor of mortality in hiv patients after they started art . our study findings did n't show any association difference which could be due to smaller sample we had in this study but majority of the study participants started art with cd4 > 50  cell/l .", "this study showed that the incidence of death was 3.8/100 person - years with the majority of deaths occurring within 3 months of art initiation . we found a very high mortality rate in this cohort especially during the three months of treatment . the factors associated with survival were who stage , basic haemoglobin , tb coinfection , and anemia . our study , while confirming the clinical benefit of art , raises the challenge of earlier and timely access to art and that of maintaining this clinical benefit over time . this highlights the need for identifying and treating patients early through improved counseling and testing strategies ."], "summary": "introduction . art has improved the survival of hiv -

{"id": "PMC5337827", "section_names": ["Competing interest statement", "Introduction", "Case Report", "Discussion", "Conclusions"], "document": ["", "primary plasma cell leukemia ( ppcl ) is a very aggressive form of plasma cell disorder . ppcl is very rare , reported in only 4 - 6% of patients with multiple myeloma ( mm ) . ppcl is defined as the presence of more than 20% plasma cells in the peripheral blood and an absolute plasma cell count greater than 2  10/l , without previous evidence of mm . consistent with the high tumor burden , extramedullary involvement , such as hepatosplenomegaly , lymphadenopathy , soft - tissue plasmacytomas , or leptomeningeal infiltration , is more frequent in ppcl than in mm .   despite the development of new agents , such as proteasome inhibitors or immunomodulatory drugs ( imids ) , for plasma cell disorders , the median overall survival of ppcl although ppcl is difficult to treat , high - dose melphalan followed by autologous stem cell transplantation ( auto - sct ) and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( allo - sct ) seems to improve outcomes in younger selected patients . however , patients with ppcl who had central nervous system ( cns ) relapse after auto- and/or allo - sct were refractory to various treatments , and had an extremely poor prognosis . we herein present a ppcl patient with cns relapse after allo - sct who underwent concurrent intrathecal therapy ( it ) and radiotherapy ( rt ) followed by maintenance therapy with pomalidomide and low - dose dexamethasone ( pd ) .", "a 46-year - old man without a previous significant medical history was referred to our hospital with complaints of anorexia and generalized fatigue . laboratory findings revealed significant abnormalities , including a white blood cell ( wbc ) count of 19.710/l with 45% plasma cells , a hemoglobin level of 11.6 g / dl , a platelet count of 7.010/l , a creatinine level of 7.63 mg / dl , and a ldh level of 301 iu / l ( table 1 ) . on a peripheral blood smear , the plasma cells were medium - sized , with round nuclei , basophilic cytoplasm , and occasional cytoplasmic vacuoles ( figure 1a ) . g / l , and the serum free light chain ( flc ) k/ ratio was 161.11 ( table 1 ) . in this case , a m - component of the igg - k type was identified by serum protein electrophoresis . moreover , flow cytometry on the peripheral blood showed that these plasma cells were positive for cd38 , cd49e , cd54 , cd138 and cytoplasmic kappa light chain . t(11;14)(q13;q32 ) in 9 metaphase cells ( figure 1b ) and 46,xy in 11 metaphase cells , and a fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis revealed ccnd1/igh gene fusion rearrangement . the patient was admitted to an intensive care unit ( icu ) for continuous hemodiafiltration ( chdf ) . on the same day , we started induction therapy with lenalidomide ( 15 mg / day orally on days 1 - 14 ) , bortezomib ( 1.3 mg / m subcutaneously on days 1 , 4 , 8 , and 11 ) , and low - dose dexamethasone ( 20 mg / day orally on days 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 11 , and 12 ) , also known as rvd induction therapy , each for a 21-day cycle . eight days after starting the induction therapy , the circulating plasma cells in the peripheral blood disappeared , and he was transferred from the icu after withdrawal of chdf . after a total of 3 cycles of chemotherapy , the laboratory abnormalities markedly subsided , consistent with a very good partial response ( vgpr ) , because serum immunofixation was positive . he and his family consented to undergo allo - sct . at our outpatient department , because of grade 2 peripheral neuropathy , he continued induction therapy with lenalidomide ( 25 mg / day orally on days 1 - 14 ) , bortezomib ( 1.3 mg / m subcutaneously on days 1 and 8) , and dexamethasone ( 20 mg / day orally on days 1 and 8) in each 21-day cycle . after a total of 6 courses , allo - sct was performed with the bone marrow from an unrelated donor ( hla - a one allele mismatch ) . the conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine 120 mg / m ( 30mg / m on day -5 , -4 , -3 , and -2 ) , melphalan 180 mg / m ( 90mg / m on day-4 and -3 ) , and rabbit anti - thymocyte globulin 2.5 mg / m ( 1.25mg / m on day -2 and -1 ) . for the prevention of graft - versus - host - disease ( gvhd ) , tacrolimus was started from day -1 , and methotrexate was given on days 1 , 3 , and 6 . complete donor chimerism was detected in the bone marrow on day 29 . during this admission , however , serum immunofixation was positive despite normal igg and flc levels ; therefore , he was still considered to have a vgpr . two months after discharge , the patient developed cervical , mediastinal , and axillary lymphadenopathy . he was therefore diagnosed with ebv - associated lymphoproliferative disease and was immediately treated with 2 cycles of rituximab monotherapy , resulting in a complete response . tacrolimus was discontinued on day 180 , and there was no evidence of chronic gvhd . however , 6 months after allo - sct , he had marked cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) antigenemia . the protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid was 53 mg / dl , and the glucose level was 55 mg / dl ; 17 monocytes per microliter were detected . cytological examination revealed that some of these cells resembled plasma cells ( figure 2a ) . magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) with gadolinium ( gd ) enhancement revealed a small , enhanced nodule in the lateral medulla oblongata ( figure 2b , arrowhead ) . enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) showed no extramedullary tumors . moreover , we still observed complete donor chimerism , without leukemic plasma cells , in his bone marrow . the patient underwent 4 courses of weekly it , consisting of methotrexate 15 mg , cytarabine 20 mg , and prednisolone 40 mg in combination with local cranial rt ( 5 fractions of 2 gy for a total dose of 10 gy ) . after this combined treatment , his neurological symptoms resolved and the plasma cells in the cerebrospinal fluid disappeared . to prevent cns recurrence , we administered pomalidomide 4 mg / day on days 121 , with 20 mg of dexamethasone weekly for each 28-day cycle . subsequently , a reduced dose of 2 mg was administered for 2 cycles , but grade 4 neutropenia occurred again . he resumed pomalidomide at 1 mg and continued the low dose without severe hematological abnormalities . twelve months after the cns relapse , both enhanced ct and brain mri with gd enhancement revealed no extramedullary tumors . in our outpatient follow - up , he maintained vgpr without major complications for more than 18 months after the diagnosis of cns relapse .", "the prognosis of plasma cell disorder has improved following the introduction of new agents and the development of sct , but a cure remains elusive . the long - term survival rate of ppcl is low due to the aggressive nature of the disease that comprises high tumor burden and extramedullary involvement . in the us , upfront allo - sct is still one of the treatment options for young ppcl patients without major complications . in our study , we performed upfront allo - sct with a myeloablative - conditioning regimen for our young patients without major complications . the center for international blood and marrow transplant research ( cibmtr ) conducted a retrospective sct study in ppcl , and demonstrated high survival rates in an autologous group compared with those in an allogeneic group . in the cibmtr study , non - relapse mortality in the allogeneic group was much higher at 3 years ( 42% vs. 5% ) , despite this group possessing a lower relapse rate ( 39% vs. 61% ) . our patient survived for more than 2 years after allo - sct , although he unfortunately suffered from cns relapse on day 350 . consolidation and maintenance therapy after auto- and/or allo - sct in plasma cell disorder is still controversial . however , some clinical trials have recently shown that lenalidomide maintenance after auto - sct for mm significantly prolonged progression - free survival ( pfs ) and overall survival . moreover , a prospective clinical trial by the intergroupe francophone du mylome group showed that a bortezomibbased regimen followed by auto - sct and subsequent maintenance therapy with lenalidomide , bortezomib , and dexamethasone for ppcl significantly improved pfs compared with those who received a reduced intensity conditioning allograft . in the future , auto - sct and maintenance therapy combined with novel agents may be a treatment option for young ppcl patients . the prognosis of plasma cell disorders with cns involvement is extremely poor . in a retrospective study on cns myeloma conducted in 12 greek institutions , there was no significant difference in median survival of cns myeloma ( called post cns - mm ) between novel drug - treated patients and those given other treatments ( 4 months vs. 2 months ) . by multivariable analysis , extramedullary lesions , prior to treatment with novel drugs , and high ldh levels at myeloma diagnosis were statistically independent predictors of post cns - mm survival . these findings corroborate our observations that our patient with cns relapse of ppcl had an extremely short - term outcome . it has been reported that 19% of post cns - mm patients met the criteria for ppcl . furthermore , some of these ppcl patients developed isolated cns relapse during systemic remission after auto - sct . in a prospective study by royer et al . , 2 ppcl patients experienced neuromeningeal relapse after autologous- and allo - sct , respectively , and both patients soon died despite intrathecal chemotherapy . in the present case , although vgpr was maintained by rvd induction therapy followed by allo - sct , isolated cns relapse occurred within 1 year . several drugs used in multiple myeloma , including bortezomib and lenalidomide , do not efficiently cross the blood  of note , bbb penetration of lenalidomide was 11% in a rhesus monkey model , whereas that of thalidomide was 42% . in a murine model , pomalidomide displayed 39% bbb penetration and high anti - tumor activity in the cns . to the best of our knowledge , the anti - tumor effect of thalidomide is inferior to that of pomalidomide . additionally , pomalidomide is more effective in ameliorating extramedullary involvement . in our case , concurrent it and rt followed by pd was initiated after the diagnosis of isolated cns involvement after allo - sct . in addition , maintenance therapy by pd might prolong survival to prevent systemic recurrence , including cns involvement , for more than 18 months . the role of pomalidomide for ppcl patients with cns involvement should be further explored in clinical trials .", "our ppcl patient received rvd induction therapy followed by up - front allo - sct . however , concurrent it and rt followed by pomalidomide - based maintenance therapy well controlled his cns recurrence and prolonged his survival . to find an optimal treatment for this rare but aggressive ppcl , prospective clinical trials for this disorder should take into account the importance of myeloma drug penetration across the bbb in order to enhance the treatment of cns recurrence"], "summary": "primary plasma cell leukemia ( ppcl ) is a rare aggressive variant of plasma cell disorder and frequently presents with extramedullary disease . central nervous system ( cns ) involvement with ppcl has an extremely poor prognosis . we describe a 46-year - old man with ppcl treated with a combination of lenalidomide , bortezomib , and dexamethasone as induction therapy following upfront allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( allo - sct ) . despite achieving a very good partial response , the patient suffered from an isolated cns relapse 12 months after allo - sct . he was immediately started on concurrent intrathecal chemotherapy ( it ) and cranial irradiation ( rt ) . subsequently , pomalidomide and low - dose dexamethasone ( pd ) were given as maintenance therapy . he has been without cns recurrence for more than 18 months . our case suggests that concurrent it and rt followed by pd maintenance therapy may be an effective option to control cns relapse of ppcl after allo -

standardized prevalence of radiographic knee osteoarthritis in adults aged 45 years or above was 19.2% among the participants in the framingham study and 27.8% in the johnston county osteoarthritis project ( 3 ) . in addition , in the third national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes iii ) , about 37% of participants aged 60 years and above exhibited radiographic knee osteoarthritis ( 2 , 3 ) . furthermore , the age- and sex - standardized incidence rates of symptomatic hip , knee , and hand osteoarthritis were estimated at 88 , 240 and 100 ( per 100,000 person - years ) , respectively , according to a study conducted in massachusetts , usa ( 4 ) . the etiology of osteoarthritis is multi - factorial and is generally considered as a product of interaction between systemic and local factors ( 1 , 2 ) . from this point of view , certain individuals may have a genetic predisposition to develop osteoarthritis , but this condition ( osteoarthritis ) will be established only if an injury to the joint takes place . essentially , the systemic risk factors for osteoarthritis include age ( 1,3,5 ) , sex ( 6 , 7 ) , race and ethnicity ( 8 , 9 ) , genetics ( 10 , 11 ) , congenital and other developmental factors ( 12 , 13 ) and diet ( 14 , 15 ) . on the other hand , local factors consist of obesity ( 1 , 2 ) , injuries ( 2 , 16 ) , occupation ( 2 , 17 ) , physical exercise ( 2 , 18 ) , mechanical factors , alignment , or laxity ( 2 , 19 , 20 ) . yet , the relative importance of each risk factor may vary for different joints affected , for different stages of osteoarthritis , for the development ( establishment ) versus the progression of disease , and for radiographic compared to symptomatic disease ( 2 ) . it should be noted that the number of individuals who develop osteoarthritis is expected to increase due to the aging of the population and the obesity epidemic ( 2 ) . a similar aging and obesity situation is evident also in albania , a post communist country in south eastern europe which is experiencing a significant socioeconomic transition in the past twenty five years . due to the demographic transition in the past couple of decades , in albania , the proportion of individuals aged 65 years and above has increased up to 11% ( 21 ) . this proportion is going to increase further given the decline of fertility rates ( 21 ) , a gradual increase in life expectancy ( 21 , 22 ) and the ongoing emigration of young people ( 22 ) . in addition , overweight and obesity pose a serious public health concern in view of the rapid changes in lifestyle / behavioral patterns , where processed foods are increasingly replacing traditional foods in albania ( 22 ) . according to the world health statistics 2014 report , the prevalence of obesity in albania is 21.7% in males and 20.5% in females ( 23 ) . the burden of musculoskeletal disorders has also increased in albania in the past two decades . overall , the share of these disorders accounted for 8.5% of the total burden of disease in 1990 , whereas in 2010 it increased up to 11.0% ( 22 , 24 ) . in relative terms , there was evidence of a stronger increase in females ( with 3.7% increase in the proportional burden of disease ) compared to males ( only 2.0% ) ( 22 , 24 ) . however , specific information on osteoarthritis including its prevalence and associated risk factors is scarce for albania . in this context , we aimed to describe the distribution of the main risk factors among primary health care users diagnosed with osteoarthritis in albania , which was the most isolated communist country in europe until 1990 .", "our study involved all individuals who were diagnosed with osteoarthritis over a two - year period ( from january 2013 to december 2014 ) in several primary health care centers in tirana , the albanian capital . selection of the primary health care centers included in this study was based on the probability proportional to size principle . on the whole , during this two - year period , 1179 adult individuals were diagnosed with osteoarthritis ( 521 men aged 60.110.6 years and 658 women aged 58.19.6 years ) . according to the recommendations of the american college of rheumatology for the clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis , the diagnosis of osteoarthritis was based on the following criteria ( 25 , 26 ) : ( i ) history of the disease : self - reported presence of pain , aching , stiffness , or other symptoms in the joints affected by osteoarthritis ; ( ii ) physical examination : difficulties in flexion / extension and rotation of the joints ( range of motions ) , tenderness , crepitations , or enlargement of the joints ; ( iii ) laboratory findings : erythrocyte sedimentation rate , rheumatoid factor , c - reactive protein and uricemia , and ; ( iv ) radiological findings : joint space narrowing and presence of osteophytes . fisher s exact test was used to compare the distribution of the major risk factors ( smoking , alcohol intake , body mass index , genetic factors , major trauma , weight lifting , heavy physical exercise and preexisting inflammatory diseases ) among primary health care men and women diagnosed with osteoarthritis . conversely , binary logistic regression was used to assess the sex - differences regarding the main risk factors among primary health care users diagnosed with osteoarthritis in tirana . initially , crude ( unadjusted ) odds ratios ( ors ) and their respective 95% confidence intervals ( cis ) were calculated . next , multivariable - adjusted ors and their respective 95% cis were calculated in logistic regression models controlling ( adjusting ) simultaneously for all the main risk factors for osteoarthritis ( smoking , alcohol intake , body mass index , genetic factors , major trauma , weight lifting , heavy physical exercise and preexisting inflammatory diseases ) . statistical package for social sciences ( spss , version 17.0 ) was used for all the statistical analyses .", "table 1 presents the distribution of risk factors among primary health care users diagnosed with osteoarthritis in tirana during the period 2013 -

validated tools for diagnosis of osteoarthritis in the albanian population . on the other hand , in our study , data on behavioral / lifestyle determinants was based on interview , which may have been subject to different information biases . thus , male and female participants may have tended to report differently about their lifestyle characteristics . if so , we can not entirely exclude the possibility of reporting bias for the self - reported information about lifestyle / behavioral factors including smoking , alcohol intake and physical exercise .", "potential limitations aside , this study offers useful evidence about the distribution of the main risk factors for osteoarthritis in adult individuals diagnosed with osteoarthritis in albania . this information may support health professionals and decision -

otherwise , they received longer inpatient care based on the severity of their complications and illness . all the patients had a follow - up visit two weeks after discharge from hospital . patient- and procedure - related data , including demographics , characteristics , clinical information and technical details , and findings from ercp procedures were recorded prospectively on a detailed data sheet . exclusion criteria were a history of biliary sphincterotomy or pre - cut sphincterotomy , pre - procedure active pancreatitis , pregnancy , mental disability , and refusal to participate . ercp procedures were performed by a total of eight expert endoscopists , almost always with a trainee performing at least part of the procedure . during the procedures , patients were under conscious sedation using a combination of intravenous lidocaine , midazolam , and propofol . successful cannulation was defined as free and deep instrumentation of the biliary tree , and a cannulation attempt was defined as sustained contact with the cannulating device and the papilla for at least five seconds.17 difficult biliary cannulation was defined as the failure of biliary access despite 10 minutes of attempted biliary cannulation or more than five attempted unintentional pancreatic cannulations.18 any complications taking place during or following the procedure were also entered into the records . pep was diagnosed according to the generally accepted criteria defined by cotton et al,6 ie , presence of upper abdominal pain 24 hours after an ercp procedure and a serum amylase level more than three times the upper limit of normal . results were expressed as the mean  standard deviation ( sd ) for quantitative variables and percentages for categorical variables . multiple linear regression analysis was used to develop an optimal model for predicting pep with the presence of confounders . the performance of the model was assessed with the hosmer  lemeshow goodness - of - fit test . all the statistical analyses were performed using spss version 16.0 ( spss inc . ) for windows .", "between 2008 and 2012 , 780 patients ( male : female ratio 393:387 , mean age 57.5 years ) underwent diagnostic and therapeutic ercp with the primary diagnosis of hepatobiliary disorders . of these 780 ercps , 105 procedures ( 13.5% ) were carried out in patients with invasive cancers ( pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma , biliary carcinoma , metastastic tumor with biliary obstruction , hepatocellular carcinoma , ampullary carcinoma ) because of obstruction and 675 ( 86.5% ) were performed in patients with benign diseases , which included 313 procedures ( 40.1% ) to remove bile duct stones and 362 ( 46.4% ) for benign biliary stricture . the patients included 393 men ( 50.4% ) , and 448 ( 57.5% ) were more than 65 years old . previous cholecystectomy had been performed in 36.3% of patients and 9.0% had undergone previous ercp . a total of 80 patients had history of biliary stone diagnosed by a similar procedure . also , history of confirmed pancreatitis and hepatitis was observed in 27 ( 3.5% ) and 10 ( 1.3% ) patients , respectively ( table 1 ) . regarding laboratory parameters ( table 2 ) , serum amylase was found to be elevated to more than 200 units / l in 102 patients ( 13.7% ) three hours after ercp and more than 800 units / l in 60 patients ( 7.7% ) . in all , 446 ( 70% ) participants underwent wire - guided cannulation and others ( 30% ) underwent sphincterotome biliary cannulation using contrast injection as the conventional method . successful biliary cannulation was technically achieved in 82.5% of all patients at ercp , although in 13.0% of them , cannulation failed . regarding pathologic changes in papilla , tumoral features and ulcerative changes were found in 3.3% and 0.6% of patients . of the 780 patients who underwent diagnostic or therapeutic ercp , pancreatitis developed in 26 patients ( 3.3% ) . significant bleeding occurred in two patients ; the only predictor in multivariable analysis was biliary sphincterotomy . we diagnosed cholangitis ( using the criteria of transient worsening of clinical states and liver function tests consistent with cholangitis ) in four subjects , all of whom had common bile duct ( cbd ) stones with biliary stent placement . table 3 shows the frequency of pep and raised esr according to indication for ercp . in the multivariable risk model for predicting pep ( table 4 ) , significant risk factors with adjusted odds ratios ( ors ) were age < 65 years ( or = 10.647 , p = 0.023 ) and esr > 30 ( or = 6.414 , p < 0.001 ) . female gender , history of recurrent pancreatitis , pre - ercp hyperamylasemia , and difficult or failed cannulation could not predict pep . regarding the cannulation techniques , there was no difference in the incidence of pep between guide wire - assisted ercp or conventional contrast - assisted cannulation .", "we have identified two risk factors for the development of pep : age < 65 years and esr > 30 . several studies have focused on younger age as an independent predictor of pep.14,617 so in younger individuals , it is important to perform ercp only when the indication is very strong and there is no other noninvasive substitute for ercp . another risk factor for the development of pep in our study was increased esr level before ercp ( esr > 30 ) . we found that raised esr > 30 mm / hour is a significant factor that independently predicts increased risk of pep . although some studies have evaluated the level of post - ercp inflammatory markers , especially post - procedure crp elevation , as predictors of development of pep,1923 it seems that none of the previous studies have focused on pre - ercp esr level as a potential risk factor for pep . however , the findings of previous studies suggest that inflammatory biomarkers are helpful at 2448 hours post - procedure , so they are not early predictors . although it seems that our study is the first study to evaluate pre - ercp esr level as a risk factor for developing pep , many other studies have evaluated the role of pharmacologic agents in reducing the incidence or severity of pep.2,10,2227 several agents , most of which have an anti - inflammatory effect , have been tested in clinical trials . in terms of attenuating the inflammatory response , the most promising results have been with non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) , and some standard guidelines recommend the routine use of nsaids to prevent pep.28 most of these studies are experimental clinical trials , but it is possible that the main beneficial effect of these drugs is limiting systemic inflammatory response and lowering the level of esr as a potential risk factor for pep . this study could be a guide for future clinical trials on rectal nsaids for the prevention of pep ; the effect of these drugs in prevention of pancreatitis , with attention to the level of esr before ercp , should be evaluated . other risk factors such as female gender , younger age , sphincter of oddi dysfunction , cannulation difficulty , prolonged procedure time , and repeated injection to the pancreatic duct were not assessed because ercp procedures were done by an expert and because of the absence of manometry . also , other factors such as pre - ercp bacterial infections might increase esr level . some studies on both human and animal models , performed to evaluate the potential role of antibiotics in preventing pep , found reduced rates of pep in patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis prior to ercp when compared to placebo.26 however , most studies did not find any role for infections in pep , except in cases of severe pancreatitis with necrosis . the main limitation of this study was the absence of combined evaluation of crp and esr before ercp . esr will be raised in almost all patients with any systemic inflammation , so our study is also limited because patients with systemic inflammation were not excluded . to date , many risk factors for pep have been reported from high - volume centers . these have included female gender , younger age , sphincter of oddi dysfunction , cannulation difficulty , prolonged procedure time , and repeated injection to the pancreatic duct . not all of these factors were analyzed in our study , and our results were not fully consistent with the previous results .", "performing ercp may be safer in the elderly and in patients with low levels of serum esr because they may be less at risk of pep . using pre - ercp anti - inflammatory pharmacologic agents like nsaids might be beneficial , by lowering esr level and reducing related risk of pep ."], "summary": "backgroundpancreatitis remains the most common complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ercp ) , resulting in substantial morbidity and occasional mortality . there are notable controversies and conflicting reports about risk factors of post - ercp pancreatitis ( pep).aimto evaluate the potential risk factors for pep at a referral tertiary center , as a sample of the iranian population.materials and methodsbaseline characteristics and clinical as well as paraclinical information of 780 patients undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic ercp at taleghani hospital in tehran between 2008 and 2012 were reviewed . data were collected prior to the ercp , at the time of the procedure , and 2472 hours after discharge . pep was diagnosed according to consensus criteria.resultsof the 780 patients who underwent diagnostic ercp , pancreatitis developed in 26 patients ( 3.3% ) . in the multivariable risk model , significant risk factors with adjusted odds ratios ( ors ) were age < 65 years ( or = 10.647 , p = 0.023 ) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) > 30 ( or = 6.414 , p < 0.001 ) . female gender , history of recurrent pancreatitis , pre - ercp hyperamylasemia , and difficult or failed cannulation could not predict pep . there was no significant difference in the rate of pep in wire - guided cannulation versus biliary cannulation using a sphincterotome and contrast injection as the conventional method.conclusionsperforming ercp may be safer in the elderly . patients with high esr may be at greater risk of pep , which warrants close observation of these patients for signs of pancreatitis after ercp .", "ranking": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]}

Conclusion"], "document": ["south east asia is home to one - third of the global burden of tuberculosis ( tb ) , with an estimated 5 million prevalent cases and an annual incidence of 3 million tb cases . five of the 11 countries in the region are among the 22 high - burden countries , with india accounting for over 20% of the global burden of tb disease [ 1 , 2 ] . using the current strategy of passive case finding , the case detection rate in the region has improved from around 40% in 2002 to 65% in 2008 . however , it has stagnated since 2006 and remains below the target of more than 70% . a lower than expected case detection rate indicates that tb cases in the community are not being adequately identified and treated , which means ongoing transmission of tb infection . the risk of transmission increases with the closeness of contact , overcrowded living conditions , and the degree of infectiousness of a tb case as determined by the positivity of sputum smear microscopy of acid - fast bacilli ( afb ) and degree of lung field involvement in the chest x - ray ( cxr ) [ 5 , 6 ] . close contacts to a tb case such as those living in the same household are at higher risk of infection than casual contacts . among those that are infected , young children ( < 5 years ) or those with immunodeficiency ( e.g. , hiv infected ) are at increased risk of developing tb disease , usually within two years following infection . therefore , the world health organization ( who ) , the international union against tuberculosis and lung diseases ( iuatld ) and the national tb control programs ( ntps ) recommend screening of all children who are household contacts of sputum smear - positive tb case . screening and management of child contacts has great potential to reduce tb - related morbidity and mortality in children [ 4 , 9 ] . it also can identify contacts of any age with suspected tb disease at an earlier stage than they otherwise may have presented to health care services . it , therefore , has the potential to increase case finding and reduce transmission . finally , though the contribution of young children to transmission may be small , they may form a pool of infection from which future adult cases arise [ 11 , 12 ] .   despite the benefits , contact investigation for child contacts is rarely implemented and reported in resource - limited tb endemic settings , such as in the south east asia . this paper aims to collate published data reporting the prevalence of tb infection and tb disease among child household contacts of tb in the south east asia region .", "the search strategies were developed using a combination of subject headings and keywords , including  tuberculosis ,   mycobacterium tuberculosis ,   contact tracing ,   contact investigation ,   contact screening ,   household contact ,   the primary studies were searched electronically using databases pubmed , embase , and web of science . manual searching of the reference lists of the primary studies was performed to identify other eligible studies . published studies were included if they included children and adolescents ( 015 years ) , reported the yield of household contact investigation in children or provided data to calculate the prevalence of tb infection or tb disease in children , and were conducted in countries in the south east asia region . the data extracted included the following information : study site , design , description of index cases , description of household contacts , definition of household contacts , investigations performed ( tuberculin skin test ( tst ) , cxr , sputum smear microscopy of afb , and culture of mycobacterium tuberculosis ) , outcomes among child contacts ( healthy , tb infection , or tb disease ) , and the criteria used to determine the outcomes .", "there have been systematic reviews and a meta - analysis on contact investigation of tb , but none specifically assessed the yield from household contact investigation among children in the south east asia region [ 13 , 14 ] . eleven eligible studies were conducted in seven countries in south east asia : india ( four studies ) [ 1518 ] , thailand ( two studies ) [ 19 , 20 ] , and one study each from cambodia , indonesia , lao people 's democratic republic , pakistan , and philippines . not all of the studies evaluated the prevalence of both tb infection and tb disease : five studies provided data on both ; five studies evaluated the prevalence of tb infection only and one study of tb disease only . there was heterogeneity among studies with regards to epidemiology background , study design , the characteristics of the index case and child contact , and the criteria used for determining tb infection and tb disease ( table 1 ) .   most studies were cross - sectional in design , and only one study conducted in india in 1960s performed a prospective followup for a period of 5 years . the index case in most studies was a case of sputum smear - positive pulmonary tb ( ptb ) . the study from indonesia evaluated household contacts of an index case with sputum smear - negative ptb , and two studies in india included sputum smear - positive and smear - negative cases with abnormal cxr [ 15 , 16 ] . with regard to child contacts , three studies involved children under five only [ 15 , 21 , 22 ] , the others included older children up to 1418 years of age [ 1620 , 2325 ] . there was no uniform definition of a household contact across the studies , but the most common definition was a child living in the same house as the index case . four studies specified a period of at least 3 months of living at the same house to define household contacts [ 19 , 22 , 24 , 25 ] . a study in india defined close contact as living , cooking , and eating in the same house as the index case for the period of three months immediately preceding the start of treatment for the index case . all studies which provided data on tb infection defined it as a positive tst , evaluated 4872 after administration of tuberculin solution . four studies used a cutoff of 10  mm , whereas the philippines study used 5  mm and the thailand study used 15  mm . the study from indonesia used the local scoring system , whereas most other studies used clinical and radiological features .   the number of child contacts investigated in the studies ranged from 61 to 790 children of 50 to 342 index cases . in general , the prevalence of tb infection among child contacts under 15 years of age was higher ( 24.469.2% ) than that of active tb disease ( 3.35.5% ) . tb disease was more commonly found among children aged less than 5 years , whereas tb infection was more common in older children ( table 2 ) .   the results of household contact investigation across the eligible studies can not be compared directly due to the heterogeneity , particularly in outcome definitions ( tb disease or tb infection ) .   figure 1 presents the yield of tb infection from studies which used a cutoff of 10  mm of tst result for tb infection among sputum smear - positive index cases . it is shown that tb infection is more common in children aged more than 5 years . the prevalence of infection in all children ranged from 24.4% to 38.8% , with a weighted yield of 31% .", "the prevalence of tb infection and disease among children living in the same house as a case of pulmonary tb in south east asia varies between settings . this variation may be due to the different epidemiology features amongst the countries or to the heterogeneity among studies with regards to the characteristics of the index case and the criteria used for determining tb infection and disease . nonetheless , tb infection among child contacts was common and would support recommendations for routine screening and management of child household contacts . the finding that tb disease is more prevalent among young children ( < 5 years ) is as expected given that young age is a well - established risk factor for disease following infection .   various approaches and criteria were used to assess the outcome of contact investigation , indicating that there has not been a universal method accepted or implemented in south east asia . for example , the study in the philippines used a cut - off point of 5  mm induration to define positive tst , which is lower than the recommended 10  mm in a bcg - vaccinated population . the use of the cutoff may explain why this group reported the highest prevalence ( 67.2% ) of tb infection amongst the studies . for studies which defined a positive tst as 10  mm induration , the proportion of tb infection ranged from 24% to 48% [ 6 , 15 , 22 , 24 , 2731 ] . a meta - analysis of contact investigation in low- and middle - income countries by morrison and colleagues revealed a prevalence of tb infection of 40% in children aged under 15 years . despite the evidence of high rates of infection and disease in child contacts in south east asia , screening a cross - sectional study in india reported that only 31 of 220 ( 14% ) children younger than 14 years living in the same house as adults with pulmonary tb were screened for tb . a higher yield of 52% was reported by tornee and co - workers in a prospective study in thailand . . the potential of contact screening upon identification of an infectious case in the community is emphasised by a recent study from south africa which reported that most cases of young children with confirmed tb represented a missed prior opportunity for preventive therapy . isoniazid preventive therapy ( ipt ) which has proven efficacy in preventing tb disease in infected and uninfected child contacts is recommended for child contacts < 5 years of age who have no evidence of tb disease [ 8 , 34 , 35 ] . a study in india reported that , of 84 child contacts aged younger than 6 years , only 16 ( 19% ) were initiated on ipt . in malawi , of 365 child household contacts under five , only 33 ( 9% ) were actually screened for tb : 23 ( 6% ) received ipt , 6 ( 2% ) received anti - tb treatment , and , in 4 ( 1% ) , no action was taken . when ipt is prescribed , poor adherence is another problem that is likely to reduce the effectiveness of this intervention . adherence rates of 15 to 28% have been reported from south africa [ 38 , 39 ] . a reason for the poor implementation of contact investigation and ipt provision in resource - limited countries is likely to be the lack of human resources . health workers in tb endemic areas are overburdened by the identification and management of sputum smear - positive cases , which are the priority for treatment in any national tb programs . in addition , the awareness and knowledge of families and healthcare workers of the rationale and potential of ipt are lacking [ 33 , 40 ] . in malawi , only 21% of tb patients who had child contacts aged 5 years or below were informed about the need for screening their children . a more recent study in malawi in 2006 reported that only 8% of sputum smear - positive cases brought their children to the clinic for screening despite provision of clear information . guidelines that are difficult to implement may also be a barrier for the implementation of contact investigation . as long as tst and cxr remain mandatory tests for screening , coverage in resource - limited settings can not be expected to improve , and its impact on tb control is likely to be limited . tst and cxr are not readily available in primary health clinics in the region , where index cases are commonly identified and treated . these tests are usually performed at main hospitals located in cities , which increases transport and time costs . the use and interpretation of tst are also problematic : unaffordable for most families in resource - limited setting ; require skill to perform , and a second hospital visit is necessary .   a more simple , cheap , feasible , efficient and patient - friendly method is required . the current who guideline   of symptom - based screening recommends symptom evaluation alone to decide whether the contact requires further investigation for tb disease or can be prescribed ipt directly . asymptomatic child contacts aged less than 5 years can be provided ipt without further investigation . if tb is suspected at initial assessment or at subsequent followup , further investigation should be performed to establish or exclude a diagnosis of tb disease . referral to a district or tertiary hospital may be necessary when there are uncertainties about the diagnosis . a limitation of this systematic review is that it only includes published studies reported in english . more precise yields from contact investigation among child household contacts in the south east asia would have been gained if unpublished studies and the grey literature such as reports from ntps of each country were included .", "contact investigation studies in south east asia indicate the potential of screening and ipt to reduce the risk of tb disease in child contacts , yet it is rarely implemented . research is required to determine patient and health service barriers to screening to enable targeted effective intervention programs to be developed . one such research strategy could include a qualitative review of problems around the implementation of contact investigation and ipt provision for child contacts in the region . this will provide valuable information for the design of community - based interventions to improve the management of child contacts ."], "summary": "background . screening of children who are household contacts of tuberculosis ( tb ) cases is universally recommended but rarely implemented in tb endemic setting . this paper aims to summarise published data of the prevalence of tb infection and disease among child contacts in south east asia . methods . search strategies were developed to identify all published studies from south east asia of household contact investigation that included children ( 015 years ) . results . eleven studies were eligible for review . there was heterogeneity across the studies . tb infection was common among child contacts under 15 years of age ( 24.469.2% ) and was higher than the prevalence of tb disease , which varied from 3.3% to 5.5% . conclusion . tb infection is common among children that are household contacts of tb cases in south east asia . novel approaches to child contact screening and management that improve implementation in south east asia need to be further evaluated .", "ranking": [3, 2, 0, 1, 4]}

free , female icr mice , aged 46 weeks and weighting 2530  g , were purchased from the national laboratory animal center , mahidol university , bangkok , thailand . they were kept at 2225c with 12  h light / dark cycle and given standard mouse pellet and water ad libitum . all procedures of the animal experiments were approved by the ethical committee on animal experimentation , faculty of medical technology , western university . \n pbanka was kept alive by intraperitoneal ( ip ) passage of 1  10 parasitized erythrocytes in nave mice . in addition , hematocrit ( % hct ) was also monitored by collecting tail vein into heparinized hematocrit tubes and centrifuged at 10,000  g for 10  min . blood urea nitrogen ( bun ) and creatinine were used as indicators of renal function . mouse blood was collected from tail vein into heparinized hematocrit tubes and centrifuged at 10,000  g for 10  min . plasma was subsequently collected and used as subjects for measurement of bun and creatinine using an available commercial kit ( biosystems ) according to manufacturer 's instruction . protective effect of aqueous crude extract of t. crispa on renal damage and hemolysis during malaria infection was done based on standard 4-day suppressive test . groups of icr mice ( 5 mice of each ) were randomly divided , and infection was then performed with 1  10 parasitized erythrocytes of pbanka by ip injection . two hours after infection , they were given orally by gavage with 500 , 1000 , and 2000  mg / kg of the extracts and every 24  h twice a day for 4 consecutive days . three control groups were used ; normal controls were given either distilled water or the extract while untreated control was given only distilled water . on day 4 of experiment , tail blood was collected to assess hemolysis by measurement of % hct .", "parasitemia was first detectable on day 1 after infection with a parasitemia of 0.5% and reached 65% on day 10 ( figure 1(a ) ) . next , we observed that bun and creatinine levels were markedly increased in infected mice , and first significant ( p < 0.05 and p < 0.001 ) increases were found on day 4 after infection ( figures 1(b ) and 1(c ) ) . additionally , we also observed progressive decreases of % hct in infected mice in response to the presence of parasitemia ( figure 1(d ) ) . it was found that t. crispa stem extract showed protective effect on renal damage induced by pbanka infection in mice , and the highest activity was found at dose of 2000  mg / kg of extract treated group ( figure 2 ) . the bun and creatinine levels were increased significantly ( p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 , resp . ) by malaria infection ( untreated group ) and infected mice treated with 500  mg / kg of the extract , compared to normal control . interestingly , after oral administration of t. crispa stem extract , bun and creatinine levels declined significantly ( p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 , resp . ) , especially at doses of 1000 and 2000  mg / kg , compared to untreated control . however , t. crispa stem extract could not be able to decrease parasitemia levels . \n t. crispa stem extract exerted antihemolytic effect against pbanka infected mice . as shown in figure 3 , hemolysis was observed in untreated control and infected mice treated with 500  mg / kg of the extract as indicated by decreasing of % hct with significance ( p < 0.01 ) , compared to normal control . interestingly , % hct was significantly ( p < 0.01 ) increased in infected mice treated with 1000 and 2000  mg / kg of the extract , compared to untreated control . the highest effect was found at dose of 2000  mg / kg of the extract . moreover , prolonged survival time of infected mice treated with this extract was also observed .", "in the current study , we provide evidence that describes the protective effect of t. crispa stem extract on renal damage and hemolysis induced by p. berghei infection in mice . the onset of renal damage and hemolysis in icr mice infected with pbanka come out from day 4 after infection and the incidence of renal damage and hemolysis were confirmed through manifestations such as increasing of bun and creatinine as well as decreasing of % hct in infected mice . renal damage and hemolysis are proposed to be a consequence of parasite adhesion and exacerbated immune response against products of oxidative stress released during infection . in addition , parasitized erythrocyte sequestration at the microvascular site of renal has also been discussed to induce renal damage . the destruction of erythrocytes during blood stage infection accumulates high levels of toxic - free heme that has ability to induce oxidative stress from production of hydroxyl radicals via fenton / haber - weiss reaction . moreover , heme - derived oxidative stress is considered to be a main factor in the iron - induced lipid peroxidation resulting in the formation of oxidized ldl . therefore , these conditions derived by blood stage of infection result in renal damage and hemolysis . however , protective effects of renal damage and hemolysis induced by malaria infection were found in infected mice treated with t. crispa stem extract . polyphenols and flavonoids show high antioxidant and anti - inflammation properties and then protect oxidative stress development . t. crispa stem extract has been shown to contain high amounts of polyphenols and flavonoids . thus , the potent antioxidant activity of this extract might play a central role in protecting renal damage and hemolysis from oxidative stress induced by malaria infection . moreover , t. crispa stem extract has been reported to have antimalarial activity against p. yoelii infection in mice . so , antimalarial activity to inhibit p. berghei growth and subsequently inhibit renal damage and hemolysis might also be mentioned .", "taken together , our results suggest that t. crispa stem extract shows protective effects against p. berghei - induced renal damage and hemolysis . appropriate pharmaceutical strategies might now be devised to increase the low bioavailability of this extract and to protect against rapid in vivo metabolic transformation , in such a way to make them more amenable as alternative antimalarial drug in combination therapies ."], "summary": "renal damage and hemolysis induced by malaria are associated with mortality in adult patients . it has been speculated that oxidative stress condition induced by malaria infection is involved in its pathology . thus , we aimed to investigate the protective effects of tinospora crispa stem extract on renal damage and hemolysis during plasmodium berghei infection . t. crispa stem extract was prepared using hot water method and used for oral treatment in mice . groups of icr mice were infected with 1  107 parasitized erythrocytes of p. berghei anka by intraperitoneal injection and given the extracts ( 500 , 1000 , and 2000  mg / kg ) twice a day for 4 consecutive days . to assess renal damage and hemolysis , blood urea nitrogen ( bun ) , creatinine , and hematocrit ( % hct ) levels were then evaluated , respectively . malaria infection resulted in renal damage and hemolysis as indicated by increasing of bun and creatinine and decreasing of % hct , respectively . however , protective effects on renal damage and hemolysis were observed in infected mice treated with these extracts at doses of 1000 and 2000  mg / kg . in conclusion , t. crispa stem extract exerted protective effects on renal damage and hemolysis induced by malaria infection . this plant may work as potential source in the development of variety of herbal formulations for malarial treatment .", "ranking": [3, 0, 2, 1, 4]}

a multisystem fibrotic disease causing vasculopathy the main complications of which affect the skin , muscles , joints , and internal organs . musculoskeletal involvement is common among patients with ssc and it is also a main cause of disability . the hands are the most commonly affected part of the body including : hand deformities , loss of flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints , loss of extension of the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints , loss of thumb abduction , flexion , and opposition , and loss of wrist motion in all planes resulting in the classic claw - hand deformity . ssc generally results in disfigurement to visible and socially relevant parts of the body ( particularly the hands , mouth , and face ) , resulting in body image dissatisfaction not unlike patients with severe burn injuries . perhaps because deteriorating psychological function and psychological distress erode a person 's self - esteem . women with ssc have a lower self - esteem than burn patients with observable deformities , as thickening skin is both disabling and cosmetically disconcerting . the typical hand deformations result in functional disability as related to activities in daily living requiring object manipulation , grasping , and pinching . approximately 90% of patients with ssc confirm the loss of both hand movement and dexterity ( gross and fine motor control ) . hand deformity , expanded fingers , and decreased wrist extension are the main risk factors leading to hand disability . hand function is one of the greatest concerns among patients with ssc including : muscle strength , grasp patterns , precision and accuracy , anatomical integrity , sensation , motivation , coordination and dexterity , unilateral and bilateral tasks , and daily living tasks . pharmacological treatments used include : ( a ) vasodilators and antiplatelet aggregation drugs to improve peripheral blood circulation , ( b ) immunosuppressant drugs to prevent the synthesis and release of harmful cytokines , and ( c ) agents that reduce collagen synthesis to inhibit or reduce fibrosis ; while nonpharmacological treatments include manual therapies . crucially , a hand rehabilitation program is needed for prevention of hand deformity and maintaining quality of life . recent studies by vannajak and colleagues reported that traditional thai massage ( ttm ) on the upper extremities in patients with ssc can increase hand mobility in the immediate and short - term and increase hand skin temperature for half an hour . hand exercises  including finger stretching , upper extremity stretching , occupational therapy , and mcmennell joint manipulation  have been reported to improve hand function through active exercise ( active range of motion ) combined with connective tissue massage . both prior studies measured hand mobility in scleroderma ( hamis ) and the test results showed that the use of heating modalities in conjunction with physical therapy improved extensibility of collagen tissue along with tendon and joint capsules ; underscoring the importance of superficial heating modalities or thermal glove insulation for keeping the hands warm and increasing extensibility . secondary raynaud 's phenomenon ( srp ) generally occurs and is serious in ssc when the patient is exposed to cold or to emotional stressors . in a cold environment , and especially in winter , even a small decrease in temperature can aggravate the vasculitis in the hands . in order to maintain good hand function for adls , when patients with ssc are exposed to cold the hands need to be protected against heat loss from heat convection and/or direct contact with cold . wearing gloves is a simple , safe , and easy way to prevent hand heat loss and direct contact with cold . the objective of this study was to evaluate the short - term effect on hand mobility of thermal insulation gloves in combination with a daily home program ( including ttm , stretching , and superficial heating ) among patients with ssc .", "this was a randomized control trial conducted with 28 scleroderma ( ssc ) patients ( both males and females ) from the rheumatology department , srinagarind hospital , khon kaen university , at the faculty of associated medical sciences , khon kaen university , thailand . the study was conducted in patients who were already on vasodilator drugs ( depending on rheumatologist , i.e. nifedipine ) , which was administered by rheumatologist , specialist in scleroderma . the study was approved by the khon kaen university ethics committee for human research based on the declaration of helsinki and the international conference on harmonization ich good clinical practice guidelines ( order : 4.2.01 : 38/2011 , number : he541337 ) . scleroderma patients ( diffuse subtype ) were recruited to the study , which was conducted in the thai cool season ( december 2012-january 2013 ) . exclusion criteria were : ( a ) a history of hand surgery within 6 months , ( b ) an open wound or ulceration on the hand , ( c ) loss of tactile and proprioceptive sensation in the hand , ( d ) diabetes mellitus , ( e ) smoking , or ( f ) a psychiatric condition . participants were asked to sign a consent form after which they were randomly allocated into one of two groups ( experimental treatment or control group ) . then each was given a hamis hand function test by a physical therapist . the experimental group performed the daily home program wearing gloves , while the control group did the program without gloves . all of the participants had superficial heat ( i.e. warm water ~ 40c ) applied to the hands for 20 min . then a relative gave ttm to the upper extremities , from the neck to the finger tips , for 30 min ( 15 min on each side ) . seven stretching positions were done following the ttm : ( a ) forearm supination / pronation , ( b ) wrist flexion / extension , ( c ) radial / ulnar deviation , ( d ) finger abduction / flexion / extension , ( e ) thumb abduction / adduction , ( f ) flexion / extension , and ( g ) thumb opposition [ figure 1 ] . patients began by gradually stretching to the point of resistance , then holding for 30 seconds . they repeated this four times on each side , once a day , for 2 weeks . ( patients did the stretching independently after instruction and supervision by the physical therapist . ) next , the patients in the glove group put on the gloves for 6 h per day . stretching exercise in daily home program , ( a ) forearm supination , ( b ) forearm pronation , ( c ) wrist flexion , ( d ) wrist and finger extension , ( e ) wrist radial deviation , ( f ) wrist ulnar deviation , ( g ) finger abduction , ( h ) finger flexion , ( i ) thumb abduction , ( j ) thumb adduction , ( k ) thumb flexion , and ( l ) thumb extension data for hamis was collected and expressed as a median : ( q1q3 ) . any significant difference between the daily home program with gloves and without after 2 weeks of treatment differences between the groups would be considered significant at a p < 0.05 [ figures 2 and 3 ] . change in left and right hand mobility after 2 weeks of daily home program flow chart of the study", "the study had 28 participants : the glove - wearing group ( nine females ; five males ) and daily home program group ( four females ; 10 males ) . the diagnosis was the diffuse , cutaneous systemic sclerosis ( dcssc ) subtype in the indurative phase . the modified rodnan skin thickness score ( mrss ) was 1 - 2 at the dorsum of the forearm , hand and between 3 and 6 at the proximal phalange of the 3 finger ( 0 = normal skin thickness , 1 = mild , 2 = moderate , and 3 = severe ) . hamis is a performance index comprising nine items normally constituting in an ordinary range of motion ( a score between 9 and 18 reflects a high degree of deformity ) . baseline characteristics of participants are presented in table 1 , while changes in hand mobility after the 2 week study is shown in table 2 and figure 1 . baseline characteristic of patients with ssc hand mobility in scleroderma patients change after gloving in combination with ttm", "prevention of hand deformity is a core goal and is one reason for the need for physical therapy . the aim of the current study was to compare the therapeutic effect between a daily home program with and without thermal insulation ( wearing gloves ) as measured by hand mobility ( hamis ) . accordingly , wearing gloves as part of the daily home program represented a benefit viz -  - viz hand mobility . vannajak and colleagues reported that ttm also aids with hand mobility among patients with ssc . although their study did not include any stretching exercise because they were focused on isolating the effect of ttm on hand mobility , other studies used ttm augmented by daily home programs with heat and/or stretches appropriate to the individual 's condition , disease stage , and expectation for improvement of hand mobility in the indurative phase . wearing gloves in combination with ttm and a daily home program may be particularly useful in winter . the combination of ttm + heat + stretching produced a synergistic therapeutic effect . in the current study , the gloves were made of nylon fabric , selected because of the results of a previous in vitro study about the characteristics of material and insulation properties . after the 2 weeks of routine treatment there was no difference between the two groups in mobility , on the basis of ttm and stretching alone , but wearing gloves plus the other treatments clearly improved finger flexion , finger extension , thumb abduction , and pincer grip aspects . even though the median hamis score was equal between groups , wearing gloves in combination with ttm and the daily home program was a better method . in winter , gloves provide protection from exposure to cold which aggravates severe srp in ssc . if an srp attack is not prevented , vascular permeability and vasospasm will result in sclerosis of vascular , severe pain , and disturbed daily living . the daily home program in our study indicated an increase in hand mobility among patients with ssc , which agrees with a previous study on active range of motion and another on individual rehabilitation programs . vannajak and colleagues demonstrated that ttm can increase hand skin temperature and hand mobility in both the immediate and short - term . the results of the current study underscore that primary self - care by hand exercise is beneficial in increasing hand mobility which leads to improved quality of life among patients with ssc , and is especially effective when combined with manual therapy and wearing gloves to prevent cold exposure leading to srp . a limitation of this study was its short duration ; notwithstanding , the results indicate a measurable benefit for the group wearing gloves with the daily home program . further study will be conducted on microvascular structure alteration with a longer duration follow - up .", "after 2 weeks , the daily home program helped to improve hand mobility among patients with ssc . wearing gloves in combination with the daily home exercises was effective , safe , and led to increased self - esteem . the quality of life score among patients with ssc also improved as a result of increased hand mobility . the suggestion was larger sample size and longer duration of study is desired to further confirm these observations . finally , wearing gloves in combination with ttm , heat , and stretching may help to improve hand mobility among patients with scleroderma ."], "summary": "background : systemic sclerosis ( ssc ) is a chronic , multisystem connective tissue disorder characterized by autoimmune activation , microvascular endothelium damage , and excessive collagen proliferation . the most affected hand presents claw hand deformity and microvascular disease . deformed hands can cause functional disability and decrease the quality of life . a daily home program can improve mobility of scleroderma patients.objective:we sought to determine the effect of a daily home exercise program on hand mobility among scleroderma patients.materials and methods : this was a randomized control trial . twenty - eight participants were divided into two groups , both of which received the same daily home treatment : group 1 with gloves ( n = 14 ) and group 2 without gloves ( n = 14 ) . the 2-week daily home program combined traditional thai massage ( ttm ) with stretching exercises and heat . hand mobility was assessed using hand mobility in scleroderma ( hamis ) . the study was conducted in patients who were already on vasodilator drugs.results:both groups showed a significant improvement in hand mobility after 2 weeks of daily home exercise program ( p < 0.05 ) . wearing the glove , however , resulted in better thumb mobility.conclusions:a daily home exercise program improved hand mobility among patients with scleroderma and wearing gloves may improve thumb mobility .", "ranking": [2, 4, 1, 3, 0]}

Conclusion"], "document": ["during the last years an increased focus on fatigue symptoms / syndrome among children has been observed , together with an increase in referrals to our hospital . children with fatigue whether these illnesses are increasing in number or just an increase in referrals to the specialist , in part based on greater interest in the topic is unknown . the aetiology of the condition is still unclear after almost three decades of research in this area , where infectious , immunological , neuroendocrine , sleep , and psychiatric mechanisms , among others , have been investigated . despite the fact that no evidence has been found so far of an infectious aetiology , it has been proposed that a heterogeneous group of infections may trigger or maintain the symptoms of cfs . abnormalities in the immune system have been reported in cfs - patients , among these , deficiencies in natural killer cell function and increased expression of activation markers on the cell - surface of t - lymphocytes , especially increased numbers of cd8 + cytotoxic t cells that have certain antigenic markers . whether these abnormalities have any relationship to cfs and its symptoms remains unclear .   the prevalence of the condition among young adults in the twenties and older has been reported as three percent studies have found a higher prevalence of cfs of two to three among females [ 1 , 4 , 8 , 9 ] . found that children and adolescents with chronic fatigue have a syndrome that is similar to that described in adults but that the syndrome presents earlier in the course of the illness and has a more optimistic outcome . a doctoral thesis from norway did not find socioeconomic status to contribute to the fatigue symptom , opposite to what chalder et al . found . having a disabling condition like cfs in childhood and adolescence may pose major consequences regarding mental health , personal relationships , school attendance and participating in social life and work . it is important to ensure early and proper management of these patients [ 15 , 16 ] .   the aim of the present hospital - based clinical retrospective study was ( 1 ) to estimate the number of children being diagnosed with g93.3 postviral fatigue syndrome during a 10-year period ( 2002 to 2011 ) and ( 2 ) describe the clinical and laboratory findings in children with postviral fatigue syndrome .", "the diagnosis given in icd-10 g93.3 postviral fatigue syndrome ( cfs ) is also used diagnosing children and adolescent with fatigue . however , time aspect with onset of symptoms is shorter for children than adults . all children and adolescents in the county where this study took place , was referred to specialist when diagnosing g93.3 post viral fatigue syndrome . all children suffering from fatigue are investigated in the department of paediatrics . during the first consultation the specialist will apply a preliminary diagnosis while the medical investigations are done . at the end of evaluation it should be noted that not all children with illness compatible with cfs will also fulfil criteria for postviral fatigue syndrome . the study was retrospective , and the subjects were all children under the age of 16 . a list of patients who underwent investigations and were diagnosed with g93.3 postviral fatigue syndrome according to the icd-10 classification was collected from the patient registry . the diagnosis was set by a paediatrician either during or at the end of the evaluation period . the following data were collected : ( 1 ) clinical examination , ( 2 ) blood sample tests , ( 3 ) other investigations , and ( 4 ) evaluation by physiotherapist , psychiatrist evaluating depression and anxiety using icd-10 criteria , and neuropsychologist assessing wisc - r measuring iq . body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated retrospectively based on weight and length as kg / m . we defined overweight as bmi > 25 and underweight as bmi < 17.5 . because some findings support the notion that cfs may be due to one or more immune disorders that have resulted from exposure to an infectious agent , igg antibodies to epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) and cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) were used as a measure of previous infection .", "a total number of 37 patients were referred with fatigue symptoms according to the patient registry . four patients were excluded due to obvious incorrect coding . of the remaining 33 , six ( 18% ) two were diagnosed with epilepsy , two with sleeping disorders , one with hypothyreosis and one did not fulfil the criteria of cfs or any other diagnosis . of the 27 who received the diagnosis g93.3 , four had comorbid chronic illness . there were an increased number of referred patients with fatigue during the 10-year period , with almost three in four patients investigated during the last three years ( 20092011 ) . previous studies have found that many children with cfs do have mental health problems irrespective of cause [ 2023 ] . according to the psychiatrist assessment , none of the patients suffered from anxiety or depression . three children had a pathological eeg ; two of them had epilepsy and one sleeping disorder . heart rate ( hr ) and blood pressure ( bp ) were all within normal range . one child had low ft4 and later diagnosed as hypothyreosis .   among the 27 patients referred with cfs , 16 ( 59% ) were boys . the mean average age for the onset of fatigue symptoms was 141 months ( sd 30 ) for boys and 136 months ( sd 31 ) for girls , respectively . being underweight , defined as bmi < 17.5 , was found in 12 ( 44% ) , while one ( 4% ) was overweight with a bmi > 25 . half of the underweight children were boys . of the 27 patients with cfs ( g93.3 ) , 20 ( 74% ) tested positive for igg to epstein - barr virus , six ( 22% ) tested positive for igg to cytomegalovirus , and one ( 4% ) tested positive to borrelia , indicating previous infection .", "in the present clinical retrospective study we found no gender differences among children and adolescent younger than 16 years of age with chronic fatigue symptom , with debut of symptoms after 10 years of age . almost half of them were underweight and half of these were boys . almost one in five suffering from fatigue symptoms proved to have other diagnoses . during the last decade , there have been an increase in number of referrals of children with fatigue as the only symptom . chronic fatigue syndrome is not a new syndrome , there are documented cases since the 19th century . however during the last decade , there has been an increased knowledge and awareness about the condition in the healthcare system and in the media in norway which influence the number of referrals .   in this study , the use of medical and biochemical test when assessing children and adolescence with chronic fatigue syndrome varied . the increased focus on the cfs diagnosis may have led to excessive use during the diagnostic evaluation process .   the strength of the study is the retrospective design which allows us to confirm the diagnoses . in addition , due to uncertainty whether the whole county was covered , one can not estimate incidences .   previous studies have reported a higher prevalence of cfs in the female population [ 25 , 26 ] . however , this was a very small population , and it is possible that the results could have been different in a larger group . time of onset seemed to be in accordance with other studies who describe symptom onset of fatigue between almost twelve until fifteen years .   almost all patients reported themselves to be previously healthy prior to their fatigue and also ascribed the onset due to an infection . one in six had a chronic condition that could explain their fatigue symptoms but still fulfilling criteria for g93.3 postviral fatigue syndrome . the diagnosis of cfs is usually established after excluding other chronic conditions ; however , long standing medical or psychological conditions can also result in cfs . there is a gray area between fatigue due chronic medical and psychological conditions and fatigue which is a part of cfs . this zone needs to be examined carefully , and diagnostic criteria for cfs should be adjusted to clarify this overlap .   interestingly , we found that more than one in three of the referred patients was underweight , with an equal gender representation . the question is whether the underweight as a cause of fatigue has been overlooked in the diagnostic process or the cfs itself is the reason for underweight . lack of the bmi records before the onset of fatigue symptoms makes it difficult to answer this question in our study . this is opposite to a recent study where high bmi was found to be significantly associated with prolonged duration of cfs in a retrospective cohort of children . many of the adolescents had additional symptoms from the gastrointestinal system , like diarrhea and nausea [ 12 , 28 ] . further studies are needed to address the issue of eating disorders and to explain the reason for the low bmi . many medical conditions present with long lasting fatigue as a disabling symptom [ 29 , 30 ] . in this retrospective study , this is a reminder of the importance of a thorough investigation of the children being evaluated for possible cfs , to exclude other causes for their fatigue .", "the clinical assessment of children and adolescents with possible cfs needs systematic investigation . nutritional status , possible eating disorder , and psychosocial issues need to be addressed and evaluated carefully ."], "summary": "aim . to estimate number of children being diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome ( cfs ) . methods . for a period of 10 years ( 20022011 ) data from children being referred for fatigue symptoms were collected retrospectively . results . thirty -

Future Directions of Periodontitis Therapy"], "document": ["periodontal diseases are polymicrobial immune - inflammatory infectious diseases that can lead to the destruction of periodontal ligaments and adjacent supportive alveolar bone . the subgingival plaque contains more than 700 bacterial species , and some of these microorganisms have been shown to be responsible for initiation / progression of periodontal diseases [ 1 , 2 ] . the red complex , which includes porphyromonas gingivalis , treponema denticola , and tannerella forsythia ( formerly bacteroides forsythus ) , encompasses the most important pathogens in adult periodontal disease . additionally , fusobacterium nucleatum , prevotella species , eikenella corrodens , peptostreptococcus micros , and campylobacter rectus are increased in deep periodontal pockets and are implicated as possible periodontopathogens [ 14 ] . these bacteria are not usually found alone , but in combination in the periodontal pockets , suggesting that some bacteria may cause destruction of the periodontal tissue in a cooperative manner . studies using animal models have reported the synergistic pathogenicity of mixed infections with p. gingivalis - t . furthermore , coaggregation , nutrient effects , and modulation of virulence factors by periodontopathogens or by interspecies interactions between periodontopathogenic and nonpathogenic organisms have been reported to contribute to oral microbial pathogenesis . this paper focuses on interspecies pathogenic interactions within the red complex , in particular the combinations of p. gingivalis - t . potential therapies using normal inhabitants of the oral microbiota that have an antagonistic relationship with the red complex are discussed .", "p. gingivalis possesses many virulence factors , such as fimbriae , lipopolysaccharides , and proteases [ 1315 ] . the arg - gingipain ( rgp ) and lys - gingipain ( kgp ) cysteine proteinases are important for the virulence of p. gingivalis as they elicit dysfunction of inflammatory and immune responses and can degrade various connective tissue proteins [ 16 , 17 ] . rgp is encoded by two separate genes ( rgpa and rgpb ) , whereas kgp is encoded by a single gene ( kgp ) . in a murine abscess model , rgpa and rgpb double and kgp single - mutants induced smaller abscesses than did the wild type , and the rgpa - rgpb - kgp triple ( gingipain - null ) mutant showed negligible lesion formation . these findings indicate that gingipains play an important role in abscess formation in mice .   compared to the abscess formation induced by monoinfection with each bacterium in the abovedescribed murine model , mixed infection with wild - type p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and t. forsythia atcc 43037 showed a synergistic effect on abscess formation . on the other hand , mixed infection with p. gingivalis mutants devoid of gingipain ( rgpa rgpb , kgp , and rgpa rgpb kgp ) with t. forsythia showed only just an additive effect on abscess formation . these findings suggest that the gingipains of p. gingivalis play an important role in the pathological synergism between p. gingivalis and t. forsythia . a combination of t. forsythia strains isolated from periodontitis patients and p. gingivalis also showed synergistic pathogenesis in a rabbit abscess model . the researchers found 100% abscess formation in rabbits with mixed infection using p. gingivalis and t. forsythia but 0% in rabbits with monoinfection with each bacterium . recently , verma et al .   injected p. gingivalis fdc 381 and t. forsythia atcc 43037 into the oral cavity of rats and evaluated the synergistic effect of mixed infection on periodontal disease . mixed colonization by p. gingivalis and t. forsythia in the rat oral cavity was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) . the induction of moderate periodontal inflammation and pronounced apical migration of junctional epithelium , generation of a specific immunoglobulin g ( igg ) antibody response , and stimulation of both th1- and th2-like immune responses as reflected by the serum igg subclass profiles were evident . mixed infection with p. gingivalis and t. forsythia resulted in a significant increase in interproximal alveolar bone resorption compared to that in rats infected with a single bacterial strain and controls , but there was no synergy between the bacteria . the researchers indicated that the virulence of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia mixed infection resulted from the immune - inflammatory responses and the lack of humoral immune protection during periodontitis in rats .   mice that were first infected with a wild - type strain and subsequently reinfected with the same wild - type strain showed significantly smaller lesions than control mice that were mock - infected with medium only and then re - infected with the wild - type strain . assessed the serum igg antibody response in a murine abscess model after mixed infection with various levels of p. gingivalis atcc 33277 or t. forsythia atcc 43037 whole bacteria cell antigens . after mixed infection , igg antibody responses to p. gingivalis increased in proportion to the level of t. forsythia injected . in contrast , igg antibody responses to t. forsythia did not correlate with the level of p. gingivalis injected . reasons for this difference may be that p. gingivalis and t. forsythia induced different antibody responses after mixed infection in mice ; alternatively , these bacteria may exhibit different interactions in terms of growth at the injected sites .  \n t. forsythia , which is a fastidious anaerobic gram - negative rod , is frequently isolated together with p. gingivalis , especially from the active state of periodontitis [ 2427 ] . it is well known that the growth of t. forsythia is accelerated on blood agar when cocultivated with p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum , suggesting that a form of symbiosis occurs with respect to nutrition . sonicated cell extracts of t. forsythia atcc 43037 stimulate growth of p. gingivalis atcc 33277 in nutrition - decreased medium in a dose - dependent manner , whereas the cell extract of t. forsythia had no stimulatory effect on the growth of the rgpa rgpb kgp triple ( gingipain - null ) mutant of p. gingivalis . these results suggest that gingipains of p. gingivalis play an important role in the digestion or uptake of the growth - promoting factor derived from t. forsythia . the growth - promoting interaction between p. gingivalis and t. forsythia may be partly related to synergistic virulence in a murine abscess model .  \n t. forsythia is a member of the polymicrobial flora that invades buccal epithelial cells taken directly from the mouth . epithelial cell invasion by periodontopathogens is considered to be an important virulence mechanism for evasion of the host defense responses and for forming reservoirs important in recurrent infections . t. forsythia possesses some putative virulence factors , such as a trypsin - like protease , a sialidase , hemagglutinin , components of the bacterial s - layer , and a cell surface - associated and secreted protein ( bspa ) . bspa has been recognized as a virulence factor important for alveolar bone loss in mice . inagaki et al .   investigated the epithelial cell adherence and invasion abilities of t. forsythia and reported that these are dependent on bspa . additionally , they found that p. gingivalis fdc 381 or its outer membrane vesicles enhance the attachment and invasion of t. forsythia atcc 43037 to epithelial cells .", "t. denticola , a small oral spirochete , is frequently found with p. gingivalis in progressing periodontitis lesions [ 1 , 3335 ] . t. denticola is located within the surface layers of the subgingival plaque , whereas p. gingivalis is observed predominantly beneath the spirochete layer ; a symbiotic nutrient utilization relationship between these two periodontopathogens has been shown in vitro . the growth - stimulating factors produced by p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and t. denticola atcc 35405 have been identified as isobutyric acid and succinic acid , respectively .   coculture of p. gingivalis fdc 381 and t. denticola atcc 35405 induced synergistic biofilm formation and coaggregation . confocal microscopy demonstrated that p. gingivalis attaches to the substratum first as the primary colonizer followed by coaggregation with t. denticola to form a mixed biofilm . the t. denticola flagellar mutant and cytoplasmic filament mutant exhibit significantly reduced biofilm formation with p. gingivalis . similarly , the p. gingivalis gingipain mutant and major fimbriae mutant exhibited significantly reduced biofilm formation with t. denticola . using two - dimensional electrophoresis followed by a ligand overlay assay with p. gingivalis fimbriae , hashimoto et al .   determined that dentilisin , a chymotrypsin - like proteinase of t. denticola ,  was the p. gingivalis fimbriae - binding protein . these results support the hypothesis that these two organisms assist each other 's survival in subgingival sulcus and explain why they are frequently isolated together from subgingival plaque . synergistic virulence of mixed p. gingivalis and t. denticola infection has been assessed in several animal lesion models . using a murine abscess model , one group reported that high doses of p. gingivalis w50 ( 1 - 2  10 cells per dose ) together with t. denticola atcc 35404 ( 1  10 or 1  10 cells per dose ) had no effect on the formation and size of the spreading lesion caused by p. gingivalis . however , at low p. gingivalis doses ( 1 - 2  10 cells ) , addition of t. denticola ( 1  10 cells ) significantly enhanced the virulence of p. gingivalis compared with monoinfection . investigation of the synergistic virulence of p. gingivalis and t. denticola using a murine experimental model of periodontitis found that a 1  :  1 ratio of p. gingivalis w50 and t. denticola atcc 35405 coinoculum at 5  10 or 1  10 total bacterial cells induced the same level of bone loss as four doses of 1  10  p. gingivalis . coinoculation induced strong p. gingivalis - specific t cell proliferative and interferon- ( ifn- ) cytokine responses and induced a strong t. denticola - specific ifn- cytokine response . another study using a rat model of periodontal disease reported that a mixed p. gingivalis fdc 381 ( 5  10  cells ) and t. denticola atcc 35404 ( 5  10 cells ) infection produced significantly more interproximal and horizontal alveolar bone loss compared to monoinfections ( 1  10  cells ) ; however , there was no synergy between p. gingivalis and t. denticola . furthermore , colonization of these bacteria was observed in the rat oral cavity during 7 weeks of periodontal disease , resulting in the generation of a specific serum igg antibody response that reflected oral infection and the induction of an inflammatory response consistent with the established characteristics of periodontitis . these results suggest that p. gingivalis and t. denticola act synergistically ( with no synergy between the bacteria ) to stimulate the host immune response and to induce alveolar bone loss in a rat model of periodontitis .", "epithelial cells and macrophages play a major role in the host response to periodontopathogens , and secretion of inflammatory mediators and matrix metalloproteinases ( mmps ) by these host cells contribute to periodontal tissue destruction . investigated the inflammatory response of an in vitro macrophage / epithelial cell coculture model following mono- or mixed infections with whole bacterial cells of the red - complex and their lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) . mono- or mixed infections of the coculture model induced the secretion of interleukin-1 beta ( il-1 ) , il-6 , il-8 , prostaglandin e2 ( pge2 ) , and mmp-9 . all lps mono- or mixed infections induced an increase in chemokine , mmp-9 , and pge2 production . compared to mono - infections with individual bacterial species , no synergistic effects on cytokine , pge2 , or mmp-9 production by the bacterial mixtures tested were observed . p. gingivalis and t. forsythia induced the secretion of rantes ( regulated and normal t cell expressed and secreted ) , whereas t. denticola alone or in combination with p. gingivalis resulted in a significant decrease in rantes levels . rantes degradation by mono- or mixed infections with red - complex bacteria resulted in massive proteolytic degradation of rantes by t. denticola . the ability of periodontopathogens to degrade cytokines and chemokines in vivo may play an important role in their pathogenicity by disrupting the host inflammatory response .   recently , polymicrobial infection with p. gingivalis , t. denticola , and t. forsythia in a rat model of periodontal disease was investigated . a 1  10  cell mixture ( 1  ml ) containing an equal number of cells of each bacterium was injected into the rat oral cavity . pcr of the bacterial dna in the oral sample revealed that polymicrobial infection enhanced colonization by p. gingivalis , t. denticola , and t. forsythia compared to their levels in monomicrobial infections . oral infection of rats with a polymicrobial consortium comprising p. gingivalis , t. denticola , and t. forsythia induced significant increases in maxillary and mandibular alveolar bone resorption compared to those resulting from any of the monomicrobial infections ( p < 0.001 ) . the levels of serum igg against all of the bacteria in the polymicrobial infection were lower than the respective levels induced by monomicrobial infections . this suggested that the host response to the polymicrobial infection was altered , resulting in enhanced evasion of protective immune responses by the bacterial consortium .", "most therapeutic modalities for treatment of periodontitis aim to remove pathogens and kill all bacteria in the periodontal pocket . understanding the effect of interbacterial interactions on the pathogenesis of periodontitis may facilitate development of novel treatment modalities , such as the inhibition of adherence using antagonists , passive immunization , replacement therapy , regulation of levels of nonpathogenic bacteria to modulate virulence , probiotics , and interference with signaling mechanisms . the disruption of the harmonic relationship between the host and commensal microorganisms is considered to be an important factor for the development of oral pathologies . , we discuss the significance of interbacterial antagonism for maintenance and recovery of a healthy oral microbiota . moreover , antagonistic bacteria have the potential for probiotic action , which may protect against periodontitis .   staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus mutans isolates inhibited the growth of t. denticola and p. gingivalis . s. aureus strains produced a bacteriocin - like inhibitory substance , whereas the inhibitory effect of s. mutans was related to the production of lactic acid . s. sanguinis , s. cristatus , s. salivarius , s. mitis , actinomyces naeslundii , and haemophilus parainfluenzae inhibited the adhesion of standard p. gingivalis strains in vitro . s. cristatus arginine deiminase repressed fima , a major subunit protein of the long fimbriae , and inhibited biofilm formation by p. gingivalis . an analysis of the ability of clinical isolates from healthy and periodontitis patients to inhibit the growth of periodontopathogens showed that the number of isolates from healthy volunteers that inhibited either p. gingivalis or p. intermedia was significantly higher than that from diseased patients . these isolated growth - inhibiting strains included some viridans group streptococcus , actinomyces , and bifidobacterium strains . compared to these isolates , commercial dietary probiotics showed stronger inhibition of the periodontopathogens . in a study that compared oral lactobacilli from patients with chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects , the most prevalent species in healthy subjects were lactobacillus gasseri and l. fermentum , whereas the most prevalent species in subjects with periodontitis was l. plantarum . furthermore , the greatest antimicrobial activities were associated with l. paracasei , l. plantarum , l. rhamnosus , and l. salivarius . the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics confirm that these four organisms exhibit both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance to environmental stress .   some oral bacteria possess the potential for antagonism towards periodontopathogens , which highlights the therapeutic potential of stimulation of oral health using beneficial effector strains . most evidence indicates that probiotics in the gut do not populate the gastrointestinal microbiota permanently , and they disappear from feces soon after cessation of probiotic ingestion . probiotic bacteria used in the human oral cavity include bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species , and most of them were not derived from the oral cavity . l. reuteri and l. salivarius colonized the oral cavity of patients ; however , the study was of only 2 weeks duration [ 5759 ] . another study reported that oral administration of l. salivarius decreased the proportion of l. salivarius in saliva during the 4- and 8-week intervention periods , although the sampling and analysis methods differed . organisms antagonistic to periodontopathogens that are derived from typical representatives of the oral microbiota and have probiotic potential may overcome the weaknesses associated with exogenous probiotic bacteria ."], "summary": "the red complex , which includes porphyromonas gingivalis , treponema denticola , and tannerella forsythia ( formerly bacteroides forsythus ) , are recognized as the most important pathogens in adult periodontal disease . these bacteria are usually found together in periodontal pockets , suggesting that they may cause destruction of the periodontal tissue in a cooperative manner . this article discusses the interspecies pathogenic interactions within the red complex .", "ranking": [0, 3, 4, 2, 1]}
{"id": "PMC3675283", "section_names": ["INTRODUCTION", "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "RESULTS", "DISCUSSION", "CONCLUSION"], "document": ["recently , esthetic requirements in dental restorative treatment are on the rise . for this reason , recent attention - drawing material is zirconia which is a biocompatible material with stable structure . flexural strength and fracture toughness of zirconia reaches up to 900 - 1200 mpa and 9 - 10 mpam1,2 respectively , and zirconia has been proven to be much more excellent in its strength than that of glass infiltrated full porcelain which is widely used in esthetic restoration.1,2 material properties of zirconia like these show that zirconia can be substituted for metal and can be surely used even in long span fixed prosthesis.3,4 cad / cam system which was introduced to dentistry in 1980 's has brought cost and time reduction in fabricating restoration by using computer for inputting , designing and cutting the form of restoration . in order to overcome disadvantage of previous method of framework fabrication in which post - sintered zirconia block was cut , pre - sintered zirconia block is being used recently . by doing so , fabrication time and consumption of bur this method , however , has disadvantage in that approximately 15 - 30% shrinkage occur in the procedure of sintering and hardening the cut block using cam unit for the increased density of zirconia block.5 when using partially sintered block , therefore , it is more important to calculate shrinkage rate accurately than any other things in order to compensate shrinkage which inevitably occurs in sintering process , and also to gain precise product when using partially sintered block . it is considered that internal and marginal fit plays a key role in longevity of prosthesis . in previous studies , many authors said that 120 m or less marginal gap of prosthesis was clinically acceptable.6,7 according to a study on fit of zirconia framework which was used in all ceramic crown , marginal gap was reported to be 64 - 83 m,8,9 and in another study on clinical fit of 3-unit fixed prosthesis , zirconia prosthesis ( lava , 3 m espe , seefeld , germany ) for which cad / cam was used reportedly showed 80 m of mean marginal gap.10 the reason why marginal fit is important is because increased marginal leakage may cause secondary caries , periodontitis , pulpitis etc . and there was a report from one previous study saying the thicker the cement became due to a large internal gap , the weaker the porcelain became.11 this effect is shown also in zirconia . excessive thickness of cement increases radial crack12,13 and causes fracture of veneering porcelain.14 fracture of veneering porcelain is considered to be one of the greatest reasons for removing zirconia restoration.15 - 18 as opposed to this , too small internal gap may cause unstable seating of prosthesis.19 abduo et al.20 said that factors which influenced fit of prosthesis were fabrication system of zirconia , veneering , configuration , span length of zirconia etc . although the use of zirconia has increased and are being used more in multiple areas where the tooth are missing , studies on fit of zirconia fixed partial denture until the now have been limited to 3-unit fixed partial denture with nearly linear form ; there has been few study on internal or marginal fit of 4 or more unit fixed partial denture with curved form.20 particularly , there was no study in which both internal and marginal fit depending on the span length were simultaneously evaluated . the purpose of this study , therefore , was to measure marginal and internal fit of single , 4-unit , 6-unit zirconia fixed partial denture core which had been fabricated using cad / cam system by using replica technique and to evaluate the effect that span length on fit while evaluating whether measured marginal gap was in clinically acceptable range or not .", "experimental groups were divided into single , 4-unit and 6-unit groups , and preparation of each abutment teeth were done in order to make single crown of upper right central incisor , 4-unit fixed partial denture with abutment teeth of upper right and left lateral incisor where upper right and left central incisors were missing , and 6-unit fixed partial denture with abutment teeth of upper right and left canines where upper right , left central and lateral incisors were missing ( table 1 ) . for tooth preparation , surveyor and diamond bur were used , and total taper of each abutment teeth was intended to be 6. preparation amount was 2 mm on incisal part and 1 mm on axial wall , and 1 mm width deep chamfer margin was formed . in order to prevent possible wear or fracture of master models from repetitive impression taking procedure , dentiformmodels ( nissin dental prod . japan ) where abutment preparation were done were duplicated and titanium master model weremade ( addtech co. , seoul , korea ) ( fig . 1 ) . impression of titanium model were taken with conventional method by using addition silicone impression material ( imprint ii , 3 m espe , st . paul , mn , usa ) and readymade tray , and total 30 improved stone ( fuji rock ep , gc corp , tokyo , japan ) models including 10 models per each group were made ( fig . 2 ) . after scanning of the manufactured plaster model using cad / cam system , partially sintered zirconia blocks were cut and sintered , and finally zirconia cores were fabricated ( fig . 3 ) . when fabricating cores , cad / cam system of orapix ( seoul , korea ) and zirconia blocks were used . thickness of core and cement space were set as 0.6 mm and 40 m respectively . internal adjustment was not done so that fit of core that was fabricated by only cad / cam could be merely evaluated . after core fabrication was done , whether there were remnants inside , defects or distortions were checked and then cleaned with high pressure steaming . after positioning fabricated zirconia cores on each models , jigs for positioning the zirconia coreon the model were made using pattern resin ( gc dental , japan ) so that zirconia could always be positioned at a same spot on the models . after filling fit checking material ( fit checker , gc dental , japan ) in inner surface of core after that , pre - made resin jig was positioned above the core . while maintaining adapted position by hand pressure , it was place in universal testing machine ( shimadzu corporation , kyoto , japan ) immediately . universal testing machine was set to measurement mode , and its compressive force was limited to 40 n , and regular force ( 40 n ) was maintained for 5 minutes until fit checker was completely hardened . when doing so , the silicon film of fit checker has to be fully attached to silicone core . filling inner surface of silicone film of core with regular bodied addition silicone impression material ( aquasillv , densply caulk , usa ) and hardening the filled material increase strength andalso enables gaining of stable film layer . each 8 measuring points were established for labial and mesio - distal side respectively ( fig . 4 ) , and cutting was done right in the center of the model labialy and mesio - distally ( fig . 5 ) . by using measuring microscope ( axio , carl zeiss , rochester , ny , usa ) and i - solution ( imt i - solution inc . , vancouver , bc , canada ) , thickness of fit checker was measured at 16 measuring points of each abutment teeth ( fig . mean value was documented after 3 times measured by 2 experimenter for each measuring points . mean value and standard deviation value were calculated by adding measurement values of right and left abutment teeth of each group which was divided into bucco - lingual and mesio - distal . whether there was statistically significant difference between groups which were divided into bucco - lingual and mesio - distal or not was analyzed by multivariate analysis . after that , if there had been statistically significant difference , post - hoc test was done using dunnett t3 test per each measuring points . in all analyses ,", "twenty seven specimens including nine single , nine 4-unit and nine 6-unit were used in fit measurement . there existed 1 specimen per each group of which measurement could not be done because fracture had occurred in the process of applying force after putting fit checker inside the core and placing it on abutment . statistical analysis was performed by adding each measurement values of right and left abutment teeth of each group . by doing so , number of specimen of each group became nine single , and eighteen 4-unit and eighteen 6-unit . mean value and standard deviation value of gap at bucco - lingual measuring point were calculated ( table 2 ) . as a result of multivariate analysis , statistically significant difference was shown at point 2 , 4 , 7 and 8 . in order to investigate between which groups of point 2 , 4 , 7 and 8 showed the difference , post - hoc test was performed using dunnett t3 test ( table 3 ) . mean value and standard deviation value of gap at mesio - distal measuring point were calculated ( table 4 ) . the result of anova showed statistically significant differences at point 2 , 4 , 7 and 8 by span length factor . in order to investigate between which groups of point 2 , 4 , 7 and 8 showed the difference , post - hoc test was performed using dunnett t3 test ( table 5 ) . as a result of measuring point analysis which showed statistically significant difference , measurement value increased from single , 4-unit and 6-unit in order in point 2 , 4 , 7 when bucco - lingual analysis was done . but in point 8 , the gap of 4-unit group was measured to be the smallest . in the result of mesio - distal analysis , measurement value increased from single , 6-unit and 4-unit in order in point b ,", "zirconia is an esthetical and biocompatible material , and its physical property is so strong that it can be used for fixed prosthesis of posterior region . because of its property like this , it has become one of the most noteworthy materials in esthetic prosthetics . in order for zirconia to be used as prosthetic restoration material that can last long and function stably , not only its physical property but also the fit of prosthesis made by it should meet clinical requirements . in fabrication of zirconia prosthesis using cad / cam , completely sintered , this method has disadvantages in time and cost although fit could be more excellent than when partially sintered block which is used in most fabrication system is used . on the other hand , if partially sintered block is used , it will be better off when it comes to time and cost factor . however , if cutting is not done by accurate calculation due to shrinkage in sintering process , level of fit will decrease significantly . according to previous studies , 120 m or smaller marginal gap is clinically accepted.6,7 in the studies on fit of single or 3-unit fixed partial denture zirconia prosthesis fabricated by cad / cam system , marginal gap showed approximately 64 - 83 m as a result.8,9 these show that zirconia can be used for fixed partial denture restoration adequately . however , these were the studies which had been mostly proceeded on linear type fixed prosthesis which was shorter than 3-unit . study on prosthesis of which span is longer than this has not been done.10 in this study , therefore , whether fit of zirconia prosthesis is influenced by the span length was investigated using anterior teeth model . as methods for measuring marginal or inner fit , a method of direct inspection , a method of inspection after cutting , a method of evaluation by impression taking , a method of evaluation using explorer and so on although a method of inspection after cutting may be the most accurate way , there is a shortcoming in that more specimens have to be made for the increase of the number of measurement . therefore , replica technique where measurement of fit of various parts could be done easily with only small number of specimens was used in this study . this method had been considered to have low accuracy in the past,21 but it became known to be reliable compared to other methods for measuring fit by rahme et al.22 and laurent et al.23 study . specimens for measurement were made using replica technique , and thickness of fit checker was measured at 16 measuring points which were designated per each abutment teeth , and 2 experimenters recorded mean value after 3 times of measurements so that error could be minimized . as a result of measurement , overall fit was acceptable ( small gap ) in marginal and axial wall area , but connection part between margin and axial wall and incisal part showed relatively large gap . because it was considered that whether it was either right abutment tooth or left abutment tooth could not be a variable for analysis , mean value and standard deviation were calculated by adding measurement values of right and left abutment teeth together for statistical analysis in 4-unit and 6-unit group . in the case of this study , multivariate analysis was used because it was considered that gap of inner surface and margin could not be independent to each other although independent variable was a span length . as a result of statistical analysis of bucco - lingual ( 1 - 8 ) and mesio - distal ( a - h ) measuring points , there were statistically significant differences at point 2 , 4 , 7 , 8 and b , d , e , f , g among the groups . from this result , the fact that span length influenced fit of zirconia core was confirmed . as a result of analysis of each measuring points which showed statistically significant difference , measurement value increased from single , 4-unit to 6-unit in order at 2 , 4 , 7 point , but measurement value of 4-unit group came out smallest at 8 point . as opposed to this , 4-unit group showed the largest value at b , f , g point as a result of mesio - distal analysis . this is considered to be because of small number of specimens that were used in the experiment and measurement error as well . also , there were more points which showed significant difference inmesio - distal part than inbucco - lingual part . it is guessed that the reason for this is because more error occurred in the process of shrinkage at mesio - distal part since the form of zirconia core was not bucco - lingually but mesio - distally long . although there was not enough number of specimen for more accurate multivariate analysis in statistical analysis process , kruskal - wallis test was performed to compensate it , and same result as that of multivariate analysis was gained . it can be said that the meaning of this study lays in the fact that evaluation of effect of span length on fit in fabrication of prosthesis . however , the number of specimen was not enough for securing statistical significance which is the weak point of this study . also , if fit of prosthesis had been measured after veneering , the study would have been closer to clinical setting . in some specimens , measurement was difficult because boundary of silicone film and impression material was blurred . for more accurate measurement , this method needs improvement . also , in case of fixed partial denture , fit is not something that is independent to one another . therefore , it is considered that comparative evaluation on volume will be more necessary than to just observe some part after cutting it . also , if analysis such as micro ct24 and so on is additionally used , appearance of transformation or distortion in shrinkage process will be able to be evaluated . the further studies to investigate the difference of fit among the different manufacturers with increased number of specimens will be necessary . and", "change of the span length influenced marginal fit and internal fit to some degree . in single or 4-unit fixed partial denture group , mean value of marginal fit was within clinically acceptable range . in 6-unit group , however , some margins showed values that were out of clinically acceptable range . therefore , it was analyzed that the increase of the span length could possibly decrease fit between zirconia core and abutment tooth when fixed partial denture was 6-unit or longer ."], "summary": "purposethe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the span length on the fit of zirconia framework fabricated using cad / cam system.materials and methodsabutments for single , 4-unit and 6-unit fixed partial prostheses were fabricated . ten zirconia frameworks were fabricated for each group . the marginal and internal gap were presented by means of replica technique and measured by measuring microscope ( axio , carl zeiss , rochester , ny ) and software ( i -

Conclusions"], "document": ["understanding the changes occurring within an aging immune system is essential if public health authorities are to be equipped to deal with an aging population . specifically , knowledge of altered immune responses to infectious agents is required if rational clinical interventions are to be tailored to these aging individuals . aging is a continuous and slow process that compromises the normal functioning of various organs and systems . as the population ages , there is growing interest in understanding host - parasite interaction and eventual prevention of chronic parasitic diseases , including cysticercosis , in elderly individuals . cysticercosis is emerging as a serious public health problem in many poor countries in latin america , africa and asia . although theoretically easy to control , and declared eradicable , cysticercosis remains neglected in most endemic countries . this parasitosis may be asymptomatic or it may cause a variety of clinical manifestations depending on the number , location , and stage of cysticercus lesions . pleomorphic disease is a result of the presence of the parasite itself ( cysticerci ) , of the inflammatory process that surrounds the larvae , and of residual fibrosis and calcification [ 46 ] . it is likely that the combination of several factors is responsible for such differences , one of which may be gender - related . the relevance of gender in host susceptibility has been explored in cysticercosis infection . in experimental murine taenia crassiceps cysticercosis , female mice were found to be more susceptible than males in different syngeneic and congenic strains of mice . the finding that gonadectomy equalized susceptibility between sexes , by reducing parasite loads in females and increasing it in males , first clearly indicated the relevance of sexual hormones . the cysticercus contains a large number of antigens that can elicit a host immune inflammatory reaction . the inflammatory cellular infiltrate , if present , may be discrete with lymphocytes and eosinophils in the initial stage , or it may be a more intense lymphocyte infiltrate with giant multinucleated foamy macrophages in the necrotic stage . recent evidence suggests that immunosenescence associated to an immunological alteration caused by cysticercosis leads to a favorable condition for neoplasia development in elderly individuals attacked by the parasitosis . moreover , it is likely that the patients continue to be infected with cysticercosis as they age . the aim of this study was to quantify the inflammatory infiltrate in the heart and in the encephalon of the elderly with cysticercosis . our hypothesis is that it is possible to quantify the infiltrated inflammatory among male and female elderly patients , due to the fact that those individuals are undergoing immunosenescence .", "this research paper was approved by triangulo mineiro federal university research ethics committee under protocol no . 486 . as this research regards autopsy material , the only risk was the loss of confidentiality . however , as a precautionary measure , the cases were identified by letters and numbers . also , consent for the autopsy was given in writing by the next of kin after the death of the patient . then the document was filed in the general hospital and the general pathology discipline records . a retrospective transversal study of 3639 autopsies of adults collected at the general hospital of triangulo mineiro federal university , located in uberaba , mg , brazil , from 1970 to 2008 , was carried out . diagnosis of cysticercosis was made through histological demonstration or through direct visualization of the cysticercus , meeting the diagnostic criteria proposed by other authors , in 75 autopsies , 55 non - elderly , and 20 elderly patients . information regarding age , gender , body weight , height , heart weight , brain weight , and the number , location , and evolutionary stage of the cysticercus was registered . in order to analyze the heart and brain inflammatory infiltration , we obtained 33 ( 13 elderly and 20 non - elderly ) samples of heart and brain of patients with cysticercosis the 7 heart samples , amongst which 3 belonged to elderly patients and 4 belonged to non - elderly patients with cardiac cysticercosis , and 26 brains with neurocysticercosis , 10 of which belonged to elderly patients and 16 to non - elderly patients . the other organs were not found at the anatomical specimens ' archives from the department of general pathology . the brain and heart samples affected by cysticercosis were fixed in formaldehyde 10% and subjected to routine histological processing so as to obtain 4  m thick sections , stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( he ) , for general morphological analysis and for quantification of the inflammatory cell infiltrate . a video camera coupled to a standard light microscope and an interactive image analysis system ( ks 300 carl zeiss ) were used . we analyzed ten fields per quadrant ; that is , 40 measurements were carried out in each slide . the he - stained slides were examined using a standard light microscope with a 20x objective and 800x magnification range . the digital image showed the field where the number of inflammatory cells was counted in absolute value . quantification was carried out by the observer 's identification of such cells and through the staining performed by point - counting method . the variables were tested in order to verify the type of distribution using the kolmogorov - smirnov test and variance analysis . student 's t - test ( t ) or mann - whitney ( t ) was used in the comparison of two groups , and anova ( f ) or kruskal - wallis ( h ) for comparison between three or more groups , followed by bonferroni or dunn test when necessary . correlations between two variables were analyzed by pearson 's or spearman correlation coefficient ( r ) .", "amongst the patients with cysticercosis , the average age of the non - elderly was 47.3 years , ranging from 23 to 58 years old , whereas the elderly had an average age of 66.7 years , ranging from 61 to 75 years old . male and caucasian patients predominated in both groups , and analysis of nutritional status showed that the non - elderly had an average body mass index ( bmi ) of 21.2  4.4  kg / m and that the elderly with cysticercosis had an average bmi of 20.2  9.9  kg / m . heart weight and brain weight of the non - elderly were found to be higher than those of the elderly with cysticercosis , and both elderly and non - elderly male patients had heart weight and brain weight higher than female patients ( table 1 ) . it was possible to ascertain the evolutionary stage of the parasite in 8 cysticerci of elderly individuals , among whom 4 ( 50% ) were vesicular stage , 2 ( 25% ) colloidal vesicular stage , 1 ( 12.5% ) granular nodular stage and ( 12.5% ) nodular calcified stage . amongst the non - elderly , 4 ( 21.1% ) cysticerci were in the first evolutionary stage , 5 ( 26.3% ) colloidal vesicular stage , 4 ( 21.1% ) granular nodular stage , and 6 ( 31.5% ) nodular calcified stage . the elderly had an average of 3.1  2.5 cysticerci , whereas the non - elderly had 2.7  3.8 parasites . at all stages was observed some degree of inflammatory reaction around the cysticercus , its intensity decreased with the succession of evolutionary stages . the colloidal vesicular stage showed the highest inflammatory infiltrate , followed by the granular nodular stage in elderly and non - elderly groups ( table 2 ) . analysis of the cardiac inflammatory infiltrate indicated that the non - elderly had significantly more inflammation than the elderly patients with cardiac cysticercosis ( figures 1 and 2 ) . in the non - elderly group , although men had more cardiac inflammation than women , this difference was not significant . nonetheless , elderly females had significantly more inflammation than the elderly males ( table 3 ) . encephalic inflammation was more acute amongst the non - elderly when compared to the elderly with neurocysticercosis ( figure 1 ) . in the elderly group , female patients had significantly more encephalic inflammation than male patients . when contrasting both genders of the non - elderly group , male patients had more inflammation , yet without any significant difference ( table 3 ) . a positive and not significant correlation between encephalic inflammation and cardiac inflammation was found ( r = 0 , 032 ; p = 0,247 ) , as well as a negative correlation between age and encephalic inflammation ( r = 0,518 ; p = 0,03 ) or cardiac inflammation ( r = 0,385 ; p = 0,186 ) in male group .", "population aging , which has increased since the last decades of the twentieth century , has changed the demographic and epidemiological profiles of countries such as brazil . the increase in chronic degenerative diseases , which have replaced infectious and parasitic diseases , has demanded that more emphasis be placed on the prevention and treatment of such diseases , which leads to the need to know about their pathological changes during the aging process . in the present study , heart and brain weights of non - elderly patients with cysticercosis were found to be higher than those of the elderly group with the parasitosis , without significant difference . male patients had higher heart weight and brain weight , regardless of age . according to the literature , heart weight ranges from 347  g to 487  g in individuals over 60 years old , and brain weight ranges from 1105  g to 1264  g [ 1416 ] . in an experimental study , not only did adult male rats have higher heart weight , but they also had larger myocardiocytes compared with female rats , which might be related to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease in males . studies involving patients without encephalopathy showed that the brain weight and the volume and density of the cell undergo a steady decrease with age , whereby male patients have higher brain weight than female patients . analysis of the inflammatory infiltrate showed that the non - elderly had significantly more cardiac and encephalic inflammation than the elderly , and that such inflammatory infiltrate decreases with age and depends upon the evolutionary stage of the cysticercus . the inflammatory process caused by cysticerci in the cerebral parenchyma and in the myocardium comprises mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells , mainly eosinophils , macrophages , and lymphocytes [ 19 , 20 ] . during the aging process , changes in the expression of functionally important cell receptors , reduction in the population of polymorphonuclear cells , and reduction in the capability of producing antibodies are verified , and these factors may lead to immune dysfunction [ 21 , 22 ] . therefore , our data might be related to changes in the immune response , mainly in t cells , which were found in the elderly individuals . the vesicular stage was more prevalent among the elderly and nodular calcified stage among non - elderly , and colloidal vesicular stage showed higher inflammatory infiltrate in both groups . researches show that a more intense inflammation with lymphocyte and macrophage infiltrate can be found around the cysticercus in colloidal vesicular stage [ 10 , 24 , 25 ] . with cysts degenerates , the inflammatory reaction tends to decrease in the granular nodular stage , denoting continuity in the host reaction against the parasite remnants without , however , having an association with the type or intensity of the inflammatory response [ 24 , 26 ] .   the duration of each of the progressive stages in the natural history of cysticercosis has not been established because there are considerable differences between individuals , particularly in relation to the intensity of the endogenous immune response . whereas the parasite typically dies few years after infection stimulating a vigorous inflammatory response , probably the acquisition of the parasite occurred most recently in the elderly than in non - elderly patients , or the elderly , due to changes in the immune system with aging , preserve the cysticercus in the initial phase for a long time . there are also some indications that , in human neurocysticercosis caused by t. solium , women show a more intense inflammatory profile in the cerebrospinal fluid than men do and , likewise , are more prone to develop a severe and generalized encephalitic process . these observations are in accordance with previous studies in which gender has been associated with the intensity of the inflammatory response against the parasite , possibly promoted by the female sex - steroid levels [ 7 , 9 , 2832 ] . therefore , our data showed that even during senescence , when a decrease in the levels of female sex steroids is noticed , women have a more intense immune response towards cysticercosis in comparison with men . studies have showed that the presence of multiple parasites is more common in older individuals . encephalic inflammation and cardiac inflammation were more commonly found in the analyzed material , and most of the individuals had cysticercosis in more than one location . it was found that multiple cysticerci lesions and multiple vesicular cysts were more frequently observed in the elderly without an increase in severity of the clinical symptoms . this observation could indicate that susceptibility to become infected increases with age , whereas susceptibility to follow a pathogenic course of the infection decreases . the reverse effect of age upon susceptibility to infection and to resistance against severe disease has been found in other parasite infections such as schistosomiasis [ 33 , 34 ] and it suggests that susceptibility and pathogenicity involve distinct physiological pathways that are independently regulated . this study presents important findings on the influence of gender on cardiac and encephalic inflammation in the elderly with cysticercosis , although it has some limitations , such as small number of samples for analyses , particularly of the gender influence , loss of many biopsies and retrospective design . future researches are needed to determine the mechanisms of the differences related to gender and immunosenescence associated to immunological alteration caused by cysticercosis .", "in this study , we showed that the non - elderly had significantly more cardiac and encephalic inflammation than the elderly , and that such inflammatory infiltrate decreases with age and depends upon the evolutionary stage of the cysticercus . furthermore , there are differences , concerning gender , in the intensity of the inflammatory response due to cysticerci in the heart and brain parenchyma during senescence . even during this period , women continue to have a more intense response to the parasitosis ."], "summary": "background . the present study explores the influence of the host 's age and gender upon the inflammatory infiltrate . we aimed to quantify the inflammatory infiltrate caused by cysticercosis , which is related to aging , in the heart and in the encephalon . methods . 75 autopsy protocols with cysticercosis diagnosis from department of pathology at a university hospital from 1970 to 2008 were reviewed . two groups were formed : elderly with cysticercosis and nonelderly with cysticercosis . we used ks-300 ( kontron -

although most of these patients go on to develop systemic recurrences within several months . isolated cns recurrence has a worse prognosis than cns disease at the time of diagnosis , suggesting an alternative disease mechanism.41 survival is slightly better in isolated cns recurrence when compared with systemic recurrence , which is the major cause of death in secondary cns lymphoma . unfortunately , the median survival time is  <  6 months when no treatment has been administered . treatment and cns prophylaxis after the discovery of primary lymphoma is an area of active investigation . based on the results of the large retrospective ricover-60 trial , intravenous ( iv ) rituximab is added to cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , and prednisolone ( chop ) therapy because it has shown a decreased incidence of scnsl from 6.9 to 4.1%.24 \n 25 \n 26 \n 39 \n 40 \n 41 \n 42 \n 43 another study found that a regimen of acvbp with iv methotrexate ( mtx ) may also be superior to standard chop therapy.30 the use of iv mtx has been shown to increase survival times for isolated scnsl , especially for parenchymal scnsl.44 despite these results , a strong consensus has yet to be reached on the indications for , efficacy of , and means of cns prophylaxis . this is partially due to the retrospective nature of the studies to date and the variance in treatment regimens among the different studies . also , the histopathology of the primary lymphoma is a determining factor in the efficacy of treatment . for example , although iv rituximab decreased the incidence of scnsl overall , it does not seem to influence the incidence of scnsl in dlbcl ( 30% ) . interestingly , the patient in this case did not meet the criteria for increased risk of developing scnsl , yet he still developed the disease . this leads us to believe that indeed no one factor is a definitive indicator that a patient will progress to a scnsl . the classification of mediastinal dlbcl may have elevated the patient 's risk of progression to scnsl ; however , his lack of other indicative risk factors made this an uncommon occurrence in an already uncommon condition . despite the unusual presentation in this case ( panhypopituitarism ) , the patient did have an isolated cns relapse within 6 months , and the mental status change resolved in response to mtx treatment .", "isolated scnsl is a rare disease in which standardized treatment guidelines have yet to be developed . this case is one particular example where a patient designated as low risk for developing scnsl did progress to an isolated occurrence of the disease . additionally , although treatment extended the patient 's survival time and resolved the change in mental status , the disease continued to progress and the patient succumbed to his illness ."], "summary": "isolated secondary central nervous system lymphoma ( scnsl ) relapse is a rare disease . consequently , standardized treatment regimens have yet to be developed . we present an interesting case of isolated scnsl presenting with altered mental status and panhypopituitarism in a patient at low risk of developing the disease . we also review the related literature and discuss newer , more aggressive treatments for primary cns lymphoma and scnsl .", "ranking": [0, 1, 3, 4, 2]}

but in both these cases , the difficulty of copying is only technological , not fundamental . however , when elementary quantum systems such as polarized photons are used as the transmission medium , routine copying of messages is no longer possible even in principle . in particular , there are ways of encoding messages so that they can be copied reliably only with the help of certain key information used in forming the message . quantum coding was first described in  [ w ] , along with two applications : making money that is in principle impossible to counterfeit , and multiplexing two or three messages in such a way that only one can be read . more recently [ bbbw ] , quantum coding has been used in conjunction with public key cryptographic techniques to yield several schemes for unforgeable subway tokens . here we show that quantum coding considerably enhances the usefulness of another standard cryptographic device , the one - time pad . mathematically , a polarized photon acts like a two - bit read - once memory one of whose bits ( k ) serves as a read key for the other ( m ) . querying the memory with the correct k yields the correct value of m. querying with the wrong k yields a random bit instead of m , and in either case querying resets the memory so that subsequent queries yield no new information . even after a query , it is generally impossible to infer the initial state of either bit , because the memory gives no indication of whether its response was the correct response to the correct key or a random response to the wrong key . because it represents the behavior of an elementary quantum system , this kind of restricted - access memory should be thought of as a natural information - processing primitive , not as a complex technological device that could probably be circumvented in principle . ordinarily , when one thinks of a technological restricted - access memory , one has in mind an information - storage device . photons can also be stored ( e.g.  between mirrors , or in a closed optical fiber ) , but they can not in practice be stored for very long , and their natural application is in the transmission of information . we thus have a situation in which restricted - access memory , as a storage device , is possible in practice but not in principle via conventional technology , and in principle but not in practice via storage of polarized photons . on the other hand , restricted - access transmissions , which can be read or copied only with the help of a key , are possible both in principle and in practice using polarized photons .", "polarized light can be produced by sending ordinary light through a polarizing apparatus such as a polaroid filter or nicol prism . a  beam of polarized light is characterized by its polarization axis , which is determined by the orientation of the polarizing apparatus in which the beam originates . although polarization is a continuous variable , and in principle can be measured as accurately as desired by passing the polarized beam through a second polarizing apparatus , the uncertainty principle forbids measurements on any single photon from revealing more than one bit about the beam s polarization . in particular , if a beam with polarization axis  is sent into a polarizer oriented at angle  , the individual photons behave dichotomously and probabilistically , being transmitted with probability \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal } \n\t\t\t\t \\usepackage{amsmath } \n\t\t\t\t \\usepackage{wasysym } \n\t\t\t\t \\usepackage{amsfonts } \n\t\t\t\t \\usepackage{amssymb } \n\t\t\t\t \\usepackage{amsbsy } \n\t\t\t\t \\usepackage{mathrsfs } \n\t\t\t\t \\usepackage{upgreek } \n\t\t\t\t \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt } \n\t\t\t\t \\begin{document}$$\\cos ^2(\\alpha - \\beta ) $ $ \\end{document } and absorbed with the complementary probability \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal } \n\t\t\t\t \\usepackage{amsmath } \n\t\t\t\t \\usepackage{wasysym } \n\t\t\t\t \\usepackage{amsfonts } \n\t\t\t\t \\usepackage{amssymb } \n\t\t\t\t \\usepackage{amsbsy } \n\t\t\t\t \\usepackage{mathrsfs } \n\t\t\t\t \\usepackage{upgreek } \n\t\t\t\t \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt } \n\t\t\t\t \\begin{document}$$\\sin ^2 ( \\alpha - \\beta ) $ $ \\end{document}. the photons behave deterministically only when the two axes are parallel ( certain transmission ) or perpendicular ( certain absorption ) . if the two axes are not perpendicular , so that some photons are transmitted , one might hope to learn additional information about  by measuring the transmitted photons again with a polarizer oriented at some third angle ; but this is to no avail , because the transmitted photons , in passing through the  polarizer , emerge with exactly  polarization , having lost all memory of their previous polarization . any other elementary two - state quantum system , such as a spin-1/2 atom , behaves similarly dichotomously and probabilistically . another way one might hope to learn more than one bit from a single photon would be not to measure it directly , but rather somehow amplify it into a clone of identically polarized photons , then perform measurements on these ;

the eavesdrops become so frequent before then that they are forced to use up key information faster than they can replace it , in which case they will ( with high probability ) be able to cease communication before any of their transmissions have become uniquely decodable by the eavesdropper . because the replacement keys are truly random , rather than being pseudorandomly computed from an original seed , the security of the scheme would not be reduced by allowing the eavesdropper unlimited computing power . the scheme does incorporate one technologically unrealistic assumption , viz . that photons can be detected with perfect efficiency ( cf .  section  5 , where this assumption is not made ) . the ability to send many messages without loss of security ( when no eavesdropping is detected ) follows from the exponential decline of the probability of escaping detection with the number of distinct bit positions ever subjected to eavesdropping , whether these bit positions are listened to all at once , or a few at a time over the course of many transmissions . for this reason , a quantum channel could even be used to safely send arbitrarily many copies of the same strongly coded transmission , without the eavesdropper being able to forge it accurately , provided the copies were sent one at a time , each only on confirmation that the preceding one had apparently not been listened to . by contrast , if many identical transmissions were sent all at once , the eavesdropper could intercept them all , reliably determine each polarization by multiple measurements , and then escape detection by forging many trains of photons with the now known sequence of polarizations . in order to be sure that no key is reused after a detected eavesdropping , the two communicating parties must alternate strictly in their use of each key . otherwise the eavesdropper could , for example , intercept and absorb a message from a without forwarding it to b and then wait for b to use the same key on a subsequent message . the effect of absorbing a message is thus the same as that of spoiling it through eavesdropping : neither party reuses the key with which it was sent . if the initial body of shared key information included several keys reserved for first use by a and several for first use by b , the parties could alternate in the use of each key without strictly alternating transmissions . of course if multiple keys were in use , and particularly if some transmissions were being absorbed by the eavesdropper , the communicating parties would have to prefix each quantum transmission by a ( cleartext ) indication of which key it was encoded with , to avoid reading a message with the wrong quantum key and spoiling it . the ability to change keys without serious loss of security depends on using a somewhat diffusive error - detecting code when new key information is transmitted . with the simple non - diffusive code \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal }

even perfectly efficient , photon detector . the volume of safe communication for this scheme is more than linear , but may be less than exponential , in the initial key size . the main modification is to use standard faint pulses of polarized light instead of single photons , each pulse being of such a size that when it is sent into a detector of the given efficiency ( e.g.  30 per cent ) , or split into several fainter pulses ( e.g.  by  a half - silvered mirror or a nicol prism ) and sent into several such detectors , the total number of photons detected obeys a poisson distribution of mean  1 . such a standard faint pulse can easily be produced by filtering a standard bright pulse of polarized light to reduce its intensity by the requisite constant factor . a standard faint pulse of a given polarization resists copying nearly as well as a single photon would . the best strategy for an eavesdropper to copy a faint pulse is to use a half silvered mirror and two nicol prisms to split the incoming pulse into four beams , one of each canonical polarization , and monitor each beam by a photon detector . most of the time , only one of the detectors will register a photon , and the eavesdropper will be no better off than in the single photon case . occasionally two or three detectors will register , yielding more information . only when three detectors register will the pulse s polarization be known unambiguously ( e.g.  if  both diagonal detectors and the vertical detector register , then the pulse must have been vertically polarized ) . the faint pulse works well because the chance of three detectors responding to the same pulse is only about 2 per cent ( for a poisson distribution of mean~1 ) . the other 98 per cent of the time , the eavesdropper does not learn the pulse s polarization unambiguously , and , as with single photons , can not reliably copy  it . even a technologically advanced eavesdropper , with perfectly efficient photon detectors , could not copy faint pulses reliably . for example , if the advanced eavesdropper uses 100 per cent detectors to analyze a pulse intended for 30 per cent detectors , an average of 3.3 photons will be detected per pulse , but the chance that these will appear in three different beams , and thus reveal the pulse s polarization unambiguously , would still be only about 25 per cent . the converse phenomenon , namely statistical failure to detect even one photon when a pulse arrives , requires that the rejection test be made more complicated . even if a transmission is not subjected to eavesdropping , about \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal } \n\t\t\t\t \\usepackage{amsmath } \n\t\t\t\t \\usepackage{wasysym } \n\t\t\t\t \\usepackage{amsfonts } \n\t\t\t\t \\usepackage{amssymb }

} of its light pulses go undetected , due to normal bad luck at the detectors . the rejection test must begin by deciding whether the number of missing light pulses is so great as to raise the suspicion of eavesdropping ( a wise eavesdropper now might not bother to forge replacements for the intercepted pulses , but instead let them remain missing , hoping to pass them off as pulses that

observer error was calculated by re - measuring a random sample of 30 images after an interval of two weeks . both readings were then analysed by paired t - test . in the sagittal view of each ramus , line b was traced tangential to the most prominent point on the posterior border of the ramus and condyle . the angle between lines b and d was measured as ga ( \n fig . 1 \n ) [ \n 9 \n  \n 14 \n ] . gonial angle measurements the scans were divided into the following two ga groups : low angle ( 125 ) and high angle ( > 125 ) [ \n 15 \n ] . to evaluate the shape and position of the canal in coronal views , the distance between the mandibular foramen and the mental foramen was divided into three equal segments and the central cuts ( c1 , c2 , and c3 ) were measured in each segment [ \n 16 \n , \n 17 \n ] . in order to evaluate the canal shape , the superior - inferior and buccolingual diameters of the canal were measured in each slice . to evaluate the buccolingual position of the iac , we measured the distances from the center of the iac to the tangential lines with buccal and lingual borders and to the lowest point of the inferior border ( fig . 2 ) [ \n 17 \n , \n 18 \n ] . in each slice , the distance from the buccal plate to the lingual plate was measured as buccolingual width of the mandibular body [ \n 16 \n , \n 19 \n ] . consequently , in order to define the buccolingual position of the canal in each section , the ratio of the distances between the center of the iac and the buccal and lingual plates to the width of mandible in each section was calculated [ \n 16 \n ] . evaluation of the buccolingual position of the iac by calculating the distance from the center of iac to buccal , lingual , and inferior borders in c1 , c2 , and c3 slices to investigate the total length of iac , the nerve was traced in coronal views . by using the serial measurements option , the total length of the nerve was exactly measured on the sagittal view ( fig . 3 ) . to investigate the canal course on the sagittal view , the nerve path was classified into three types of a , b , and c [ \n 7 \n , \n 17 \n ] . in type a , the canal course had a straight path and was positioned at the same level of the mental foramen . in type b , the canal had a curved path , and in type c , the canal had a forward path and then ran superiorly to reach the mental foramen with a sharp ascent ( fig . to evaluate the canal course on the axial view , the nerve path was traced and classified according to the mental foramen angle . if the canal course made an acute angle with mental foramen (  90 ) , it was defined as type a1 ; otherwise , it was type a2 ( \n\n fig . 5 \n\n ) [ \n 7 \n ] . different types of canal course on the sagittal view type a : the canal course has a straight path at the same level as the mental foramen . type c : the canal has a forward path and then runs up to reach the mental foramen with a sharp ascent . \n the canal course forms an acute angle with the mental foramen on the right side ( a1 type ) and an obtuse angle on the left side ( a2 type ) \n  statistical analysis was done using pasw version 18 ( spss inc . , paired - sample t - test was used for right and left symmetry and calculation of intra - observer agreement between the two readings . pearson s correlation coefficient was used to examine the correlation between the right and left gas . also , independent -

value less than 0.05", "intra - observer reproducibility for all variables was calculated by re - examining 30 scans . the differences between measurements in the first and second readings were not significant ( p=0.160.35 ) . the mean size of ga was 121.87.05 at the right side and 123.86.32 at the left side ( table 1 ) . the results showed that there was a statistically significant correlation in the ga size at both sides ( p=0.000 , r=0.9 ) ; however , a significant difference was noted between them ( p=0.03 ) . the mean  standard deviation of canal length at the right and left sides were 63.035.48 mm and 62.75.51 mm respectively . there was no significant correlation in the mean total canal length in the right and left sides . no statistically significant difference was found between the two sides in terms of canal lengths ( p=0.53 ) . descriptive findings for gas sd : standard deviation after evaluating different sagittal views of the mandibular canal , it was obvious that the most common type of iac course on the sagittal view was type b ( 53.8% ) , followed by type c ( 26.2% ) and type a ( 20% ) . in 70% of the cases , there was no right - left symmetry in the course of the canal on the sagittal view . in addition , it was clear that there was no significant difference between the canal length on the sagittal view , according to canal course ( p=0.59 ) . the samples were grouped according to ga size as high angle ( > 125 ) and low angle ( 125 ) . the gas were smaller than 125 and larger than 125 in 60.7% and 39.3% of samples , respectively . as shown in table 2 , there was a significant relationship between different types of canal courses on the sagittal view and the different ga groups ( p=0.04 ) . therefore , in the low ga group , type b was the more common canal course ( 73.5% ) , while type a was dominant in the high ga group ( 66.7% ) as shown in table 2 . cross tabulation between different canal course types and ga groups on the sagittal view . after evaluating the canal course on the axial view , type a1 was found to be more common ( 73.43% ) than type a2 ( 26.56% ) . according to the data in 10.34% of the cases , the canal type was different at both sides of the mandible . there was no statistically significant relationship between the canal course on the axial view and ga group ( p>0.05 ) . the total canal length was 63.255.4 mm in type a1 and 60.744.7 mm in type a2 . no significant difference existed in the canal length in different types of canal course on the axial view ( p=0.09 ) . evaluation of the iac course on the coronal view in segments c1 , c2 , and c3 showed that on the right side , the canal was closer to the lingual cortex in 86% of the cases in c1 , 100% in c2 , and 90% in c3 ; on the left side the corresponding percentages were 77% , 93% , and 93% of the cases , respectively . according to our results , the canal is positioned lingually throughout its path up to the mental foramen , and then reaches the mental foramen with an acute or an obtuse angle . analysis of the diameters of iac showed that the greatest mean diameter in the superior - inferior and buccolingual dimensions was in c1 and the smallest was in c2 .", "in this study , the gender of the individuals from whom the dried human mandibles were obtained was unknown . many previous studies , including those conducted by de oliveira - santos et al , [ \n 4 \n ] ozturk et al , [ \n 7 \n ] kisser et al , [ \n 8 \n ] liu et al , [ \n 17 \n ] apinhasmit et al , [ \n 20 \n ] angel et al , [ \n 21 \n ] and raustia and salonen [ \n 22 \n ] demonstrated that the position of some anatomic landmarks , such as iac and ga , is not related to gender or age . the mean size of ga in this study was similar to that found in earlier studies \n [ \n 9 \n  \n 13 \n , \n 23 ] \n . the mean ga of the right side was 2 smaller than that in the left side , and this difference was statistically significant . the difference in the mean size of the right and left ga was mentioned in the study by raustia and salonen [ \n 22 \n ] , who stated that the right ga was significantly smaller than the left one . when we analysed the canal shape in the coronal sections , we found that ovoid shape was more common than other shapes . similar to ozturk et al , [ \n 7 \n ] we found that type b was the most common type of canal course on the sagittal view , followed by types c and a. liu et al . [ \n 17 \n ] classified the canal course into four groups ( types 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) using panoramic radiography [ \n 17 \n ] . the shape of the canal in type 1 was similar to type a in the current study and the study carried out by ozturk et al [ \n 7 \n ] . types 2 and 3 , which had a catenary like path , were similar to type b , and type 4 was similar to type c. in the study by liu et al , [ \n 17 \n ] the frequency sum of types 2 and 3 was greater than that of type b , but the frequency of types 1 and 4 was lower than that of types a and c [ \n 17 \n ] . the difference in the prevalence rate of iac course shape in the study by liu et al , [ \n 17 \n ] compared to that observed by ozturk et al , [ \n 7 \n ] and in the current study , may be due to the difference in the type of imaging system and methodology of the studies , and may also be because of the difference in ga [ \n 7 \n , \n 17 \n ] . there was no difference in the total canal length between types a and b ; however , there was a high prevalence ( 66.7% ) of type a in the high - angle group , while type b was dominant ( 73.5% ) in the low - angle group . it is analogous to a situation in which you have two identical ropes ; if you tie the ends of one of the ropes , its path will be bent , whereas the other rope would have a more direct route . there was no difference in the canal length observed in our study and that found by liu et al [ \n 17 \n ] . although the method to obtain the total canal length used by liu et al . was via the tracing cord with a 5 mm arch , while we calculated the length using a specific type of software ; the average length found in both studies was very similar [ \n 17 \n ] . introduced four types of canal course on the axial view , and two of these ( types b and c ) were introduced for the first time [ \n 7 \n ] . similar to liu et al , [ \n 17 \n ] we did not observe these types in the current study , but type a1 was the most commonly found , which is in accordance with the results of ozturk et al [ \n 7 \n ] . in the current study , the iac was located near the lingual plate throughout its path , and then travelled to the buccal plate with a sharp ascent near the mental foramen in the majority of samples . ozturk et al , [ \n 7 \n ] hwang et al , [ \n 19 \n ] som and curtain [ \n 24 \n ] , kim et al , [ \n 25 \n ] and fabian [ \n 26 \n ] also found that the iac is close to the lingual plate , and then runs to the buccal plate near the mental foramen [ \n 7 \n , \n 19 \n , \n 24 \n  \n hwang et al . showed that the iac is close to the lingual plate in the posterior two thirds of the mandible and runs towards the buccal side in the anterior third [ \n 19 \n ] . in our study , the entire canal course was of a1 and a2 types on the axial view , which shows that the canal is in the lingual plate , then in front of the mental foramen , it reaches with a sharp turn to the buccal side [ \n 7 \n , \n 19 \n ] . the canal was located almost 1 cm above the inferior border of the mandible in the second premolar and the first molar region , which appears to provide the greatest superior - inferior dimension for implant placement . showed that the least distance to the lower border was almost 1 cm in the first molar region [ \n 7 \n ] . \n \n according to the results of the current study , the iac has the greatest diameter in the ramus region ( behind the third molar ) and the smallest diameter in the molar region . de oliveira - santos et al . studied canal diameter in the first molar region and their conclusion was in accordance with our findings [ \n 4 \n ] . no other study has calculated iac diameter on the coronal view . in this study we were not able to identify the sex of subjects whose dry mandibles were evaluated ; thus further studies on human mandibles are suggested taking into account the sex and age parameters .", "we concluded that : \n 1-the ga size has a correlation with the iac course . in subjects with small gas but in cases with large gas , the canal is more straight and at the same level as the mental foramen.2-the alveolar crest has the maximum distance from the iac in the second premolar and first molar region . \n  the ga size has a correlation with the iac course . in subjects with small gas but in cases with large gas , the canal is more straight and at the same level as the mental foramen . the alveolar crest has the maximum distance from the iac in the second premolar and first molar region . since the iac is located in the lingual side of the mandible , the safe zone for implant placement and pre - prosthetic surgery is believed to be the buccal side . in addition , the greatest height of bone can be obtained in the second premolar and first molar regions ."], "summary": "objectives : accurate localization of the inferior alveolar canal ( iac ) is extremely important in some dental treatments . anatomical variation of the canal means that it can be difficult to locate . the purpose of this study was to assess the relationship of the gonial angle ( ga ) size and iac position using cone beam computed tomography ( cbct).materials and methods : in this in vitro study , 61 dry adult human hemi - mandibles were used . the cbct scans were taken of all samples and ga was measured on all cbct scans . the samples were divided into two groups of low angle ( 125 ) and high angle ( > 125 ) . the canal dimensions , length and course were evaluated . on the sagittal view , the iac path was classified as type a , b or c. on the axial view , canal course was defined as a1 or a2 according to the mental foramen angle.results:the average ga size was 121.87.05 at the right side and 123.86.32 at the left side . on the sagittal view , there was a significant correlation between the ga size and the canal course ( p=0.04 ) . in the high - angle group , type a was dominant ;

in addition , this recorder includes a pre- and a post - registration of specific events . the r - test evolution is equipped with a new acquisition system favoring the cm5 lead , for excellent results in arrhythmia detection and st shift measurement in case  the user interface on pcs ( rtsoft ) is a model of user friendliness . patient i d is directly sent to and stored in the recorder before it starts , for enhanced data treatment safety . transfer of the recorded data , display of all the events as well as the heart rate curve and event histograms are immediate , allowing a global overview .", "among the patients , 113 were positive to the hutt and 98 were negative . in the positive group , 87 were females and 26 were males ( median age 32  10 yrs ) , while in the negative group 36 were female and 62 were male ( median age 61  10 yrs ) . of the 45 patients who underwent the r - test , five patients were symptomatic for syncope : in three cases there was a registration of complete atrial ventricular block with idio - ventricular rhythm and in two cases there was evidence of major pauses > 3 sec ( fig . r - test : results for hypokinetic arrhythmias . among the patients submitted to the r - test , 19 patients presented with hyper kinetic arrhythmias ( seven patients with ventricular ectopic beats ( fig . 2 ) , five patients with supra - ventricular ectopic beats , four patients with short traits of parossistic supra - ventricular tachycardia and three patients with short traits of atrial fibrillation ) ( figs .", "syncope is a syndrome consisting of a relatively short period of temporary and self - limited loss of consciousness caused by a transient reduction in blood flow to the brain ( most often the result of systemic hypotension ) . syncope comprises part of a subset of clinical conditions in which loss of consciousness is transient ; other conditions in this group , which are not syncope and should be clearly distinguished from syncope , include , for example , seizure disorders , post - traumatic loss of consciousness and cataplexy ( 4 ) . syncope accounts for up to 3% of emergency room visits and 6% of hospital admissions . the framingham study reported that approximately 3% of individuals have a syncopal episode during their lives , although lifetime incidence in the elderly can be as high as 23% . mortality is generally low , but can be up to 33% at 1 yr in patients with a cardiac aetiology ( 5 ) . diagnosis can be made difficult by the intermittent nature of the symptoms , the large number of potential aetiologies , and the lack of a gold standard for clinical investigation . the cost of the investigation of recurrent unexplained syncope can be high , particularly if a relatively benign cause of syncope is overlooked in the process of excluding life - threatening disorders . recurrences are common after the index event , occurring in up to one - third of patients . the search for an underlying cause in patients with syncope often poses a clinical dilemma and even after extensive evaluation , the specific cause can remain unknown in up to 50% of patients . in selected patients , the diagnostic yield can be improved with the use of specialized studies such as head - up tilt testing . head - up tilt testing is a widely accepted tool in the investigation of syncope , particularly where there is no evidence of structural heart disease ( 6 ) . initial evaluation with anamnesis , clinical examination , ecg and bp in clinostatic and orthostatic positions screens the patients suspected of vasovagal syncope and cardiogenic syncope . with an initial evaluation a neurogenic reflex can be suspected with indicative data and when other syncope causes have been excluded , independent from tilt - table test results . patients with positive tilt - table test results and those with a negative response ( indefinite syncope ) have similar characteristics and prognosis , so it seems they belong in the same population . the key remains in selecting the appropriate patients for each investigation , such as by the presence of a prodrome of autonomic symptoms in those with suspected vasovagal syncope ( 7 ) . the absence of a gold standard diagnostic test for vasovagal syncope makes the calculation of the exact specificity and sensitivity of the tilt test difficult , particularly in view of the variable methodology used in the different groups reporting results . the ability of the test to differentiate patients from healthy controls is nonetheless established with specificity generally up to 90% and sensitivity ranging between 32% and 85% with the median closer to the upper number ( 8) . the diagnostic value of the hutt in our group of patients is lower than that in the literature data , possibly due to the low pre - test probability . more rigorous application of the guidelines is necessary to optimize the usefulness of the hutt . recent studies have seen how a correct and specific anamnesis is able to discover with a high diagnostic value patients affected by vasovagal syndrome ( 11 , 13 ) . however , the tilt test has a higher sensibility in young female patients ( 10 ) . sheldon et al ( 11 ) tested the sensitivity and specificity of a preliminary questionnaire about the characteristics of the syncopal episodes and every question was assigned a positive or negative score . the point score correctly classified 90% of patients , diagnosing vasovagal syncope with 89% sensitivity and 91% specificity ; so it is true that a targeted anamnesis could make a diagnosis without the tilt test ( 14 ) . the availability of implantable cardiac loop recorders is a significant advance in helping to clarify the situation in patients with unexplained syncope ( 9 ) . not unsurprisingly , many patients have been found to have a diagnosis different from that presumed from their history and other investigations as evidenced in the issue-2 study . the issue-2 study with the early application of a loop recorder in patients with unexplained syncope demonstrated that in a minority of patients during syncope recurrences there are tachy or bradyarrhythmias , supraventricular or ventricular that are responsible for syncopal episodes . in our study , the r - test was able to detect an arrhythmic cause of syncope in some patients with negative hutt and negative traditional holter ecg monitoring . in our opinion , r - test ecg monitoring for a period of 7 days , with the possibility of repeating the test , could be a preliminary test to determine the use of the implantable loop recorder in patients with unexplained syncope . it is a very simple method that also reduces the management costs of the unexplained syncope population ( 12 ) ."], "summary": "the diagnostic value of the head - up tilt test ( hutt ) in discovering vasovagal syndrome depends on the pre - test probability . an accurate anamnesis and clinical examination screens the patients indicated for the hutt . in patients with unexplained syncope , the r - test is an alternative procedure to discover its cause . in our study , we evaluated the diagnostic significance of the hutt in a group of 211 patients and of the r - test in a subgroup of 45 patients with negative hutt results and with negative traditional holter ecg monitoring ( 24 hr ) .", "ranking": [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]}

stages , cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) , are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide with enormous socio - economic costs . patients with liver cirrhosis are at high risk of deadly hepatic failure and well over 80% of hcc develop on a cirrhotic background . hcc ranks as the fifth most common cancer and , with over 600,000 deaths per annum , it constitutes a major global health problem ( parkin et al . the main aetiologies of clds are chronic hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) and hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) infections , alcohol abuse and , as a result of metabolic syndrome reaching epidemic proportions , an increasing prevalence of non - alcoholic steatohepatitis ( nash ) . liver transplantation is currently the only available therapy for terminal liver failure . with donor organs being limited , preventive measures and prevention aims at eliminating the source of damage . in alcoholic liver disease , this obviously means avoiding further alcohol consumption . the addictive behaviour of patients , however , puts a serious limitation to the efficiency of this prevention strategy . hbv and hcv infections , representing about one third of cld aetiologies , are combatted with virostatic treatments , thus improving patient conditions to some extent . the infections can , however , not be fully abrogated , severely reducing the efficiency of such therapy for this subset of clds . this liver injury triggers a cascade of molecular and cellular reactions geared towards damage limitation , removal or repair of damaged cells , defence against further infection , tissue repair and regeneration . central to the natural response to injury is inflammation induced by a large battery of signalling molecules and executed by a variety of dedicated cells , repair by activated myofibroblasts , which produce the fibrous tissue and parenchymal cell proliferation , both of which are required for filling the holes caused by damage . together , these cellular and molecular events release the enormous natural regenerative potential of the liver . in cld , hepatocyte damage , wound healing and tissue remodelling go awry , resulting in fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis , the platform on which hcc and deadly hepatic failure develop . at the cellular and molecular level , the multistep process of progressive cld is reflected in the complex modulation of intracellular signal transduction circuits , altered cell - cell communications and , more drastically , an altered differentiation state of most liver resident cell types . evidently , the dissection of these pathways is critical for the development of drugs and therapies . as is well recognised , the multifunctional cytokine transforming growth factor ( tgf)- plays a pivotal role in the sequence of events leading to end - stage cld , although the complexity of the underlying aberrant responses that , in the various liver cell types and at the organ level , lead to the drastic changes seen in cld and hcc is not understood in detail ( dooley et al . 2009 ; gianelli et al . 2011 ; matsuzaki 2009 ) . to set the stage , we will first discuss the current knowledge of cellular communication and molecular mechanisms associated with cld initiation and progression and thereafter address the role of tgf- therein .", "the initial event is liver epithelial cell stress , resulting in necrotic and/or apoptotic death . death - mediated signals induce the activation of kupffer and stellate cells , which orchestrate an inflammatory and wound - healing response that might lead to tissue regeneration and repair in an acute setting or to fibrogenesis , cirrhosis and cancer when injury occurs chronically . below , we discuss the diverse phases that trigger disease progression and the process of liver regeneration . cell damage and death clds are characterised by persistent hepatocyte damage and death , induced by either chemical toxicity , metabolic overload resulting in high levels of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) or viral / microbial activity causing metabolic deregulation ( rombouts and marra 2010 ) . in non - alcoholic and alcoholic fatty liver disease , this process is known as steatosis , which is ( highly ) reversible and does not necessarily lead to cell damage . in the case of cholestasis - mediated injury , bile duct epithelial cells ( bdecs ) rather than hepatocytes are the primary target of damage , bile reflux being the major inducer of this type of injury . several modes of cell death have been classified in the damaged liver , including apoptosis and necrosis . hepatocyte death triggers a cascade of reactions initiated actively by specific messengers and signalling molecules or simply by molecules released because of cell damage . the response is aimed towards damage limitation , removal or repair of damaged cells , wound closure , defence against further infection and tissue repair and regeneration . a highly interesting recent observation suggests that , upon liver damage , hedgehog ligand production is upregulated in dying liver epithelial cells to re - initiate a signalling pathway that controls progenitor cell fate and tissue construction during development , thus inducing progenitor cell expansion and liver regeneration ( omenetti et al . 2011 ) . liver regeneration the liver possesses an enormous regenerative capacity . in experimental partial hepatectomy ( phx ) models , full liver mass is restored within 56  days after two - thirds phx in rats or mice . key events and signalling pathways that control hepatocyte proliferation have been extensively investigated and have been summarised ( michalopoulos 2007 ; bohm et al . 2010 ) . however , in some settings , the potency of the toxic xenobiotic or the amount of damaged cells might cause the death of a large number of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes . then , hepatic progenitor cells ( hpcs ) with bi - potential capacity , residing in the ductules and canals of hering , differentiate into either hepatocytes or cholangiocytes , depending on the cell compartment that is damaged the most ( michalopoulos 2011 ) . rapid hepatic failure occurs if hepatic regeneration based on mature hepatocytes / cholangiocytes and hpc proliferation can not replenish dead liver cells and liver architecture ( duncan et al . inflammation hepatitis is a central mechanism of disease progression and a marker of serious liver disease ( weber et al . it encompasses a complex inflammatory response induced by a battery of signalling molecules and is executed by a variety of cells . the process is initiated by mutual activation of stellate and kupffer cells that together provide a cytokine milieu triggering massive infiltration of mononuclear cells , which include macrophages , lymphocytes , eosinophils and plasma cells . lymphocytes are mobilised and stimulated by contact with antigen to produce lymphokines that further activate macrophages . cytokines and chemokines from activated macrophages , in turn , stimulate lymphocytes , thus setting the stage for a persistent inflammatory response ( wynn 2004 ; heymann et al . 2009).evidence is accumulating for the plasticity of liver macrophages , including kupffer cells , depending on the surrounding cytokine milieu : nf-b- and ap1-driven pro - inflammatory ( m1 ) or stat6 and peroxisome proliferation - activated receptor - directed anti - inflammatory ( m2 ) phenotypes are generated and correspondingly impact on subsequent cellular processes ( vats et al . fibrosis the activated ( myo)fibroblast is the cell type responsible for wound closure and fibrosis ( reflecting persistent wound - healing activity attributable to chronic damage ) in any cld . several potential sources for this critical mediator exist , including bone - marrow - derived fibrocytes or circulating mesenchymal cells , which can migrate through the injured liver and become myofibroblasts ( friedman 2008 ; bataller and brenner 2005 ) . resident cells , e.g. tissue fibroblasts located in the portal tract of the liver or quiescent hepatic stellate cells ( hsc ) located in the space of disse , might also be activated to become myofibroblasts ( friedman 2000 ) . whether hepatocytes , cholangiocytes or even endothelial cells undergo a transition into activated fibroblasts under certain circumstances remains controversial ( popov and schuppan 2010 ) . the predominance of evidence still supports a central role for the quiescent hsc becoming activated by cytokine signalling , turning into myofibroblasts and then producing the fibrous scar that can be found in cld.cirrhosis is not simply extensive fibrosis but is characterised by architectural disruption , aberrant hepatocyte regeneration , nodule formation and vascular changes . the chance of a reversal from a cirrhotic to normal liver architecture remains controversial and corresponding data are discussed , for example by iredale ( 2007 ) . on the other hand , no doubt exists that the resolution of liver fibrosis can occur , e.g. it is initiated by apoptosis and senescence as orchestrated biological processes to eliminate fibrogenic cells ( friedman 2010 ; 2008).based on a multitude of data from rat or mouse hscs and animal models of liver damage , several conclusive statements about liver fibrosis can be drawn : ( 1 ) oxidative stress induces hepatocyte damage and hsc and kupffer cell activation , resulting in liver fibrosis , ( 2 ) tgf- is required for liver fibrosis and ( 3 ) the blunting of tgf- signalling reduces fibrogenesis . carcinogenesis in cirrhotic livers , macroregenerative nodules that display foci of hepatocyte dysplasia are considered to be pre - neoplastic lesions of hcc . histologically , these dysplastic lesions are classified as small cell or large cell lesions or as foci of adenomatous hyperplasia , whereby small cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia are the predominant preneoplastic lesions ( roskams and kojiro 2010 ) . our present lack of a unified comprehensive understanding of liver carcinogenesis is partially attributable to hcc being initiated in multiple genetic and environmental contexts and almost certainly emerging as a consequence of multiple pathways ( whittaker et al . this limitation regarding the pathogenesis of hcc has also prevented the development of effective , targeted , preventive or therapeutic interventions.recent analyses by using genome - wide approaches and improved animal models have initiated new and promising attempts at subclassifying the apparently highly heterogeneous hcc into distinct molecular and prognostic subtypes ( lee and thorgeirsson 2006 ) . the generally accepted paradigm of hepatocarcinogenesis is that malignant transformation occurs through the stepwise accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations that lead to the progressive acquisition of cancer phenotypes . on the other hand , more recent studies have led to the concept that a minimum number of molecular alterations leads to the acquisition of the key cancer phenotype , namely unconstrained cell proliferation ( hoshida et al . concept proposes that , in a physiological context , growth - promoting pathways are coupled with the activation of control mechanisms such as cellular senescence or apoptosis that limit their growth effects , producing a natural homeostasis of tissue mass . additionally , the existence of cancer stem cells ( csc ) is now being intensely investigated in liver and hcc , since proliferation of stem cells is a frequent and permanent process in this organ and since the accumulation of adverse molecular events , e.g. mutations , bears a high risk of csc generation ( mishra et al . such cancer stem cells , depending on their fate at the time point of carcinogenic conversion , could account for the development of hcc or cholangiocarcinoma ( ccc).thus , in cld upon initial chronic liver damage , various progression phases can be distinguished in which a complexity of cellular crosstalk occurs . tgf- has a pivotal role in orchestrating and regulating the corresponding phenotypes of cld ( fig .  1 ) . upon liver damage , tgf- production is initiated in non - parenchymal liver cells , e.g. granulocytes , macrophages ( especially kupffer cells ) and hsc ( nakatsukasa et al . 1990 ) , whereas fully differentiated epithelial cells do not express tgf-. interestingly , hepatocytes appear to absorb and store significant amounts of latent tgf- in the cytoplasm and this might be activated and available upon damage , thus contributing to the initiation of hsc activation and the wound - healing process ( roth et al . 1998 ) . of note , hepatocytes under culture conditions lose polarity and activate survival signalling pathways , thus gaining a fibroblastoid phenotype and the facility of autonomous tgf- production ( dooley et al . 2008).fig . 1pros and cons of transforming growth factor- ( tgf- ) signalling during the progression of chronic liver diseases . upon liver damage caused by many different aetiologies , active tgf- ligands show up in the liver and induce downstream signalling in all cell types investigated . tgf- is recognised as a major profibrogenic cytokine and , thus , tgf--directed therapies are being investigated for their capacity to interfere with fibrogenesis and combat disease progression . although many of these approaches have shown promising results in animal disease models for more than a decade , there is currently still no effective treatment for human disease on the market . this scheme attempts to explain the difficulties one faces when dealing with chronic liver diseases in human patients . in animal models , severe damage from fibrosis and inflammation can be achieved within weeks , whereas the establishment of end - stage liver disease in humans usually takes several decades to establish . during that life span , the liver undergoes many different phases , as shown along the central time line . strongly depending on the disease stage , tgf- and thus its targeting might have a good ( + ) or bad (  ) outcome in the organ . tgf- enhances damage to epithelial cells by inducing apoptosis and oxidative stress , triggers myofibroblast ( mfb ) activation and a wound - healing response , controls or inhibits liver regeneration by hepatocyte apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation , activates regulatory t cells ( treg ) and th17 differentiation to calm down inflammatory responses , causes fibrogenesis and liver scarring in chronic disease , inhibits the proliferation of premalignant cells , activates stroma fibroblasts in the neighbourhood of tumour cells , inhibits tumour - directed inflammatory responses , facilitates tumour angiogenesis and induces epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) of tumour cells . this multiplicity of outcomes in one organ during the different stages of one disease clearly reveals the difficulties that we have to face while directing therapeutic approaches towards tgf-. one must select the accurate therapeutic window , target the right cell type and interfere with the adverse downstream branches of the signalling pathway . to achieve this , a great deal of basic research is still required pros and cons of transforming growth factor- ( tgf- ) signalling during the progression of chronic liver diseases . upon liver damage caused by many different aetiologies , active tgf- ligands show up in the liver and induce downstream signalling in all cell types investigated . tgf- is recognised as a major profibrogenic cytokine and , thus , tgf--directed therapies are being investigated for their capacity to interfere with fibrogenesis and combat disease progression . although many of these approaches have shown promising results in animal disease models for more than a decade , there is currently still no effective treatment for human disease on the market . this scheme attempts to explain the difficulties one faces when dealing with chronic liver diseases in human patients . in animal models , severe damage from fibrosis and inflammation can be achieved within weeks , whereas the establishment of end -

derived growth - factor - induced proliferation of quiescent hsc is antagonised by tgf- , transdifferentiated myofibroblasts demonstrate a growth stimulatory effect in response to tgf- ( dooley et al . 2000 ) . 1 ( nieto et al . 2001 ) and 2 ( inagaki et al . 1995 ) type ( i ) pro - collagen , tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and 2 ( herbst et al . 1997 ) and plasminogen activator inhibitor ( pai)-1 ( knittel et al . 1996 ) have been identified as direct tgf- target genes in this cell type , whereas the transcriptional activation of myofibroblast markers -smooth muscle actin ( sma ) and connective tissue factor ( ctgf ) are induced in a tgf--independent manner . instead , tgf- signalling is required for -sma organisation and stress - fibre formation ( dooley et al . 2003 ; uemura et al . 2005).quiescent hsc respond to tgf- treatment by smad activation and display a functional negative feedback regulation via the induction of smad7 . in contrast , myofibroblasts are fully stimulated via autocrine tgf- signalling and display a strong intrinsic r - smad activation and , importantly , lack smad7 upregulation ( stopa et al . tahashi and co - workers ( 2002 ) have confirmed this finding with myofibroblasts isolated from chronically injured rat livers ; they conclude that the lack of smad7 induction as observed in myofibroblasts in cld could be one reason for excessive tgf- effects during the progression of liver fibrosis.several studies have identified smad3 as being the main mediator of the fibrogenic response of hsc , especially with respect to the induction of collagen expression ( schnabl et al . 2001 ; furukawa et al . 2003 ; inagaki et al . 2001a ; 2001b ; seyhan et al . p38/jun amino - terminal kinase ( jnk)/map kinase ( mapk)-mediated smad3 linker phosphorylation has been reported to be associated with hsc migration and disease progression ( yoshida et al . in addition to affecting the activin receptor - like kinase-5 ( alk5)-smad3 pathway , tgf- has been found to mediate its profibrogenic action via the activation of an alternative type i receptor pathway in hscs , i.e. the alk-1-induced smad1 pathway mediating id1 expression . ectopic overexpression of id1 enhances hsc activation , whereas its depletion blunts this tgf--induced response ( wiercinska et al . 2006 ) . furthermore , non - smad tgf- signalling via ras , raf-1 , mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase and mapk p42 and p44 signalling has been reported , although the outcome of these pathways on hsc activation and fibrogenesis has not been extensively studied ( reimann et al . hepatocytes the first investigations of tgf- effects on hepatocytes were performed in cultured cells and indicated that tgf- counteracted the stimulatory action on dna synthesis by various growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor ( hgf ) , epidermal growth factor ( egf ) or insulin ( hayashi and carr 1985 ; nakamura et al . this tgf--induced growth arrest in hepatocytes was at least in part mediated via the interaction of smad proteins with sp1 transcription factors , which induce the expression of the cyclin - dependent kinase ( cdk ) inhibitor p21 ( moustakas and kardassis 1998 ) . ( 1986 ) showed that tgf- mrna increases in a late stage of the regenerating liver after phx . they further reported that , in the regenerating as in the normal liver , tgf- mrna is present in non - parenchymal cells but not in hepatocytes and the authors therefore suggested that tgf- was a component of a paracrine regulatory loop controlling hepatocyte replication ( fausto et al . subsequently , this cytostatic effect could also be shown in cultured hepatocytes from hepatectomised rat livers ( strain et al . 1987).in addition to being anti - mitogenic , tgf- ( and activin ) has been found to induce hepatocyte apoptosis ( schwall et al . the adaptor protein daxx , which is associated with the fas receptor that mediates the activation of jnk and programmed cell death induced by fas , was suggested to provide the connection between tgf- receptors and the apoptotic machinery ( perlman et al . tgf--induced apoptosis was shown to be mediated via smad - mediated induction of death - associated protein ( dap ) kinase ( jang et al . 2002 ) . furthermore , tgf- has been shown to induce hepatocyte apoptosis via enhanced expression of the pro - apoptotic protein bim ( ramesh et al . 2008).tgf- has been found , as for many other epithelial cell types , to have a biphasic role in hcc . initially , in the primary tumour , tgf- has tumour - suppressive effects . in agreement with this notion , the reduced availability of tgf- type ii receptor ( trii ) by the ectopic expression of soluble trii in hepatocytes ( kanzler et al . 2001 ) or by using heterozygous mice with reduced trii expression ( i m et al . 2001 ) results in enhanced susceptibility to hcc , confirming the tumour - suppressor function of the tgf- signalling pathway . ectopic expression of mutated ha - ras but not c - myc , has been found to abrogate the cytostatic effect of tgf- on hepatocytes ( houck et al . hcc cells might become selectively resistant to the cytostatic effects of tgf- ( braun et al . 1990 ) and not lose all responses to tgf- , such as epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) . these hepatocytes display a high degree of differentiation and undergo cell cycle arrest in the g1 phase following exposure to tgf-. they maintain epithelial polarisation , despite the expression of oncogenic ha - ras ; however , upon tgf- stimulation , they convert into a migratory cell type with fibroblastoid morphology and proliferation is no longer inhibited by tgf-. without oncogenic ras , in a preneoplastic setting , tgf- might activate the epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) and induce c - src phosphorylation leading to akt activation and cell survival . the blocking of egfr signalling then amplifies the apoptotic response to tgf- , whereas tgf--mediated emt in hepatocytes is unaffected ( murillo et al . 2005 ) . this indicates that the activation of egfr is required for impairing cytostatic tgf- activity but is dispensable for the emt process.using monolayer and sandwich culture systems , we have shown that hepatocytes can exist in differentiated and dedifferentiated states that are reversible and can be switched by manipulating the responsible key factors of the signalling network . for example , focal adhesion kinase - mediated akt and extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1/2 signalling interferes with the cytostatic effects of tgf- , thus facilitating fibroblastoid transdifferentiation ( emt ) . abrogating survival signalling resensitises hepatocytes to tgf--induced apoptosis ( godoy et al . in addition , immortalised , highly differentiated hepatocytes , when treated with tgf- , maintain their epithelial morphology and undergo dramatic alterations in adhesion , leading to detachment , re - adhesion and spreading . these alterations in adhesive behaviour are caused by sequential changes in the expression of 51 integrin and its ligand fibronectin ( biname et al . 2008 ) . ctgf is potently induced by tgf- and both factors are thought to play an important role and to cooperate in fibrogenesis and emt ( wang et al . 2011 ; gressner and gressner 2008).the results described in the preceding paragraph and from others ( kaimori et al . 2007 ; zeisberg et al . 2007 ) show that tgf- , e.g. via the induction of the transcriptional repressor snail , induces adult mouse hepatocytes to undergo phenotypic and functional changes typical of emt . whether , however , hepatocyte emt occurs in vivo during fibrogenesis is currently under discussion . ( 2007 ) have performed lineage - tracing experiments with albcre - r26rstoplacz double - transgenic mice and demonstrated that hepatocytes undergoing emt substantially contribute to the population of fibroblast - specific protein-1 ( fsp1)-positive fibroblasts in carbon tetrachloride ( ccl4)-induced liver fibrosis . moreover , rowe et al . ( 2011 ) have demonstrated that hepatocytes up - regulate the expression of snail in vivo during tissue remodelling . hepatocyte - specific ablation of snail demonstrates that this transcription factor plays a key role in liver fibrosis progression in vivo by triggering multiple aspects of fibrogenesis , including growth factor expression , extracellular matrix ( ecm ) synthesis and chronic inflammatory responses ( rowe et al . ( 2010 ) have strongly challenged the concept that hepatocytes in vivo acquire a mesenchymal phenotype through emt to produce ecm in liver fibrosis . when triple - transgenic mice expressing rosa26 stop -galactosidase , albumin cre and collagen 1(i ) green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) and in which hepatocyte - derived cells are permanently labelled by -galactosidase and type i collagen - expressing cells are labelled by gfp are subjected to the induction of liver fibrosis by repeated ccl4 injections , no cells with double - positivity for gfp and -galactosidase can be found , although all -galactosidase - positive cells exhibit abundant cytoplasm and the typical morphology of hepatocytes and express none of the mesenchymal markers including -sma , fsp1 , desmin and vimentin . the authors conclude that type i collagen - producing cells do not originate from hepatocytes and that hepatocytes in vivo neither acquire mesenchymal marker expression nor exhibit a morphological change that is distinguishable from normal hepatocytes ( taura et al . wells and coworkers present even more convincing results that , in alfp - cre 3 rosa26-yellow fluorescent protein ( yfp ) mice , neither hepatocytes , nor cholangiocytes ( or their bipotential progenitors ) display evidence for in vivo colocalisation of yfp with mesenchymal markers s100a4 , vimentin , -sma or procollagen 1 2 in three animal models of chronic liver disease ( bile duct ligation , ccl4 and 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine ( chu et al . 2011).reconciling these apparently contradictory findings will require further investigations . nevertheless , if transgenic mice with upregulated smad7 expression only in their hepatocytes are challenged with chronic exposure to ccl4 , they demonstrate significantly diminished liver damage and fibrosis when compared with controls ( dooley et al . 2008 ) , indicating that tgf- signalling in hepatocytes in vivo is required for fibrogenesis progression , as it is in hsc . other cell types of the liver much less intensely investigated are the effects of tgf- on other cell types of the liver , e.g. bdec , immune cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells , although a major influence can be expected in liver physiology and during cld . similar to hepatocytes , tgf- might provide cytostatic and tumorigenic effects towards bdec , in particular during carcinogenic progression in cholangiocarcinoma . from many studies in other tissues , an inhibitory role of inflammation is expected , especially in its role as a differentiation factor for regulatory t cells ( tregs ; becker et al . finally , the impact of tgf- as a pro - angiogenic factor has been well - described ( ten dijke and arthur 2007 ) and will be relevant in the branched sinusoid network of the liver in the settings of regeneration , cirrhosis and carcinogenesis .", "various strategies have been pursued to accomplish the inhibition of tgf- signalling in fibrosis ( fig .  2 ) , first in animal studies and then with the objective of being translated into humans ( see next paragraph ) . these include ( 1 ) sequence - specific anti - sense oligonucleotides that inhibit tgf- mrna expression , ( 2 ) isoform - selective neutralising antibodies , soluble trii fragments or synthetic peptides that interfere with ligand binding to the endogenous receptor complex , ( 3 ) overexpression of the natural tgf- signalling inhibitor smad7 or cytokines such as interferon- ( ifn- ) that induce smad7 expression , ( 4 ) neutralising antibodies to integrins that interfere with the activation of latent tgf- and ( 5 ) low -

tgf- approaches have been established and successfully used for the treatment of experimental fibrogenesis . for example , a synthetic peptide that blocks the interaction of tgf- with its receptor has been established to be effective in protection against ccl4-induced liver fibrosis ( ezquerro et al . further , dominant - negative or soluble triis have been applied to suppress fibrosis in mice and rats upon dimethylnitrosamine- , ccl4- or bile duct ligation - mediated liver damage ( qi et al . 2002 ) . in part , the inhibitory effect of soluble trii is achieved by interference with oxidative stress , including the generation of ros ( cui et al . similarly , tgf--binding proteins , such as decorin and antagonistic cytokines , such as bone morphogenetic protein-7 , hepatocyte growth factor , interleukin-10 or ifn- were as efficient as camostat mesilate , a protease inhibitor that possibly abrogates the proteolytic activation of tgf- ( breitkopf et al . 2005 ) . moreover , adenovirus - mediated overexpression of smad7 in the liver potently blunted bile duct ligation - induced liver fibrosis and achieved efficient inhibition of intracellular tgf- signalling . bile duct ligation induced profibrogenic effects in cultured hscs and in vivo were inhibited ( dooley et al . 2003 ) . a similar approach with adenovirus - mediated overexpression of smad7 successfully interfered with bleomycin - induced lung fibrosis in mice ( tgf- signals via heteromeric transmembrane complexes of type i and type ii receptors ( tr ) that are endowed with intrinsic serine / threonine kinase activity ( alk activin receptor -

induced responses by stimulating smad7 expression as mentioned above , experimental evidence exists showing that smad3 is the predominant mediator of fibrogenic tgf- downstream signalling . therefore , strategies to interfere specifically with smad3 are promising . in line with this assumption , the targeted disruption of smad3 confers resistance to the development of dimethylnitrosamine - induced hepatic fibrosis in mice ( latella et al . 2002 ) . however , small molecule inhibitors announced as specific for smad3 ( jinnin et al . 2006 ) have not yet yielded breakthrough results and seem to need further improvement . with regard to interference with cancer , recent studies in g. giannelli s lab ( giannelli et al . 2011 ) have shown that the inhibition of tgf- signalling results in multiple synergistic downstream effects that probably improve the clinical outcome in hcc . further , the small molecule inhibitor ly2109761 , which targets tri / alk5 and trii induces a complete abrogation of smad - dependent and -independent signalling in human colon carcinoma cells harbouring activated k - ras , resulting in reduced tumour cell invasion and liver metastasis ( zhang et al .", "contrary to the stimulating beneficial outcome of anti - tgf- treatment in animal disease models ( breitkopf et al . for example , metelimumab , a monoclonal antibody against tgf-1 , has been used to treat systemic sclerosis . other studies involving the use of lerdelimumab , a monoclonal antibody against tgf-2 , to treat eye scarring ( mead et al . 2003 ) , or gc1008 , a pan - antibody against tgf-1 - 3 for lung fibrosis are still ongoing . intriguingly , an antisense strategy against tgf-2 has been successful in the treatment of glioma and is currently being tested in other malignant tumours such as pancreatic carcinoma , colon carcinoma and melanoma ( schlingensiepen et al . a major reason that most of these promising results from animal disease models have not yet robustly been translated into clinical use is probably the multiplicity of the possible biological - context - dependent functions of tgf-. in the time course of cld progression , various phases occur , such as initiation , regeneration , perpetuation , fibrogenesis , tumorigenesis and metastasis . depending on the specific disease stage , , it triggers the transdifferentiation of hsc to myofibroblasts and thus mediates a wound - healing response . during regeneration and hepatocyte proliferation , tgf- has an important tissue - mass - limiting cytostatic effect and controls inflammation by generating tregs . during perpetuation and fibrogenesis in chronic disease stages , the overwhelming scar - forming wound - healing reaction is adverse for the liver . in the pre - malignant stage , , the negative outcome of tgf- on inflammation might inhibit the immune response against arising tumour cells . in carcinogenesis , when tgf--cytostatic effects are lost and the signalling branch is redirected to emt , tgf- may favour cancer progression and metastasis . furthermore , the pro - angiogenic action of tgf- towards endothelial cells may also be important for tumour progression ( meyer et al . thus , an important consideration for tgf--directed treatment of fibroproliferative diseases , such as cld , is to select the right time point and cell type for targeted intervention ( fig .  1 ) . moreover , an additional challenge is that the selective inhibition of some but not all tgf--induced cellular responses might be beneficial ."], "summary": "transforming growth factor- ( tgf- ) is a central regulator in chronic liver disease contributing to all stages of disease progression from initial liver injury through inflammation and fibrosis to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma . liver -

term animal models has provided promising results , liver disease progression in humans is a process of decades with different phases in which tgf- or its targeting might have both beneficial and adverse outcomes . based on recent literature , we summarise the cell -

present plates show lactobacilli negative medium and vice versa . in 72 stools , bacteria diversity was determined by means of t - rflp extracting bacterial dna of 30 samples . two restriction enzymes , hhai and mspi , have been used to identify diversity . cutting with hhai , all samples showed peaks around 373 - 375 bp , one showed multiple peaks at 86 , 221 , and 592 bp with a few other minor peaks . different patterns of peaks allowed us to differentiate stool samples by their diversity ( figure 4 a ) . in mspi , all samples showed a peak at 495 bp , many in 70 , 79 , 565 bp peaks ( not shown in data ) . , the dendrogram was constructed using ward s algorithm with 30 samples clustered into two well -

positive bacteria and anaerobes were dominant flora and early colonizers of the first stool , and this illustrated a typical pattern for gut microbiota ( 13 , 14 ) , while lactobacillus and bifidobacterium were less dominant ( table 1 ) . the beneficial microbiota ( lactobacillus and bifidobacterium ) were present in low numbers in the early life of the healthy korean neonates . a range of facultative anaerobes , such as enterobacteriaceae , streptococcus , and staphylococcus , initially dominated the gut . as the available oxygen is consumed , strict anaerobes , including bifidobacterium , bacteroides , and clostridium proliferate ( 8) . facultative anaerobes are the first colonizers , but strict anaerobes become abundant later , in which bifidobacteria dominate within days or weeks after birth , ultimately reaching levels that are similar to those of adults by the age of two ( 15 ) . this result of culture - based study seems to follow the colonization pattern classically described . bifidobacterium and lactobacillus are widely known to be beneficial to intestinal immunity and considered as members of healthy microbiota ( 16 ) . in general , bifidobacteria colonies by one month of age ( 7 ) , and the first anaerobes are able to reach high levels in most neonates within the first to second week of life , followed by members of the firmicutes ( 17 ) . bifidobacterium genus has appeared differently in european studies , showing to have geographical influence , more dominant in northern european countries than in southern regions and remained at low colonization rates until day 90 in healthy greece infants ( 5 , 18 ) . as in other western countries , bifidobacteria in this study have shown a low composition ( table 1 ) . in different defecation times ( figure 1 ) , greater numbers of bacteria were found in delayed stools . anaerobes and gram - positive bacteria decreased , while the total number of bacteria increased with the rise of coliforms and lactobacilli after 24 hours . ( 3 ) found that the colonization patterns of gas - forming coliforms , especially e. coli , were more prevalent in colicky infants when compared to healthy infants . in a study comparing the healthy microbiota to allergic colitis , the main differences were in counts of bifidobacteria , clostridia , and total anaerobes with no significant differences in the growth of lactobacilli , coliforms , and enterococci ( 19 ) . in this study , the increase of lactobacillus was significant , while the increase of coliforms was insignificant in healthy infants . this result suggests that the dynamics of microbiota could occur in the short time of 24 hours after birth . coliforms are detrimental to the human gut , have a strong correlation with inflammatory bowel disease and exist highly in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis , hirshsprung s disease , and eczema ( 7 , 9 , 20 ) . in contrast , lactobacilli are beneficial to gut by promoting adherence of intestinal epithelial cells and inducing mucin secretion in vivo ( 21 ) . this mechanism inhibits the adherence and invasion of enteropathogenic e. coli and modulates the activation of dendritic cells ( 22 ) . in plates with lactobacillus , this could explain the consequence of the earlier colonization of lactobacilli that may play a role in affecting the intestinal immunity to disfavor coliform growth . this suggests that the specific early colonizing bacteria can determine the establishment of healthy gut immunity by their dynamic relationships with other bacteria . many studies have already proven that low diversity of gut microbiota at an early age is strongly correlated with the development of inflammatory and allergic disease in an affluent society ( 23 , 24 ) . in the cluster analysis , our findings showed bacterial diversity with different clustering patterns ; enterococcus faecium , enterococcus durans , enterococcus hirae , and streptococcus mutans dominated cluster while the other group did not ( figure 4 a ) . in a diverse stool , enterococcus is the dominant flora . this early establishment of diversity explains the existence of inter - individuality in healthy first stools . the present study has limitation in showing the relation of gut microbiota to onset of disease and lacks clinical information of subjects and other maternal factors . however , many recent studies have found that composition of gut microbiota during early infancy is associated with asthma ( 25 ) or inflammatory disease in children . this study confirmed that the healthy microbiota of korean neonates is non - sterile , in which anaerobes dominate , with low bifidobacteria , and diverse with inter - individuality . understanding the healthy gut microbiota in infancy , may make it possible to determine core bacteria for  healthy microbiota throughout life and find strategies to treat conditions associated with a disrupted gut ( 14 ) . although the exact mechanism of microbiota in maturation of immunity is elucidated , the  hygiene hypothesis  and the  microflora hypothesis  support that intestinal diversity and different bacterial composition affect the development of inflammatory disease by breaking the balance between th1 and th2 ( 26 ) . the modified  microflora hypothesis  proposes that the overly hygienic and western lifestyle limit general microbial exposure and alter the colonization of the infants gut . overall , this study supports  microflora hypothesis  by showing westernized and various microbiota compositions of the first stools . this study contributes to further understanding of healthy microbiota and presents preliminary findings to support the whether and how these different microbiota compositions relate to onset of disease in early infancy need to be further investigated . this study paves the way for future study about modulating microbiota of infant into healthy gut ."], "summary": "background : the microflora hypothesis may be the underlying explanation for the growth of inflammatory disease . in addition to many known affecting factors , knowing the gut microbiota of healthy newborns can help to understand the gut immunity and modulate it.objectives:this study examined the microbiota of healthy newborns from urban regions.patients and methods : we enrolled 128 full - term newborns , born at seoul st . mary and st . paul hospital from january 2009 to february 2010 . all 143 samples of feces were cultivated in six culture plates to determine the amounts of total bacteria , anaerobes , gram - positive bacteria , coliforms , lactobacilli , and bifidobacteria . the samples were evaluated with a bivariate correlation between coliforms and lactobacilli . terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism ( t - rflp ) analysis with hhai and mspi and a clustering analysis were performed for determination of diversity.results:bacteria were cultured in 61.5% of feces in the following order : anaerobes , gram - positive bacteria , lactobacilli , coliform , and bifidobacteria . the growth of total bacteria and lactobacilli increased in feces defecated after 24 hours of birth ( p < 0.001 , p = 0.008 ) and anaerobes decreased ( p = 0.003 ) . a negative correlation between the growth of lactobacilli and coliforms was found ( r = -463 , p < 0.001).conclusions : this study confirms that bacterial colonization of healthy newborns born in cities is non - sterile , but has early diversification and inter - individuality .", "ranking": [0, 4, 1, 2, 3]}

{"id": "PMC3879284", "section_names": ["INTRODUCTION", "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "RESULTS", "DISCUSSION", "CONCLUSION"], "document": ["the contour of the lower face , including the lips and soft - tissue chin , is thought to be closely related to the underlying dentoalveolar structure . both the upper and the lower lips are known to increase in length during growth and maintain a fairly constant vertical relationship with the edges of the corresponding central incisors after their full eruption.1 during lip closure , a subject with a normal maxillofacial skeletal pattern shows negligible contraction of the perioral musculature , and therefore , changes in the contour of the lip and soft - tissue chin are minimal.2,3 on the other hand , many orthodontic patients display visible tension in their soft - tissue chin during lip closure , which is often considered unesthetic . in particular , patients who have a long anterior vertical dimension or protruded incisors with a large interlabial gap show strain of their soft - tissue chin in an effort to close their lips , because the lower lip is elongated and the mentolabial sulcus moves upward and forward.2,4,5 one goal of orthodontic treatment is to achieve a desirable facial profile by obtaining not only satisfactory dental and skeletal relationships but also esthetic soft - tissue components including the lips and chin . any dental or skeletal factors found to be contributing to either tension in or deformation of the soft - tissue chin must be considered during diagnosis and treatment planning for better outcomes . the influence of diagnostic factors on pretreatment or posttreatment variables can be evaluated through various analytical methods such as logistic and multivariate regression analyses.6,7 however , these analyses often include complicated predictive equations , which occasionally present difficulties in result interpretation . a classification and regression tree ( cart ) is a useful analytical method that integrates the data of complex regression analyses and converts them into a simple tree model providing information on diagnostic factors in the order of their impact on the dependent variable with cut - off values.8,9 studies using cart as a mean of analytical method for the evaluation of the soft - tissue chin are scarce . the purpose of this study was to investigate the dentoskeletal factors which may predict soft - tissue chin strain during lip closure .", "two hundred and ninety - three women with angle 's class i or ii molar relationships and aged 18 - 30 years were recruited from three private orthodontic clinics . the exclusion criteria were as follows : ( 1 ) previous orthodontic treatment or orthognathic surgery ; ( 2 ) multiple missing teeth ; ( 3 ) presence of prostheses in edentulous areas ; ( 4 ) anb less than 0 ; ( 5 ) anterior edge - to - edge bite or crossbite ; and ( 6 ) congenital anomalies such as cleft lip and palate . the records included frontal and lateral facial photographs taken with the lips in the closed and relaxed positions and lateral cephalograms obtained with the teeth in centric occlusion . visually inspected the lips , mentolabial sulcus , and soft - tissue chin of the subjects in these records and classified the subjects into either the no - strain or the strain group according to the soft - tissue chin tension or deformation during lip closure . cochran 's q test was performed to compare the proportion of subjects classified into the strain group by the three examiners : the differences were found to be significant ( p = 0.02 ) . further , mcnemar 's test was used to compare the proportion of subjects classified into the strain group between the examiners . showed no significant difference ( p = 0.892 ) , with their concurrence being 81.5% . however , examiner j.p . showed significant discordance with both examiner y.k . and examiner y.y . ( p = 0.036 and 0.014 , respectively ) . the results of these tests suggested that the examiners showed subjectivity in classifying the women into the no - strain or strain group ; to enhance the credibility of this research , the data of only 209 subjects ( 114 and 95 women from the no - strain and strain groups , respectively ) who had been unanimously classified by all the three examiners were used . the lateral cephalogram of each subject was traced on standard 0.003 inch acetate tracing paper with a 0.3 mm mechanical pencil and measured on a scale with 0.5 mm and 0.5 intervals by one orthodontist . the description of cephalometric landmarks and references for the skeletal and dental measurements are shown in table 1 . the reliability of the measurements was assessed via intraclass correlation coefficients ( iccs ) and the wilcoxon signed - rank test . a t - test was performed to compare the differences in the mean values of the variables between the groups . three variables that did not pass the normality test were analyzed by the mann - whitney u - test . multivariate analysis of variance ( manova ) was conducted to determine the intergroup differences in the variables after age adjustment . the chi - square test was carried out to evaluate the significance of the group distribution according to angle 's classification of malocclusion . moreover , logistic regression analysis was used to determine the possible discriminants for each group . then , a cart model was constructed to obtain cut - off values for the variables selected as predictors . tracing and measurement errors were determined by retracing 20 cephalograms acquired through systematic random sampling .", "the results of the wilcoxon signed - rank test reflected no significant differences in the repeated measurements of all the variables ( p > 0.05 ; table 2 ) . the measurements were considered reliable and measurement errors were thought to be minimal because 26 of the 27 analyzed variables exhibited icc values of 0.95 or higher ( p < 0.001 ; table 2 ) . as shown in table 3 , the mean values of 22 of the 27 variables were significantly different between the groups . meanwhile , the age differences between the groups were not significant ( p = 0.362 ) . further , in the manova , the values of wilks ' lambda indicated that the intergroup differences in the mean values of the variables after age adjustment were comparable to those before age adjustment ( p < 0.05 ) . according to angle 's classification of malocclusion , 124 and 85 subjects had class i and ii malocclusions , respectively . the strain group included a lower number of subjects with class i malocclusion ( 48 [ 38.7% ] vs. 76 [ 61.3% ] ) and a slightly higher proportion of subjects with class ii malocclusion ( 47 [ 55.3% ] vs. 38 [ 44.7% ] ) than the no - strain group . the chi - square test showed that this trend was significant ( p = 0.018 ) . the variables analyzed in the forward stepwise ( likelihood ratio ) logistic regression analysis included the cephalometric measurements , age , and angle 's classification of malocclusion ( class i or ii malocclusion ) . four variables were chosen as the most prominently related factors for the group classification in the final model ( table 4 ) : overbite depth indicator ( odi ) , upper incisor to n - pog plane ( u1-npog , mm ) , overjet , and upper incisor to upper lip ( u1-upper lip , mm ) . a logit model using the four selected variables was derived as follows :   where \" a , \" \" b , \" \" c , \" and \" d \" are the coefficient values of odi , u1-npog , overjet , and u1-upper lip , respectively ( table 4 ) . the logit model indicated that the lower the odi value and the higher the u1-npog , overjet , and u1-upper lip values , the greater was the probability of the subject being included in the strain group . by inverting the logit model with exponential function , the following equation was obtained :   where \" s \" is the logit model and \" pr(sg ) \" is the probability of classification into the strain group . the prediction rate at which the group classification by using the four selected variables would concord with the actual classification was 81.8% ( table 5 ) . the cart model constructed by using the four selected variables provided the cut - off values of these variables ( figure 1 ) . the tree building began at the root ( or parent ) node ( node 0 ) , which included all the subjects in the dataset . the best splitter variable for each node was selected to maximize the average \" purity \" of the two child nodes . the best splitter variable for node 0 was found to be u1-npog , with a cut - off value of 14.2 mm . therefore , in node 1 , 80% of the subjects showing a u1-npog value less than or equal to 14.2 mm would be categorized into the no - strain group , and in node 2 , 79.8% of the subjects showing a u1-npog value greater than 14.2 mm would be categorized into the strain group . accordingly , u1-npog was considered the primary predictor , with the ability to classify approximately 80% of the total subjects into the strain or no - strain group at the value of 14.2 mm and without the necessity of the other variables . the next splitter variable for both node 1 and node 2 was considered to be overjet , although the number and condition of the subjects in these nodes were different ( i.e. , node 1 contained 120 subjects with a u1-npog value  14.2 mm and node 2 comprised 89 subjects with a u1-npog value > 14.2 mm ) . the tree building continued until one of the coupled nodes showed 100% purity in the categorization of the groups , as seen in nodes 12 , 14 , and 15 . the predictability of the group classification according to the cart model is shown in table 6 .", "during lip closure , the upper and lower lips cover two - thirds and one - third of the maxillary central incisors , respectively , and the main muscle activity is shown by the mentalis , followed by the lower and upper lips.1 the mentalis is essential in both esthetic and functional aspects because it is responsible for the central motion of the lower lip and determining the position of the chin point.4,10 patients with the dolichofacial type or maxillary protrusion tend to overwork the mentalis and lower lip to compensate for the lip incompetence . this condition leads to tension in the soft tissue at the insertion point of the mentalis and dimpling at the soft - tissue chin point , which is considered functionally and esthetically unfavorable.2 - 4 in this study , frontal and lateral extraoral photographs taken with the lips in their resting and closed positions and lateral cephalograms obtained with the teeth in centric occlusion were examined . to eliminate discrepancies related to gender or age , further , only the subjects who were unanimously categorized into the no - strain or strain group by all the three examiners were included to allow the maximal objectivity . to identify the cephalometric measurements highly related to strain of the soft - tissue chin , a cart is used in various dental and medical studies to evaluate diagnostic or predictive factors for a certain condition or disease.11 - 13 this diagnostic tree is a machine - learning method that allows the construction of a prediction model from the data.8,9 it exhibits independent variables ( e.g. , the cephalometric variables ) in the order of their influence on the dependent variables ( e.g. , no - strain or strain group ) in a stratified manner , with the earlier division or node ( higher in the tree ) demonstrating a greater effect . its main advantage is that it defines the cut - off values for dividing the parent node into the two child nodes that can simplify the decision for one way or the other . another advantage is the graphical presentation of the tree diagram , which effectively aids in the interpretation of complex statistical data . the child nodes can each be recursively divided into two nodes , forming additional child nodes with their own splitters and cut - off values . of the four discriminants selected in this study , the cart model showed that u1-npog had the highest differentiability at a cut - off value of 14.2 mm . in a previous study , subjects with class ii division 1 malocclusion and lip incompetence had higher perioral muscle activities than those with normal occlusion.14 further , in both maxillary and bimaxillary protrusion cases , a greater amount of muscle tension developed from the lower lip to the chin in the closed lip position , because the amount of lower lip movement increased in relation to the degree of maxillary incisor protrusion.3 these studies are highly comparable to the present study as they evaluated asian male and female patients equivalently or female patients only . accordingly , maxillary incisor protrusion has a notable effect on the lower lips and can lead to increased strain of the soft - tissue chin . moreover , the degree of the chin prominence relative to the lip and maxillary incisors should not be overlooked . the chin provides a fundamental base on which the lips rely for support and the balance of the lip position heavily depends on the strength of the chin.15 if the chin is too weak , the relative distance to the maxillary incisors would increase , which might cause the lower lip to protrude in order to reach the maxillary incisors during lip closure and lead to soft - tissue tension in the mentalis area . therefore , the optimal treatment plan to relieve strain of the soft - tissue chin should include retraction of the maxillary incisors or orthognathic surgery such as bimaxillary anterior subapical osteotomy where a more prominent chin profile is preferred.5,16 the next predictive variable in the cart model was overjet , with cut - off values of 4.8 and 4.2 mm . an increased overjet was associated with decreased activity of the upper lip and increased activity of the lower lip ; a positive correlation was noted between the overjet and the activity of the lower lip during lip closure , speech , and mastication.14 otuyemi17 reported that in a preadolescent nigerian population , an overjet greater than 6 mm was strongly related with a \" trapped \" lower lip and that greater than 7 mm led to inadequate coverage of the maxillary incisors by the lower lip . on the other hand , a direct correlation between the varying overjet and the different upper lip positions has not been shown , confirming a strong association between the overjet and the lower lip rather than with the upper lip.18 although these studies were performed with varying age groups and included male subjects , the results of the present study are in agreement with the previous findings concerning the influence of a large overjet on the movement of the lower lip . therefore , acquiring a normal overjet may minimize malfunction of the lower lip and distortion of the mentalis . u1-upper lip ( mm ) is a measurement reflecting the relative length of the lip . its average values in the strain and no - strain groups were 4.07 and 2.83 mm , respectively , indicating that maxillary incisor extrusion coincides with increased strain in the mentalis . this relationship was significantly different in the subjects with class ii division 1 and class i malocclusions , implying that the maxillary incisors tend to supra - erupt in class ii division 1 malocclusion.2 hayashida et al.19 reported that the most influential factor for the vertical position of the lower lip is the varying position of the tip of the maxillary incisor . an extruded maxillary incisor causes cushioning of the lower lip on the lingual surface and leads to eversion of the lower lip and distortion of the mentolabial sulcus and mentalis . therefore , the vertical position of the maxillary incisors should also be considered together with the smile arc in the esthetic aspect of orthodontic treatment.2,20,21 the odi was the only skeletal factor among the selected predictors and its influence was not as conspicuous as that of the other variables , which are related to the position of the maxillary incisors . although its influence is limited , the treatment plan should be oriented toward increasing the odi value to decrease tension in the mentalis . however , this may be difficult to achieve because the ab plane angle should not be increased in treating class i and ii malocclusions . therefore , prevention of extrusion or active intrusion of the maxillary molars is required to maintain or decrease the mandibular angle . the chi - square test showed an apparent discrepancy in the sample distribution of angle 's classification of malocclusion between the groups ( p = 0.018 ) . although the measurements were not compared between skeletal class i and skeletal class ii malocclusions , the differences in the cephalometric variables imply that the skeletal pattern between the groups was different , and the strain group showed a higher tendency for retrognathism , convex profile , and dolichofacial type . patients showing unfavorable strain at the soft - tissue chin may be managed by an orthodontic intervention - often involving retraction of anterior teeth - to establish satisfactory anterior dental relationship accordingly which induces changes in the lip posture , leading to lip closure without unnecessary tension in the lips and soft - tissue chin , and thus a more desirable profile is obtained.1 recognition of the variables predicting strain of the soft - tissue chin may enable the establishment of a guideline for the important dentoskeletal factors to be considered during diagnosis and treatment planning . to minimize strain of the soft - tissue chin , the treatment modality should be oriented toward decreasing the u1-npog , overjet , and u1-upper lip values while increasing the odi value . strain of the soft - tissue chin is influenced by not only the underlying dentoskeletal structures but also the thickness , length , and tone of the soft tissue.10 therefore , further studies should include soft - tissue variables to improve the predictability of the soft - tissue profile after orthodontic treatment . given that the present study was limited to only korean women , studies including men or various age or racial groups are warranted to compare the discrepancies arising from these predictive factors .", "odi , u1-npog , overjet , and u1-upper lip were found to be the discriminants for classifying the female adult subjects with class i or ii molar relationships into the no -

related complication of treatment for hematologic malignancies . hyperuricemia results from rapid catabolism of purine - containing nucleic acids from tumor cells and can lead to renal insufficiency when uric acid precipitates into the renal tubules and distal collecting system . this causes renal vasoconstriction , which in turn leads to impaired autoregulation , decreased renal flow , oxidation and inflammation , finally leading to acute kidney injury . markedly increased phosphate levels compounded with calcium phosphate deposition in the renal tubules can also cause acute kidney injury . high concentrations of both uric acid and phosphate potentiate the risk of acute kidney injury because uric acid precipitates more readily in the presence of calcium phosphate and vice versa . allopurinol has been used for many years in the prevention and management of tls - related hyperuricemia . allopurinol decreases the new production of uric acid by inhibiting enzyme xanthine oxidase and blocking oxidation of xanthine and hypoxanthine into uric acid . therefore , following allopurinol administration , there is a time lag for reduction in uric acid levels and hence should be administered for more than 3 days for the achievement of significant reduction in uric acid levels . an alternative to inhibiting uric acid formation by inhibiting xanthine oxidase with allopurinol is to promote the catabolism of existing pool of uric acid to allantoin , which is 510 times more soluble in urine by urate oxidase . rasburicase offers potential advantage over allopurinol because of its rapid onset of action , reducing pre - existing pool of uric acid within few hours , and also helping in avoiding accumulation of xanthine and hypoxanthine , which has poor water solubility and can worsen renal function . urate oxidase is an endogenous enzyme commonly found in many mammalian species but not in humans because of nonsense mutation i , the coding region in the gene during hominoid evolution . rasburicase is indicated for the prophylactic management as well as treatment of high plasma uric acid levels ( > 7.5 mg / dl ) in pediatric and adult patients with leukemia , lymphoma , and solid tumor malignancies , which have the highest risk of tumor lysis such as those with tumors that have a high proliferative rate(all , burkitt 's lymphoma ) , tumors with high sensitivity to cytotoxic therapy , patients with large tumor masses , and those with pre - existing renal insufficiency and high serum ldh levels . it is administered as an intravenous ( iv ) infusion over 30 min and should never be given as a bolus . the reconstituted solution can be stored at 28c for 24 h. repeated use of rasburicase increases risk of hypersensitivity reactions . rasburicase was initially approved by the us food and drug administration for the management of tls in the pediatric setting , based on a randomized controlled phase iii clinical trial whereby rasburicase ( 0.15 or 0.2 mg / kg ) was administered for 5 consecutive days . has confirmed the effectiveness and safety of rasburicase over allopurinol in children with hematologic malignancies . rasburicase was administered at a dose of 0.2 mg / kg iv over 30 min for 57 days in this study population . though the efficiency and advantage of rasburicase has been proved beyond doubt more than a decade ago , it 's the cost of the product that has been the main inhibiting factor against its usage . in a developing country like india , where majority of the patients have to bear the brunt of the medical expenses with no insurance to support them , the use of rasburicase for 5 days is beyond the scope of the poor patients . so , when several noncontrolled studies involving retrospective case series suggested shorter duration of treatment to minimize the cost but without compromising the efficacy , it was boon for children in resource limited settings . evaluated the efficacy of a single dose rasburicase 0.15 mg / kg followed by as - needed dosing with a maximum of five doses instead of the standard 5-day regimen with 0.2 mg / kg in adult patients at risk for tls and concluded that single dose was effective in most patients and only a subset of high - risk patients received a second dose . a study in south carolina depicted that a single dose of rasburicase 6 mg was effective in the management of tls in adults . in california , sdr for adult cancer patients with hyperuricemia or at high risk for tls demonstrated better response rate and stronger control of uric acid level compared with allopurinol . sdr response rate was not inferior to that of daily - dose rasburicase ( ddr ) , and the standard - dose sdr generates more cost savings compared with the ddr . though majority of the studies had been in adult patients , lee et al had proven the effectiveness of a single dose of rasburicase in three children with all and concluded that it is feasible and will improve the cost - effectiveness profile of the otherwise expensive compound . all the children received a single dose of rasburicase , and their electrolyte abnormalities , and renal parameters , hyperuricemia and hypertension normalized in 72 h. the children were started on chemotherapy as per children 's oncology group protocol . the uric acid levels were well below the normal levels during the entire period of chemo administration . the rasburicase was administered on the day of admission in all our patients at the earliest and within 12 h of admission . the time lag of 12 h in few patients was due to the financial constraints in arranging the drug . our experience suggests that in appropriately monitored patients single dose followed by dosing as needed can be cost - saving . none of our patients required dialysis , which otherwise would have added to the economic burden . administration of rasburicase does not require any expertise like catheters , central lines , intensive care unit care unlike dialysis , and no dose modifications are needed in spite of deranged renal parameters .", "from an economic point of view , especially in a developing country like india , the promising single low - dose approach of rasburicase administration achieved satisfactory results with a great reduction of cost per patient , which can result in better cost - effectiveness with no compromise in clinical efficacy ."], "summary": "tumor lysis syndrome ( tls ) occurs in malignancies with high proliferative potential and tumor burden , such as lymphomas and leukemias . tls syndrome is an oncologic emergency , requiring prompt intervention . the metabolic derangements cause acute kidney failure and may lead to cardiac arrhythmias , seizures , and death . with the advent of rasburicase , a recombinant urate oxidase , there has been a decline in the tls - mediated renal failure and the need for dialysis . the recommended regimen and doses pose a heavy financial burden for patients in developing countries like india . with data and studies proving a similar efficacy for the reduced dose and lesser number of rasburicase , we report here a case series of seven children with acute leukemias , whose tls was managed by a single dose of rasburicase . a retrospective analysis of case records of seven children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and tls , admitted to our pediatric oncology unit of our hospital between the period 2011 and 2013 , was done . all our patients responded to a single dose , indicating that in appropriately monitored patients , single dose followed by as -

10 ] . our main objective was to analyze the relationship between serum testosterone , prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) , and prostate cancer risk in high - risk patients .", "the study population consisted of 120 men with a psa level of 10 ng / ml or higher . the data were collected from january 2008 to january 2010 . to determine the relationship between testosterone , psa , and prostate cancer risk in a high - risk group , we limited our study population to men with a psa level of 10 ng / ml or higher . we excluded from this analysis men who were taking medications known to lower psa , such as finasteride or dutasteride . twelve cores were obtained and two extra biopsies were taken if hypoechoic or otherwise suspicious areas were noted on ultrasound . serum testosterone levels were measured by using a solid - phase competitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay with the advia centaur immunoassay system ( bayer health care , chicago , il , usa ) . we classified the men as hypogonadal if their serum testosterone level was < 300 ng / dl , according to the criteria used by rhoden et al . for possible correlation between serum testosterone , psa , and prostate cancer , we included age , psa density ( psad ) , prostate volume , and gleason score for patients with prostate cancer . statistical analysis was performed by using the student 's t - test , the pearson correlation test , simple linear regression , and binary logistic regression . odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals ( cis ) for psa , psad , serum testosterone , and age were determined to predict prostate cancer risk . all data are presented as the mean2 sd to define and characterize quantitative variables and as percentages to characterize qualitative variables ; we considered a p - value<0.05 to be statistically significant .", "out of 120 patients , the samples of 85 ( 70.1% ) patients were diagnosed as benign and those of 35 ( 29.2% ) patients were diagnosed as being prostate cancer . there was no significant difference in the patient 's average age , psa , prostate volume , or testosterone between patients without and those with prostate cancer . only psad differed significantly between the two groups ( t - test , p=0.012 ) ( table 1 ) . hypogonadal and eugonadal men did not differ significantly in cancer detection rate ( 30.2% vs. 32.0% , respectively ) . the testosterone level did not differ significantly between patients without and those with prostate cancer in either hypogonadal ( 248.1650.41 ng / dl vs. 251.3543.61 ng / dl , respectively ) or eugonadal ( 501.52137.06 ng / dl vs. 506.22126.40 ng / dl , respectively ) men ( t - test , p>0.05 ) . testosterone was unrelated to age , psa , psad , or prostate volume in both men without and those with prostate cancer , and prostate cancer aggressiveness also was unrelated to serum testosterone in prostate cancer patients ( p>0.05 ) ( table 2 ) . the binary logistic regression also confirmed that none of the variables used in this study was an independent predictor of prostate cancer risk for men with a psa level > 10 ng / ml ( p>0.05 ) ( table 3 ) . further evaluation with simple linear regression confirmed that testosterone and psa did not show any correlation ( p>0.05 ) ( fig . when we divided the patients into 11 groups according to their testosterone level , within a 150 ng / dl range , prostate cancer prevalence did not change as the testosterone level increased ( p>0.05 ) ( table 4 ) .", "in men , the leydig cells in the testes produce approximately 90% of testosterone ; the adrenal glands produce the rest . testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as the testes and prostate gland . under testosterone influence , the prostate gland experiences two main growth periods . the first occurs early in puberty , when the prostate doubles in size . at around age 25 , when the prostate is growing , testosterone is converted into dihydrotestosterone ( dht ) , which is the androgen receptor 's major activator . after dth binds to androgen receptors , it translocates to the nucleus , where it mediates the transcriptional activation of target genes . these androgen - stimulated changes in gene expression promote cellular growth , which often results in benign prostatic hyperplasia in elderly men . long - term cessation of the prostate 's exposure to androgen appears to protect against the development of cancer , but no dose - response relationship between testosterone level and cancer risk has been established . the prostate cancer risk for men with a testosterone concentration in the normal range remains unclear . recent chemopreventive trials with 5-alpha - reductase inhibitors show the role of testosterone in prostate cancer development . finasteride reduced the risk of prostate cancer by 24.8% compared with a placebo in healthy men . recently , the reduce study showed that dutasteride also reduced the risk of prostate cancer by 23% compared with a placebo in healthy men . huggins and hodges first showed the effect of testosterone on prostate cancer patients in 1941 . they showed the hormonal responsiveness of prostate cancer by reporting that markedly reducing the testosterone level by castration and estrogen treatment caused metastatic prostate cancer to regress , and injecting testosterone caused prostate cancer to grow . in 1995 wu et al found that the distribution of dihydrotestosterone - to - testosterone ratios parallels both the incidence of and mortality from prostate cancer . the demonstration that androgen suppression effectively treats advanced prostate cancer , and the fact that elevated serum androgen levels might predispose people to prostate cancer , have attracted persistent interest . however , a recent study refuted any connection between elevated testosterone levels and increased prostate cancer risk . endogenous hormones and prostate cancer collaborative group et al meta - analyzed the serum concentrations of sex hormones from subjects in 18 prospective studies that included 3,886 men with incident prostate cancer and 6,438 control subjects . they concluded that endogenous hormones , including testosterone , were not associated with prostate cancer . morote et al recently conducted another study of 478 patients , all of whom were assessed by trus - guided prostate biopsy because of an abnormal digital rectal examination , psa > 4 ng / ml , or both . they found no difference in serum testosterone level between patients with and those without prostate cancer and concluded that the serum testosterone level was not associated with prostate cancer risk or aggressiveness . an animal study by morgentaler and traish showed that beyond a certain serum testosterone concentration , androgens have a limited ability to stimulate prostate cancer growth . subsequent increases in serum testosterone levels beyond that concentration did not stimulate the prostate because the binding capacity of the intra - prostatic androgen receptors had been saturated . our results are similar to those of the above studies even though we limited our study population to patients with psa > 10 ng / ml . we found that the serum testosterone level at the time of diagnosis was unrelated to psa and prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness in both hypogonadal and eugonadal patients . ideas about the interaction between testosterone and prostate cancer have changed considerably over the past decade . like our study , most recent epidemiologic studies have found no association between testosterone and prostate cancer [ 6 - 10 ] . a few studies published during the past decade contrast with our results , however , and show that low testosterone levels seem to be related to an increased risk of prostate cancer and tumor aggressiveness , such as a high gleason score [ 23 - 28 ] . in our study , we compared age , psa , prostate volume , and psad with testosterone . only a known prostate cancer predictor , psad , showed a significant difference between patients with and those without prostate cancer , even in high - risk patients with a psa level of 10 ng / ml or higher . patients without prostate cancer had relatively lower psa and larger prostates than did patients with prostate cancer . however , our binary logistic regression showed that psad was unsuitable as an independent predictor of prostate cancer risk in men with a psa level of 10 ng / ml or higher . we measured the serum testosterone level in the patients only once , before their biopsy was done . second , we checked only their total testosterone level and were unable to check their free testosterone level . , the present study found that the serum testosterone level at the time of diagnosis was unrelated to psa and prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness . because testosterone levels change with age and time , a prospective study with long - term testosterone monitoring is required to find a relationship between testosterone and prostate cancer .", "our results show that the serum testosterone level at the time of diagnosis was unrelated to psa and prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness . additional studies with long -

The Relevance of Osteopetrosis Studies to New Understanding of Functions Associated with the Skeleton", "5. Conclusion"], "document": ["bone is a dynamic tissue which undergoes continuous self - renewal , and bone homeostasis relies on functional equilibrium among three types of cells : osteoclasts essential for bone resorption , osteoblasts responsible for bone matrix formation , and osteocytes involved in the reception and transduction of mechanical stimuli and in the regulation of osteoclast / osteoblast differentiation and function . the balance between bone synthesis and resorption is finely tuned and any perturbations of this balance in adults trigger bone disease . osteopetrosis ( osteo : bone and petros : stone ) regroups a set of rare , heterogeneous , and inherited bone diseases characterized by increased bone mass . osteopetrosis is therefore an osteocondensing disease . in principle , two causes could give rise to this osteocondensing phenotype : increased bone formation or failure of resorption by osteoclasts . however , osteopetrosis is known to result from defective osteoclast differentiation or function [ 3 , 4 ] . important progress has been made during the past decades in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of hereditary diseases characterized by increased bone mass [ 3 , 5 ] . our objective in this review is not to give a detailed description of all the sclerosing bone diseases ; such information can be found in other reviews [ 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 ] . instead , we discuss recent findings regarding osteopetrosis and how the study of this disease has contributed to new understanding of functions associated with the skeleton [ 810 ] .", "osteoclasts are highly specialized cells responsible for the dissolution of bone mineral and for the degradation of organic matrix . osteoclasts are multinucleated cells ( containing up to 50 nuclei ) , derived from the fusion of mononuclear cells belonging to the monocyte - macrophage lineage . under the influence of factors secreted by osteoblasts and/or stromal cells present in the bone microenvironment m - csf ( macrophage colony stimulating factor ) is expressed by osteoblasts and binds the c - fms receptor on osteoclast precursors , stimulating their proliferation and the expression of rank ( receptor activator of nf-b ) receptor . the interaction of rank - l , expressed and secreted by osteoblasts and stromal cells , with its receptor propels the fusion of osteoclast progenitors to form a giant multinucleated cell . a terminally differentiated osteoclast is able to degrade extracellular bone matrix by the action of specific proteins . to resorb bone matrix , osteoclasts must be perfectly polarized with a ruffle border and a sealing zone . these two features allow the creation of a resorption lacuna into which h ions are actively secreted in order to acidify it , leading to dissolution of bone matrix hydroxyapatite . type ii carbonic anhydrase ( caii ) hydrates co2 to form carbonic acid , which spontaneously dissociates into protons and hco3 ions . the protons are actively transported into the resorption lacuna by a vacuolar atpase proton pump located in the ruffled border domain [ 1 , 11 ] . the hco3 ion is exchanged with cl by a bicarbonate / chloride antiport on the basolateral membrane of the cell . the chloride ion is translocated into the resorption lacuna through chloride channel 7 ( clcn7 ) , recently reclassified as chloride / proton antiport . the acidic environment promotes the dissolution of inorganic content and also exposes the organic matrix , which is then ready to be digested by secreted proteolytic enzymes [ 1 , 11 ] . the collagenous bone matrix is dissolved by two groups of enzymes , the matrix metalloproteases and the lysosomal cathepsins . this enzyme is secreted into the resorption lacuna and degrades type i collagen in the acidic environment . the acquisition and maintenance of osteoclast membrane polarity require a complex system of vesicle trafficking and ongoing cytoskeletal renewal . one of the proteins involved in these processes is plekhm1 ( pleckstrin homolog domain containing family m with run domain member 1 ) . this protein plays a crucial role in acidification and trafficking of intracellular vesicles [ 13 , 14 ] . a recently discovered protein important for osteoclast trafficking activity is snx10 ( sorting nexin 10 ) . snx10 belongs to a family of about 30 proteins sharing the px ( phox homology ) phospholipid binding domain and is involved in protein trafficking and osteoclast differentiation / function [ 15 , 16 ] .", "osteopetrosis is a generic name for a group of rare genetic bone diseases characterized by osteoclast failure . the adult autosomal dominant type ii form or albert - schnberg disease classified as mild is sometimes associated with bone symptoms . in contrast , the infantile recessive osteopetroses are severe forms and usually lethal in childhood without treatment [ 3 , 57 , 17 ] . mutations in at least 8 genes ( table 1 ) have been identified as being responsible for osteopetrosis pathogenesis in humans . autosomal recessive osteopetrosis is a severe disease diagnosed in the first months of life owing to a variety of problems . they also show bruising and frequent bleeding secondary to medullar hyperplasia caused by bony invasion of the medullar space . untreated children usually die during their decade from hemorrhage , pneumonia , anemia , or infection . hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( hsct ) is the only treatment option currently far available [ 3 , 5 , 18 ] . the number of osteoclasts is normal or high , but their acidifying activity , compulsory for bone resorption , is impaired . several genes are known to be involved in this form of osteopetrosis ( table 1 , figure 1 ) . about 50% of aro patients harbors loss - of - function mutations of tcirg1 which codes for the proton pump v - atpase 3 subunit [ 17 , 19 ] . loss - of - function mutations of the clcn7 gene , coding for chloride channel 7 , have also been described in ~10% of aro patients . mutations in ostm1 ( osteopetrosis associated transmembrane protein 1 ) , coding for a protein involved in transport of clcn7 to the ruffled border ( and considered as a  subunit of clcn7 ) , have been described as causing severe osteopetrosis in ~5% of patients [ 2123 ] . primary neurological defects can also be present in patients bearing ostm1 or clcn7 mutations [ 20 , 23 ] . deformity of the distal femora , bone pain , and chondrolysis of the left hip were described in one patient . recently , a mutation in the snx10 gene was found in 15 families in which the patients displayed a heterogeneous phenotype . mild growth retardation , hypocalcemia , hydrocephalus , severe hematological abnormalities , and visual impairment have been described in patients with loss of function mutations of snx10 [ 3 , 15 , 16 , 24 ] . less than 4% of aro patients harbors loss - of - function mutations of tnfsf11 , encoding rank - l , or of tnfrsf11a , encoding rank receptor , and constitute a distinct subgroup of recessive osteopetrosis . indeed , bone biopsies from these patients revealed a complete lack of osteoclasts [ 2527 ] . in addition , patients with tnfsf11 mutations exhibit some immune abnormalities and not palpable lymph nodes , but b and t lymphocyte numbers are normal . by contrast , most of the patients with tnfrsf11a mutations have a more severe immunological phenotype with a defect in memory b lymphocyte differentiation and a reduction in immunoglobulins levels [ 2527 ] . however , osteopetrosis caused by tnfsf11 mutations can not be treated by hsct , because an osteoblast defect is the basis of this pathology . in practice , a molecular genetic diagnosis should be made before transplantation to ensure that the pathology is not due to a rank - l mutation . in 1983 , renal tubular acidosis can explain the hypotonia , apathy , and muscular weakness occurrence in some patients . by radiography caii deficiency resembles other forms of osteopetrosis , but brain calcifications can develop during childhood and osteosclerosis and bone modeling spontaneously decrease instead of increasing in the course of pathology evolution . metabolic acidosis occurs during the neonatal period , and renal tubular acidosis , both proximal and distal , has been described [ 29 , 30 ] . caii is expressed in many different tissues including brain , kidney , red blood cells , cartilage , lung , and digestive mucosa . ado ii is commonly called benign osteopetrosis but presents with an extremely heterogeneous course from asymptomatic to rarely fatal . adoii clinical and radiological signs occur quite late in childhood or in the teens , although earlier occurring has sometimes been reported . adoii patients usually displayed osteosclerosis at the vertebral level ( so - called sandwich vertebrae ) and also a bone in bone aspect observed mainly in the iliac bones , but sometimes in other epiphyses . in addition , on radiography , alternating dense and light bands are often seen in iliac bones and at the extremities of long bones [ 7 , 33 ] . bone fractures occur in 80% of patients , with a mean of 3 fractures per patient . the femur is the most fractured bone in this pathology , but fractures can occur on any long bones and even at the posterior arch of the vertebrae , which often leads to a spondylolisthesis . hip arthritis is frequent ( in 50% of the cases ) and could be due to excessive stiffness of the subchondral bone . auditory or visual impairment occurs in less than 5% of affected individuals [ 7 , 33 ] . arthropathies are technically difficult and postsurgical complications , such as strengthening delay , infections , and pseudoarthritis are frequent ( 50% of cases ) due to bone stiffness . for example , in 3 families in which most of the affected individuals expressed only a mild form of adoii , some members exhibited anemia and blindness caused by optical nerve compression . this phenotype has been called intermediate osteopetrosis because of its overlap with that of mild aro . about 70% of patients affected by adoii harbors heterozygous dominant negative mutations of the clcn7 gene ( figure 1 , table 1 ) . in the remaining ~30% of cases , no mutations in clcn7 gene sequences were found , suggesting involvement of further genes in the pathogenesis of this form of osteopetrosis .", "osteopetrorickets is a bone disorder characterized by increase of bone mass with a defect of skeletal mineralization . schinke and coauthors performed histological analysis of undecalcified bone biopsies of 21 patients who received a diagnosis of osteopetrosis . in patients with loss - of - function mutations in the tcirg1 gene , the same pathological enrichment of osteoid was confirmed in oc / oc mice carrying a loss - of - function mutation of the tcirg1 gene , while no increase was revealed in osteopetrotic scr mice . the increase of osteoid volume was associated with hypocalcemia , due to a defect of intestinal calcium uptake . indeed it was shown that tcirg1 is also expressed in the fundus , a region of the stomach involved in gastric acidification , and loss - of - function mutations induce hypochlorhydria and reduced intestinal calcium uptake in both humans and mice . gastric acidification is a prerequisite for efficient intestinal calcium uptake ; in hypochlorhydria , intestinal calcium uptake is lowered leading to parathyroin hormone ( pth)-dependent activation of osteoclasts and an osteoporosis phenotype . in the case of loss - of - function mutation of tcirg1 , intestinal calcium uptake is reduced and pth - dependent stimulation of bone resorption is blocked , resulting in an osteopetrorickets phenotype . performed histomorphometric analysis of bone biopsies of 9 osteopetrotic patients with loss - of - mutation in the tcirg1 , clcn7 , and tnfsf11a genes . in contrast , there was no sign of osteopetrorickets in patients with clcn7 and tnfsf11a gene mutations [ 3537 ] . osteocalcin can exist in two different forms , undercarboxylated and carboxylated on 3 glutamic acid residues [ 10 , 38 ] . the carboxylated form has high affinity for the hydroxyapatite , facilitating its engraftment in the bone matrix . ferron et al . investigated whether acidic bone resorption lacuna promotes the decarboxylation of osteocalcin . indeed they observed that in oc / oc mice the levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin were reduced by 30% compared to wild - type animals . similar features were observed in wild - type mice that received fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells ( hscs ) from oc / oc mice confirming the relevance of osteoclast function in osteocalcin - insulin signaling . moreover they observed that oc / oc mice were glucose intolerant , with reduced serum insulin levels , pancreas insulin content , and insulinexpression in the pancreas [ 40 , 41 ] . interestingly , it was shown that osteopetrotic patients affected by autosomal dominant osteopetrosis with osteoclast acidification defects have lower levels of insulin and a lower undercarboxylated / carboxylated osteocalcin ratio but diabetes was not reported [ 40 , 41 ] . osteocalcin is very important for the cross talk between bone and the systems responsible for male fertility [ 42 , 43 ] . karsenty 's group showed that osteocalcin is able to stimulate , in a camp response element binding ( creb ) protein - dependent manner , the production of testosterone by testes . this function is mediated by the interaction of osteocalcin with gprc6a , a g - coupled receptor expressed in leydig cells [ 42 , 43 ] . in 1997 cohen et al .   showed that op / op mice ( which lack colony stimulating factor 1 , csf-1 ) have reduced mating ability , low sperm numbers , and low serum testosterone levels due to decreased leydig cell steroidogenesis . the study also showed how csf-1 is essential for the development and function of the hypothalamic - pituitary - gonadal axis . further studies in osteopetrotic animal models will be important to confirm the interaction between bone and male fertility . it now well established that there is a tight correlation between bone and the immune system , which has led to a new discipline called osteoimmunology . this research area is just now expanding and we are beginning to better understand the relevance of this interplay in bone diseases . associated defects in b cell function were attributed to mutations in genes involved in osteoclast differentiation or function or to an abnormal medullary microenvironment . oc / oc mice display a block at the pro - b to pre - b cell transition , which is due to a defect of the bone microenvironment rather than to a cell autonomous defect of b cells , because in vitro experiments showed that b cell progenitors isolated from osteopetrotic mice were able to differentiate into immature b cells apart the alterations of b cell differentiation , kong and coauthors described a reduction in thymus size and a block of thymocyte development at the cd4cd8cd44cd25 stage . many studies have been published regarding the effects on osteoclast differentiation and function following alterations of immune cells . in particular , it was shown that animal overexpressing the transcription factor foxp3 ( forkhead box p3 ) displayed osteopetrotic phenotype with increased bone mass and reduced osteoclast number and activity . moreover in vitro experiments suggested that treg cells could inhibit osteoclast differentiation and function by suppression of cytoskeletal reorganization . bone and bone marrow can be considered as two distinct compartments of the same functional unit , the bone - bone marrow organ . indeed it was shown that dysfunction of osteoclast activity results in aberrant formation of the hsc niche , leading to retention of hsc in the spleen . the frequency and absolute number of linnegsca1ckit ( lsk cells ) were decreased by 90% and 99.8% , respectively , in the bone marrow of oc / oc mice compared to controls . this alteration was associated with a defect of mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into osteoblasts . the effect was revealed by a dramatic reduction in the expression of the osteoblast markers runx2 , alp , osteocalcin and bsp and a reduced proportion of cells expressing cd51 and the integrin 5 ( cd49e ) . the study showed that osteoclasts promote the formation of the hsc niche , regulating the osteoblast differentiation important for the niche . indeed the authors showed that the absence of osteoclast activity affects formation of the bone marrow hsc niche and impairs ability of mesenchymal stem / stromal cells to recruit hematopoietic progenitor cells . moreover the restoration of osteoclast function by treatment with cd45sca1 cells reestablishes normal levels of hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow [ 46 , 53 ] . the relationship between bone and adipose tissue is an area of intensive investigations because molecules involved in bone - fat interactions could be used as pharmacological targets to prevent osteoporosis and bone fractures . in particular , ligands for ppar- include long - chain fatty acid and synthetic compounds such as thiazolidinedione . ppar- functions are associated with activation of the adipogenesis and inhibition of the osteoblastogenesis [ 56 , 57 ] . these mice developed increased bone mass with a parallel reduction of bone marrow cavities and extramedullary hematopoiesis . indeed deletion of ppar- resulted in impaired osteoclast differentiation and activity , since it regulates c - fos expression involved in rankl signaling . demonstrated that the absence of ppar- in white adipose tissue led to lipodystrophy , increased bone mineral density , and extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen . this interplay between bone and adipose tissue has clinical important implications , since a long - term treatment with the ppar- agonist rosiglitazone in patients affected by type 2 diabetes could result in osteoporosis and bone fractures [ 54 , 58 ] .", "rare hereditary diseases inducing a bone condensation have shed new light on several aspects of bone cellular biology that were not well known . indeed the study of these diseases allowed the identification of new mechanisms of osteoclast differentiation and function and the discovery of new functions associated with the skeleton . much evidence suggests that the skeleton has a central role in bone physiology since bone disorders usually impact other organs [ 8 , 9 , 42 , 43 , 45 , 53 , 54 , 60 ] . however , there are some features of these diseases that require further investigation . for example , as in other monogenic diseases , the genotype - phenotype correlation is not always clear and consistent . indeed , the same mutations can give rise to different phenotypes , as exemplified by the clcn7 gene heterozygous mutations . efforts to identify the mutations responsible for the remaining 30% are on - going . from a pathophysiological point of view , it is worth noting that the pathologies caused by reduced osteoclastic activity such as osteopetrosis lead to frequent fractures . this might be linked to a skeleton elasticity defect , but also to an inability to repair micro damage in bones because of a lower rate of bone turnover . this situation illustrates the well - known discrepancy between the bone quantity and its resistance to mechanical stress . in contrast , pathologies caused by an increase in bone formation due to increased activity of the wnt signaling pathway ( striated osteopathy ) or to tgf activating mutations ( camurati engelmann disease ) are not associated with an increased incidence of fractures . in conclusion , further study of osteopetrosis will allow us to better understand the physiology of bone and its impact on the whole body . moreover our challenge for the future will be to identify new therapeutic approaches for this disabling disease , particularly for those forms for which only palliative intervention is currently available ."], "summary": "osteopetrosis is a rare genetic disorder characterized by an increase of bone mass due to defective osteoclast function . patients typically displayed spontaneous fractures , anemia , and in the most severe forms hepatosplenomegaly and compression of cranial facial nerves leading to deafness and blindness . osteopetrosis comprises a heterogeneous group of diseases as several forms are known with different models of inheritance and severity from asymptomatic to lethal . this review summarizes the genetic and clinical features of osteopetrosis , emphasizing how recent studies of this disease have contributed to understanding the central role of the skeleton in the whole body physiology . in particular , the interplay of bone with the stomach , insulin metabolism , male fertility , the immune system , bone marrow , and fat is described .", "ranking": [0, 3, 4, 2, 1]}

effective would be to perform the procedure as same - day surgery or so - called fast - track surgery . because it has been our observation that many children can be discharged within 24 hours after a laparoscopic appendectomy , we reviewed our records to determine its feasibility .", "a retrospective chart review was performed on 79 children who underwent a laparoscopic operation for the suspected diagnosis of acute appendicitis over a 3-year period between july 1997 and july 2000 . prior to the operation , if the diagnosis of acute appendicitis was unclear , the patients were evaluated with further laboratory and diagnostic testing , which included an abdominal computed tomography scan or ultrasound evaluation , or both of these , in select patients . laboratory information included white blood count and urinalysis , and depending on the circumstances , might also include a beta human chorionic gonadotropin and rapid streptococcal screen , as well as other tests as indicated . all patients underwent the operation while under general anesthesia , and all received a single dose of a broad - spectrum antibiotic preoperatively for wound infection prophylaxis . the standard laparoscopic operative technique was used , with either a 5-mm or 12-mm port introduced at the umbilicus after inducing pneumoperitoneum with carbon dioxide . a 0- or 30-degree laparoscopic telescope was then introduced through this port , and the abdominal and pelvic cavities were directly visualized with the laparoscope to inspect for other possible pathologies . next , two 5-mm ports were introduced under direct vision , one in the suprapubic region or the left lower quadrant and another in the right iliac fossa or in the right upper quadrant . the appendix was identified and grasped by its distal end to fully expose the entire organ and its attached structures . the appendiceal artery was isolated , ligated , and divided or cauterized . at that point , a staple line was fired across the base of the appendix by using an endoscopic stapler , or endoscopic loops were used to isolate the base of the appendix , and it was divided . if the appendix was particularly enlarged or friable , it was removed from the abdomen through the umbilical incision with the use of an endoscopic bag . all ports were removed under direct visualization , and the fascia was reapproximated to prevent future incisional hernia occurrences . if any evidence of localized or generalized peritonitis was visualized during the operation , patients were sent home on oral antibiotics , usually a 5-day course of amoxicillin plus clavulanate . if the appendix was perforated prior to removal , patients were placed on triple antibiotic coverage intravenously , which included ampicillin , gentamicin , and clindamycin for 5 days while in the hospital . if any evidence of abscess formation or peritoneal soilage was noted , the abdominal cavity was vigorously lavaged with normal saline . postoperative analgesia was obtained usually with ketorolac tromethamine and acetaminophen . to be discharged home , patients had to be tolerating oral liquids , be afebrile , and free of nausea and vomiting .", "seventy - nine children ( 44 boys and 35 girls ) between 2 to 17 years of age ( mean , 11 years ) underwent la . in 4 ( 5% ) children , all with perforated appendicitis , the la was converted to an open appendectomy , secondary to technical difficulties in completing the operation laparoscopically . at operation , 51 ( 64.5% ) had acute appendicitis , 22 ( 27.8% ) had perforated appendicitis , 4 ( 5% ) had ruptured ovarian cysts , and 2 ( 2.5% ) had no obvious pathology . total los for all 79 patients was a median of 58 hours , and median postoperative los was 35 hours . complications included wound infection , 2 ( 2.5% ) ; abdominal abscess , 4 ( 5% ) ; drug rash , 2 ; and epididymoorchitis , 1 . all but one complication ( drug rash , 1 ) occurred in the perforated group . in the 57 ( 72% ) children without perforated appendicitis , the total los was a median of 42 hours , while median postoperative los was only 28 hours . thirty - two ( 56% ) of the children without perforated appendicitis went home in 24 hours following la . no significant morbidity occurred in the nonperforated group ( drug rash , 1 ; fever > 24 hrs , 3 ) ; and no readmissions or reoperations were necessary on follow - up .", "although most appendectomies , especially in children , are not done laparoscopically , many studies have shown that laparoscopic appendectomy ( la ) is at least as good as open appendectomy ( oa ) , with several benefits , including less postoperative pain and shorter lengths of stay ( los ) . the disadvantages of la , which include increased operative time and increased cost of equipment , are easily offset by the decreased postoperative recovery time and the apparent decreased incidence of postoperative complications . additionally , it has been suggested that with increasing operative experience the operative time required for la will decrease significantly . lastly , it has been suggested that even if patients are not discharged from the hospital soon enough after la to make a significant difference between the cost of la versus oa , la has a much shorter recovery time and returns patients to a productive lifestyle sooner , thus justifying la . although most children are not working , the care - givers or parents can return to work sooner , when their child goes back to school . adult series have documented a decreased incidence of postoperative complications and a decreased incidence of wound infection after la . , in our series , 2 patients had wound infection and 4 patients developed abscesses , which is a similar complication rate to that in other series . in all instances , these complications arose in the perforated group . although perforation was at first considered a contraindication for la , it has now been utilized successfully in the management of acute appendicitis as well as perforated appendicitis . it has been suggested that thorough lavage of the abdominal cavity after appendectomy can help to decrease the incidence of abscess formation , and this is a practice that we utilize and is facilitated by the use of laparoscopy . certainly , the laparoscopic approach facilitates the complete irrigation of the abdominal cavity and identification of all loculated collections . an additional benefit of laparoscopic surgery is that it leads to greater accuracy of diagnosis , especially in teenage female patients with suspected appendicitis . in cases such as obesity and mental retardation , the diagnosis of appendicitis laparoscopy can be used to delineate the source of abdominal pain when the diagnosis of appendicitis is suspected but not certain . in 4 of our patients with the presumed diagnosis of appendicitis , intraoperative visualization revealed normal appendices , and ruptured ovarian cysts were identified as the source of their pain . obviously , all four patients were female . others have also found an increased preponderance of unclear diagnoses in the female population . in our patients , the appendix was always removed at the time of operation , despite the fact that occasionally ( in 4 patients ) the gross appearance of the appendix was normal . in the past , it has been unclear whether it would be of any benefit to the patient to remove a healthy organ , but it has been argued that with advances in laparoscopy and its proven benefit , there is no justification for leaving a visually normal appendix in place . additionally , microscopic evidence of early appendicitis is occasionally seen . in our study , it was noted that 2 visually normal appendices were found to have microscopic evidence of appendicitis . outpatient surgery has been widely accepted in a variety of procedures , and many are done laparoscopically . the idea that an appendectomy can be done in the pediatric patient as outpatient surgery is not a new one . in 1993 , ramesh and gallard suggested early discharge after open appendectomy , even within 24 hours . in another study , velhote et al also found that most children could be sent home within 24 hours after appendectomy . in that study , the appendectomy was performed through a standard gridiron incision of 2 cm or less . brosseuk and bathe suggested laparoscopic appendectomy as outpatient surgery in 1999 , and they advocated early discharge in both perforated and simple appendicitis . the fact that all major complications in our study occurred in perforated cases would argue against these cases being performed as same - day surgery , although others have disputed this approach . in our treatment protocol , perforated appendicitis would not be placed on a fast - track surgery list because these patients usually receive inpatient intravenous antibiotic therapy for 72 hours . we suggest that laparoscopic appendectomy is a safe and effective treatment in the pediatric population , and that in cases of nonperforated appendicitis this may be performed as a fast - track or short - stay procedure . we believe that this not only is more convenient for patients and their families , but it also adds to the overall cost - effectiveness of laparoscopic appendectomy . our findings are based on a retrospective review of our charts over the past 3 years , and this is an obvious criticism of the study . in no instance was it prospectively decided that the child would be discharged within 24 hours . in fact , a small number of children met exclusion criteria due to delays in discharge not related to their medical condition . we made our best attempt to identify when the order was given for the child to be released rather than the actual time that the child left the hospital . however , the documentation was occasionally unclear , and these children were excluded if it could not be ascertained exactly when the order was given or when they left the hospital . we believe that in cases of simple appendicitis , there is no reason not to dismiss a child within 24 hours if the above - mentioned discharge criteria are met . we anticipate that in the future , a greater percentage of our pediatric patients will be discharged within 24 hours , and we feel that in cases of simple appendicitis , laparoscopic appendectomy can be done as fast - track or short - stay surgery .", "it may be safely performed as fast - track or same - day surgery , in select children without perforated appendicitis , with a postoperative stay of 24 hours in the majority of such patients ."], "summary": "background : laparoscopic surgery has reduced the length of hospital stay for common operations like cholecystectomy , gastric fundoplication , and appendectomy . we have noticed a reduction in length of hospital stay for children undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy . we , therefore , looked at our data to assess whether laparoscopic appendectomy in children could be performed as fast -

related infection , pus / abscess , and hematoma / seroma ( h - s ) formation , with subsequent airway compromise.3 \n 6 surgical drains are placed in patients undergoing the sistrunk procedure to prevent these postoperative complications , but hardly any studies have overtly assessed if drain placement is actually necessary . a recent case series in a pediatric population suggests that routine drain placement may not be necessary.7 as drain placement in the sistrunk procedure may often necessitate postoperative hospitalization , leading to increased cost and patient discomfort , it is important to understand if drain placement offers any substantial advantage . the rationale of our study was to assess if drain placement in the sistrunk procedure makes any significant difference in the prognosis of postoperative complications . the issue assumes significance as a focus of head and neck surgeries ( including the sistrunk procedure ) now is shifting toward outpatient , same - day , and ambulatory surgeries.5 \n 8 \n 9 studies demonstrate same - day surgery to be a safer , less costly , and reasonable alternative to admission surgery , without increased patient risk.8 \n 9 with a general tendency to reduce hospital stays and with the sistrunk technique being increasingly performed in same - day , outpatient settings , evaluating the impact of drain placement with the technique on postoperative complications and patient morbidity is essential.5 \n 7 \n  with this objective , we conducted a retrospective study at our hospital to explore if same - day , outpatient sistrunk procedure performed without drain placement was a safe alternative versus the same procedure with drain placement . the study focused on postsurgical complications of the sistrunk procedure in both groups ( those with or without drain placement ) and evaluated whether surgical drain offered any substantial benefit in the sistrunk procedure , and if it was necessary .", "records of all patients who underwent the sistrunk procedure for tdc surgery in the preceding 10 years ( 2004 to 2014 ) were retrieved , and data were searched and extracted . in total , 80 patient records of the sistrunk procedure could be retrieved and were reviewed . certain patients were excluded to standardize the patient population and avoid any bias in the study . all those who had active infection and pus in cyst requiring incision and drainage of the cyst along with sistrunk procedure were also excluded . patients who had incomplete surgery like removal of just the cyst without the tract including the body of the hyoid ( which were documented as sistrunk but were not actually sistrunk ) were also not included . patients who in addition to sistrunk procedure also underwent other surgical procedures were excluded ( e.g. , those who underwent papillary carcinoma surgery and proceeded to the sistrunk procedure , or thyroidectomy / lymph node biopsies along with sistrunk procedure , among others ) . moreover , cases with missing data like no mention of placement or nonplacement of drain were also not included . records missing follow - up information or clues regarding complications after the sistrunk procedure were also not included . based on inclusion - exclusion criteria , of 80 records , only 58 patients were deemed fit for analysis , and the remaining 22 were excluded due to either missing data or inclusion - exclusion criteria . patients who were found suitable for analysis ( n  =  58 ) were separated into two groups : patients who did not have a drain placed ( n  =  38 ) during the sistrunk procedure , and those who had a drain placed ( n  =  20 ) . of these 58 patients , 38 were males ( 65.5% ) and 20 ( 35.5% ) were females . the age of the patients varied from 1 to 53 years , with the mean and median age of patients being 18.1 and 13.5 years , respectively . overall mean age ( sd ) was 18.1 ( 14.8 ) y and median age , 13.5 y. all patients had same - day surgery under general anesthesia . the patients came in the morning , were operated upon , and were discharged by evening after their condition stabilized . of the 58 patients , 13 ( 6 from the drain group and 7 from the no - drain group ) were admitted for 1 night and discharged the next day but for reasons unrelated to complications , apparently based on patient or surgeon preference . patient preference included those who had come from distant places and had late evening surgery , those who felt nauseous and had possibly not recovered well from anesthesia , and those who had anticipatory anxiety and reported feeling   patients who were admitted due to surgeon preference included one patient who had sickle cell anemia ( who did not have a drain ) for optimization and another patient ( who had a drain ) to observe for any anticipatory h - s . both groups of patients had homeostasis secured at time of surgery , and no major complication was noted . none of the patients developed any major complication like damage to great vessels , nerve damage , hypothyroidism , perforation of pharynx / esophagus , or injury to airway . none of the patients required any surgical exploration post  sistrunk procedure , except minor wound exploration or incision and drainage of pus . both groups of patients were reviewed , and data were extracted for various postoperative sistrunk - related complications , like presence of h - s ( and if the patients required aspiration for h - s or were managed conservatively ) , wound infection , and pus formation . of the 58 patients , 3 did not return for follow - up and were assumed to be doing fine . the extracted data were stored and analyzed using spss version 16 ( armonk , ny , ibm corp ) . pearson chi - square test was used to see the association of drain or no drain with gender , age , h - s , aspiration , wound infection , pus , and number of follow - up visits . the t test was used to compare if there was any significant difference in mean age of patients in both groups . the parametric nature of the data was accessed statistically , and normality assumption was checked before application of t test .", "overall , about 10% of patients had h - s , 6.9% of whom needed aspiration for h - s and the rest were managed conservatively ; 3.4% had wound infections ; and 1.7% had pus collection that required wound exploration or incision and drainage . the comparative overall gross percentages of complications in both groups ( drain versus no drain ) did not show any significant difference ( h - s , 0 versus 15.8% ; aspiration needed , 0 versus 10.5% ; wound infection , 5.0 versus 2.6% ; pus formation , 5 versus 0% ; respectively ) . none of the patients who were admitted overnight ( patient or surgeon preference ) developed any of the complications discussed . the chi - square test compared both group of patients in terms of any sistrunk procedure - related complications ( h - s , aspiration required , wound infection , pus , and number of follow - up visits ) . the groups did not show any statistical significant difference in sistrunk - related complications in the fisher exact ( two - sided ) test : h - s ( p  =  0.08 ) , aspiration required ( p  =  0.29 ) , wound infection ( p  >  0.99 ) , and pus formation ( p  =  0.35 ; table 2 ) . the chi - square ( two - sided ) test also did not show any statistically significant difference in number of follow - ups for both group of patients ( p  =  0.81 ; table 2 ) . the t test compared mean age difference between patients with and without drain , and no significant difference in mean age could be seen ( p  =  0.34 ; table 2 ) . abbreviations : h - s , hematoma / seroma ; ns , not significant ; sd , standard deviation . note : all percent values are within group percentages . overall mean age ( sd ) of participants was 18.09    14.84 .", "analysis of data suggests that there is no significant difference in complications post  sistrunk procedure ( infection , pus / abscess , or h - s ) between the drain and no - drain groups . furthermore , no patient admitted overnight developed any of the complications discussed , which supports our methodology because the patients were admitted for reasons not related to complications and admissions were apparently due to patient and surgeon preferences . the findings of our study resonate with that of another recently published case series , which tried to ascertain if drain placement is at all necessary with the sistrunk procedure for treating tdcs in the pediatric population.7 the case series evaluated 30 consecutive pediatric patients ( mean age 7.4 years ) who underwent the sistrunk procedure without drain placement ( study group ) . importantly , the first 10 patients were hospitalized , despite no drain placement , to observe for any complications in terms of hematomas , seromas , and subsequent airway compromise . however , when no major complications were seen , the next 20 patients undergoing the sistrunk procedure without drain placement were treated with same - day , outpatient surgery . the study also had 21 age - matched controls ( mean age 7.5 years ) who underwent the sistrunk procedure with drain placement.7 interestingly , the study did not find any statistical difference in the complication rates between the study ( no drain ) and the control ( drain ) group ( paired t test , p  =  0.85 ) . conclusively , the author stated that surgical drain placement was not necessary in pediatric patients who underwent the sistrunk procedure.7 our study ( which included both children and adults ) reinforces the same finding in a pediatric population and extends the generalizability of similar outcome in the sistrunk procedure performed in an adult population . with hardly any studies exploring the need for drain placement in the sistrunk procedure , in fact , use of drains in thyroid / parathyroid surgery has been considered controversial and debatable and may be even contraindicated.10 \n 11 it has been suggested that use of drains is not justified as drains can not substitute for meticulous use of surgical technique and adequate hemostasis , in which noncompliance would eventually still lead to h - s . rather , it has been contended that in noncomplicated surgeries with minimal drainage , placement of a drain could lead to a possible infection.12 \n 13 hence , nonusage of drains in the sistrunk procedure is not only related to reduced hospital stay , less cost , and improved patient comfort , but also has implications in terms of decreased chance of postoperative infections . though not specific to the sistrunk procedure , hurtado - lpez et al tried to analyze the actual value and effectiveness of a drain in thyroid surgery settings and found that presence or absence of drains did not affect the incidence of seroma or hematoma postsurgery.14 it is worth mentioning that although routine use of drains does not seem to be indicated in uncomplicated thyroid surgery cases , in complicated cases or when dead space is large , drains do have a use.15 the same may be applicable while using the sistrunk procedure to surgically excise and manage tdcs , and the surgeon preference for drain placement should depend on merits of its use and not on routine use in the sistrunk procedure . due to the increasing burden of extensive head and neck surgeries requiring mandatory hospitalization , smaller surgeries like the sistrunk procedure be managed as same - day , outpatient treatment . as drain placement in the sistrunk procedure may often require in - patient admission and increased hospital stay , it should not be performed if it does not offer any considerable advantage in decreasing postoperative complications . bratu and laberge evaluated same - day tdc surgery ( which included sistrunk procedure ) in 100 children in a retrospective review and found that outpatient surgery was a safe alternative to postoperative admission surgery in uncomplicated cases ( no comorbidity , congenital defect , or bleeding disorders).5 interestingly , drain placement was one of the factors that prolonged the length of hospital stay in patients . another point worth emphasizing is that 38% patients had drains placed at surgeon discretion with no further details.5 bratu and laberge also stated that outpatient , same - day surgery was safe for routine tdc excision ( including the sistrunk procedure ) , but surgeons who were reluctant to use same - day surgery due to fear of complications needed a shift in behavior to increase outpatient tdc surgery.5 this further emphasizes the rationale of performing the sistrunk procedure as same - day , outpatient surgery and emphasizes that the unnecessary routine use of drain placement with the sistrunk procedure would necessitate admission surgery leading to waste of health resources . the fact that very few complications were observed in our study even after discharge suggests that if homeostasis is adequately achieved , drain placement in sistrunk procedure may not be necessary . however , to take care of any unprecedented postoperative hematoma and/or edema and subsequent airway compromise in patients undergoing same - day , outpatient sistrunk procedure without any drain placement , the surgeon should take all precautions . all patients with tdc having same - day sistrunk procedure should be asked to report any postoperative abnormality like swelling , purulent discharge , or fever postdischarge , as soon as possible and irrespective of the scheduled follow - up . this not only would ensure optimal utilization of health care resources to manage any adverse complication ( if any arise ) but also would provide cost - benefit information and improved comfort to the patient , ensuring greater patient satisfaction and better overall management of tdcs . smaller sample size is another limitation , as complications of h - s in the sistrunk procedure are relatively rare . due to the retrospective , observational study design , with no randomization possible , there may be a risk of selection bias . although , to the best of our effort , we could not find any clinical or surgical variable to be associated with placement or nonplacement of a drain , its possibility can not be completely ruled out . furthermore , because all surgeries were performed by the consultant and residents under direct supervision of the consultant ( and consultant as first assistant ) , there does not seem to be any performance bias . apparently , drain placement with the sistrunk procedure does not seems to be determined by the person performing the surgery or the surgeon 's expertise , and rather appears to be governed by patient and surgeon preference . however , we can not deny it in absolute terms . a study with a larger sample population ideally , however , a randomized trial comparing the sistrunk procedure , with or without drain , should be performed to definitively understand if placing a drain is at all necessary in the sistrunk procedure . this would help create a protocol recommendation and consensus among surgeons managing tdcs , with respect to deciding whether or not a drain should be placed during the sistrunk procedure . to best of our knowledge , ours is the first study that has compared drain or no - drain sistrunk procedure across all age groups ; more comparative studies are needed in both pediatric as well as nonpediatric population .", "surgical placement of a drain did not seem to offer any advantage in patients undergoing the sistrunk procedure at our hospital in terms of reduced postoperative complications . hence , there does not seem to be any apparent need for drain placement when performing the sistrunk procedure in patients with tdcs . moreover , because no major complications were observed in surgically managing uncomplicated cases of tdcs by same - day , outpatient sistrunk procedure without drain placement , it could be considered a safe alternative to the sistrunk procedure with drain placement , which may require overnight hospitalization / admission . this would translate into better patient comfort , greater satisfaction , and reduced surgical costs in patients of tdcs undergoing the sistrunk procedure ."], "summary": "introduction  same - day , outpatient sistrunk procedure is commonly performed to manage thyroglossal duct cyst anomalies and may lead to postoperative complications . surgical drains are placed to prevent complications , but recent observations show no advantage and rather increased health care costs and patient discomfort . objective  the study evaluated if drain placement in the sistrunk procedure offers any benefit on postoperative complications . methods  a retrospective analysis of patient records having undergone same - day , outpatient sistrunk procedure from 2004 to 2014 was done . of 58 ( 38 male and 20 female ) patients included , 38 did not have drains placed and the remaining 20 had drains placed . mean and median age of patients was 18.1 and 13.5 years , respectively . postoperative complications of patients with drains versus those without drains were statistically analyzed . results  overall , about 10% of patients had hematoma / seroma ( h - s ) , with 6.9% of patients needing aspiration for h - s ; 3.4% had wound infections ; and 1.7% had pus formation . no statistically significant differences in sistrunk - related complications between patient groups ( with drain or without drain ) were seen using fisher exact ( two - sided ) test : h - s ( p  =  0.08 ) ; need for aspiration ( p  =  0.29 ) ; wound infection ( p  >  0.05 ) ; and pus formation ( p  =  0.35 ) . chi - square test also did not show any significant difference in the groups in terms of number of follow - ups . conclusion  surgical placement of a drain in the sistrunk procedure does not seem to offer any advantage in terms of reducing common postoperative complications . same - day sistrunk procedure without any drain placement may be a safer alternative without necessitating hospitalization . more studies with larger sample size are needed for further substantiation .", "ranking": [0, 1, 3, 4, 2]}
{"id": "PMC3665035", "section_names": ["INTRODUCTION", "METHODS", "RESULTS", "DISCUSSION", "CONCLUSION"], "document": ["every year , a large number of athletes experience knee trauma during training session and competitions . the anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) is the most commonly injured ligament of the knee , which mainly affects patients between 15 and 45 years of age . . however , non - contact condition is more prevalent.[14 ] the acl rupture can occur not only as a sole event but also in association with the rupture of meniscus and other ligaments.[57 ] while the reconstruction of an injured acl is considered as one of the most important procedures in sport injury , the optimal timing for the operation remains uncertain . the safety and efficacy of the timing of the operation is controversial . it appears that some consensus has been achieved on this issue with more surgeons waiting for the resolution of the acute hemarthrosis and the restoration of normal gait and range of movement before performing the surgery . it has also been suggested that any undue delay in surgery may lead to an increase in meniscal pathology such as experiencing recurrent episodes of giving ways , which could damage the articular surface . the timing of surgery is of importance in counseling patients regarding the outcome of surgery and could be of particular interest while treating patients within a healthcare system with limited resources . recent long - term clinical researches have pointed out the increased risk of secondary meniscal damage and chondral lesion in patients with chronic acl deficiency.[1113 ] the present study , therefore , was designed to evaluate the association between acl deficiency and its impact on meniscal and articular cartilage injury among groups of professional iranian athletes and also to determine whether there is a correlation between the timing of reconstruction and these types of injuries .", "the present retrospective study was conducted on the medical records of 616 consecutive professional athletes gathered from referral hospitals between 1995 and 2009 . based on these records , the studied athletes had visited a single orthopedic surgeon ( m.r . ) because of knee injury and they were diagnosed with acl tear , which was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and arthroscopy . athletes who were injured through a non - exercise mechanism such as experiencing a car accident , those experiencing concomitant acl tear and tibia or fibula fracture , and those with a positive history of meniscal tear in the same leg were excluded . the demographic information of the athletes including their age , gender , the injured leg , the sport in which they were involved , the duration between the time of injury and the surgery , and the injured ligaments was recorded in a questionnaire . the sport in which the athletes were involved consisted of soccer , wrestling , ball games ( handball , volleyball , and basketball ) , martial arts , and others ( ski , tennis , table tennis , running , badminton , skating , etc . ) . the duration between the time of injury and that of surgery was classified as <3 months ( group a ) , 3 - 6 months ( group b ) , 6 - 9 months ( group c ) , 9 - 18 months ( group d ) , 18 - 36 months ( group e ) , and > 36 months ( group f ) . in cases with meniscal tear , the data on individuals with total meniscus injury regardless of their grade were entered and those with partial tears were excluded . severity of chondral pathology was divided into two groups : low graded groups ( type 1 and 2 ) and high grade groups ( type 3 and 4 ) . chi - square test was used to evaluate the correlation between the presence of the meniscal tear , chondral damage , and the duration between the time of injury and that of surgery .", "overall , 564 ( 91.6% ) out of a total of 616 athletes with acl tear enrolled in this study were male . table 1 outlines the gender distribution and the sports in which the athletes were involved . the frequency of athletes involved in different sports the single acl injury was reported in 103 ( 16.7% ) of the athletes . medial meniscus injuries were more prevalent than lateral meniscus injuries among our professional athletes . the incidence of medial and lateral meniscus injury in different sports also , 115 ( 18.7% ) of athletes had chondral lesions . among them , there was no significant association between chondral pathology and sex of the athletes ( pv > 0.05 ) . after an interval of 6 months , there was a significant increase in the prevalence of chondral lesions ( chi square test , p = 0.008 ) [ table 3 ] . the incidence and severity of chondral injuries among 6 groups based on what was reported and identification by mri and arthroscopic findings , medial femoral condyl showed more prevalent chondral injuries ( 58.11% ) than lateral side due to acl deficiency . the prevalence of medial and lateral menisci tears within the groups is presented in table 4 . considering the gathered information , the severity of tears in the medial meniscus increases over time since the injury .", "the present study was conducted on 616 athletes involved in different sports diagnosed with acl tear based on the findings of clinical examination , mri , and arthroscopy . the first strength of our study lies in the ability of examining a large group of patients by a single surgeon ( m.r . ) . this is of great importance since the identification of pathology during knee arthroscopy has been shown to be related to the observer 's capability . we found an increased incidence of medial meniscal tears if the interval between the injury and reconstruction process was > 3 months . a significant reduction was also found in the number of patients with normal articular surfaces after a delay of 6 months in the time of operation . prade et al . , reported a relatively higher prevalence ( 44% ) of single acl tear among patients with acute knee injuries accompanied with hemarthrosis over a 90-days period . similarly , frobell et al . , reported the prevalence of acl rupture in the general population to be about 30% , which was higher than previously described . the difference between the diagnostic methods was considered as the main reason contributing to the discrepancies reported in these studies . in other words , while mri was used to detect acl tear in the abovementioned studies , our patients were diagnosed by clinical examination , mri , and arthroscopic evaluations . the higher accuracy of the diagnostic procedures in our study accounts for the reduced number of single acl tear and increased rate of combined meniscal and/or chondral injuries . the other possibility for having differences of the prevalence of single acl tear in our population is on the basis of late referral of athletes to orthopedic surgeon . it can extend their knee complications and decrease the rate of single acl tear . based on our findings , there was an association between delayed reconstruction and an increased incidence of medial meniscus tear and chondral pathology after 3 and 6 months , respectively , which is clinically important . to our knowledge , few studies have investigated the relationship between a delay in reconstruction and the incidence of secondary pathologies . in line with the results published by papastergiou et al . , our finding showed the association between acl tear and meniscus injury 3 months after the events . it could be concluded that the rate of secondary meniscus injury increases over time and , therefore , the operation should be performed within 3 months of the injury . while rocha et al . , described similar findings , they noted a higher rate of lateral meniscus injury within the first 3 months of acl tear . they examined the incidence of meniscal tears based on the interval between the injury and operation , but failed to assess the possible changes in the articular surface . they found an increased incidence of both medial and lateral meniscal tears when the operation was postponed beyond 3 months . due to the fact that most of the elite players are expected to continue their participation in competitions of the league despite of their injury , serious rehabilitation will be achieved for their recovery . therefore , after rehabilitation process and reducing their pain and effusion , pseudo well - being and self confidence will occur . these athletes believed that the recovery of acl tearing was completed and they could continue their playing without any treatment for their knee . but , unfortunately , this type of estimation will increase the chance of severe injury , especially meniscal tear . the incidence of chondral lesion among our population increased as the interval between injury and reconstruction was > 6 months . church and keating reviewed 187 patients and found a significant increase in degenerative changes of grade 1 to 4 ( 31.3% vs 10.7% ) and also in the overall incidence of meniscal tears among those who had undergone late reconstruction ( after > 12 months of injury ) . based on our findings , significant changes in the articular surface of the injured knee starts in less than a year . it has been suggested that patients with acl deficiency dispose to the development of chondral injuries in weight bearing activities due to excessive anterior tibial translation and rotational instability in their injured knee . in a similar study conducted by murell et al . , the injuries to the medial condyl of femur were more prevalent than other parts of condyls . it is believed that the increased shear stresses on the meniscus and the application of greater weight - bearing loads on the articular surface ( unconditioned cartilage region ) , which was not previously functionally loaded , may account for the abnormal translation and rotational motions following acl injury . moreover , opposite to the constantly changing , contact points of the tibio  femoral articulation in a normal knee ( rollback ) , the femur in an acl - deficient knee may remain in contact with a section of the articular surface of tibia , resulting in point - loading with non - physiological loads , leading to degeneration process and chondral damage . in their finite element analysis of the kinematic changes related to acl deficiency , confirmed this hypothesis . barker et al . , found that the relative internal rotation of the tibia secondary to acl injury results in an increased cartilage loss especially in the medial compartment of the injured knee . this finding is believed to be secondary to a shift of load bearing to the thinner regions of articular cartilage . despite the increased risk of chondral injuries secondary to a delay of > 6 months in the time of surgery , there was a peak of high - grade chondral lesion among athletes operated in the first 3 months . acute chondral injuries have been reported in 20% of acl tears ; however , many authors believe that the common pattern of bone bruise , known as post - truamatic bone marrow lesions , represent occult damage to the cartilage secondary to the compressive force imposed on the joint surface at the time of the acl tear.[2426 ] one of our limitations include low number of female athletes in the study . as the number of professional female athletes is lower than in some other countries , there are not many high - level competitions ; similarly , international competition is subject to considerable limitation . therefore , we could not compare our results about women 's sports to that in other studies .", "in conclusion , based on our findings , in order to reduce the chance of the occurrence of instability induced medial meniscal tears and chondral lesions , reconstruction should be performed before 6 months after injury . it is recommended that surgical reconstruction should be performed instantaneously after conduction of intensive rehabilitation program , psychological preparation , and economical support . due to the fact that the return to play is one of the most imperative and challenging subjects in sports medicine field , identifying it seems that time preparation to improve patients ' compliance to surgery takes between 3 weeks to 3 months ."], "summary": "background : to review a single -

the skin incision from the previous endoscopic phase is used . the ureter is dissected along and under the iliac vessels with a harmonic scalpel or ligasure advance or blunt tip 35 mm . this phase is delicate due to the relatively narrow operation space and the close relation of iliac vessels and the bowel . the ureter is completely separated and the hem - o - lok clip must be clearly visible to constitute proof of completion of the ureterectomy .", "a few points to emphasize include : four complications ( clavien ii 2x , iiib and v )    wound infection at the site of extraction ( staphylococcus aureus ) , urine leakage from the pelvic drain for 6 days ( bladder catheter was removed on the 8 postoperative day following cystoradiography that did not reveal leakage ) , one open prostatectomy on the 2 postoperative day because of an enlarged prostate ( bph with hematuria ) , and one patient died of heart failure on the day of operation . in four cases ( 19.0% ) application of the clip failed and clnue was concluded with a non - occluded ureter and the risk of dissemination of tumor cells in urine paravesically . in the first case the patient had a ureteral stent and the ureter was incrassate , which is why we did not want to apply 10 mm port to facilitate the introduction of the hem - o - lok clip size l. in another case , the stented ureter was also incrassate and we introduced a 10 mm port to the urinary bladder and applied a size l clip without difficulty . there was one incidence with the inability to grasp the ureter by endoscopic forceps . in two cases the laparoscopic nephrectomy was converted to the open surgery ( flank incision and lumbolaparotomy )  in one case this was due to extensive adhesions in the abdominal cavity ( a history of open cholecystectomy with evacuation of subphrenic abscess ) , and in the other two cases it was due to advanced tumor growth with perirenal and periureteral adhesions . in three cases , laparoscopic nephrectomy was followed by open distal ureterectomy with the standard pluck method , because the laparoscopic approach was not feasible due to poor access of the laparoscopic instruments to the small pelvis . four patients with non - ut histology were judged to be ut by preoperative imaging . follow - up ( mean 10 , range : 0 - 22 months ) , including results of the control endoscopy , are known in all patients . one patient with uc of the renal pelvis pt2n0m0g2 had uc in the contralateral distal ureter and died after 11 months due to extensive metastatic disease , mainly to bone . \n  abbreviations : ae  adrenalectomy for adenoma , bcg  history of intravesical instillation of bcg , bt  urinary bladder tumor , eskd  end - stage kidney disease , l  left , m  male , mo  right , turb  transurethral resection of bladder tumor , up - um  ureter proximal - middle , uc  notes : all cases were n0m0 ;

's idea [ 18 , 19 ] of endoscopically closing the excised ureter with lockable clip to be excellent , although the introduction of the hem - o - lok clip via endoscope appears to be difficult . pathak et al . performed their technique in 25 cases with a mean total operative time of 164 ( range : 105 - 235 ) minutes . no pelvic complications in were reported and there were no perivesical tumor recurrences with mean follow - up of 26 ( range : 11 - 44 ) months . we have decided to apply the hem - o - lok clip size ml via an intravesical 5 mm port introduced through the suprapubic area . regarding our first nine cases , we had found the exact same method described in the literature . suprapubic transvesical single - port technique for control of lower end of ureter during laparoscopic nephroureterectomy  . the dissected nephroureterectomy specimen during the operation . the tumor can be seen in the upper calyx with hem - o - lok size ml at the end of the ureter ( see detail ) . reportedly , occlusion of the ureter may be performed instead of clip with electro - coagulation only ( it is probably less reliable ) or with fibrin sealant injection .", "clnue- ivlc is a relatively simple , reproducible , and minimally invasive method with minimal risks of tumor spillage and seeding . the main disadvantage seems to be the risk of an unclosed defect of the urinary bladder , but based on our own experience , as reported in this paper and the available literature , we have not found any significant complications emerging from this . another disadvantage is failure in applying the hem - o - lok clip , in which the technique is concluded without closing the ureter , and is generally thought to carry a higher risk of extravesical tumor recurrence , but as described recently , this technique has comparable oncological results to the open distal ureterectomy [ 3 , 6 ] . failures in clip application were experienced only in early cases and , with increasing experience , this problem was avoided . importantly , if needed , the endoscopic phase can be transformed to open nue or it can be combined primarily with open surgery . some may consider conversion to open distal ureterectomy / nephrectomy as a failure of the method . the method whereby closing of the ureter is performed allows the procedure ( nue ) to be completed safely in complicated cases ( obesity , advanced cases , previous intraabdominal surgery etc . ) ."], "summary": "introductionwe present a cohort of patients with low - stage pelviureteric neoplastic disease who underwent complete laparoscopic nephroureterectomy ( clnue ) with intravesical lockable clip ( ivlc ) . due to the absence of a standard technique of nue , the study was not randomized.materialsfrom 1/2010 to 1/2012 , 21 patients were subjected to clnue - ivlc . the first step was transurethral excision of the ureterovesical junction with collin 's knife deep into the paravesical adipose tissue . the ureter was grasped with biopsy forceps and the distal end of the ureter was occluded with lockable clip . the applicator was introduced through a 5 mm port inserted as an epicystostomy . the patients were rotated to flank position and clnue followed . the endoscopically introduced clip on the distal ureter is proof of completion of the total ureterectomy.resultsthe mean operation time was 161 ( 115 - 200 ) min . in four ( 19.0% ) , the application of the clip failed and clnue was completed with non - occluded ureter . in three cases , subsequent laparoscopic nephrectomy was converted to open surgery . in two cases , the distal ureterectomy was completed with pluck technique through a lower abdominal incision that was also used for extraction of the specimen . there were four complications ( clavien ii 2x , iiib , v ) . follow - up was available for all  mean 10.6 ( range : 0 - 25 ) months . one died of disease generalization within 11 months.conclusionclnue-ivlc is fast and safe . if needed , the endoscopic phase can be switched to open nue . disadvantages include : the need to change the position of the patient , the risk of inability to apply the clip on the distal ureter , and the risk of an unclosed defect of the urinary bladder .", "ranking": [0, 4, 2, 3, 1]}

Conclusions"], "document": ["type 1 diabetes ( t1d ) is an autoimmune disease characterized by t cell - mediated destruction of the pancreatic islet beta cells . multiple genetic loci contribute to t1d susceptibility in humans , with the most responsible locus being the major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) . the ability of certain class ii mhc genes to influence disease risk has long been appreciated [ 2 , 3 ] . multiple studies have also revealed an association with certain class i mhc alleles , including the common hla - a02:01 [ 413 ] . these findings are not surprising , given that cd4 and cd8 t cell responses to a variety of beta cell antigens , including insulin , are observed in t1d patients . after the mhc , the locus that confers the strongest susceptibility to t1d in humans is the variable number of tandem repeats ( vntr ) regulatory region of the insulin gene [ 1 , 15 ] . vntr alleles with the smallest number of repeats , designated as class i , predispose to t1d [ 16 , 17 ] , while the longer class iii alleles have a dominant protective effect [ 15 , 18 ] . class iii vntr alleles are associated with thymic insulin rna levels that are increased two- to threefold compared to class i alleles , leading to the hypothesis that impaired negative selection of insulin - specific t cells in individuals with class i vntr alleles explains their predisposition to t1d [ 19 , 20 ] . while findings from a single human study are consistent with this idea , the development of a mouse model for t1d that incorporates the reduced , but not abolished , thymic insulin expression observed in patients would allow for more rigorous future testing of this hypothesis . the nod mouse is the primary rodent model used for studying t1d . unlike humans , while both genes are expressed in beta cells , ins2 expression predominates in the thymus [ 2427 ] , with little   to no [ 2527 ] detectable thymic ins1 expression . ins2-deficient ( ins2 ) nod mice develop diabetes at an accelerated rate [ 2830 ] , as do hla - a02:01-transgenic ins2 nod mice , and both ins2-deficient strains have increased insulin - specific islet - infiltrating cd8 t cells compared to their wild - type ( wt ) counterparts . while these ins2 mouse strains highlight the importance of thymic insulin expression , they do not accurately represent a human patient , where thymic insulin expression is diminished but still present [ 19 , 20 ] . here we have developed an hla - a02:01-transgenic nod - based t1d model that is heterozygous ( het ) for the ins2 allele , resulting in thymic insulin expression that is decreased but not eliminated . the mice develop accelerated disease compared to ins2 mice , and this is true regardless of gender . immune cell populations are not grossly altered , and the mice exhibit typical signs of islet autoimmunity , including cd8 t cell responses to beta cell peptides also targeted in hla -

a02:01 . the 3 , transmembrane , and cytoplasmic portions of the molecule are derived from h-2d . mouse class i mhc molecules are not expressed in these mice due to the murine 2 m deficiency . the resulting progeny were bred as appropriate to obtain ins2 and ins2 nod.2m.hhd mice for our studies . female 2 m mice breed poorly in our hands and so were rarely used for this purpose . similarly , nod and nod.ins2 mice were intercrossed and the resulting progeny bred as appropriate to obtain ins2 and ins2 nod mice . the hhd transgene and the wt and ko 2 m and ins2 alleles were identified by pcr using the following primer pairs : hhd , 5-cttcatcgcagtgggctac-3 and 5-cggtgagtctgtgagtggg-3 ; 2 m , 5-gaaacccctcaaattcaagtatactca-3 and 5-gacggtcttgggctcggccatact-3 ; 2 m , 5-gaaacccctcaaattcaagtatactca-3 and 5-tcgaattcgccaatgacaagacgct-3 ; ins2 , 5-ggcagagaggaggtgctttg-3 and 5-agaaaaccaccagggtagttagc-3 ; ins2 , 5-ggcagagaggaggtgctttg-3 and 5-attgaccgtaatgggatagg-3. all animal experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of albert einstein college of medicine . female ins2 and ins2 nod.2m.hhd mice ( four each ) were sacrificed and thymus was harvested . total thymic rna was isolated using the rneasy midi kit ( qiagen , valencia , ca ) and treated with dnase i ( qiagen ) to eliminate dna contamination . 1.52.3  g of rna was reverse - transcribed to cdna using random hexadeoxynucleotides and oligo dt primers ( invitrogen ) . equal amounts of cdna were mixed with sybr green pcr master mix ( qiagen ) and each ins2 primer ( 5-cttcttctacacacccatgtcc-3 and 5-tctacaatgccacgcttctg-3 ) or primers for the u6 normalization control ( 5-ctcgcttcggcagcacatatacta-3 and 5-acgaatttgcgtgtcatccttgcg-3 ) and brought to a final volume of 25  l . real -

b220 , anti - cd11c , anti - cd4 , and anti - cd8 ( all from bd biosciences , san jose , ca ) . in some samples , cells were stained with anti - cd25 ( bd biosciences ) , fixed and permeabilized with fixation / permeabilization buffer ( ebioscience , san diego , ca ) , and stained with anti - foxp3 ( ebioscience ) . to assess insulitis in female nod.2m.hhd and nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mice at 4 and 8 weeks of age , pancreata were fixed in bouin 's solution , embedded in paraffin , and sectioned at nonoverlapping levels . sections were stained with aldehyde fuchsine to readily visualize granulated beta cells and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin for detection of leukocytes . islets were scored as previously described : 0 , no insulitis ; 1 , local insulitis without infiltration of islet itself ; 2 , less than 25% infiltration ; 3 , 2575% infiltration ; or 4 , greater than 75% infiltration . an insulitis index was calculated by adding the scores of all islets and dividing by four times the number of islets scored . islets were isolated from female nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mice at 8 weeks of age by collagenase p perfusion of the common bile duct as previously described . islets were handpicked using a micromanipulator and a dissecting microscope and up to 50 islets were transferred per well to 24-well plates in 500  l r-10 medium ( rpmi 1640 ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) containing 10% fbs , 1  mm sodium pyruvate , 28  m -mercaptoethanol , 1x nonessential amino acids ( invitrogen ) ) with 50  u / ml recombinant human il-2 ( peprotech , rocky hill , nj ) . cells were cultured for 7 days at 37c in 5% co2 , at which point the majority of the cells are expected to be cd8 t cells . human hla -

derived hla - a02:01-binding peptide ( slyntvatl ) . the cutoff for positivity is a stimulation index greater than 2 and a test peptide spot number greater than 5 per 1  10 t cells .", "a previous study had demonstrated that ins2 mice of mixed , but primarily c57bl/6 , background experience a reduction in thymic insulin expression of approximately 40% . to develop a mouse model of t1d having reduced thymic insulin quantity , and also expressing the human class i mhc molecule hla - a02:01 , we generated nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mice . using quantitative rt - pcr , we similarly found a reduction in thymic insulin expression of 35% in female ins2 compared to ins2 mice ( n = 4 mice of each genotype ) . both female ( figure 1(a ) ) and male nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mice ( figure 1(b ) ) demonstrated accelerated diabetes development compared to their ins2 counterparts . female nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mice developed diabetes as early as 9 weeks of age and all were diabetic by 27 weeks ( figure 1(a ) ) . the first onset of diabetes in ins2 female mice was at 11 weeks , and only 47% developed diabetes by 30 weeks . as also seen in standard nod males [ 39 , 40 ] , diabetes development was slowed and overall incidence was reduced in nod.2m.hhd males ( figure 1(b ) ) compared to females . however , ins2 males exhibited an earlier onset of disease compared to ins2 males ( 10 weeks versus 17 weeks ) , and a larger percentage ( 56% versus 24% ) had developed diabetes by 30 weeks of age ( figure 1(b ) ) . thus , both genders of nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mice faithfully model the circumstance in humans where reduced thymic insulin expression is predisposing to t1d [ 16 , 17 ] . note that this is not what we observed in the case of nod.ins2 mice , where both female ( figure 2(a ) ) and male ins2 mice ( figure 2(b ) ) exhibit a diabetes profile that is statistically indistinguishable from that of nod mice . to verify that the accelerated diabetes development observed in nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mice could not be attributed to a gross alteration in immune cell populations , we examined the splenocyte composition of 8-week - old female nondiabetic nod.2m.hhd and nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mice ( figure 3(a ) ) . it was previously shown that nod.2m.hhd mice have a reduced cd8 t cell population and elevated b and cd4 t cells compared to standard nod mice . this was also true for nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mice , and no differences were observed in any of the cell types analyzed as a percentage of total cells . to investigate whether a reduction in regulatory t cells ( treg ) might contribute to disease pathogenesis in the ins2 mice , nod.2m.hhd and nod.2m.hhd.ins2 splenocytes were monitored for expression of the characteristic treg cell phenotype , cd4cd25foxp3 . no difference was observed in treg cells as a percentage of cd4 t cells ( figure 3(b ) ) . these results indicate that the accelerated diabetes development seen in nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mice is the result of neither an altered immune cell composition nor reduced treg cells , at least at the level investigated here , that is , without regard to antigenic specificity . in mixed background mice carrying zero , one , or two copies of the ins2 gene , furthermore , ins2 mice perform identically to their ins2 counterparts in intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests . thus , we hypothesized that the diabetes observed in nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mice was of an autoimmune nature , as is the case for the nod.2m.hhd parent strain , and not a deficiency in pancreatic insulin production due to the presence of only one functional copy of the ins2 gene . to verify this , histological sections of pancreata from female mice at 4 and 8 weeks of age were examined . all mice studied exhibited some degree of insulitis , which progressed significantly with age ( figure 3(c ) ) , and islets showing a wide range of immune cell infiltration and beta cell destruction were observed ( figure 3(c ) ) . we previously identified several hla - a02:01-restricted beta cell epitopes , derived from the autoantigens insulin and islet - specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit - related protein ( igrp ) that are recognized by islet - infiltrating t cells from nod.2m.hhd mice [ 31 , 42 ] . to further confirm the autoimmune nature of the diabetes observed in nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mice , islets from 8-week - old females were cultured for 7 days and t cell reactivity to the previously identified beta cell epitopes was monitored by ifn elispot . all mice harbored autoreactive t cells specific for at least two epitopes ( figure 3(d ) ) , further confirming the autoimmune nature of their disease . a subset of these epitopes ( ins b514 , igrp 228236 , and igrp 265273 ) have previously been shown to be recognized by cd8 t cells in hla - a02:01-positive t1d patients [ 4346 ] , supporting the clinical relevance of the model .", "insulin is an important autoantigen recognized by t cells in both human t1d and the nod mouse model of the disease . reduced thymic insulin expression is associated with susceptibility to t1d in patients [ 16 , 17 , 19 , 20 ] , suggesting that impaired negative selection of t cells specific for insulin is responsible for this predisposition . here we have developed and characterized nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mice as a model of t1d that incorporates reduced thymic insulin . we find that , as in patients , disease is accelerated ( figure 1 ) , and we suggest these mice as a new diabetes model that can be used to better understand this phenomenon . the nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mice present advantages over other disease models that have been described for this purpose . for example , thymic insulin expression is abolished in nod.ins2 and nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mice , and both exhibit accelerated t1d [ 2830 ] and increased insulin - specific islet - infiltrating cd8 t cells   when compared to their ins2 counterparts . while these findings suggest the importance of thymic insulin expression , ins2 models do not accurately represent patients , where thymic insulin expression is reduced , but not eliminated [ 19 , 20 ] . as for nod.ins2 mice , in our hands two earlier studies of nod.ins2 mice also showed no effect on disease in males [ 29 , 30 ] , and only one of the two showed acceleration in females . in contrast , both male and female nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mice show enhanced disease ( figure 1 ) . indeed , the female and male incidence curves are nearly overlapping until 15 weeks of age ( cf . these studies should include the quantification of insulin - specific effector t cells and treg and analysis of their phenotype and function . the recently described ability to isolate insulin - specific cd4 t cells from nod mouse strains using enrichment with peptide / mhc tetramer reagents will facilitate this work . in nod mice , establishment of immunological tolerance to insulin can lead to prevention of t1d [ 4951 ] and remission of established disease . because of these findings , there is great interest in immunological interventions for human t1d that seek to manipulate the t cell response to insulin . the nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mouse strain should be considered as an additional preclinical model to be used to evaluate such therapies , as it incorporates aspects of the human disease that are not represented in standard nod mice , including reduced thymic insulin expression . in humans , vntr alleles associated with diminished thymic insulin have been shown to alter the frequency and avidity of insulin - specific t cells , both of which could reasonably influence the outcome of therapies designed to manipulate the immune response to insulin . given that human insulin - specific cd8 t cells have been shown to have cytotoxic activity against islets , an additional advantage of the nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mouse model is the expression of the t1d - predisposing human class i mhc allele hla - a02:01 [ 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 ] , which we have shown as supporting the development of t cells specific for hla - a02:01-restricted insulin epitopes in these mice ( figure 3(d ) ) . in terms of insulin - specific cd4 t cells , the class ii mhc allele expressed in the nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mice is i - a , which is structurally similar to the human t1d - predisposing hla - dq8 [ 55 , 56 ] . indeed , i - a and hla - dq8 are capable of presenting similar peptides [ 5759 ] . the nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mouse therefore has a variety of potential uses as a humanized model of t1d , including cd8 and cd4 t cell epitope identification , analysis of the relationship between thymic insulin expression and tolerance , and the evaluation of antigen - specific immunotherapies , particularly those targeting the immune response to insulin .", "nod.2m.hhd.ins2 mice represent a model for t1d that incorporates the reduced , but not abolished , thymic insulin expression observed in patients . this model should find utility in investigations to probe the mechanisms underlying the association between reduced thymic insulin expression and t1d in humans . it will also be an important tool for t cell epitope discovery and for the preclinical evaluation of insulin - targeted immunotherapies for the disease ."], "summary": "type 1 diabetes ( t1d ) is an autoimmune disease characterized by t cell - mediated destruction of the pancreatic islet beta cells . multiple genetic loci contribute to disease susceptibility in humans , with the most responsible locus being the major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) . certain mhc alleles are predisposing , including the common hla - a02:01 . after the mhc , the locus conferring the strongest susceptibility to t1d is the regulatory region of the insulin gene , and alleles associated with reduced thymic insulin expression are predisposing . mice express two insulin genes , ins1 and ins2 . while both are expressed in beta cells , only ins2 is expressed in the thymus . we have developed an hla - a02:01-transgenic nod - based t1d model that is heterozygous for a functional ins2 gene . these mice exhibit reduced thymic insulin expression and accelerated disease in both genders . immune cell populations are not grossly altered , and the mice exhibit typical signs of islet autoimmunity , including cd8 t cell responses to beta cell peptides also targeted in hla - a02:01-positive type 1 diabetes patients . this model should find utility as a tool to uncover the mechanisms underlying the association between reduced thymic insulin expression and t1d in humans and aid in preclinical studies to evaluate insulin -
