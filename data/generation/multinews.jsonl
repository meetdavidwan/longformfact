{"document": ["Fidget spinners are one of the hottest new trends of the year, but ahead of the holiday shopping season, a new report by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy organization, says testing found dangerous levels of lead in some. \n \n The safety group is not aware of any reported cases of kids getting lead poisoning from fidget spinners, but they urge awareness and transparency on the part of the retailers, especially when putting the items in children's toy sections, reports CBS News correspondent Anna Werner. \n \n The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there is no safe level of lead when it comes to children. It can cause serious health problems, including brain damage. It's something a mother from Portland learned the hard way, and now she is trying to help other parents. \n \n \"You don't know what that means the first time you hear that your kid has lead poisoning,\" Tamara Rubin said. \n \n CBS News \n \n Rubin said her sons still suffer debilitating effects from lead exposure in their home 12 years ago, when she says contractors used unsafe methods to remove lead paint. Now, the mother of four helps other parents learn more about products that may contain lead. \n \n Her \"Lead Safe Mama\" Facebook page has more than 15,000 followers. She tests consumer products that concerned parents send to her, including hundreds of fidget spinners. She said many of them had concerning levels of lead. \n \n \"It's on the center, it's the part you're interacting with so it's definitely a hazard for children,\" Rubin said. \n \n Rubin's blog caught the attention of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. They tested 12 fidget spinners found in children's toy aisles in Target stores across the country. \n \n \n \n Two of the products tested with high levels of lead. One contained levels reaching 33,000 parts per million. That's 300 times higher than the legal limit for children's products. \n \n \"They should take these toys off the shelves,\" said Kara Cook Schultz, U.S. PIRG's toxics program director. \n \n \"The reason that lead is a large concern \u2013 especially in children's products \u2013 is that when children are exposed to high levels of lead they can experience things like memory loss, learning disabilities,\" she said. \n \n Tamara Rubin \n \n When the group contacted Target and asked them to take the product off the shelves, Target declined, saying the two products are not designed for children. \n \n According to the packaging, they are marked for ages 14 and up, and Target says, \"They are not defined by the Consumer Product Safety Commission as toys\" and as a result \"are not required to meet children's product standards.\" \n \n The toy's manufacturer, Bulls-i-Toy, similarly stated in a letter to the safety group: \"The products in question are clearly labeled 'ages 14+'\u2026there are no mandatory CPSC (Consumer Product Safety Commission) requirements for it.\" \n \n The CPSC says fidget spinners marketed to children under the age of 12 would be subject to federal testing regulations including lead testing, but those marketed for use over age 12 are considered \"general use products,\" which would not be subject to those same tests. U.S. PIRG is pushing to change the guidelines for these popular gadgets. \n \n CBS News reached out to Bulls-i-Toy for comment but has not heard back.", "- High levels of lead have been found in one of the more popular gadgets this year: fidget spinners. \n \n In recent lab results, the U.S. PIRG Education Fund found two fidget spinners sold at Target have \u201cextremely high levels of lead.\u201d The advocacy group requested Target and its developer, Bulls i Toys, LLC to recall the products and investigate the how lead seeped into them. \n \n The two fidget spinners containing the lead are, \u201cFidget Wild Premium Spinner Brass,\u201d and \u201cFidget Wild Premium Spinner Metal.\u201d \n \n According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, lead's toxicity resulted in its ban in household paints and products marketed to children in 1978. Exposure to children is damaging because it can impact development, and any amount of lead in a child\u2019s blood is unsafe. It can affect nearly every body system. \n \n U.S. PIRG also called on the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to reclassify fidget spinners as toys, rather than its current category of general use products. The organization argues that the two fidget spinners are marketed towards children. On Target\u2019s website, the \u201cFidget Wild Premium Spinner Bass\u201d is recommended for ages 14 and over, as well as, 6 and over. \n \n CPSC could hold the products to federal standards for lead if classified as a toy. Children products must not contain more than 100 parts per million (ppm) of total lead in \"accessible parts,\" according to federal requirements. \n \n In the report, the lab results were tested twice to confirm the results. For the \"Fidget Wild Premium Spinner Brass,\" the center circle tested for 33,000 ppm of lead, and the arm tested for 22,000 ppm of lead. The center circle of the \"Fidget Wild Premium Spinner Metal\" was tested for 1,300 ppm of lead and the arm tested for 520 ppm of lead. \n \n While U.S. PIRG notified the CPSC, the agency held firm that the fidget spinners are not toys. \n \n In the meantime, U.S. PIRG still recommends for adults and children to stop using the fidget spinners. The report did not address whether there have been any injuries after a product purchase. \n \n View the full report here.", "These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

This inexpensive and addictive little toy is already the topic of choking hazard warnings by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. And Thursday morning the US Public Interest Research Group revealed that some of the spinners sold at Target (TGT) contain dangerously high levels of lead. \n \n The Fidget Wild Premium Spinner Brass tested at 33,000 parts per million for lead -- some 300 times the 100 parts per million allowable for children's toys. The lead level in another model, the Fidget Wild Premium Spinner in Metal, tested at 1,300 parts per million. \n \n The response from Target and the manufacturer: These particular spinners are recommended for consumers over the age of 14. That means CPSC lead restrictions for children don't apply, according to the companies. Products marketed to those over the age of 12 have no specific lead-level prohibitions. \n \n \"The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has reviewed and explicitly defined fidget spinners as 'general use products.' They are not defined by the CPSC as toys,\" said Target spokesman Lee Henderson in a prepared statement. \n \n Fidget Spinner craze sweeping the nation \n \n Noting that US PIRG had provided Target with its lead testing results, Henderson added that the retailer's product safety team reviewed the consumer advocacy group's data and decided there was no need to pull the products from its shelves or website. \n \n \"The two fidget spinners cited in their letter are clearly marked on the package as 'appropriate for customers ages 14 and older,' and are not marketed to children,\" Henderson said in an email. \"As a result, the fidget spinners identified are not regulated as toys or children's products and are not required to meet children's product standards.\" \n \n The manufacturer, Bulls-I-Toy, said in a letter to US PIRG that because the product packaging says this spinner model is for youngsters who are at least 14-years-old, \"There are no mandatory CPSC requirements for it.\" \n \n Regardless of how the CPSC classifies these spinners, they're marketed as toys for kids, said Kara Cook-Shultz, toxics director at US PIRG. Not only are they sold in the toy aisles, alongside the spinners sold to 6-year-olds, until Thursday, the description of the brass spinner noted that the gadget has an \"educational focus\" and is appropriate for ages \"6 and up,\" on Target's website. \n \n After publication of this story, Target updated its website to reflect that the toy was appropriate for ages 14 and up, which matches the age range on the product packaging. \n \n \"All fidget spinners have play value as children's toys regardless of labeling,\" said Cook-Schultz. \"We can't sit idly by while children play with these toxic toys. And, yes, they are toys.\" \n \n Lead poisoning is considered most dangerous for young children because their rapidly growing bodies absorb the substance more readily, and they're more likely to put products in their mouths and near their noses, where the lead is most easily ingested. But lead is dangerous for everyone. \n \n In children, lead can lead to hyperactivity, lack of appetite, behavior problems and learning disabilities. In adults, lead poisoning leads to brain and nervous system ailments, stomach and kidney problems, as well as high blood pressure, weakness, muscle problems and headaches, according to WebMD. \n \n Some lead exposure victims facing new threat as adults \n \n Target's spokesman failed to comment about why the retailer would sell a product that could be dangerous for adults. A spokesman for Bulls-I-Toy said the company's products meet CPSC guidelines. When a reporter noted that there are no lead guidelines for adult products, he reiterated: \"As a company, we follow the guidelines issued by the CPSC.\" \n \n Meanwhile, the CPSC has been warning about other spinner hazards. \n \n \"As the agency investigates some reported incidents associated with the popular product, fidget spinner users or potential buyers should take some precautions,\" said CPSC Acting Chairwoman Anne Marie Buerkle in an August statement. \n \n Some of the pieces can break off and create choking hazards, she said. Moreover, light-up spinners often contain lithium coin cell batteries. If swallowed, these batteries can cause severe internal burns. Several reports have also said the devices can catch on fire while charging. \n \n The CPSC noted that the agency classifies most spinners as \"general use\" products, rather than children's toys. Thus, they're not required to meet a variety of toy safety standards, including those that limit lead or phthalates content. \n \n US PIRG's Cook-Schultz said the debate about whether the lead-laced products are a child's toy or an adult \"stress-reliever\" is beside the point: \"These products are not safe,\" she said. \"Let's get them off the shelves.\"", "By Dev Gowda and Kara Cook-Schultz, U.S. PIRG Education Fund \n \n Introduction \n \n The negative health effects of lead poisoning are well known. Unfortunately, lead remains a problem in our everyday lives. While much attention has been focused on tainted drinking water, such as the lead crisis in Flint, Mich., lead still remains a problem in toys. While lead in toys has become less prevalent in recent years, U.S. PIRG Education Fund tested several models of one of today\u2019s hottest toys, fidget spinners, for the toxic heavy metal. Laboratory results indicated that two fidget spinners purchased at Target and distributed by Bulls i Toy, L.L.C. contained extremely high levels of lead. \n \n U.S. PIRG Education Fund calls on Target and Bulls i Toy to immediately recall these two fidget spinners and investigate how such high levels of lead were found in these toys. Also, we call on the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to classify these fidget spinners as toys and hold them to federal standards for lead in children\u2019s products. \n \n Background on Lead \n \n Elemental lead is a metal occurring naturally in soils and rocks. It has a variety of commercial uses including in batteries, plastics, and radiation shielding. In the past, lead was also added to gasoline and paint. Because of lead\u2019s toxicity, in 1978 it was banned in household paint, in products marketed to children, and in dishes and cookware in the United States. Lead is not discernible by sight or smell. \n \n Lead exposure is particularly damaging for young children because of its impact on development. Even low levels of lead in blood have been shown to undermine IQ, attentiveness, and academic achievement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) makes clear that any amount of lead in a child\u2019s blood is unsafe. Moreover, since the effects of lead exposure cannot be reversed, it is especially important to prevent lead exposure to children in the first place. \n \n Unfortunately, toys can pose a risk in part because lead is used in other countries and can be found in imported products. Additionally, lead may be incorporated into plastic. Lead is used to soften plastic and make it more flexible, but when the plastic is exposed to sunlight, air, or detergents, the chemical bond between the lead and plastic breaks down, forming lead dust. Children can inhale or come in contact with this dust when they put toys in or near their mouths. \n \n Federal Standards for Lead \n \n With a few exceptions, federal law requires that all children\u2019s products manufactured after August 2011 contain no more than 100 parts per million (ppm) of total lead content in all accessible parts. The CPSC defines accessible parts as parts that a child could reach through \u201cnormal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product.\u201d \n \n Paint or similar surface coatings on all children\u2019s products are subject to a limit of 90 ppm of total lead. (Household paints are also subject to this rule.) \n \n Exceptions to these standards include metal components of bicycles, which cannot contain more than 300 ppm of lead. Components in electronic devices, inaccessible parts, and other items are exempt from the lead standard. \n \n Note that these limits do not meet the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), which recommends that all products intended for use by children contain no more than trace amounts of lead, defined as 40 ppm, the high end of typical lead concentrations in uncontaminated soil. \n \n Lead Found in Fidget Spinners \n \n Several fidget spinners were tested for lead content by a CPSC-accredited laboratory. The fidget spinners were analyzed in accordance with CPSC-CH-E1001-8.3 using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP/MS). The toys that tested for high levels of lead were then re-tested a second time to confirm the results. The results of the second test are included in this report. \n \n The lab results showed two fidget spinners contained extremely high levels of lead: \n \n \n \n Fidget Wild Premium Spinner Brass: \n \n The center circle tested for 33,000 ppm of lead. \n \n The arm tested for 22,000 ppm of lead. \n \n This fidget spinner was purchased at Target and is distributed by Bulls i Toy, LLC, located in Des Moines, Iowa. Although the box says for ages 14+, the Target.com website where it is available for sale says both that it is for children 6+ and 14+ and specifically states that it is \u201cframed as a toy\u201d. See screenshot from Target.com website below. Moreover, it was found in the toy aisles of numerous Target stores throughout the country and is marketed as a toy. Below is a picture of the Fidget Wild Premium Spinner Brass in the toy aisle of a Target store. Therefore, we believe that this product should be treated as a toy since it\u2019s marketed for use by children under 12 years. \n \n Screenshot from Target.com website. \n \n Fidget spinner in Target store. \n \n \n \n Fidget Wild Premium Spinner Metal: \n \n The center circle tested for 1,300 ppm of lead. \n \n The arm tested for 520 ppm of lead. \n \n This fidget spinner was purchased at Target and is distributed by Bulls i Toy, LLC, located in Des Moines, Iowa. Although it says it\u2019s for ages 14+, it was found in the toy aisles of numerous Target stores throughout the country and is marketed as a toy. Therefore, it should be held to federal lead standards for children\u2019s products. \n \n Furthermore, the BullsiToy.com website where Fidget Wild products are found is clearly a website for toys. Below is a screenshot of the Bulls i Toy website. The products they sell are marketed towards children and should, therefore, be classified as toys by the CPSC. \n \n Alarmingly, when U.S. PIRG Education Fund notified the CPSC about the elevated lead levels in the fidget spinners, the CPSC responded in an email (screenshot below) that these fidget spinners are general use products, not toys, so the CPSC will not hold them to federal lead standards. When we alerted Target and the toy's distributor to our findings, they pointed to the same CPSC statement and refused to address the problem. Belying that statement, U.S. PIRG Education Fund staff found these fidget spinners sold in the toy aisle of Target stores and on the Target.com website, which includes a statement that the product is intended for children ages 6 and up. Furthermore, common sense dictates that fidget spinners are meant for kids and therefore should be classified as toys. U.S. PIRG Education Fund calls on the CPSC to classify these fidget spinners as toys and hold them to the federal standard for lead in children\u2019s products. \n \n Recommendations \n \n For consumers: \n \n Adults and children alike should stop using these fidget spinners. \n \n Call on the CPSC to classify all fidget spinners as toys so that they will be held to federal standards for lead in children\u2019s products. \n \n Subscribe to email recall updates from the CPSC and other U.S. government safety agencies available at www.recalls.gov. \n \n For Target, Corp and Bulls I Toy, L.L.C.: \n \n Immediately recall these fidget spinners and remove from store shelves and Target.com website. \n \n Issue a public statement about the recall due to high lead content. \n \n Investigate how these toys came to contain such extremely high levels of lead and make findings public. \n \n Ensure that other fidget spinners sold or manufactured do not contain high levels of lead. \n \n Notify customers who purchased these fidget spinners, where contact information is available, that they should stop using the fidget spinner due to high levels of lead and offer a return for full refund. \n \n For U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission: \n \n Ensure that all fidget spinners are classified as toys and that they must meet federal regulations for children\u2019s products. \n \n Investigate any misleading marketing by Target, Corp. and Bulls i Toy, L.L.C. and take appropriate action. Although the labels on the toy boxes say 14+, they\u2019re clearly being marketed to children under 12 years. \n \n Conduct testing for other fidget spinners, especially those labeled \u201cbrass\u201d or \u201cmetal\u201d, for lead. \n \n U.S. PIRG Education Fund is a consumer and public health non-profit organization. We work to educate the public about dangers in toys, and for more than 30 years we have published an annual report titled Trouble in Toyland. Our survey of toys has led to more than 150 recalls and other enforcement actions."], "summary": "\u2013 A maker of one of the hottest products of the year has just found itself in a bucket of hot water. According to a consumer advocacy group, two fidget spinners supplied to Target by Iowa-based Bulls-i-Toy contain lead at up to 330 times the federal legal limit for toys. Inspired by a 15,000-strong Facebook group run by a woman who tests consumer products for lead, the US Public Interest Research Group tested 12 fidget spinners sold by Target and found two with unsafe lead levels, reports CBS News. Fidget Wild Premium Spinner Brass was found to contain 33,000 parts per million at its center, while Fidget Wild Premium Spinner Metal contained 1,300 parts per million, reports the Washington Post. Federal laws limit lead in \"children's products\" to 100 parts per million. The group is now asking Target to remove the products and recall those already sold. But Target isn't complying, arguing the Consumer Product Safety Commission classifies fidget spinners as \"general use products\" marketed to users 14 and up, making them exempt from regulations on toys. Bulls-i-Toy seconds that, noting the products are \"clearly labeled\" for ages 14 and up. But FOX 13 notes the fidget spinners sold in Target toy aisles had actually been listed on its website at one point with a manufacturer's recommendation for users \"6 years and up.\" Given that lead exposure can cause learning disabilities in children, among many other issues, US PIRG's toxics director maintains \"these products are not safe,\" per CBS.

Instead, there were 684 cases. \n \n Similarly, during five months in which the Zika virus was circulating in Colombia, officials recorded 320 cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 when there should have been about 100. From September 2015 to March 2016, while Zika infections peaked in El Salvador, cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 doubled to 184 from 92. \n \n The researchers included patients with both suspected and confirmed Zika infections, as reported by national health officials. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Roughly 500 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean are at risk for Zika virus infection, so even modest increases in the incidence of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 are worrisome. \n \n The nations in the study included the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Suriname, Venezuela and Colombia, along with the state of Bahia in Brazil.

The reported incidence was 28 percent higher for men and increased with age for both sexes, in line with previous research. \n \n Temporary paralysis is a potential neurological complication of dengue infection, too. But Dr. Espinal and his colleagues looked for a similar link to dengue and found none. \n \n Dr. Gorson noted that the continental United States has no formal monitoring system for Guillain-Barr\u00e9.

The condition can cause temporary paralysis and in rare instances, death. \n \n Rivera noted that it's unusual for the victim to be so young. \n \n \"What does this tell us? That all of us are susceptible,\" Rivera said as she urged Puerto Ricans to protect themselves from the mosquito-borne virus. \n \n The man, who died last month, was obese but did not have any other health conditions, she said. No further details about the victim were provided. \n \n The U.S. territory has a total of 13,186 confirmed Zika cases, with a total of 102 hospitalizations and 34 cases of Guillain-Barre. The number of Zika cases is believed to be much higher because eight of 10 people have no symptoms and many do not go to the doctor. Those infected include 1,106 pregnant women, which is a concern because Zika has been linked to severe birth defects. \n \n \"We are not going to see the effects of Zika today,\" Rivera said. \"We are going to see them in the next couple of months, in the next several years.\" \n \n Puerto Rico reported the first Zika-related microcephaly case acquired on U.S. soil in May, involving a dead fetus that a woman turned over to health authorities. Since then no microcephaly cases have been reported, but federal officials say it is only a matter of time. A study published Friday in JAMA Pediatrics estimates that up to 10,300 pregnant women in Puerto Rico could be infected with Zika and that between 100 to 270 babies could be born with microcephaly through mid-2017. \n \n In addition, some babies infected with Zika may present other type of problems such as eye abnormalities, hearing loss and inflexible joints, said Dr. Peggy Honein, chief of the birth defects branch at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n \n \"We are very concerned about these often devastating outcomes,\" she said in a phone interview. \n \n Honein, who was involved in the study, said that one of the major challenges of the Zika outbreak is the time delay in babies being born with severe defects. \n \n \"It doesn't mean that it's not happening because we don't see the effects yet,\" she warned. \n \n The U.S. government last week declared a public health emergency in Puerto Rico because of Zika, and federal officials have warned that up to 25 percent of Puerto Rico's nearly 3.5 million people could become infected. \n \n The CDC recently urged Puerto Rico fight Zika with the insecticide naled through aerial spraying, but the governor rejected that proposal and instead authorized the use of Bti, an organic larvicide.", "Our apologies.

But these facilities are often not available in some of the worst-hit places. \n \n The researchers found more women than men reported Zika infections, but said that might be because women are more aware of the risks because of the pregnancy link. However, men were more likely to develop Guillain-Barr\u00e9. \n \n \u201cFrom April 1, 2015, to March 31, 2016, a total of 164,237 confirmed and suspected cases of Zika virus disease and 1,474 cases of the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome were reported in Bahia, Brazil; Colombia; the Dominican Republic; El Salvador; Honduras; Suriname; and Venezuela,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe reported incidence of the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome was 28 percent higher among males than among females and consistently increased with age, findings that are in line with previous reports.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe reported incidence of the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome was 28 percent higher among males than among females.\u201d \n \n Zika has often circulated quietly, in part because it doesn\u2019t cause symptoms in most people and in part because it looks like so many other mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue virus. \n \n The health officials suggested that watching for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 cases might be one way to spot Zika outbreaks. \n \n Related: Zika Link to Birth Defects, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 'Alarming' \n \n \u201cApproximately 500 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean are at risk for Zika virus infection,\u201d they wrote. \n \n \u201cIt is clear that increases in the incidence of the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome to a level that is 2 and 9.8 times as high as baseline, as we have reported here, impose a substantial burden on populations and health services in this region.\u201d", "Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is an uncommon sickness of the nervous system in which a person\u2019s own immune system damages the nerve cells, causing muscle weakness, and sometimes, paralysis.

Most people fully recover from GBS, though some people have permanent damage. Very few people die from GBS. \n \n Causes of GBS \n \n Researchers do not fully understand what causes GBS. Most people with GBS report an infection before they have GBS symptoms. Rarely, vaccination has also been associated with the onset of GBS (for example, the 1976 Swine influenza vaccine). \n \n GBS is rare \n \n An estimated 3,000 to 6,000 people, or 1-2 cases for every 100,000 people, develop GBS each year in the US. Most cases of GBS tend to occur for no known reason, and true \u201cclusters\u201d of cases of GBS are very unusual. \n \n What to do if you are concerned \n \n If you want to know more about the number of GBS cases in a certain area, contact the state or local health department in the state where the cases happen. CDC collaborates with state and local health departments to investigate reports of possibly unusually large numbers or \u201cclusters\u201d of GBS cases. \n \n Additional Resources \n \n Vaccine Safety Concerns- Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome \n \n Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and Flu Vaccine: Questions and Answers"], "summary": "\u2013 Earlier this month, Puerto Rico announced its first death from Guillain-Barre syndrome, a condition causing temporary paralysis that, in this case, was linked to the Zika virus.

The rootstock contributes vigor and disease resistance while the scion is chosen for fruit flavor and quality. Grafting has been used in agriculture for centuries to improve plant health and yield (fruit trees and grape vines are two familiar examples). Grafted vegetables are currently widespread in Asia and Europe among produce growers and are gaining popularity in the US, especially with organic farmers. Our plants are grafted by hand in a unique, carefully controlled environment using innovative methods recently developed here in Oregon. \n \n \n \n Grafted vegetables help solve common garden problems. Vigorous rootstock enables more effective uptake of water and nutrients, and increases plants' resistance to pests or disease and tolerance to temperature extremes and drought. This allows commercial growers \u2014 and now home gardeners \u2014 to plant earlier and harvest longer. Healthier, stronger plants also mean greatly reduced pesticide use and more yield. With grafted tomato plants, even gardeners in challenging climates can enjoy ample harvests of America's favorite garden crop. \n \n \n \n Grafted plants are drop-dead gorgeous \n \n Statuesque, strong, and loaded with flowers and fruit, they remain beautifully healthy and disease-resistant when the same non-grafted varieties oftentimes struggle. \n \n \n \n Benefits of Grafted plants over non-grafted plants \n \n \u2022 Better quality crops and increased fruit production \n \n \u2022 Increased water and nutrient uptake \n \n \u2022 Extended harvests \n \n \u2022 Increased disease resistance including resistance to early and late blight and blossom end rot in tomatoes \n \n \u2022 Increased overall plant vigor \n \n \u2022 Increased tolerance to environmental stresses (extremes in heat and cold, salinity, etc.) \n \n \n \n Our plants are available individually in 2 1/4 inch pots!

A video shows how the combo plant yields cherry tomatoes above ground and spuds below ground. \n \n \u201cEach plant is grafted by hand to ensure that unique double cropping,\u201d the narrator says in the video. \n \n So it\u2019s not a miracle of genetic engineering, but rather a simple graft of the top of one plant onto the rootstock of the other one. \n \n The reason this works is that potatoes and tomatoes are closely related. The grafted plant first yields lots of cherry tomatoes and when that winds down, puts its energy into maturing its potatoes. \n \n Grafting can be done at home, but requires skill and practice. In this case, the tomato stem and potato stem need to have the same thickness. The graft entails making a clean cut of both plant stems and then taping two ends together until they heal. \n \n The British mail order nursery that commercialized the combo plant dubbed it the TomTato, also known as \u201cKetchup \u2018n\u2019 Fries.\u201d An imitator in New Zealand called its version the Potato Tom. \n \n \u201cPeople have been grafting tomatoes and potatoes for a while, but mostly as a novelty,\u201d said Territorial Seed Company marketing director Tim Russell.

Andrew Cuomo signed an executive ordering allowing storm victims to vote outside of their district Monday night. Still, problems arose as soon as some locations opened. \n \n On the playground of Scholars\u2019 Academy on Beach 104th St. in Rockaway Park, several voting locations from the western end of the Rockaway peninsula were consolidated into one tent-covered polling site. Problems started immediately, as poll workers arrived to find that generators, heaters and lights were nowhere to be found. \n \n \u201cIt just got a little chaotic,\u201d said pollworker Estel Lyons. \u201cWe had it planned the best we could and there were a few glitches.\u201d \n \n Zuma Press People gather to vote at a makeshift tent, which is used as a polling station in Rockway. \n \n Marie Howley of Rockaway Park used a rental car to drive in from Rockville Centre on Long Island, where she has been staying with her daughter. Her only complaint was lack of sufficient light in the tents. \u201cIt\u2019s dark in there,\u201d she said. \u201cYou had to hold up the card to see. I think I filled in all the holes correctly.\u201d \n \n In hard-hit Hoboken, various snafus caused long waits for voters to cast ballots at a combined polling location for two districts on Grand Street. The doors of the Multi Service Center of Hoboken weren\u2019t open at 6 a.m., poll workers struggled to find a key to open the operational voting machines and voters were told they might have to cast paper ballots, said Joe Maziarski, a 27-year-old Hoboken resident at the polling site. \n \n \u201cPeople weren\u2019t really happy with that idea,\u201d said Maziarski, a TV producer. \n \n The machines were eventually opened but the tables lacked signs directing people to their appropriate polling district, and voters took it upon themselves to guide people, Maziarski said. \u201cIt was very disorganized. You couldn\u2019t tell who was running the organization,\u201d he said. \n \n Sandy even threw some kinks in the voting process in parts of New York City where the lights stayed on throughout the storm. \n \n In Park Slope, voters who usually cast their ballots at John Jay High School, now serving as an shelter for storm evacuees, were directed to PS 282, more than a half a mile away. Some residents had received fliers passed out on Monday by Assembyman James F. Brennan redirecting them to the new site. \n \n Lines stretched outside the school and around the block. But displaced voters got a break and were directed to a separate entrance where lines were shorter. Those who already knew their election district were processed quickly, in about half an hour. \n \n It was unclear if the shorter lines were because of lower turnout from residents redirected from their usual polling places. \n \n At the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis High School in midtown Manhattan, polling workers said that around noon, they had run out of affidavit ballot envelopes needed for voters who weren\u2019t registered at the polling site. \n \n Jon Protas/The Wall Street Journal A double line of voters stretches around the block as people wait to vote on West End Ave at 95th street in Manhattan. \n \n \u201cGovernor Cuomo sits up there in Albany and signs an executive order, but he\u2019s not in the trenches,\u201d said coordinator Fred Kelly. \n \n Another Board of Elections worker said some voters had submitted ballots without envelopes, meaning their votes wouldn\u2019t count. \n \n Voters were instructed to try other polling places in midtown. \u201cI figured there would be a long line, but I thought I\u2019d be able to vote here,\u201d said 22-year-old James Bedell, who lives in East Village but works as a bank analyst in midtown.

Voters have no wait time to use a polling booth at one Teterboro site that is accepting votes from displaced Moonachie residents. \n \n Eleanor Madison, 77, displaced by the storm, said her town had shuttles to Teterboro so they could vote. \n \n \u201cWe had calls from our police department,\u201d she said about the voting change. \u201cBut not everybody is getting the calls. People have told me,\u201d she said, guessing their numbers were not listed or registered. \n \n \u201cThey are calling people but I say they should go around with a megaphone,\u201d she said. \n \n Dale Birnbaum, a small-business owner from South Brunswick who has been displaced by Sandy, struggled to figure out how to vote electronically. She couldn\u2019t easily find information on the state\u2019s website, and resorted to contacting friends on Facebook. She eventually contacted the Middlesex County clerk\u2019s office for an application, but had yet to receive a response Tuesday. \n \n \u201cI want to vote so badly,\u201d said Birnhaum, who is staying with her daughter in West New York and is going to try to vote provisionally in Hudson County. \u201cI have local people I would love to vote for but I just want to vote for the president.\u201d \n \n Associated Press Poll worker Lisa Amico, right, helps voters by flashlight in a dark and unheated tent serving as a polling site in the Midland Beach section of Staten Island. \n \n New Jersey residents who chose to vote electronically were facing confusion and uncertainty whether their votes would be counted. \n \n Kate Supple, a 29-year-old Jersey City resident who was displaced by Sandy and staying in Manhattan, emailed her application to the Hudson County clerk Monday. Supple said she received a brief email acknowledgement of her application but has yet to receiver her ballot, and was worried that her vote wouldn\u2019t be counted. \n \n Poll worker Lisa Amico, right, helps voters by flashlight in a dark and unheated tent serving as a polling site in the Midland Beach section of Staten Island. \n \n Several confused voters showed up Tuesday morning at PS 288 in Coney Island.

Yet four more years will not be smooth sailing. Obama faces a still anemic economic recovery, stubbornly high unemployment and a looming fiscal crisis. \n \n With Republicans retaining control of the House and Democrats adding to their advantage in the Senate, Obama also may be plagued by the same political gridlock that has sharply divided the electorate and hampered the president's agenda for solving the country's woes. And gridlock could thwart his efforts to negotiate a new fiscal plan. \n \n Obama and Congress have been unable to find common ground on tax and spending cuts.

Yet Robles supported Obama, saying he's not responsible for the worst of the economic crisis: \"People need to give him a chance.\" \n \n Signs point to an improving economy. While the unemployment rate ticked up to 7.9% in October, employers added 171,000 jobs in October. Hiring also was stronger in August and September than first thought. Yet a separate Labor Department report issued Tuesday said job openings dropped by 100,000 in September to 3.56 million, lowest in five months, data that suggest hiring will remain modest. \n \n Gasoline prices have been dropping sharply \u2014 now $3.46 a gallon \u2014 a drop of 35 cents from a month ago. Cheaper gas typically spurs consumer spending, although prices typically fall in the fall. \n \n Stocks \u2014 which historically perform better with a Democrat in the White House \u2014 rose Tuesday and U.S. stock futures were up heading into Wednesday's market opening. Overseas markets also were up in early Wednesday trading. \n \n Yet overall economic policy needs to change, experts say. And that starts with bipartisan agreement in Washington. \n \n Senate and House leaders seemed conciliatory. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday's vote showed that the electorate had neither endorsed the \"failures or excesses of the president's first term,\" but rather have given him more time to finish the job. \"To the extent he wants to move to the political center, which is where the work gets done in a divided government, we'll be there to meet him half way,\" McConnell said. \n \n Said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid: \"Now that the election is over, it's time to put politics aside and work together to find solutions.\" \n \n In his victory speech early Wednesday morning from Chicago, Obama said he was willing to work across party lines to tackle problems. \"Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual,'' he told a partisan crowd. \"You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together. Reducing our deficit. Reforming our tax code. Fixing our immigration system. Freeing ourselves from foreign oil.

{"document": ["Last week, the bitcoin community heard about UCLA professor Bhagwan Chowdhry, who had been invited by the Prize Committee for the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel to nominate someone for the 2016 Prize, suggesting nominating bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto for the Nobel Prize in Economics. But, as we also reported, the nomination by Chowdhry itself proved counterproductive when a comment underneath the professor\u2019s post explained that Nobel Foundation rules forbid public disclosure of nominations for 50 years i.e. the finance professor\u2019s announcement meant he couldn\u2019t nominate Nakamoto. \n \n Apart from Chowdhry\u2019s disclosure, it seems Nakamoto wouldn\u2019t be eligible for the Nobel Prize without a verified identity. Hans Reuterski\u00f6ld, Nobel Press Officer of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, told Inverse that the prize cannot be awarded anonymously or posthumously. \n \n There\u2019s always the possibility of Nakamoto revealing his identity sometime over the next year. However, given that he\u2019s remained anonymous for this long, it\u2019s probably a long shot. \n \n Image source", "Even as his face towered 10 feet above the crowd at the Bitcoin Investor\u2019s Conference in Las Vegas, Craig Steven Wright was, to most of the audience of crypto and finance geeks, a nobody. \n \n The 44-year-old Australian, Skyping into the D Hotel ballroom\u2019s screen, wore the bitcoin enthusiast\u2019s equivalent of camouflage: a black blazer and a tieless, rumpled shirt, his brown hair neatly parted. His name hadn\u2019t made the conference\u2019s list of \"featured speakers.\" Even the panel\u2019s moderator, a bitcoin blogger named Michele Seven, seemed concerned the audience wouldn\u2019t know why he was there. Wright had hardly begun to introduce himself as a \"former academic who does research that no one ever hears about,\" when she interrupted him. \n \n \"Hold on a second, who are you?\" Seven cut in, laughing. \"Are you a computer scientist?\" \n \n \"I\u2019m a bit of everything,\" Wright responded. \"I have a master's in law\u2026a master\u2019s in statistics, a couple doctorates...\" \n \n \"How did you first learn about bitcoin?\" Seven interrupted again, as if still trying to clarify Wright\u2019s significance. \n \n Wright paused for three full seconds. \"Um. I\u2019ve been involved with all this for a long time,\" he stuttered. \"I\u2014try and stay\u2014I keep my head down. Um...\" He seemed to suppress a smile. The panel\u2019s moderator moved on. And for what must have been the thousandth time in his last seven years of obscurity, Wright did not say the words WIRED\u2019s study of Wright over the past weeks suggests he may be dying to say out loud. \n \n \"I am Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin.\" \n \n Either Wright invented bitcoin, or he's a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did. \n \n Since that pseudonymous figure first released bitcoin\u2019s code on January 9th, 2009, Nakamoto\u2019s ingenious digital currency has grown from a nerd novelty to a kind of economic miracle. As it\u2019s been adopted for everything from international money transfers to online narcotrafficking, the total value of all bitcoins has grown to nearly $5 billion. Nakamoto himself, whoever he is, appears to control a stash of bitcoins easily worth a nine-figure fortune (it rose to more than a billion at the cryptocurrency\u2019s peak exchange rate in 2014). But the true identity of bitcoin\u2019s creator remains a cipher. Media outlets from the New Yorker to Fast Company to Newsweek have launched investigations into unmasking Nakamoto that were either inconclusive or, in Newsweek\u2019s case, pointed to a man who subsequently denied having anything to do with cryptography, not to mention cryptocurrency. Altogether, the world\u2019s Satoshi-seekers have hardly put a dent in one of the most stubborn mysteries of the 21st century, one whose answer could resonate beyond a small sphere of crypto geeks and have real economic effects. \n \n In the last weeks, WIRED has obtained the strongest evidence yet of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s true identity. The signs point to Craig Steven Wright, a man who never even made it onto any Nakamoto hunters\u2019 public list of candidates, yet fits the cryptocurrency creator\u2019s profile in nearly every detail. And despite a massive trove of evidence, we still can\u2019t say with absolute certainty that the mystery is solved. But two possibilities outweigh all others: Either Wright invented bitcoin, or he\u2019s a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did. \n \n The Evidence \n \n The first evidence pointing to Wright appeared in mid-November, when an anonymous source close to Wright began leaking documents to Gwern Branwen, a pseudonymous, independent security researcher and dark web analyst. Branwen provided those documents to WIRED, and they immediately led to several direct, publicly visible connections between Nakamoto and Wright: \n \n An August 2008 post on Wright\u2019s blog, months before the November 2008 introduction of the bitcoin whitepaper on a cryptography mailing list. It mentions his intention to release a \"cryptocurrency paper,\" and references \"triple entry accounting,\" the title of a 2005 paper by financial cryptographer Ian Grigg that outlines several bitcoin-like ideas. \n \n A post on the same blog from November, 2008. It includes a request that readers who want to get in touch encrypt their messages to him using a PGP public key apparently linked to Satoshi Nakamoto. A PGP key is a unique string of characters that allows a user of that encryption software to receive encrypted messages. This one, when checked against the database of the MIT server where it was stored, is associated with the email address satoshin@vistomail.com, an email address very similar to the satoshi@vistomail.com address Nakamoto used to send the whitepaper introducing bitcoin to a cryptography mailing list. \n \n An archived copy of a now-deleted blog post from Wright dated January 10, 2009, which reads: \"The Beta of Bitcoin is live tomorrow. This is decentralized... We try until it works.\" (The post was dated January 10, 2009, a day after Bitcoin\u2019s official launch on January 9th of that year. But if Wright, living in Eastern Australia, posted it after midnight his time on the night of the 9th, that would have still been before bitcoin\u2019s launch at 3pm EST on the 9th.) That post was later replaced with the rather cryptic text \"Bitcoin - AKA bloody nosey you be\u2026It does always surprise me how at times the best place to hide [is] right in the open.\" Sometime after October of this year, it was deleted entirely. \n \n WIRED \n \n In addition to those three blog posts, we received a cache of leaked emails, transcripts, and accounting forms that corroborate the link. There\u2019s a leaked message from Wright to his lawyer date June 2008 in which Wright imagines \"a P2P distributed ledger\"\u2014an apparent reference to bitcoin\u2019s public record of transactions known as the blockchain, long before it was publicly released. The email goes on to reference a paper called \"Electronic Cash Without a Trusted Third Party\" that Wright expects to release in 2009. \n \n 'I did my best to try and hide the fact that I've been running bitcoin since 2009. By the end of this I think half the world is going to bloody know.' Craig Steven Wright \n \n Another leaked email from Wright to computer forensics analyst David Kleiman, a close friend and confidant, just before bitcoin\u2019s January 2009 launch discusses a paper they\u2019d been working on together. Wright talks about taking a buyout from his job and investing in hundreds of computer processors to \"get [his] idea going.\" There\u2019s also a PDF authored by Kleiman, who died in April of 2013, in which he agrees to take control of a trust fund, codenamed the \"Tulip Trust,\" containing 1.1 million bitcoins. The PDF is signed with Kleiman\u2019s PGP signature, a cryptographic technique that ensures it couldn\u2019t have been altered post-signature. \n \n That million-coin trove\u2014The Tulip Trust\u2014is the same size as a mysterious bitcoin fortune that\u2019s long been visible on bitcoin\u2019s blockchain and widely attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto. No one but Nakamoto is known to have assembled such a massive hoard of the cryptocurrency, and only Nakamoto could have generated so many bitcoins so early in its evolution, when a bitcoin could be \u201cmined\u201d with relatively small amounts of processing power. Only one such bitcoin megapile exists, and the closely-watched coins haven\u2019t moved in bitcoin\u2019s entire history. \n \n Another clue as to Wright\u2019s bitcoin fortune wasn\u2019t leaked to WIRED but instead remains hosted on the website of the corporate advisory firm McGrathNicol: a liquidation report on one of several companies Wright founded known as Hotwire, an attempt to create a bitcoin-based bank. It shows that the startup was backed in June 2013 by $23 million in bitcoins owned by Wright. That sum would be worth more than $60 million today. At the time of the company\u2019s incorporation, Wright\u2019s investment in that one firm alone represented more than 1.5 percent of all existing bitcoins, a strangely large stash for an unknown player in the bitcoin world. \n \n The giveaways go on: There\u2019s a leaked email from Wright to an associate in January 2014 about a tax dispute with the Australian government. In it, he seems to consider using Nakamoto\u2019s name to wield influence with New South Wales Senator Arthur Sinodinos \"Would our Japanese friend have weight coming out of retirement?\" Wright asks. It includes a draft email to the senator signed \"Satoshi Nakamoto.\" And a leaked transcript of Wright\u2019s meeting with attorneys and tax officials in February 2014 quotes him in a moment of exasperation: \"I did my best to try and hide the fact that I've been running bitcoin since 2009,\" Wright says. \"By the end of this I think half the world is going to bloody know.\" \n \n Making Contact \n \n On December 1st, WIRED sent an encrypted email to Wright suggesting that we knew his secret and asking for a meeting. A few hours later, we received a wary response from the address Tessier-Ashpool@AnonymousSpeech.com, a cyberpunk reference to a rich and powerful corporate dynasty in William Gibson\u2019s Sprawl trilogy. Wright had referenced the same fictional family in the bio of his private twitter profile. The email\u2019s IP showed that it came from an IP address in Panama controlled by Vistomail, the same service that Satoshi Nakamoto had used to send his emails introducing bitcoin and to run Bitcoin.org. \u201cThis is a throw away account. There are ways even with [the anonymity software] Tor, but the people in Panama are exteremly [sic] good and do not violate people's desired privacy,\u201d the email read. \u201cYou are digging, the question is how deep are you?\u201d The message ended, \u201cRegards, the Director of Tessier-Ashpool\u201d \n \n After WIRED sent an encrypted email to Wright suggesting that we knew his secret, we received a perplexing message: 'You seem to know a few things. More than you should.' \n \n A few hours later, we received another, even more perplexing message from the same account. \u201cThe nature of this moniker is selected for a purpose. I now have resources. This makes me a we now. I am still within that early phase of learning just what my capabilities happen to be. So, even now with resources I remain vulnerable,\u201d it read. \u201cYou seem to know a few things. More than you should.\u201d \n \n When we responded by describing the three blog posts that showed Wright\u2019s clear connection to bitcoin\u2019s creation and asking again for a meeting, he gave a revealing answer. \u201cAlthough we all desire some level of credit, I have moved past many of these things,\u201d read his response from the same Tessier-Ashpool account. \u201cToo many already know secrets, the world does not need to know. There are other means to lead change than to be a dictator.\u201d \n \n After our second followup message asking for a chance to talk, Wright responded that he would consider our request. Then he stopped responding altogether. \n \n Dropping Breadcrumbs? \n \n Despite that overwhelming collection of clues, none of it fully proves that Wright is Nakamoto. All of it could be an elaborate hoax\u2014perhaps orchestrated by Wright himself. The unverified leaked documents could be faked in whole or in part. And most inexplicably of all, comparisons of different archived versions of the three smoking gun posts from Wright\u2019s blog show that he did edit all three\u2014to insert evidence of his bitcoin history. The PGP key associated with Nakamoto\u2019s email address and references to an upcoming \"cryptocurrency paper\" and \"triple entry accounting\" were added sometime after 2013. Even the post noting bitcoin\u2019s beta launch is questionable. While it was ostensibly posted in January 2009, it later seems to have been deleted and then undeleted\u2014or possibly even written for the first time\u2014sometime between October 2013 and June of 2014. \n \n Wright\u2019s blog, his public records, and his verified writings on mail lists and Twitter sketch a man who matches with Satoshi Nakamoto's known characteristics well enough to place him leagues above other candidates. \n \n Why those breadcrumbs were dropped remains a mystery. Is Wright trying to falsely steal Nakamoto\u2019s glory (or money)? Is he quietly revealing himself as bitcoin\u2019s creator? \n \n But this much is clear: If Wright is seeking to fake his Nakamoto connection, his hoax would be practically as ambitious as bitcoin itself. Some of the clues added to his blog were made more than 20 months ago\u2014a very patient deception if it were one. His references to Grigg\u2019s \"triple entry accounting\" paper would represent an uncannily inventive lie, representing a new and obscure possible inspiration for bitcoin. And there\u2019s little doubt Wright is a certified bitcoin mogul.

As Wright told the Bitcoin Investor\u2019s conference, he\u2019s applying that second machine towards the mysterious task of \"modeling Bitcoin\u2019s scalability,\" and meanwhile building an even more powerful supercomputing cluster in Iceland because of its cheap geothermal power. \n \n Bitcoin watchers have long wondered why the giant cache of coins they attribute to Satoshi Nakamoto never moved on the bitcoin\u2019s publicly visible blockchain.

In the last two years he\u2019s started to write more frequently about bitcoin on his blog; he\u2019s even peppered Twitter with hints (Though he also deleted many of those earlier this month and made his tweets private.) \n \n \"'Identity' is not your name. Where people go wrong is that they do not see it to be the set of shared experiences with other individuals,\" he wrote in one tweet in October. \n \n When a UCLA professor nominated Satoshi Nakamoto for a Nobel Prize earlier this month\u2014and he was declared ineligible due to the mystery of his identity\u2014Wright lashed out. \"If Satoshi-chan was made for an ACM turing price [sic] or an Alfred Nobel in Economics he would let you bloody know that,\" he wrote on twitter, using the Japanese \"chan\" suffix that indicates familiarity or a nickname. \n \n \"I never desired to be a leader but the choice is not mine,\" reads a third recent tweet from Wright. \"We are a product of the things we create. They change us.\" \n \n In one cryptic and meandering blog post in September in which Wright takes stock of his long career, he even seems to concede that no one can build and wield the wealth that Satoshi Nakamoto has amassed and remain hidden indefinitely. \"There is a certain power and mystery in secrets,\" Wright mused. \n \n \"Am slowly coming to the realisation and acceptance,\" he added, \"No secret remains forever.\" \n \n Update 12/14/2015 2:40pm: New clues following the publication of this story have shown inconsistencies in Wright's academic and supercomputing claims that may point to the second, strange possibility we noted: an elaborate, long-planned hoax. \n \n You may also like:", "The identity of \"Satoshi Nakamoto\", the pseudonym of the mysterious individual or group that created the concept of Bitcoin in late 2009, has been the subject of frenzied investigation by the currency's enthusiasts and the tech press for years. It turns out that the shadowy figure behind the digital alternative currency may be from Australia, and living in Sydney. \n \n UPDATE: The house belonging to Craig Wright in North Ryde has been raided by police, The Guardian reports. \n \n Bitcoin image via Shutterstock \n \n A month-long Gizmodo investigation into Dr Craig Wright and the late Dave Kleiman, an American computer forensics expert who died in 2013, has revealed that they were almost certainly involved in the creation of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency protocol. Wright, from North Ryde in Sydney, is a cryptocurrency enthusiast and serial entrepreneur. \n \n Wired has gathered enough evidence to suggest that Wright is the cryptocurrency's creator that it's confident in naming him publicly; it's not certain of its discovery, but it's more than confident \u2014 pointing to blog posts made by Wright before the public unveiling of the Bitcoin protocol, as well as his apparent ownership of a 1.1 million bitcoin blockchain worth $605,000,000. \n \n In the last weeks, WIRED has obtained the strongest evidence yet of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s true identity. The signs point to Craig Steven Wright, a man who never even made it onto any Nakamoto hunters\u2019 public list of candidates, yet fits the cryptocurrency creator\u2019s profile in nearly every detail. And despite a massive trove of evidence, we still can\u2019t say with absolute certainty that the mystery is solved. But two possibilities outweigh all others: Either Wright invented bitcoin, or he\u2019s a brilliant hoaxer... \n \n Possibly the strongest evidence is a leaked email about an alleged tax dispute that Wright had with the Australian government, where the self-described \"security nerd, economist and researcher\" supposedly suggests using Satoshi Nakamoto's identity to reach out to then-New South Wales senator Arthur Sinodinos: \"Would our Japanese friend have weight coming out of retirement?\" \n \n Wright lists DeMorgan Ltd in his Twitter profile, a company \"focused on alternative currency\" with \"several Bitcoin based research projects\". The Australian Securities and Investment Commission proposed to deregister DeMorgan in June 2014 after its initial registration in January to an address in North Ryde in Sydney's northwest. The company's ABN, registered to an address in Wauchope near Port Macquarie and previously trading as \"Vin De La Terre\", was cancelled in late October this year. \n \n Wright is also the founder and CEO of Cloudcroft, an Australian supercomputing firm whose Tulip Trading C01N is currently ranked at #17 in the supercomputing world's Top 500 list. Here's a video where Dr Wright introduces Cloudcroft and C01N, a high-performance computing cluster designed for finance and apparently built in North Ryde in partnership with SGI, with 115,200 CPU cores and 146TB of main memory. Gizmodo has contacted SGI to confirm this information. Gizmodo Australia has also reached out to Dr Wright for comment. \n \n Questions, comments, tips? You can find me on Twitter at @csimps0n.", "Even as his face towered 10 feet above the crowd at the Bitcoin Investor\u2019s Conference in Las Vegas, Craig Steven Wright was, to most of the audience of crypto and finance geeks, a nobody. \n \n The 44-year-old Australian, Skyping into the D Hotel ballroom\u2019s screen, wore the bitcoin enthusiast\u2019s equivalent of camouflage: a black blazer and a tieless, rumpled shirt, his brown hair neatly parted. His name hadn\u2019t made the conference\u2019s list of \"featured speakers.\" Even the panel\u2019s moderator, a bitcoin blogger named Michele Seven, seemed concerned the audience wouldn\u2019t know why he was there. Wright had hardly begun to introduce himself as a \"former academic who does research that no one ever hears about,\" when she interrupted him. \n \n \"Hold on a second, who are you?\" Seven cut in, laughing. \"Are you a computer scientist?\" \n \n \"I\u2019m a bit of everything,\" Wright responded. \"I have a master's in law\u2026a master\u2019s in statistics, a couple doctorates...\" \n \n \"How did you first learn about bitcoin?\" Seven interrupted again, as if still trying to clarify Wright\u2019s significance. \n \n Wright paused for three full seconds. \"Um. I\u2019ve been involved with all this for a long time,\" he stuttered. \"I\u2014try and stay\u2014I keep my head down. Um...\" He seemed to suppress a smile. The panel\u2019s moderator moved on. And for what must have been the thousandth time in his last seven years of obscurity, Wright did not say the words WIRED\u2019s study of Wright over the past weeks suggests he may be dying to say out loud. \n \n \"I am Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin.\" \n \n Either Wright invented bitcoin, or he's a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did. \n \n Since that pseudonymous figure first released bitcoin\u2019s code on January 9th, 2009, Nakamoto\u2019s ingenious digital currency has grown from a nerd novelty to a kind of economic miracle. As it\u2019s been adopted for everything from international money transfers to online narcotrafficking, the total value of all bitcoins has grown to nearly $5 billion. Nakamoto himself, whoever he is, appears to control a stash of bitcoins easily worth a nine-figure fortune (it rose to more than a billion at the cryptocurrency\u2019s peak exchange rate in 2014). But the true identity of bitcoin\u2019s creator remains a cipher. Media outlets from the New Yorker to Fast Company to Newsweek have launched investigations into unmasking Nakamoto that were either inconclusive or, in Newsweek\u2019s case, pointed to a man who subsequently denied having anything to do with cryptography, not to mention cryptocurrency. Altogether, the world\u2019s Satoshi-seekers have hardly put a dent in one of the most stubborn mysteries of the 21st century, one whose answer could resonate beyond a small sphere of crypto geeks and have real economic effects. \n \n In the last weeks, WIRED has obtained the strongest evidence yet of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s true identity. The signs point to Craig Steven Wright, a man who never even made it onto any Nakamoto hunters\u2019 public list of candidates, yet fits the cryptocurrency creator\u2019s profile in nearly every detail. And despite a massive trove of evidence, we still can\u2019t say with absolute certainty that the mystery is solved. But two possibilities outweigh all others: Either Wright invented bitcoin, or he\u2019s a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did. \n \n The Evidence \n \n The first evidence pointing to Wright appeared in mid-November, when an anonymous source close to Wright began leaking documents to Gwern Branwen, a pseudonymous, independent security researcher and dark web analyst. Branwen provided those documents to WIRED, and they immediately led to several direct, publicly visible connections between Nakamoto and Wright: \n \n An August 2008 post on Wright\u2019s blog, months before the November 2008 introduction of the bitcoin whitepaper on a cryptography mailing list. It mentions his intention to release a \"cryptocurrency paper,\" and references \"triple entry accounting,\" the title of a 2005 paper by financial cryptographer Ian Grigg that outlines several bitcoin-like ideas. \n \n A post on the same blog from November, 2008. It includes a request that readers who want to get in touch encrypt their messages to him using a PGP public key apparently linked to Satoshi Nakamoto. A PGP key is a unique string of characters that allows a user of that encryption software to receive encrypted messages. This one, when checked against the database of the MIT server where it was stored, is associated with the email address satoshin@vistomail.com, an email address very similar to the satoshi@vistomail.com address Nakamoto used to send the whitepaper introducing bitcoin to a cryptography mailing list. \n \n An archived copy of a now-deleted blog post from Wright dated January 10, 2009, which reads: \"The Beta of Bitcoin is live tomorrow. This is decentralized... We try until it works.\" (The post was dated January 10, 2009, a day after Bitcoin\u2019s official launch on January 9th of that year. But if Wright, living in Eastern Australia, posted it after midnight his time on the night of the 9th, that would have still been before bitcoin\u2019s launch at 3pm EST on the 9th.) That post was later replaced with the rather cryptic text \"Bitcoin - AKA bloody nosey you be\u2026It does always surprise me how at times the best place to hide [is] right in the open.\" Sometime after October of this year, it was deleted entirely. \n \n WIRED \n \n In addition to those three blog posts, we received a cache of leaked emails, transcripts, and accounting forms that corroborate the link. There\u2019s a leaked message from Wright to his lawyer date June 2008 in which Wright imagines \"a P2P distributed ledger\"\u2014an apparent reference to bitcoin\u2019s public record of transactions known as the blockchain, long before it was publicly released. The email goes on to reference a paper called \"Electronic Cash Without a Trusted Third Party\" that Wright expects to release in 2009. \n \n 'I did my best to try and hide the fact that I've been running bitcoin since 2009. By the end of this I think half the world is going to bloody know.' Craig Steven Wright \n \n Another leaked email from Wright to computer forensics analyst David Kleiman, a close friend and confidant, just before bitcoin\u2019s January 2009 launch discusses a paper they\u2019d been working on together. Wright talks about taking a buyout from his job and investing in hundreds of computer processors to \"get [his] idea going.\" There\u2019s also a PDF authored by Kleiman, who died in April of 2013, in which he agrees to take control of a trust fund, codenamed the \"Tulip Trust,\" containing 1.1 million bitcoins. The PDF is signed with Kleiman\u2019s PGP signature, a cryptographic technique that ensures it couldn\u2019t have been altered post-signature. \n \n That million-coin trove\u2014The Tulip Trust\u2014is the same size as a mysterious bitcoin fortune that\u2019s long been visible on bitcoin\u2019s blockchain and widely attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto. No one but Nakamoto is known to have assembled such a massive hoard of the cryptocurrency, and only Nakamoto could have generated so many bitcoins so early in its evolution, when a bitcoin could be \u201cmined\u201d with relatively small amounts of processing power. Only one such bitcoin megapile exists, and the closely-watched coins haven\u2019t moved in bitcoin\u2019s entire history. \n \n Another clue as to Wright\u2019s bitcoin fortune wasn\u2019t leaked to WIRED but instead remains hosted on the website of the corporate advisory firm McGrathNicol: a liquidation report on one of several companies Wright founded known as Hotwire, an attempt to create a bitcoin-based bank. It shows that the startup was backed in June 2013 by $23 million in bitcoins owned by Wright. That sum would be worth more than $60 million today. At the time of the company\u2019s incorporation, Wright\u2019s investment in that one firm alone represented more than 1.5 percent of all existing bitcoins, a strangely large stash for an unknown player in the bitcoin world. \n \n The giveaways go on: There\u2019s a leaked email from Wright to an associate in January 2014 about a tax dispute with the Australian government. In it, he seems to consider using Nakamoto\u2019s name to wield influence with New South Wales Senator Arthur Sinodinos \"Would our Japanese friend have weight coming out of retirement?\" Wright asks. It includes a draft email to the senator signed \"Satoshi Nakamoto.\" And a leaked transcript of Wright\u2019s meeting with attorneys and tax officials in February 2014 quotes him in a moment of exasperation: \"I did my best to try and hide the fact that I've been running bitcoin since 2009,\" Wright says. \"By the end of this I think half the world is going to bloody know.\" \n \n Making Contact \n \n On December 1st, WIRED sent an encrypted email to Wright suggesting that we knew his secret and asking for a meeting. A few hours later, we received a wary response from the address Tessier-Ashpool@AnonymousSpeech.com, a cyberpunk reference to a rich and powerful corporate dynasty in William Gibson\u2019s Sprawl trilogy. Wright had referenced the same fictional family in the bio of his private twitter profile. The email\u2019s IP showed that it came from an IP address in Panama controlled by Vistomail, the same service that Satoshi Nakamoto had used to send his emails introducing bitcoin and to run Bitcoin.org. \u201cThis is a throw away account. There are ways even with [the anonymity software] Tor, but the people in Panama are exteremly [sic] good and do not violate people's desired privacy,\u201d the email read. \u201cYou are digging, the question is how deep are you?\u201d The message ended, \u201cRegards, the Director of Tessier-Ashpool\u201d \n \n After WIRED sent an encrypted email to Wright suggesting that we knew his secret, we received a perplexing message: 'You seem to know a few things. More than you should.' \n \n A few hours later, we received another, even more perplexing message from the same account. \u201cThe nature of this moniker is selected for a purpose. I now have resources. This makes me a we now. I am still within that early phase of learning just what my capabilities happen to be. So, even now with resources I remain vulnerable,\u201d it read. \u201cYou seem to know a few things. More than you should.\u201d \n \n When we responded by describing the three blog posts that showed Wright\u2019s clear connection to bitcoin\u2019s creation and asking again for a meeting, he gave a revealing answer. \u201cAlthough we all desire some level of credit, I have moved past many of these things,\u201d read his response from the same Tessier-Ashpool account. \u201cToo many already know secrets, the world does not need to know. There are other means to lead change than to be a dictator.\u201d \n \n After our second followup message asking for a chance to talk, Wright responded that he would consider our request. Then he stopped responding altogether. \n \n Dropping Breadcrumbs? \n \n Despite that overwhelming collection of clues, none of it fully proves that Wright is Nakamoto. All of it could be an elaborate hoax\u2014perhaps orchestrated by Wright himself. The unverified leaked documents could be faked in whole or in part. And most inexplicably of all, comparisons of different archived versions of the three smoking gun posts from Wright\u2019s blog show that he did edit all three\u2014to insert evidence of his bitcoin history. The PGP key associated with Nakamoto\u2019s email address and references to an upcoming \"cryptocurrency paper\" and \"triple entry accounting\" were added sometime after 2013. Even the post noting bitcoin\u2019s beta launch is questionable. While it was ostensibly posted in January 2009, it later seems to have been deleted and then undeleted\u2014or possibly even written for the first time\u2014sometime between October 2013 and June of 2014. \n \n Wright\u2019s blog, his public records, and his verified writings on mail lists and Twitter sketch a man who matches with Satoshi Nakamoto's known characteristics well enough to place him leagues above other candidates. \n \n Why those breadcrumbs were dropped remains a mystery. Is Wright trying to falsely steal Nakamoto\u2019s glory (or money)? Is he quietly revealing himself as bitcoin\u2019s creator? \n \n But this much is clear: If Wright is seeking to fake his Nakamoto connection, his hoax would be practically as ambitious as bitcoin itself. Some of the clues added to his blog were made more than 20 months ago\u2014a very patient deception if it were one. His references to Grigg\u2019s \"triple entry accounting\" paper would represent an uncannily inventive lie, representing a new and obscure possible inspiration for bitcoin. And there\u2019s little doubt Wright is a certified bitcoin mogul. Even the $60 million portion of his cryptocurrency stash that\u2019s verifiable in McGrathNicol\u2019s public audit record is suspiciously large. \n \n More circumstantially, Wright\u2019s blog, his public records, and his verified writings on mail lists and Twitter sketch a man who matches with Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s known characteristics well enough to place him leagues above other candidates. He\u2019s a former subscriber to the 1990s \"cypherpunks\" mailing list devoted to anti-authoritarianism and encryption, an advocate of gold as a financial tool, an accomplished C++ coder, a security professional plausibly capable of writing a tough-to-hack protocol like bitcoin, a libertarian who battled with tax authorities, and a fan of Japanese culture. \n \n He is also\u2014parallels to Nakamoto aside\u2014a strange and remarkable person: an almost obsessive autodidact and double-PhD who once boasted of obtaining new graduate degrees at a rate of about one a year. He\u2019s a climate-change denier, a serial entrepreneur who started companies ranging from security consultancies to a bitcoin bank, and an eccentric who wrote on his blog that he once accepted a challenge to create a pencil from scratch and spent years on the problem, going so far as to make his own bricks to build his own kiln in which to mix the pencil\u2019s graphite. \n \n Wright\u2019s blogging and leaked emails describe a man so committed to an unproven cryptocurrency idea that he mortgaged three properties and invested more than $1 million in computers, power, and connectivity\u2014even going so far as to lay fiberoptic cables to his remote rural home in eastern Australia to mine the first bitcoins. His company, Tulip Trading, built two supercomputers that have officially ranked among the top 500 in the world, both seemingly related to his cryptocurrency projects. (Wright seems to enjoy tulip references, a likely taunt at those who have compared bitcoin to the Netherlands\u2019 17th century \"tulip bubble.\") The first of those supercomputers he named Sukuriputo Okane\u2014Japanese for \"script money.\" Another, named Co1n, holds the title of the world\u2019s most powerful privately owned supercomputer. As Wright told the Bitcoin Investor\u2019s conference, he\u2019s applying that second machine towards the mysterious task of \"modeling Bitcoin\u2019s scalability,\" and meanwhile building an even more powerful supercomputing cluster in Iceland because of its cheap geothermal power. \n \n Bitcoin watchers have long wondered why the giant cache of coins they attribute to Satoshi Nakamoto never moved on the bitcoin\u2019s publicly visible blockchain. Wright\u2019s \"Tulip\" trust fund of 1.1 million bitcoins may hold the key to that mystery. The trust fund PDF signed by Wright\u2019s late friend David Kleiman keeps those coins locked in place until 2020, yet gives Wright the freedom to borrow them for applications including \"research into peer-to-peer systems\" and \"commercial activities that enhance the value and position of bitcoin.\" \n \n Despite those exceptions to the trust\u2019s rules, the million-coin hoard has yet to budge, even after Kleiman\u2019s death in 2013. That may be because Wright could be keeping the coins in place as an investment. He could be leveraging the trust in less visible ways, like legally transferring ownership of money to fund his companies while still leaving it at the same bitcoin address.

Where people go wrong is that they do not see it to be the set of shared experiences with other individuals,\" he wrote in one tweet in October. \n \n When a UCLA professor nominated Satoshi Nakamoto for a Nobel Prize earlier this month\u2014and he was declared ineligible due to the mystery of his identity\u2014Wright lashed out. \"If Satoshi-chan was made for an ACM turing price [sic] or an Alfred Nobel in Economics he would let you bloody know that,\" he wrote on twitter, using the Japanese \"chan\" suffix that indicates familiarity or a nickname. \n \n \"I never desired to be a leader but the choice is not mine,\" reads a third recent tweet from Wright. \"We are a product of the things we create. They change us.\" \n \n In one cryptic and meandering blog post in September in which Wright takes stock of his long career, he even seems to concede that no one can build and wield the wealth that Satoshi Nakamoto has amassed and remain hidden indefinitely. \"There is a certain power and mystery in secrets,\" Wright mused. \n \n \"Am slowly coming to the realisation and acceptance,\" he added, \"No secret remains forever.\" \n \n Update 12/14/2015 2:40pm: New clues following the publication of this story have shown inconsistencies in Wright's academic and supercomputing claims that may point to the second, strange possibility we noted: an elaborate, long-planned hoax. \n \n You may also like:", "SYDNEY, Australia \u2014 The Australian authorities on Wednesday raided the home of a computer expert and entrepreneur in suburban Sydney, just hours after two news outlets identified the man as a likely creator of the digital currency Bitcoin. \n \n The Australian Federal Police said the raid on the residence of the man, Craig Steven Wright, was for a tax investigation, and a spokesman said it had no connection to the Bitcoin reports. The Australian Taxation Office, which asked the police to carry out the raid, declined to comment on \u201cany individual\u2019s or entity\u2019s tax affairs.\u201d \n \n The raid, in the leafy suburb of Gordon on Sydney\u2019s upper north shore, came hours after reports in Wired magazine and Gizmodo drew strong links between Mr. Wright and Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of the virtual currency that has grown to billions of dollars in total value. \n \n The identity of Mr. Nakamoto has been a mystery since the currency\u2019s computer code was released in 2009, with several false leads having been aired and debunked. The growing value of Bitcoin, which is managed by computers that run its peer-to-peer software, has driven the search for its creator or creators. \n \n Wired, which was first to identify Mr. Wright as a possible inventor of the currency, cited old blog posts as well as leaked documents and emails. The magazine acknowledged that the trail of clues could be a hoax, but it added: \u201cIf Wright is seeking to fake his Nakamoto connection, his hoax would be practically as ambitious as Bitcoin itself.\u201d \n \n The Gizmodo report said that Mr. Wright and Dave Kleiman, an American who died in 2013, \u201cwere involved in the development of the digital currency.\u201d \n \n Both outlets cited what was described as a transcript of a 2014 meeting among Mr. Wright, lawyers and tax officials, in which he is quoted as saying, \u201cI did my best to try and hide the fact that I\u2019ve been running Bitcoin since 2009.\u201d \n \n \u201cBy the end of this, I think half the world is going to bloody know,\u201d he added, according to the transcript. \n \n Efforts to reach Mr. Wright on Wednesday were unsuccessful. \n \n A Newsweek investigation in 2014 incorrectly identified the Bitcoin creator as Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, a physicist living with his mother in Southern California. He denied the report, saying he had only learned of Bitcoin weeks earlier after a reporter contacted his son."], "summary": "\u2013 Wired says it has uncovered \"the strongest evidence yet of Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity.\" Nakamoto, the alias for the creator of Bitcoin, has never been unmasked publicly, but Wired's Andy Greenberg and Gwern Branwen name Australian Craig Wright, 44, as the most likely candidate. \"Either Wright invented Bitcoin, or he's a brilliant hoaxer,\" they write. Australian police seem to be believers: They raided Wright's home in Sydney on Wednesday, reports the New York Times. Wired notes that Wright\u2014founder of supercomputing firm Cloudcroft, per Gizmodo\u2014blogged about releasing a \"cryptocurrency paper\" a few months before the Bitcoin white paper was revealed in November 2008, though that post was edited in 2013. He also used an encryption key linked to satoshin@vistomail.com. Nakamoto used satoshi@vistomail.com to introduce the white paper. Wright, who owns at least $60 million in Bitcoin, also has access to 1.1 million Bitcoins worth $605 million\u2014the same amount attributed to Nakamoto. \"I am not from the bloody USA! Nor am I called Dorien [sic],\" Wright wrote in a leaked email sent the same day Newsweek claimed American Dorian Nakamoto as Bitcoin's inventor. Leaked transcripts from meetings with Wright's attorneys in February 2014 also quote him as saying: \"I did my best to try and hide the fact that I've been running Bitcoin since 2009 \u2026 By the end of this I think half the world is going to bloody know.\" Then, in an odd interview at the Bitcoin Investor Conference, a moderator asked Wright how he first learned about Bitcoin. \"Um, I've been involved with all this for a long time,\" he said after a long pause. \"I\u2014try and stay\u2014I keep my head down.\" After sending an encrypted email to Wright suggesting he was Nakamoto, Wired received this response: \"You seem to know a few things. More than you should.\" With a verified identity, Nakamoto could be nominated for a 2016 Nobel Prize, per CoinReport. (Click for more from Wired.)", "ranking": [2, 4, 1, 3, 0]}

Troy Smith. \n \n Magistrate Commissioner Paul Schneider also reduced Wagner's bond from $500,000 - his customary starting point for second-degree murder bonds - to $300,000. \n \n Schneider ordered that should Wagner make bond, she must be fitted with a GPS-enabled ankle monitor and confined to home at all times except for medical appointments. \n \n The ruling marked the end of an unusually long, two-day hearing in commissioner's court during which Sheriff's Office investigators said the physical evidence doesn't support Wagner's various stories to investigators that her husband committed suicide by a gunshot to the head. Prosecutors also accused Wagner admitting guilt. \n \n \"There is one witness who said (Wagner) said she shot her husband,\" Assistant District Attorney Kellie Rish said. \"She confessed to shooting her husband. I want to make sure the court is very clear about what that witness said.\" \n \n But Wagner's defense attorneys, Leo Palazzo and Wiley Beevers, said Wagner has always been consistent in her statement that Smith shot himself. Smith was suffering from PTSD, was depressed, had financial and relationship troubles and had threatened to kill himself just the day before in a text message, according to Palazzo. \n \n And defense attorneys point out that the Sheriff's Office admits Wagner's DNA was not found on the gun used in the shooting. \n \n \"How do you shoot somebody without touching the gun?\" Beevers asked after the hearing. \n \n Smith, 44, an instructor at the Sheriff's Office training academy and a former member of the New Orleans Police Department, died June 24, one week after Wagner called 911 to report that he tried to commit suicide inside their Waggaman home on Father's Day. \n \n Sheriff's Office detectives arrested Wagner on July 11, noting that forensic evidence and interviews led authorities to determine that Smith's injury wasn't self-inflicted. \n \n Dr. Dana Trosclair, the forensic pathologist who conducted Smith's autopsy, took the stand Tuesday. But Trosclair and coroner's office attorney Chuck Credo told the court she could not yet provide an official opinion on whether Smith's death was a homicide or a suicide because the final autopsy report was not complete, according to court records. Toxicology samples are still being tested. \n \n Palazzo, who employed Wagner as a paralegal at his Gretna law firm, did have Trosclair identify the location of Smith's entry wound, the \"parietal scalp, right above the right ear,\" she said. The exit wound was on the \"vertex\" or top of the scalp. \n \n Trosclair described the trajectory as right to left, slightly front to back and upward. \n \n Chief Deputy Tim Scanlan, commander of the Sheriff's Office Crime Lab, also took the stand Tuesday. He testified that his technicians are in the preliminary stages of reconstructing the shooting. \n \n Beevers pressed Scanlan with questions about bullet trajectory and whether he could he sure a hole found in the ceiling of the couple's home was made by a projectile fired at the time of Smith's shooting. \n \n Scanlan conceded that Wagner's DNA was not found on the gun recovered at the shooting scene. But he also testified that the totality of evidence is inconsistent with Smith shooting himself. \n \n Palazzo passionately argued that the state did not prove probable cause to hold Wagner on a murder charge. None of the evidence presented during the hearing prove Wagner shot her husband, he said. \n \n In the end, Schneider agreed with Rish that Wagner's multiple inconsistent statements and the alleged confession to a witness rises to the level of probable cause. \n \n Although Schneider lowered Wagner's bond, Palazzo said the family will not be able to meet the $300,000 amount and called her prosecution political. \n \n \"It is an absolute tragedy,\" he said.", "Shantel Wagner tells the 911 dispatcher that her husband has shot himself.

Moore, a former chief judge of Alabama\u2019s Supreme Court who was twice thrown off the bench for refusing to follow judicial orders, was accused during the campaign of sexually molesting and assaulting girls as young as 14 when he was a district attorney in his 30s. \n \n Trump's Wednesday morning tweet followed one from the previous night, when he congratulated Jones on a \"hard fought victory.\" \n \n Trump had initially called on Moore to drop his Senate candidacy if the allegations were true, but wound up coming back into the Republican candidate\u2019s fold last week with a full-throated endorsement. Trump recorded a robocall on Moore\u2019s behalf that rang Alabamians\u2019 phones earlier this week and hosted a rally last Friday just across the state line in Pensacola, Florida. \n \n The most reliable politics newsletter.

The president held a rally for Strange in Alabama, but only at the urging of others, where he delivered a speech that famously included a screed against NFL players who protest during the national anthem. \"I might have made a mistake,\" the president told the Alabama crowd at the time. \n \n Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), once a loud critic of the president's who has more recently become a golf partner and cheerleader of Trump's, echoed the president's Monday-morning-quarterbacking with a post to his own Twitter account, bashing former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who loudly backed Moore's campaign. \n \n \"When it comes to Alabama politics Steve Bannon should have followed President @realDonaldTrump lead in supporting Luther Strange,\" Graham said Wednesday morning. \"Trump\u2019s instincts on the Alabama race proved to be correct.\" \n \n It was unclear what Trump meant with his suggestion that \u201cthe deck was stacked against\u201d Moore, given Alabama\u2019s status among the most conservative states in the nation. The state has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1992, when Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) ran as a member of the opposite party before becoming a Republican. The state has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1976. \n \n Jones's soon-to-be colleague on Capitol Hill, Sen.

And so I think that is a testament to this election, and because of it, I have hope for this country.\" \n \n Former Vice President Joe Biden, whose relationship with Jones dates back to Biden's 1988 presidential campaign, said he spoke to Jones three times on Tuesday. Biden headlined a rally in Alabama for Jones early on in his race against Moore and was perhaps the highest-profile Democrat to appear in-state on Jones's behalf. The former vice president said Jones was \"over the moon\" and \"really anxious to get to work\" in the Senate in the wake of his Tuesday night win, praising the senator-elect for using his victory speech to call on Congress to renew the Children's Health Insurance Program instead of bashing his GOP opponent. \n \n The former vice president also suggested that Senate Republicans were likely breathing a sigh of relief in the wake of Moore's defeat, pleased that they would not have to be associated with Moore, a controversial firebrand even before the allegations of child molestation came out. \n \n \"Probably some if the happiest people in America today are the Republicans in the senate.

Russia denies the accusation. \n \n Some 2,600 people have died in fighting in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions since April. \n \n The conflict erupted following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula a month before. \n \n War in eastern Ukraine: The human cost", "European leaders, he added, had long stated that any further escalation of the conflict would set off additional sanctions, and they would \u201cbe ready to take some more measures\u201d at the meeting in Brussels. \n \n President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France also backed new measures against Russia, telling journalists in Brussels that \u201cwhat is happening in Ukraine is so serious\u201d that European leaders were obliged to increase sanctions. \n \n But France is expected to block calls by some leaders to extend an existing ban on future military sales to Russia to include already signed contracts.

Russia, she added, was \u201cin a state of war against Ukraine and that means that it is in a state of war against countries that want to be closer to the European Union and that means practically that Russia is in a state of war against Europe. That means we have to help Ukraine battle back, to defend its territory and its people, to help militarily.\u201d \n \n Fighting in eastern Ukraine has been going on for months, mostly around rebel-held Donetsk and Luhansk. But the conflict expanded last week after the rebels \u2014 backed by Russian forces, according to NATO \u2014 opened a front along a coastal road leading to the industrial port city of Mariupol. \n \n Ukrainian military units and the civilian population were preparing on Saturday to defend the city against any assault by the Russian-backed militias, Ukraine\u2019s military spokesman, Col.

The city fell briefly under the control of pro-Russian fighters earlier this year, but after they were driven out it had been firmly in the hands of Ukraine. The governor of the Donetsk region, forced from his headquarters in the city of Donetsk, decamped there to maintain a formal, if largely impotent, government presence.", "KIEV/BRUSSELS Ukraine said Russian tanks had flattened a small border town and pro-Russian rebels had made fresh gains in its east, as EU leaders signaled on Saturday they would threaten more sanctions against Moscow over the crisis. \n \n Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, attending an EU summit in Brussels, said he was hoping for a political solution, but warned that his country was on the brink of full-scale war. \n \n Russia has repeatedly dismissed accusations from Kiev and Western powers that it has sent soldiers into its neighbor, or supported pro-Russian rebels fighting a five-month-old separatist war in Ukraine's east. \n \n But Ukraine military spokesman Andriy Lysenko told journalists in Kiev that Russian tanks had entered the small Ukrainian town of Novosvitlivka on the border with Russia and fired on every house. \n \n \"We have information that virtually every house has been destroyed,\" Lysenko added, without giving details on when the reported attack took place. Ukraine's daily military briefings typically cover the previous 24 hours. \n \n Lysenko said the rebels had made new gains just east of the border city of Luhansk, one of the rebels' main strongholds, after opening up a new front in another area last week. \n \n \"Direct military aggression by the Russian Federation in the east of Ukraine is continuing. The Russians are continuing to send military equipment and 'mercenaries',\" Ukraine's defense and security council said in a separate Twitter post. \n \n Kiev and Western countries say recent rebel gains were the result of the arrival of armored columns of Russian troops, sent by Russian President Vladimir Putin to prop up a separatist rebellion that would otherwise have been near collapse. \n \n There was no immediate fresh comment from Russia on Saturday. Putin on Friday compared Kiev's drive to regain control of its rebellious eastern cities to the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in World War Two. \n \n \"NO TIME TO WASTE\" \n \n EU leaders meeting in Brussels appointed Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk as president of the European Council, giving hawkish Kremlin critics in Eastern Europe new influence in the bloc. \n \n According to a draft statement from the summit, the EU leaders were set to ask the European Commission and the EU's diplomatic service \"to urgently undertake preparatory work\" on further sanctions that could be implemented if necessary. \n \n French President Francois Hollande stressed that a failure by Russia to reverse a flow of weapons and troops into eastern Ukraine would force the bloc to impose new economic measures. \n \n \"Are we going to let the situation worsen, until it leads to war?\" Hollande said at a news conference. \"Because that's the risk today. There is no time to waste.\" \n \n European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the EU was prepared to toughen sanctions against Russia but also that it wanted a political deal to end the confrontation. \n \n \"We are ready to take very strong and clear measures but we are keeping our doors open to a political solution,\" Barroso said at a news conference with Ukraine's president. \n \n Poroshenko said the crisis was close to a tipping point. \n \n \"I think we are very close to the point of no return. The point of no return is full-scale war, which already happened on the territory controlled by separatists,\" he said. \n \n He added, however, that a trilateral meeting on Monday involving representatives of Kiev, Moscow and the European Union could produce a ceasefire. \n \n SHOTS FIRED \n \n The crisis started when Ukraine's Moscow-backed president was ousted by street protests in February after he ditched a pact with the EU that would have moved the ex-Soviet republic firmly toward Europe and away from Russia. \n \n Russia denounced the pro-Western leadership that took over as \"a fascist junta\" and went on to annex Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. Pro-Russian separatists then rebelled in Ukraine's mainly Russian-speaking east in April, setting up 'people's republics' and declaring they wanted to join Russia. \n \n A senior U.N. human rights official said on Friday nearly 2,600 civilians, Ukrainian government forces and rebels had been killed in a conflict which has led to the biggest Russia-West crisis since the Cold War. \n \n In Kiev, Ukraine's Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said a group of pro-Ukrainian fighters had broken out of encirclement by pro-Russian rebels near Donetsk early on Saturday, though other reports suggested many remained trapped. \n \n Defense Minister Valery Heletey also ordered a clamp-down on information coming out of Ilovaysk, a town to the east of Donetsk. \n \n Indicating government forces were being pulled back from the area, Heletey said on his Facebook page: \"As soon as the danger for Ukrainian units has passed, all open information for the current period relating to the withdrawal of forces from Ilovaysk will be published.\" \n \n Last week pro-Russian rebels opened a new front in a separate, coastal territory along the Sea of Azov and pushed Ukrainian troops out of the town of Novoazovsk. They are now threatening the strategic port city of Mariupol. \n \n Several shots were fired on Saturday at a car carrying Alexander Zakharchenko, leader of the breakaway Donetsk People's Republic, but he escaped unscathed, another separatist leader, Sergei Kavtaradze, told Reuters. \n \n \"Zakharchenko wasn't hurt. His driver was wounded and is being operated on,\" Kavtaradze said, adding that an operation was under way to catch whoever had fired the shots. \n \n (Additional reporting by Pavel Polityuk in Kiev and Anton Zverev in Donetsk; Writing by Richard Balmforth; Editing by Andrew Heavens and Robin Pomeroy)", "BRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 The European Union on Saturday warned that the apparent incursion of Russian troops on Ukrainian soil pushes the conflict closer to a point of no return, with new economic sanctions being drawn up to make Moscow reconsider its position. \n \n Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, right, talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel during an European People's Party summit ahead of the EU summit in Brussels, Saturday, Aug. 30, 2014.

So consequences must follow.\" \n \n Conceding ground in the face of a reinvigorated rebel offensive, Ukraine said Saturday that it was abandoning a city where its forces have been surrounded by rebels for days. Government forces were also pulling back from another it had claimed to have taken control of two weeks earlier. \n \n The statements by Col. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the national security council, indicate that Ukrainian forces face increasingly strong resistance from Russian-backed separatist rebels just weeks after racking up significant gains and forcing rebels out of much of the territory they had held. \n \n Poroshenko, meanwhile, said Ukraine would welcome an EU decision to help with military equipment and further intelligence-sharing. \n \n The office of the Donetsk mayor reported in a statement that at least two people died in an artillery attack on one of Donetsk's neighborhoods. Shelling was reported elsewhere in the city, but there was no immediate word on casualties. \n \n In Brussels, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said \"sanctions are not an end in themselves,\" but a means to dissuade Russia from further destabilizing Ukraine. \n \n \"We may see a situation where we reach the point of no return,\" Barroso warned. \"If the escalation of the conflict continues, this point of no return can come.\" \n \n He provided no specifics about which sanctions the heads of state and government might adopt to inflict more economic pain to nudge Russia toward a political solution. \n \n The U.S. and the EU have so far imposed sanctions against dozens of Russian officials, several companies and the country's financial industry. Moscow has retaliated by banning food imports. \n \n Grybauskaite said the EU should impose a full arms embargo, including the canceling of already agreed contracts. France has so far staunchly opposed that proposal because it has a $1.6 billion contract to build Mistral helicopter carriers for Russia. \n \n The EU's requirement for a unanimous agreement among the 28 nation has in the past blocked or softened decisions since some nations fear the economic fallout. \n \n Russia is the EU's No. 3 trading partner and one of its biggest oil and gas suppliers. The EU, in turn, is Russia's biggest commercial partner, making any sanctions more biting than similar measures adopted by the U.S. \n \n Barroso said that the EU \u2014 a bloc encompassing 500 million people and stretching from Lisbon to the border with Ukraine \u2014 stands ready to grant Kiev further financial assistance if needed. The bloc will also organize a donors' conference to help rebuild the country's east at the end of the year, he added. \n \n Ukrainian forces had been surrounded by rebels in the town of Ilovaysk, about 20 kilometers (15 miles) east of the largest rebel-held city of Donetsk for days. \n \n \"We are surrendering this city,\" Ukraine's Lysenko told reporters. \"Our task now is to evacuate our military with the least possible losses in order to regroup.\" \n \n Lysenko said that regular units of the military had been ordered to retreat from Novosvitlivka and Khryashchuvate, two towns on the main road between the Russian border and Luhansk, the second-largest rebel-held city. Ukraine had claimed control of Novosvitlivka earlier in August. \n \n Separately, Ukrainian forces said one of their Su-25 fighter jets was shot down Friday over eastern Ukraine by a missile from a Russian missile launcher.

He's anything but.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 9:45 a.m. \n \n President Donald Trump's son-in-law has arrived for questioning by Senate investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible links to the Trump campaign. \n \n Jared Kushner is speaking in a closed session Monday to staff on the Senate intelligence committee. Earlier, he released an 11-page statement detailing four contacts with Russians during Trump's campaign and transition. \n \n Kushner in those prepared remarks says he \"did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government.\" \n \n Kushner is to meet with lawmakers on the House intelligence committee Tuesday. \n \n __ \n \n 9:20 a.m. \n \n President Donald Trump is calling the top Democrat on the House intelligence panel \"sleazy\" for conducting what he says is a \"biased\" Russia investigation. \n \n The president tweeted Monday that \"Sleazy Adam Schiff, the totally biased Congressman looking into 'Russia,' spends all of his time on television pushing the Dem loss excuse!\" \n \n Trump has repeatedly called the investigation a \"witch hunt\" spearheaded by Democrats because of the Republican victory in 2016. \n \n California Rep. Schiff has been an outspoken advocate of hearing testimony from Trump associates on their contacts with Russian officials during last year's election. \n \n ___ \n \n 9 a.m. \n \n President Donald Trump is questioning why those investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion by members of his campaign aren't digging into Hillary Clinton's \"crimes & Russia relations.\" \n \n In doing so, the president took his latest swipe at Attorney General Jeff Sessions, including him in the list of people who he says should be investigating Clinton's potential Russia links. \n \n Trump tweeted Monday, \"So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?\" \n \n Sessions recused himself from the investigation earlier this year after it was revealed that he had met with a top Russian diplomat last year. \n \n Trump condemned Sessions' recusal in a New York Times interview last week, saying he never should have taken the job as attorney general. \n \n __ \n \n 7:20 a.m. \n \n President Donald Trump's son-in-law says he received a \"random email\" during the presidential campaign from someone claiming to have Trump's tax returns and demanding ransom to keep the information secret. \n \n Jared Kushner says he interpreted the email as a hoax. Kushner says the email came from a person going by the name \"Guccifer400.\" The name is an apparent reference to Guccifer 2.0, an anonymous hacker who has claimed responsibility for breaking into the Democratic National Committee's computer systems. \n \n Kushner says the emailer demanded payment in Bitcoin, an online currency. Kushner says he showed the email to a Secret Service agent, who told him to ignore it. Kushner disclosed the details of the email ahead of a closed-door interview Monday with a Senate committee investigating Russia's meddling in the 2016 election. \n \n __ \n \n 6:33 a.m. \n \n The son-in-law of President Donald Trump is blaming his assistant for filing a version of his security clearance questionnaire that left off any contacts with foreign governments. \n \n Jared Kushner says the assistant accidentally filed the questionnaire while it was still being prepared. He says the initial form left off all foreign contacts, not just ones with Russians. Kushner says he eventually disclosed more than 100 contacts with people from more than 20 countries. Kushner says that list includes the King of Jordan, the prime minister of Israel and a high-ranking Mexican government official. \n \n Kushner is disclosing the information about his foreign contacts just hours before he speaks behind closed doors with a Senate committee investigating Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and any possible collusion with Trump associates. \n \n ___ \n \n 6:06 a.m. \n \n The son-in-law of President Donald Trump says a June 2016 meeting with a Russian-American lawyer was such a \"waste of time\" that he asked his assistant to call him out of the gathering. \n \n That's according to a statement Jared Kushner is providing to congressional committees this week. \n \n Emails released this month show Donald Trump Jr. accepted the meeting at Trump Tower with the idea that he would receive damaging information about Hillary Clinton. But Kushner says he hadn't seen those emails until recently shown them by his lawyers. \n \n Kushner says in his statement that Trump Jr. invited him to the meeting. He says he arrived late and heard the lawyer discussing the issue of adoptions. He says he texted his assistant to call him out of the meeting. \n \n ___ \n \n 6:00 a.m. \n \n President Donald Trump's son-in-law says that he only had four contacts with Russians during the campaign and presidential transition and that none of them were improper. \n \n Jared Kusher also says he never colluded with any foreign government during the presidential campaign. He also is denying that Russians finance any of his business in the private sector. \n \n Kushner is disclosing the information in an 11-page statement provided to The Associated Press. The release of the statement comes just hours before he is to be interviewed by a Senate committee investigating Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and any possible collusion by Trump associates. \n \n The interview with the Senate intelligence committee is behind closed doors. \n \n ___ \n \n 3:20 a.m. \n \n Congressional investigators probing Russia's meddling in the U.S. election will have their first opportunity this week to hear from someone in President Donald Trump's innermost circle: son-in-law Jared Kushner. \n \n Kushner, who is a senior adviser to the president and is married to Trump's daughter, Ivanka, will talk to staff on the Senate Intelligence Committee Monday behind closed doors. On Tuesday, he'll talk privately to members of the House Intelligence Committee. \n \n Both panels are investigating Russian interference and possible connections to Trump's campaign. Kushner has attracted attention for a December meeting with a leading Russian diplomat. He oversaw digital strategy for the campaign, and some lawmakers have said they want more answers about whether Russian social media \"trolls\" were connected to Trump's election efforts.", "Jared Kushner really wants everyone to believe that he did nothing wrong. \n \n Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law and top aide released a public statement about the Russia scandal on Monday morning, a preview of what he\u2019s going to say in closed-door congressional testimony this week. \n \n \u201cI did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government. I had no improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector. I have tried to be fully transparent,\ufffd? Kushner writes. \u201cHopefully, this puts these matters to rest.\ufffd? \n \n But a close read of the letter suggests that it does not, in fact, put these matters to rest. By Kushner\u2019s own account, he met with Russian nationals four times during the presidential campaign and transition. His descriptions of these meetings are incomplete, full of unconfirmed details, and at times directly contradictory of other sources\u2019 accounts of the same events. \n \n The statement is carefully constructed; the whole thing reads like it was put together by a very talented legal team. But shady behavior is still shady no matter how good the lawyers \u2014 and even Kushner\u2019s very precise defense of his actions raises big new questions for the Trump-Russia scandal. What follows are three of the biggest issues it brings up. \n \n Someone has massively misled us on the Trump-Russia backchannel \n \n On December 1, 2016, Kushner met with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Trump\u2019s now-disgraced National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was also present at the meeting. \n \n At this meeting, the Washington Post reported back in May, Kushner had asked Kislyak if it would be possible to set up a secure communications line between the Trump camp and Russia inside the Russian Embassy in Washington. The Post reported that this was \u201can apparent move to shield their pre-inauguration discussions from monitoring, according to US officials briefed on intelligence reports.\ufffd? \n \n In his statement on Monday, Kushner confirms that this meeting took place. He also confirms that he asked Kislyak about communicating through a secure line at the embassy. But he says it was a one-time proposal for receiving information about the Syrian conflict during the transition and denies that there was any effort to hide communications between the Trump camp and Russia from US snooping: \n \n I believed developing a thoughtful approach on Syria was a very high priority given the ongoing humanitarian crisis, and I asked if they had an existing communications channel at his embassy we could use where they would be comfortable transmitting the information they wanted to relay to General Flynn. The Ambassador said that would not be possible and so we all agreed that we would receive this information after the Inauguration. Nothing else occurred. I did not suggest a \"secret back channel.\" I did not suggest an on-going secret form of communication for then or for when the administration took office. I did not raise the possibility of using the embassy or any other Russian facility for any purpose other than this one possible conversation in the transition period. We did not discuss sanctions. \n \n To be clear, experts believe even this limited proposal was a bad idea. Anyone familiar with spying knows that sending a US citizen into a secure Russian communications facility would be rejected by both US and Russian intelligence as too risky. Kushner\u2019s defense, in essence, is ignorance: He briefly proposed a really bad idea, it was shot down by Kislyak, and that was the end of it. \n \n But this is a very different account of the meeting than what appeared in the Post. A number of US intelligence officials, according to the Post, seemed to believe the effort was a far more ambitious attempt to hide the Trump team\u2019s communications from the US\u2019s own spies. This would be incredibly nefarious: It would suggest that there was some information Kushner wanted to share with the Russians (or vice versa) but did not want anyone in the US government, let alone the American public, to know about. \n \n There are only three possible options: The Post\u2019s report is wrong, American spies misread the meeting, or Kushner is lying. \n \n This isn\u2019t an unresolvable conflict. According to the Post, US intelligence officials based their assessment on an intercept of a phone call between Kislyak and his superiors at the Kremlin, wherein he recounted his version of the meeting. \n \n \u201cKislyak reportedly was taken aback by the suggestion of allowing an American to use Russian communications gear at its embassy or consulate,\ufffd? the Post\u2019s Ellen Nakashima, Adam Entous, and Greg Miller write. \u201cOfficials said that it\u2019s unclear what Kislyak would have had to gain by falsely characterizing his contacts with Kushner to Moscow.\ufffd? \n \n So far from clearing things up, Kushner\u2019s letter has now raised a series of new questions: Why does his account of the meeting differ so sharply from what the intercept of Kislyak\u2019s call seemed to suggest? What did Kislyak actually tell the Russian government about the call? And how does Flynn, who has offered to testify in exchange for immunity for prosecution, recall the meeting? \n \n Kushner met with a shady Russian banker/former intelligence officer at the Russian government\u2019s urging \n \n After the December 1 meeting, Kislyak and Kushner stayed in touch. According to Kushner, he turned down multiple requests to meet with Kislyak again, once even arranging a meeting between Kislyak and his assistant to avoid having to sit down again (which seems odd, given Kislyak\u2019s stature). \n \n The ambassador repeatedly insisted that Kushner meet with a man named Sergey Gorkov, the head of the state-connected Russian bank Vnesheconombank (VEB). Gorkov is known to be close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and graduated from the Russian FSB\u2019s spy academy; his bank had been directly targeted by sanctions imposed by the Obama administration after the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Yet Kushner decided to have a sit-down with Gorkov at the Russian government\u2019s urging. \n \n \u201cI agreed to meet Mr. Gorkov because the Ambassador has been so insistent, said he had a direct relationship with the President [Putin], and because Mr. Gorkov was only in New York for a couple days,\ufffd? Kushner says. \n \n This meeting has been public knowledge since March. But the details in Kushner\u2019s statement raise new questions about the nature of the meeting itself. \n \n In a statement, Gorkov said the meeting was part of a broader strategy of sitting down with \u201cbusiness circles of the US, including with the head of Kushner Companies, Jared Kushner.\ufffd? This would suggest that the meeting was about potentially doing business together \u2014 which would raise serious conflict of interest questions given Kushner\u2019s role doing policy work for his father-in-law. If they chatted about potentially providing loans to VEB, as my colleague Alexia Fern\u00e1ndez Campbell explains, Kushner could face 20 years in prison under US sanctions law. \n \n Kushner flatly denies all of this. \n \n \u201cAt no time was there any discussion about my companies, business transactions, real estate projects, loans, banking arrangements or any private business of any kind. At the end of the short meeting, we thanked each other and I went on to other meetings,\ufffd? he writes in his statement. \n \n Instead, he says, Gorkov gave him some gifts, \u201ctold me a little about his bank and made some statements about the Russian economy,\ufffd? and \u201csaid that he was friendly with President Putin, expressed disappointment with U.S.-Russia relations under President Obama and hopes for a better relationship in the future.\ufffd? \n \n That sounds extremely boring. So why would Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, badger Kushner \u2014 for days, Kushner\u2019s account suggests \u2014 to take such a boring meeting? And why does the Putin-linked banker in question have an account of the meeting\u2019s agenda that\u2019s different from Kushner\u2019s? And what \u201cstatements about the Russian economy\ufffd? did Gorkov allegedly make, exactly? Did they suggest investment opportunities for the Kushner Companies, perhaps loans? \n \n Again, Kushner\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t really resolve anything \u2014 instead, it raises a host of significant new questions about his links to the Kremlin. \n \n This letter reveals a ton of specific facts about collusion that set up Kushner for trouble \n \n These two meetings, with Kislyak and Gorkov, took place during the transition. But there\u2019s another key meeting that Kushner took, this time during the campaign: Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s now-infamous June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer to try to get dirt on Hillary Clinton. \n \n Kushner\u2019s defense of attending the meeting is that he had no clue what it was really about. \n \n He claims not to have read to the bottom of the email chain in which it was written that the meeting was \u201cpart of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.\ufffd? He claims to have been \u201ca little late\ufffd? to the meeting, and that when he arrived they were talking about \u201cthe issue of a ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children,\ufffd? implying that he missed the part where they discussed Russian dirt on Clinton (which according to Trump Jr. happened at the beginning). \n \n He then claims to have been super bored for the whole thing: \u201cI actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there for ten or so minutes and wrote \u2018Can u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting.\u2019\ufffd? \n \n This, yet again, is an odd account of the meeting in question. It would lead us to believe that Kushner never asked Donald Trump Jr. why he brought Kushner into this waste of time meeting during a vital period in the campaign (right after they secured the nomination, shortly before the Republican National Convention). \n \n But perhaps more fundamentally, Kushner\u2019s account provides a lot of details that can be checked by reporters, FBI agents, and congressional investigators. For example, was Kushner actually late enough to the meeting to miss every mention of potential assistance with the campaign? There were seven other people there, and you can bet the FBI will be talking to all of them to confirm Kushner\u2019s story. \n \n There\u2019s a lot for investigators to go on here \n \n Indeed, the entire section of the letter focusing on the campaign is like this: Kushner sets up very specific factual assertions, many of which can be easily checked by reporters and federal investigators. \n \n For example, Kushner specifically contests a report, from Reuters, that he had two calls with Kislyak during the campaign (specifically, between April and November 2016). \n \n \u201cI do not recall any such calls with the Russian Ambassador,\ufffd? he writes. \u201cWe have reviewed the phone records available to us and have not been able to identify any calls to any number we know to be associated with Ambassador Kislyak and I am highly skeptical these calls took place.\ufffd? \n \n This is a very specific factual assertion: There were no calls between Kushner and any number that could be traced back to Kislyak or one of his associates during a seven-month time frame. The FBI can review the same phone records and see who\u2019s telling the truth. \n \n His first conversation with Kislyak, Kushner claims, took place at a Trump foreign policy speech delivered in April 2016 in Washington. Reportedly, Dimitri Simes \u2014 the CEO of the Center for the National Interest, which convened the speech \u2014 introduced the two men. \n \n \u201cHe [Simes] introduced me to several guests, among them four ambassadors, including Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak,\ufffd? Kushner writes. \u201cWith all the ambassadors, including Mr. Kislyak, we shook hands, exchanged brief pleasantries. ... Each exchange lasted less than a minute; some gave me their business cards and invited me to lunch at their embassies. I never took them up on any of these invitations and that was the extent of the interactions.\ufffd? \n \n Again, these are all specific assertions that investigators can look into, to see if they are outright false or at very least omit important context. And there\u2019s every indication that Congress and the FBI will do just that. \n \n \u201cHis description of his financial relationships with individuals and businesses tied to Russia appears incomplete, at best,\ufffd? Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) said in a statement emailed to press after the letter\u2019s release. \u201cThere should be no presumption that he is telling the whole truth in this statement.\ufffd? \n \n Kushner\u2019s legal team may have hoped that this letter would help put suspicion surrounding Kushner\u2019s links to Russia to bed. It seems more likely that the opposite will be true: that the unanswered questions in this statement will lead to even closer scrutiny of one of the president\u2019s top advisers. \n \n Watch: Why Donald Trump Jr.'s emails change everything", "\"I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government,\" Kushner says in the statement. \"I had no improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector. I have tried to be fully transparent with regard to the filing of my SF-86 form, above and beyond what is required. Hopefully, this puts these matters to rest.\" \n \n Kushner disputes a Reuters report claiming he had two phone calls between April and November 2016 with the Russian ambassador at the time, Sergey Kislyak, explaining that he has no recollection of those calls and a \"comprehensive review of my land line and cell phone records from the time does not reveal those calls.\" \n \n Kushner also seeks to distance himself from the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower that has become a part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, saying he had no prior knowledge of the topic and did not read Trump Jr.'s full email asking him to join the session. \n \n \"That email was on top of a long back and forth that I did not read at the time,\" Kushner said in the statement. \"As I did with most emails when I was working remotely, I quickly reviewed on my iPhone the relevant message that the meeting would occur at 4:00 PM at his office.\" \n \n The bulk of the email revealed that Trump Jr. believed the Russian government would provide him with damaging information about Hillary Clinton during the meeting. \n \n The meeting's participants said the meeting instead focused on Russian adoptions, and Kushner says in his statement that he emailed his assistant about 10 minutes after he walked into the room. \n \n \"Can u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting,\" Kushner wrote to his assistant in an email provided to the committees alongside the statement. He quoted the emails in his statement but did not disclose them to the media. \n \n The previously undisclosed detail is just one of several that Kushner reveals in the letter in an effort to clear himself of any suspicions stemming from the congressional and federal investigations into contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russia. \n \n The June 2016 meeting set up by Trump Jr., which was only publicly revealed for the first time this month, has become a target of scrutiny in those investigations after emails revealed that Trump Jr. believed he would obtain damaging information about Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. \n \n President Donald Trump has repeatedly decried the investigations as a \"witch hunt,\" but the June 2016 meeting and surrounding emails offered the most concrete evidence that Trump campaign officials were open to collaborating with the Russian government. \n \n Kushner also addresses the controversy over his SF-86 form -- the questionnaire needed to obtain a security clearance -- explaining that it was prematurely submitted in error by his assistant, who believed the forms were complete. \n \n \"People at my New York office were helping me find the information, organize it, review it and put it into the electronic form. They sent an email to my assistant in Washington, communicating that the changes to one particular section were complete; my assistant interpreted that message as meaning that the entire form was completed,\" Kushner writes, noting that the form was a \"rough draft\" at the time. \"Because of this miscommunication, my assistant submitted the draft on January 18, 2017.\" \n \n Kushner says he and his team realized that evening the form was submitted prematurely and the next day, they provided an update to the transition noting that Kushner had \"numerous contacts with foreign officials\" and would soon provide a full accounting of those contacts. \n \n He would subsequently update the SF-86 form two more times. In the next update, he provided a list of more than 100 contacts with foreign officials, but left off the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. \n \n JUST WATCHED Mueller to WH: Preserve Trump Jr. meeting docs Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mueller to WH: Preserve Trump Jr. meeting docs 02:56 \n \n Kushner said he later became aware of that update amid a review of his records, and his attorneys provided another update to his SF-86 form last month. \n \n Kushner also provided his first accounting of what he said were his only two meetings with Kislyak, the Russian ambassador at the time, during the campaign and transition, and says that neither encounter included a discussion of US-imposed sanctions. Kislyak completed his service as ambassador and returned to Russia over the weekend. \n \n Kushner described his first encounter with Kislyak during the campaign as brief, with little more than \"pleasantries exchanged.\" \n \n He then met with Kislyak during the transition, at which point the then-Russian ambassador offered to provide transition officials with Russian military information on the conflict in Syria. \n \n That meeting was the subject of reports claiming that Kushner and Kislyak had sought to establish a secret backchannel between the two countries, which Kushner denies. \n \n But Kushner does confirm that he sought to receive the Syria briefing from Russian generals at the Russian embassy in Washington because the transition office was not equipped with secure lines. But Kislyak said \"that would not be possible,\" Kushner explains. \n \n Kushner also offers his first on-the-record account of his meeting with Sergey Gorkov, the head of the Russian state-owned VneshEconomBank, or VEB, whom Kushner says he met with at Kislyak's behest. \n \n Kushner disputes VEB's account of the meeting. He says he met with Gorkov in his capacity as a transition official because of Gorkov's close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. VEB, which has been under US sanctions since July 2014, has claimed the interaction was a business meeting set up due to Kushner's role as a prominent New York real estate developer. \n \n Now a senior adviser to the President, Kushner discloses that he received two gifts from Gorkov and said he asked his assistant to register them with the transition at the time: \"One was a piece of art from Nvgorod, the village where my grandparents were from in Belarus, and the other was a bag of dirt from that same village.\" \n \n This story has been updated with additional details from Kushner's statement.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n Jared Kushner told reporters Monday he had done nothing wrong, that no collusion with Russia had taken place, and that his father-in-law won in November because he ran a better campaign than Hillary Clinton \u2014 not because he got help from Moscow. \n \n \"Let me be very clear. I did not collude with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so,\" Kushner, a senior presidential adviser, said at a podium in front of the White House after more than two hours of questions behind closed doors from staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee. \n \n Related: Jared Kushner\u2019s Full Statement to Congress \n \n \"Records and documents I\u2019ve provided will show all of my actions were proper and occurred in the normal course of events in a very unique campaign,\" he said. \"I had no improper contacts, I have not relied on Russian funds for my businesses, and I have been fully transparent in providing all requested information.\" \n \n He added, \"Donald Trump had a better message and ran a smarter campaign and that is why he won. Suggesting otherwise ridicules those who voted for him.\" \n \n Earlier in the day, before Kushner was interviewed by the committee staff, he released an 11-page statement detailing four contacts with Russians during the election and transition and denying any collusion with Moscow. \n \n Among the meetings with Russian officials he addressed in his written statement was a June 2016 sit-down that included Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. In his statement, Kushner said that meeting was such a \"waste of time\" that he asked his assistant to call him out of the gathering. \n \n Ahead of that meeting, Donald Trump Jr. had been promised potentially damaging information about Clinton, according to emails he released earlier this month \u2014 although the president's son has said the meeting did not produce any information and that Veselnitskaya wanted to discuss an adoption program of Russian children. \n \n Democrats have pounced on the meeting as evidence that Trump Jr. was willing to collude with a foreigner purporting to have information tied to the Russian government to help his father's presidential campaign and influence the results of the election. \n \n Kushner said in his initial Monday statement that he had not spoken to the lawyer since. \"I thought nothing more of this short meeting until it came to my attention recently,\" he said. \n \n In his statement, Kushner said his first meeting with a Russian official came in April 2016 at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. Following a speech there by then-candidate Trump about foreign policy, the event\u2019s host, Dimitri Simes, introduced Kushner \"to several guests, among them four ambassadors, including Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\" \n \n Kushner wrote of two additional meetings with Russian officials, both which occurred after Trump won. \n \n President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior White House advisor, Jared Kushner, arrives for a meeting with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on July 24 in Washington. Win McNamee / Getty Images \n \n A Dec. 1 meeting with Kislyak at Trump Tower \"lasted twenty- thirty minutes,\" where \"Lt. General Michael Flynn (Ret.), who became the President's National Security Advisor\" was also present, Kushner said he \"stated our desire for a fresh start in relations. Also, as I had done in other meetings with foreign officials, I asked Ambassador Kislyak if he would identify the best person (whether the Ambassador or someone else) with whom to have direct discussions and who had contact with his President,\" he wrote. \n \n Kushner, in his statement, also wrote of a Dec. 13 meeting with Sergey Gorkov, who Kislyak had said \"was a banker and someone with a direct line to the Russian President who could give insight into how Putin was viewing the new administration and best ways to work together.\" \n \n \"I agreed to meet Mr. Gorkov because the Ambassador has been so insistent, said he had a direct relationship with the President, and because Mr. Gorkov was only in New York for a couple days,\" Kushner wrote. \n \n \"As I did at the meeting with Ambassador Kislyak, I expressed the same sentiments I had with other foreign officials I met. There were no specific policies discussed. We had no discussion about the sanctions imposed by the Obama Administration,\" Kushner wrote. \n \n NBC News had reported in June that members of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees proving Russian interference might be looking into whether Kushner had been looking for a customer in Moscow to buy the massively expensive 41-story tower at 666 Fifth Avenue from his family's real estate company. \n \n The Senate Intelligence Committee is investigating Russia's alleged attempted interference in the 2016 presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the covert operation was intended to damage Clinton's campaign and evolved into an attempt to help Trump win. \n \n Kushner arrived at Capitol Hill for his interviews around 9:40 a.m., and did not respond to questions being shouted by reporters. \n \n He emerged more than two hours later, responding to more shouted questions from reporters that his interviews had gone \"very well\" and that he had answered \"as many (questions) as they had.\" He later spoke to reporters in front of the White House at a podium with the White House seal on it. \n \n His interview took place in a special area used for classified briefings and meetings called a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF. The SCIF is on the second floor of the Hart Senate Office Building, the same place where the Intelligence Committee has held recent interviews with James Clapper, Denis McDonough and Susan Rice. \n \n Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the top Democrat on the Senate panel, said Monday there was a \"broad bipartisan expectation\" that Kushner would be called before the committee again.", "STATEMENT OF JARED C.

Because there has been a great deal of conjecture, speculation, and inaccurate information about me, I am grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight. \n \n My Role in the Trump for President Campaign \n \n Before joining the administration, I worked in the private sector, building and managing companies. My experience was in business, not politics, and it was not my initial intent to play a large role in my father-in-law's campaign when he decided to run for President. However, as the campaign progressed, I was called on to assist with various tasks and aspects of the campaign, and took on more and more responsibility. \n \n Over the course of the primaries and general election campaign, my role continued to evolve. I ultimately worked with the finance, scheduling, communications, speechwriting, polling, data and digital teams, as well as becoming a point of contact for foreign government officials. \n \n All of these were tasks that I had never performed on a campaign previously. When I was faced with a new challenge, I would reach out to contacts, ask advice, find the right person to manage the specific challenge, and work with that person to develop and execute a plan of action. I was lucky to work with some incredibly talented people along the way, all of whom made significant contributions toward the campaign's ultimate success. Our nimble culture allowed us to adjust to the ever-changing circumstances and make changes on the fly as the situation warranted. I share this information because these actions should be viewed through the lens of a fast-paced campaign with thousands of meetings and interactions, some of which were impactful and memorable and many of which were not. \n \n It is also important to note that a campaign's success starts with its message and its messenger. Donald Trump had the right vision for America and delivered his message perfectly. The results speak for themselves. Not only did President Trump defeat sixteen skilled and experienced primary opponents and win the presidency; he did so spending a fraction of what his opponent spent in the general election. He outworked his opponent and ran one of the best campaigns in history using both modern technology and traditional methods to bring his message to the American people. \n \n Campaign Contacts with Foreign Persons \n \n When it became apparent that my father-in-law was going to be the Republican nominee for President, as normally happens, a number of officials from foreign countries attempted to reach out to the campaign. My father-in-law asked me to be a point of contact with these foreign countries. These were not contacts that I initiated, but, over the course of the campaign, I had incoming contacts with people from approximately 15 countries. To put these requests in context, I must have received thousands of calls, letters and emails from people looking to talk or meet on a variety of issues and topics, including hundreds from outside the United States. While I could not be responsive to everyone, I tried to be respectful of any foreign government contacts with whom it would be important to maintain an ongoing, productive working relationship were the candidate to prevail. To that end, I called on a variety of people with deep experience, such as Dr. Henry Kissinger, for advice on policy for the candidate, which countries/representatives with which the campaign should engage, and what messaging would resonate. In addition, it was typical for me to receive 200 or more emails a day during the campaign. I did not have the time to read every one, especially long emails from unknown senders or email chains to which I was added at some later point in the exchange. \n \n With respect to my contacts with Russia or Russian representatives during the campaign, there were hardly any. The first that I can recall was at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. in April 2016. This was when then candidate Trump was delivering a major foreign policy speech. Doing the event and speech had been my idea, and I oversaw its execution. I arrived at the hotel early to make sure all logistics were in order. After that, I stopped into the reception to thank the host of the event, Dimitri Simes, the publisher of the bi-monthly foreign policy magazine, The National Interest, who had done a great job putting everything together. Mr. Simes and his group had created the guest list and extended the invitations for the event. He introduced me to several guests, among them four ambassadors, including Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. With all the ambassadors, including Mr. Kislyak, we shook hands, exchanged brief pleasantries and I thanked them for attending the event and said I hoped they would like candidate Trump's speech and his ideas for a fresh approach to America's foreign policy. The ambassadors also expressed interest in creating a positive relationship should we win the election. Each exchange lasted less than a minute; some gave me their business cards and invited me to lunch at their embassies. I never took them up on any of these invitations and that was the extent of the interactions. \n \n Reuters news service has reported that I had two calls with Ambassador Kislyak at some time between April and November of 2016. While I participated in thousands of calls during this period, I do not recall any such calls with the Russian Ambassador. We have reviewed the phone records available to us and have not been able to identify any calls to any number we know to be associated with Ambassador Kislyak and I am highly skeptical these calls took place. A comprehensive review of my land line and cell phone records from the time does not reveal those calls. I had no ongoing relationship with the Ambassador before the election, and had limited knowledge about him then. In fact, on November 9, the day after the election, I could not even remember the name of the Russian Ambassador. When the campaign received an email purporting to be an official note of congratulations from President Putin, I was asked how we could verify it was real. To do so I thought the best way would be to ask the only contact I recalled meeting from the Russian government, which was the Ambassador I had met months earlier, so I sent an email asking Mr. Simes, \"What is the name of the Russian ambassador?\" Through my lawyer, I have asked Reuters to provide the dates on which the calls supposedly occurred or the phone number at which I supposedly reached, or was reached by, Ambassador Kislyak. The journalist refused to provide any corroborating evidence that they occurred. \n \n The only other Russian contact during the campaign is one I did not recall at all until I was reviewing documents and emails in response to congressional requests for information. In June 2016, my brother-in-law, Donald Trump Jr. asked if I was free to stop by a meeting on June 9 at 3:00 p.m. The campaign was headquartered in the same building as his office in Trump Tower, and it was common for each of us to swing by the other's meetings when requested. He eventually sent me his own email changing the time of the meeting to 4:00 p.m. That email was on top of a long back and forth that I did not read at the time. As I did with most emails when I was working remotely, I quickly reviewed on my iPhone the relevant message that the meeting would occur at 4:00 PM at his office. Documents confirm my memory that this was calendared as \"Meeting: Don Jr.| Jared Kushner.\" No one else was mentioned. \n \n I arrived at the meeting a little late. When I got there, the person who has since been identified as a Russian attorney was talking about the issue of a ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children. I had no idea why that topic was being raised and quickly determined that my time was not well-spent at this meeting. Reviewing emails recently confirmed my memory that the meeting was a waste of our time and that, in looking for a polite way to leave and get back to my work, I actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there for ten or so minutes and wrote \"Can u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting.\" I had not met the attorney before the meeting nor spoken with her since. I thought nothing more of this short meeting until it came to my attention recently. I did not read or recall this email exchange before it was shown to me by my lawyers when reviewing documents for submission to the committees. No part of the meeting I attended included anything about the campaign, there was no follow up to the meeting that I am aware of, I do not recall how many people were there (or their names), and I have no knowledge of any documents being offered or accepted. Finally, after seeing the email, I disclosed this meeting prior to it being reported in the press on a supplement to my security clearance form, even if that was not required as meeting the definitions of the form. \n \n There was one more possible contact that I will note. On October 30, 2016, I received a random email from the screenname \"Guccifer400.\" This email, which I interpreted as a hoax, was an extortion attempt and threatened to reveal candidate Trump's tax returns and demanded that we send him 52 bitcoins in exchange for not publishing that information. I brought the email to the attention of a U.S. Secret Service agent on the plane we were all travelling on and asked what he thought. He advised me to ignore it and not to reply -- which is what I did. The sender never contacted me again. \n \n To the best of my recollection, these were the full extent of contacts I had during the campaign with persons who were or appeared to potentially be representatives of the Russian government. \n \n Transition Contacts with Foreign Persons \n \n The transition period after the election was even more active than the campaign. Starting on election night, we began to receive an incredible volume of messages and invitations from well-wishers in the United States and abroad. Dozens of messages came from foreign officials seeking to set up foreign leader calls and create lines of communication and relationships with what would be the new administration. During this period, I recall having over fifty contacts with people from over fifteen countries. Two of those meetings were with Russians, neither of which I solicited. \n \n On November 16, 2016, my assistant received a request for a meeting from the Russian Ambassador. As I mentioned before, previous to receiving this request, I could not even recall the Russian Ambassador's name, and had to ask for the name of the individual I had seen at the Mayflower Hotel almost seven months earlier. In addition, far from being urgent, that meeting was not set up for two weeks -- on December 1. The meeting occurred in Trump Tower, where we had our transition office, and lasted twenty- thirty minutes. Lt. General Michael Flynn (Ret.), who became the President's National Security Advisor, also attended. During the meeting, after pleasantries were exchanged, as I had done in many of the meetings I had and would have with foreign officials, I stated our desire for a fresh start in relations. Also, as I had done in other meetings with foreign officials, I asked Ambassador Kislyak if he would identify the best person (whether the Ambassador or someone else) with whom to have direct discussions and who had contact with his President. The fact that I was asking about ways to start a dialogue after Election Day should of course be viewed as strong evidence that I was not aware of one that existed before Election Day. \n \n The Ambassador expressed similar sentiments about relations, and then said he especially wanted to address U.S. policy in Syria, and that he wanted to convey information from what he called his \"generals.\" He said he wanted to provide information that would help inform the new administration. He said the generals could not easily come to the U.S. to convey this information and he asked if there was a secure line in the transition office to conduct a conversation. General Flynn or I explained that there were no such lines. I believed developing a thoughtful approach on Syria was a very high priority given the ongoing humanitarian crisis, and I asked if they had an existing communications channel at his embassy we could use where they would be comfortable transmitting the information they wanted to relay to General Flynn. The Ambassador said that would not be possible and so we all agreed that we would receive this information after the Inauguration. Nothing else occurred. I did not suggest a \"secret back channel.\" I did not suggest an on-going secret form of communication for then or for when the administration took office. I did not raise the possibility of using the embassy or any other Russian facility for any purpose other than this one possible conversation in the transition period. We did not discuss sanctions. \n \n Approximately a week later, on December 6, the Embassy asked if I could meet with the Ambassador on December 7. I declined. They then asked if I could meet on December 6; I declined again. They then asked when the earliest was that I could meet. I declined these requests because I was working on many other responsibilities for the transition. He asked if he could meet my assistant instead and, to avoid offending the Ambassador, I agreed. He did so on December 12. My assistant reported that the Ambassador had requested that I meet with a person named Sergey Gorkov who he said was a banker and someone with a direct line to the Russian President who could give insight into how Putin was viewing the new administration and best ways to work together. I agreed to meet Mr. Gorkov because the Ambassador has been so insistent, said he had a direct relationship with the President, and because Mr. Gorkov was only in New York for a couple days. I made room on my schedule for the meeting that occurred the next day, on December 13. \n \n The meeting with Mr. Gorkov lasted twenty to twenty-five minutes. He introduced himself and gave me two gifts -- one was a piece of art from Nvgorod, the village where my grandparents were from in Belarus, and the other was a bag of dirt from that same village. (Any notion that I tried to conceal this meeting or that I took it thinking it was in my capacity as a businessman is false. In fact, I gave my assistant these gifts to formally register them with the transition office). After that, he told me a little about his bank and made some statements about the Russian economy. He said that he was friendly with President Putin, expressed disappointment with U.S.-Russia relations under President Obama and hopes for a better relationship in the future. As I did at the meeting with Ambassador Kislyak, I expressed the same sentiments I had with other foreign officials I met. There were no specific policies discussed. We had no discussion about the sanctions imposed by the Obama Administration. At no time was there any discussion about my companies, business transactions, real estate projects, loans, banking arrangements or any private business of any kind. At the end of the short meeting, we thanked each other and I went on to other meetings. I did not know or have any contact with Mr. Gorkov before that meeting, and I have had no reason to connect with him since. \n \n To the best of my recollection, these were the only two contacts I had during the transition with persons who were or appeared to potentially be representatives of the Russian government. \n \n Disclosure of Contacts on My Security Clearance Form \n \n There has been a good deal of misinformation reported about my SF-86 form. As my attorneys and I have previously explained, my SF-86 application was prematurely submitted due to a miscommunication and initially did not list any contacts (not just with Russians) with foreign government officials. Here are some facts about that form and the efforts I have made to supplement it. \n \n In the week before the Inauguration, amid the scramble of finalizing the unwinding of my involvement from my company, moving my family to Washington, completing the paper work to divest assets and resign from my outside positions and complete my security and financial disclosure forms, people at my New York office were helping me find the information, organize it, review it and put it into the electronic form. They sent an email to my assistant in Washington, communicating that the changes to one particular section were complete; my assistant interpreted that message as meaning that the entire form was completed. At that point, the form was a rough draft and still had many omissions including not listing any foreign government contacts and even omitted the address of my father-in-law (which was obviously well known). Because of this miscommunication, my assistant submitted the draft on January 18, 2017. \n \n That evening, when we realized the form had been submitted prematurely, we informed the transition team that we needed to make changes and additions to the form. The very next day, January 19, 2017, we submitted supplemental information to the transition, which confirmed receipt and said they would immediately transmit it to the FBI. The supplement disclosed that I had \"numerous contacts with foreign officials\" and that we were going through my records to provide an accurate and complete list. I provided a list of those contacts in the normal course, before my background investigation interview and prior to any inquiries or media reports about my form. \n \n It has been reported that my submission omitted only contacts with Russians. That is not the case. In the accidental early submission of the form, all foreign contacts were omitted. The supplemental information later disclosed over one hundred contacts from more than twenty countries that might be responsive to the questions on the form. These included meetings with individuals such as Jordan's King Abdullah II, Israel's Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, Mexico's Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Luis Videgaray Caso and many more. All of these had been left off before. \n \n Over the last six months, I have made every effort to provide the FBI with whatever information is needed to investigate my background. In addition, my attorneys have explained that the security clearance process is one in which supplements are expected and invited. The form itself instructs that, during the interview, the information in the document can be \"update[d], clarif[ied], and explain[ed]\" as part of the security clearance process. A good example is the June 9 meeting. For reasons that should be clear from the explanation of that meeting I have provided, I did not remember the meeting and certainly did not remember it as one with anyone who had to be included on an SF-86. When documents reviewed for production in connection with committee requests reminded me that meeting had occurred, and because of the language in the email chain that I then read for the first time, I included that meeting on a supplement. I did so even though my attorneys were unable to conclude that the Russian lawyer was a representative of any foreign country and thus fell outside the scope of the form. This supplemental information was also provided voluntarily, well prior to any media inquiries, reporting or request for this information, and it was done soon after I was reminded of the meeting. \n \n **** \n \n As I have said from the very first media inquiry, I am happy to share information with the \n \n investigating bodies. I have shown today that I am willing to do so and will continue to cooperate as I have nothing to hide. As I indicated, I know there has been a great deal of speculation and conjecture about my contacts with any officials or people from Russia. I have disclosed these contacts and described them as fully as I can recall. The record and documents I am providing will show that I had perhaps four contacts with Russian representatives out of thousands during the campaign and transition, none of which were impactful in any way to the election or particularly memorable. I am very grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight. I also have tried to provide context for my role in the campaign, and I am proud of the candidate that we supported, of the campaign that we ran, and the victory that we achieved. \n \n It has been my practice not to appear in the media or leak information in my own defense. I have tried to focus on the important work at hand and serve this President and this country to the best of my abilities. I hope that through my answers to questions, written statements and documents I have now been able to demonstrate the entirety of my limited contacts with Russian representatives during the campaign and transition. I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government. I had no improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector. I have tried to be fully transparent with regard to the filing of my SF-86 form, above and beyond what is required. Hopefully, this puts these matters to rest."], "summary": "\u2013 With the first of his two days of congressional testimony in the books, Jared Kushner made a rare public statement Monday afternoon to reaffirm his main point: \"I did not collude with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so,\" he said, per the AP. Kushner spoke outside the White House after meeting behind closed doors with the Senate Intelligence Committee. While he largely reiterated points made earlier in an 11-page statement to Congress, Kushner also suggested that the Russia investigation has political undertones. \"Donald Trump had a better message and ran a smarter campaign, and that is why he won,\" he said, per NBC News. \"Suggesting otherwise ridicules those who voted for him.\" Kushner has said all of his actions related to four meetings with Russian nationals were aboveboard, per CNN. He added during his speech that he had \"no improper contacts\" and has \"not relied on Russian funds for my businesses.\" Kushner is back on Capitol Hill Tuesday, when he again testifies behind closed doors, this time with the House Intelligence Committee.

{"document": ["The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own. \n \n BP faces opposition from some shareholders for handing Chief Executive Bob Dudley a 20 percent increase in his total remuneration package for 2015 to $19.6 million. It may seem hard to square that amount with BP\u2019s $5.2 billion loss last year, and the fact that it is slashing thousands of jobs in response to falling oil prices. But that\u2019s actually the point. Managing an oil company when crude is trading at $100 per barrel is easy compared to the current environment. Instead, Dudley has to work harder than his predecessors. \n \n Dudley, whose pay was going to a non-binding shareholder vote on April 14, has done what was needed of him. His two big challenges were to clean up the financial spill from the 2010 Gulf of Mexico disaster and change the culture at BP, which was tainted by safety concerns and excessive risk taking. Last year the company saw the number of recorded oil spills and employee injuries both at five-year lows. \n \n He has also delivered decent returns when compared to peers. BP ranks third among the big six oil majors, which include Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell, in total shareholder returns over the last three years, according to Eikon data \u2013 even despite 2010\u2019s rig blowout. Drawing a line under the environmental catastrophe last year by agreeing to pay up to $18.7 billion in penalties cleared the decks for the company to start rebuilding its balance sheet. \n \n Compared to counterparts, Dudley\u2019s remuneration appears generous. Although Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden pocketed 24.2 million euros ($27.2 million) in 2014, this figure fell to 5.6 million euros last year, according to the company. Over the same period Dudley\u2019s base salary has remained flat, with the biggest boost to his overall financial reward coming through his pension and deferred bonus shares. \n \n The mild-mannered American has had possibly the toughest job in the oil industry. His rewards look in line with that task.", "LONDON -- A leading shareholder advisory group has criticized BP PLC's decision to award its top directors their maximum bonuses for 2015, despite the company's lackluster performance, and recommended shareholders vote against the payment plans. \n \n Last month, BP announced that Chief Executive Bob Dudley would receive a 20% bump in his total compensation package in 2015. Though much of this increase related to U.K. reporting requirements that inflated the rise in Mr. Dudley's pension, the oil executive's cash bonus increased to $1.4 million from $1 million in 2014. His total bonus for the year, including a portion paid in deferred BP shares, amounted to $4.2 million. That was the maximum amount he was eligible to receive for the year and was up from $3 million in 2014. Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary also received 100% of his possible bonus. \n \n The awards follow a year in which the company lost $5.2 billion as oil prices plummeted. Since the start of 2016 it has announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs and has slashed spending to help manage the slump. \n \n \"We believe shareholders should question whether payouts were fully earned in respect of the past fiscal year relative to the company's performance,\" proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis said in a March report seen by The Wall Street Journal. \n \n BP's compensation committee awards executive bonuses based on the company's performance in a number of strategic areas, including its safety record and internal targets for operational cash flow and underlying profits. \n \n \"BP executives performed strongly in a difficult environment in 2015, managing the things they could control and for which they were accountable,\" a BP spokesman said, adding that \"safety and operational risk performance was excellent and BP responded quickly and decisively to the drop in oil price.\" \n \n This isn't the first time Glass Lewis has raised objections to BP's executive pay. Last year, it also recommended that shareholders reject Mr. Dudley's pay package, noting that his compensation outpaced that received by chief executives at similar-sized firms \"despite the company's relative underperformance.\" The executive's compensation was ultimately approved by around 86% of investors. \n \n BP's shareholders will vote on the matter this year at the company's annual general meeting in London on April 16, along with a host of other issues. Glass Lewis has also raised concerns about the company's proposal to reduce its notice period for calling a general meeting, but supports most of the proposals, including the re-election of Mr. Dudley and his board. \n \n Write to Sarah Kent at sarah.kent@wsj.com \n \n More from MarketWatch", "Angry shareholders mounted an unprecedented protest against BP on Thursday, rebelling against a 20 per cent pay rise for chief executive Bob Dudley despite the oil group making its worst ever loss. \n \n Investors voted against the company\u2019s pay decisions for the first time in living memory, with 59 per cent of proxy votes cast going against BP\u2019s decision to pay Mr Dudley nearly $20m for 2015, a year in which the company ran up a $5.2bn loss. \n \n It was the first time that a top British company was defeated over executive pay since shareholders at advertising group WPP and Xstrata, the mining company, rebelled four years ago during what was dubbed the \u201cshareholder spring\u201d.

That's the bit that sticks in the craw for many. Under what circumstances don't these guys get paid a fortune? It would be fine if some years you win, some years you lose - but they never seem to lose. \n \n We may get a rebellion of 20-30% of shareholders today but even if it was more than 50%, the board doesn't have to listen. Shareholders do have a binding vote every three years on the pay policy and formula. No use crying now, the formula that spat out \u00a314m for Bob Dudley was approved in 2014 by 96% of shareholders. \n \n Read Simon's full blog here. \n \n BP's pay policy is subject to a binding shareholder vote every three years. It was last set in 2014, meaning new proposals are due to be put forward for shareholder approval again in 2017. \n \n 'Surpassed expectations' \n \n Many experts argue that Mr Dudley is merely earning the market rate for international executives. \n \n Mark Freebairn, partner at recruitment firm Odgers Berndtson, told Today: \"If Bob Dudley was to leave [BP] it would be for a competitive company and remuneration would be part of the discussion. If you operate in a global market, you have to operate on a global scale.\" \n \n BP was now in a far better position than when Mr Dudley took the helm, he said. \n \n After the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster, BP's share price collapsed and it was forced to sell off assets worth billions of pounds to pay costs, fines and compensation. \n \n However, the collapse in the oil price over the past 18 months saw BP's profit tumble, and the company is axing another 3,000 jobs worldwide on top of the 4,000 cuts already announced. \n \n A spokesman for BP said before the meeting at London's ExCel centre had begun that shareholders had previously backed the pay formula. \n \n \"Despite the very challenging environment, BP's safety and operating performance was excellent throughout 2015... BP's performance surpassed the board's expectations on almost all of the measures that determine remuneration - and the outcome therefore reflects this. \n \n \"And these clear measures derive directly from BP's remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM with over 96% of the vote,\" the spokesman said. \n \n Mr Dudley's pay package was less than that earned by some rivals in the oil and gas industry, including at Exxon and Chevron. But it was more than the award for Ben van Beurden, chief executive at Royal Dutch Shell, whose salary package fell from \u20ac24.2m (\u00a319m) in 2014 to \u20ac5.58m last year. \n \n Experts point out, though, that it can be difficult to compare like-with-like. For instance, Mr van Beurden's 2014 pay involved one-off pension payments and \"tax equalisation\" measures when he moved from the UK to the Netherlands. \n \n And in 2015 Mr Dudley and Mr van Beurden received very different rewards under their long-term incentive plans, LTIPs. Shell gave its chief executive 8% of the LTIP, down from 49% in 2014. Mr Dudley's long-term bonus increased from 63.8% of maximum to 77.6%.", "A majority of BP PLC\u2019s shareholders voted against the company\u2019s executive pay policy, a stinging \u2014 though nonbinding \u2014 rebuke to Chief Executive Bob Dudley and his board. \n \n At the company\u2019s annual meeting Thursday, the oil giant said preliminary results showed 59% of investors voting by proxy rejected the company\u2019s executive compensation decisions for 2015. That included a controversial 20% increase in Dudley\u2019s total pay for the year, at a time when the company lost $5.2 billion. \n \n Earlier in the day, the company also signaled in its clearest terms yet that the oil giant may have to reduce its dividend, as low oil prices continue to threaten the once-sacrosanct investor payouts across the industry. \n \n Both moves heap pressure on Dudley and his board, as they try to navigate low oil prices like the rest of the industry but also contend with increasing shareholder unease. \n \n BP BP., +0.88% BP, +0.60% Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg, speaking to investors before the vote, defended the pay package, which he said was based on \u201cexceptional\u201d company performance during a difficult year.

{"document": ["During a hearing of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology on Wednesday, Rep Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) pressed Philip Duffy, president of Woods Hole Research Center, to identify reasons that sea levels might be rising. \n \n They are rising, without dispute, at an estimated rate of 3.3 millimeters a year. Much of that increase is attributed by scientists to melting surface ice. The planet loses tens of billions of tons of ice each year. Enough is lost from Antarctica alone to increase global sea levels by a millimeter every three years, but that figure isn\u2019t steady. Sea level rise is occurring at an increasing rate. \n \n Brooks asked Duffy what else might be contributing to that rise. Duffy pointed to ground subsidence, which is the sinking of the ground in places that can exacerbate the problem of rising sea levels. Cities like New Orleans are sinking quickly, even faster in many places than the seas are rising. \n \n Brooks asked if any other factors were contributing to sea level rise. \n \n \u201cThose are all that I know of,\u201d Duffy replied. \n \n \u201cWhat about erosion!\u201d Brooks exclaimed. \u201cEvery single year that we\u2019re on Earth, you have huge tons of silt deposited by the Mississippi River, by the Amazon River, by the Nile, by every major river system \u2014 and for that matter, creek, all the way down to the smallest systems. And every time you have that soil or rock whatever it is that is deposited into the seas, that forces the sea levels to rise. Because now you\u2019ve got less space in those oceans because the bottom is moving up.\u201d \n \n \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s \u2026\u201d Duffy tried to interject. \n \n \u201cWhat about the white cliffs of Dover?\u201d Brooks continued. \u201cCalifornia, where you have the waves crashing against the shorelines and time and time again you have the cliffs crash into the sea. All of that displaces the water which forces it to rise, does it not?\u201d \n \n \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that on human time scales,\u201d Duffy replied, \u201cthose are minuscule effects.\u201d \n \n Duffy is correct. \n \n Brooks has a vision in his head like the classic experiment by Archimedes, in which the scientist sank down into his bath and noticed the water overflow \u2014 providing a way to determine the volume of his body. But the amount of water displaced by even a giant boulder falling into the ocean is not like a body going into a bathtub. It is, as Duffy said, minuscule. \n \n Certainly 3.3 millimeters doesn\u2019t sound like a lot of water to displace, and it does seem, to Brooks\u2019s point, that it\u2019s an amount \u2014 about 0.1 inch \u2014 that would be easy to displace with a cliff collapse near San Diego. The equivalent rise relative to surface area in an Olympic-sized swimming pool would be 0.0000000000114 millimeters. That\u2019s not possible, though, since a water molecule isn\u2019t that small. \n \n But when you apply 3.3 millimeters of rise to the entire ocean? We\u2019re talking about a lot of water that\u2019s displaced \u2014 3.3 millimeters across about 362 million square kilometers of surface area. The total volume displaced, then, would be 1.19 trillion cubic meters of water. \n \n We know from Archimedes\u2019 work that the amount of earth required to displace that much water is the same volume: 1.19 trillion cubic meters. Here\u2019s a corny video by a science teacher showing how it works. \n \n So to make the oceans rise 3.3 millimeters, we would need to displace that 1.2 trillion cubic meters of water upward by dropping in 1.2 trillion cubic meters of dirt or stone or whatever. \n \n How much is that? It\u2019s a sphere of earth a bit over 8 miles in diameter. If we were to balance it at the top of the Capitol building, it would look like this. \n \n If the sphere were stone, it would weigh about 6.6 quadrillion pounds. Just drop that in the ocean and \u2014 bloop! \u2014 3.3 millimeters of sea-level increase. (We\u2019re ignoring here that dropping it in some parts of the ocean would result in a mountain in that location. For the sake of explaining things, we\u2019re pretending that the oceans are just one big uniform pool of water and that the sea level rise is similarly consistent. This isn\u2019t how it works, of course.) \n \n Put another way, it\u2019s a volume of earth equivalent to taking the top five inches of every one of the United States\u2019 9.1 million square miles of land area and using it to coat the bottom of the world\u2019s oceans. That would push sea levels up by 3.3 millimeters. \n \n But, remember: That sea level rise happens annually. So every year, we\u2019d need to take the top five inches of the United States, roll it in a ball and drop it in the ocean to get the sort of sea level rise we\u2019re currently seeing. Don\u2019t worry, though; assuming that the depth of Earth\u2019s crust is about 40 kilometers in the United States, it would take 309,000 years for us to get to the mantle. \n \n Except, of course, that sea level rise is occurring at an increasing rate. If someone could check on the white cliffs of Dover for us, we\u2019d appreciate it.", "Mo Brooks rejects notion that global warming is causing sea levels to increase, and says: \u2018What about the White Cliffs of Dover?\u2019 \n \n A member of Congress has suggested that the White Cliffs of Dover tumbling into the English Channel was causing rising sea levels. \n \n Everglades under threat as Florida's mangroves face death by rising sea level Read more \n \n Republican Mo Brooks of Alabama pushed back at the notion that rising sea levels were the result of global warming in a hearing of the House Science, Space and Technology on Wednesday. \n \n Instead, Brooks pointed to silt deposition as well as erosion as a cause of rising sea levels.

A recent study reported that the ice sheet had shrunk by 1,463km from 2010 to 2016. \n \n Duffy disagreed, noting that \u201cwe have satellite records clearly documenting a shrinkage of the Antarctic ice sheet and an acceleration of that shrinkage\u201d, citing \u201cthe National Snow and Ice Data Center and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u201d for his data. \n \n However, Brooks insisted: \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got a Nasa base in my district, and apparently, they\u2019re telling you one thing and me a different thing.\u201d \n \n Brooks said: \u201cThere are plenty of studies that have come that show with respect to Antarctica that the total ice sheet, particularly that above land, is increasing, not decreasing. Now, you could make a different argument if you want to talk about Greenland or the Arctic.\u201d \n \n Brooks, a graduate of Duke University and University of Alabama School of Law, was first elected to Congress in 2010 from his North Alabama district.

Duffy cited NASA as one of his sources, and Brooks replied that, \"I've got a NASA base in my district and, apparently, they're telling you one thing and me a different thing.\" \n \n Brooks at length \n \n Brooks spoke at greater length Thursday afternoon between votes on the House floor. \n \n \"You put it all together, erosion is the primary cause of sea level rise in the history of our planet,\" Brooks said, \"and these people who say to the contrary may know something about climate but they don't know squat about geology.\" \n \n \"Keep in mind I'm talking millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of years, erosion is the primary cause of thousands, if not tens of thousands, of cubic miles of sea displacement that in turn forces the sea levels to rise,\" he said. \n \n \"But if you're talking a shorter historical time span,\" Brooks said, \"you're going to have great fluctuations up and down due to the quantities of ice that exist on a planet.\" In an ice age, sea levels drop significantly, he said. \n \n The oceans \"are always rising,\" Brooks said, except during times of ice buildup that offset erosion. Look at the \"huge alluvial planes that exist around the great rivers like the Mississippi, the Amazon, the Mekong, the Danube, the Yangtze and you'll see these huge alluvial planes made up entirely of erosion,\" he said. \n \n Brooks disagreed with Duffy during the hearing about whether Antarctic ice is growing or shrinking. Duffy said satellite records \"clearly\" show shrinkage and a speedup of that shrinkage. \n \n Brooks questioned Duffy's data, and Duffy said it came from the National Snow and Ice Data Center and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\" That's when Brooks mentioned the NASA base in his district and said it was telling him something different. \n \n Wrong in the '60s \n \n \"You've got to make sure you're careful in terminology,\" Brooks said later Thursday. \"I'm talking ice quantity. He's talking about surface area. Two entirely different things.\" \n \n Brooks said the \"total ice quantity, which is what affects sea levels, has been increasing. The Antarctica sea ice varies from year to year and from decade to decade.\" The ice is growing in quantity on the interior of Antarctica, he said. \n \n \"I never said anything about Antarctic sea ice, but that's the comparison they make,\" Brooks said of the press. \"I'm talking about Antarctica ice, which is both the sea ice and the interior of Antarctica. And the interior is where the vast majority of ice is.\" \n \n \"I've never been skeptical of climate change,\" Brooks said. \"The climate is always changing. The planet is always either heating up or cooling down. It is very rarely constant.\" \n \n Brooks was asked about the theory that current warming is a threat and human activity is part of its cause. \"In the late '60s and early '70s, the climate scare was cooling, that we're going to enter into a new ice age...,\" Brooks said. \"They turned out to be wrong.\" \n \n \"What I'm trying to establish is that a lot of these climatologists have no idea what they're really talking about,\" Brooks said, \"and it's because we have not had a long enough period time with exact scientific measurement to know what the climate's going to be like 50 years from now or 100 years from now.\" \n \n Brooks said studies and projections made in the 1990s by \"these so-called climatologists\" were almost all wrong \"on the hot side as to where we would be in 2018.\" Over 90 percent were wrong, he said. \n \n The bottom line \n \n \"The bottom line is nobody is smart enough to know with the evidence we have and the relatively small time frame we have - 50 years in the history of the planet. That's just not enough information with which to make accurate predictions.\" \n \n So what is motivating scientists to say the Earth is dangerously warming? \n \n \"Money,\" Brooks said. \"Money to invest in a certain kind of resources where you might have a financial interest. There's also politics as you're trying to cobble together the votes to win an election, that's probably part of it, too.\"", "Washington (CNN) A member of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology evinced skepticism about climate change during an exchange with a witness about rising sea levels. \n \n Instead, Alabama Republican Rep.

The company was the victim of hacking that has exposed several hundred million user accounts. \n \n While sources were unspecific about the extent of the incursion, since there is the likelihood of government investigations and legal action related to the breach, they noted that it is widespread and serious. \n \n Earlier this summer, Yahoo said it was investigating a data breach in which hackers claimed to have access to 200 million user accounts and one was selling them online. \u201cIt\u2019s as bad as that,\u201d said one source. \u201cWorse, really.\u201d \n \n The announcement, which is expected to come this week, also has possible larger implications for the $4.8 billion sale of Yahoo\u2019s core business \u2014 which is at the core of this hack \u2014 to Verizon. The scale of the liability could bring untold headaches to the new owners. Shareholders are likely to worry that it could lead to an adjustment in the price of the transaction. \n \n That deal is now moving to completion, but the companies cannot be integrated until it is approved by a number of regulatory agencies, as well as Yahoo shareholders. Representatives of Verizon and Yahoo started meeting recently to review the Yahoo business, so that the acquisition would run smoothly once complete. \n \n But there\u2019s nothing smooth about this hack, said sources, which became known in August when an infamous cybercriminal named \u201cPeace\u201d claimed on a website that he was selling credentials of 200 million Yahoo users from 2012 on the dark web for just over $1,800. The data allegedly included user names, easily decrypted passwords and personal information like birth dates and other email addresses. \n \n At the time, Yahoo said it was \u201caware of the claim,\u201d but the company declined to say if it was legitimate and said that it was investigating the information. But it did not issue a call for a password reset to users. Now, said sources, Yahoo might have to, although it will be a case of too little, too late. \n \n The confirmation of such an extensive hack is another blemish on the record of CEO Marissa Mayer, a vaunted former Google exec who has presided over numerous declines in the business since she arrived four years ago. Her inability to turn Yahoo around or innovate any new products eventually led to the sale. \n \n I reached out to Yahoo for comment and will update this post if I get a response (don\u2019t wait up late for that!).", "Yahoo! is expected to confirm its unwelcome distinction of being the victim of the largest data breach on record. A report has the tech giant is expected to disclose details of a hack that has affected some 200 million Yahoo users. \n \n Yahoo! Inc., is preparing to confirm a \u201cmassive data breach\u201d of its core service, one that could affect and expose \u2018several\u2019 hundred million user accounts. \n \n Tech news site Recode broke the news, citing sources who noted the breach to be \u201cwidespread and serious\u201d, with the likelihood of legal action and investigations led by the government. \n \n The revelation would come at a time when Yahoo is the midst of a mega-acquisition by Verizon in a $4.8 billion deal and it remains to be seen if the deal could see repercussions due to the breach. \n \n Earlier in August, Motherboard reported that a cybercriminal hacker who goes by the moniker \u201cPeace\u201d was advertising the sale of 200 million Yahoo accounts. The same hacker has previously sold large data dumps of breaches related to Myspace and LinkedIn on a dark web marketplace called the Real Deal. \n \n While the lagging technology giant admitted that it was investigating the data breach, a Recode source confirmed that the number of users affected could be more than the 200 million advertised by Peace. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s as bad as that,\u201d said the Recode source. \u201cWorse, really.\u201d \n \n The data trove reportedly contains Yahoo users\u2019 usernames, scrambled passwords, birthdates and other information, likely dated from 2012. \n \n Peace was hawking the alleged data of 200 million users for a relatively mere 3 bitcoins, around $1900 in value at the time. \n \n Featured image from iStock/4\u00d76.", "Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer. Getty/Kimberly White Yahoo is getting ready to confirm a huge, historic hack affecting 200 million users, Recode reports. \n \n Back in August, Motherboard's Joseph Cox reported that 200 million apparent Yahoo user credentials were being sold on the dark web. At the time, the company's response was only that it was \"aware of [the] claim.\" \n \n But now Kara Swisher, one of the tech industry's most respected journalists, is reporting for Recode that Yahoo sources tell her the company is preparing to publicly confirm the hack. (Her sources did not confirm its exact size, only that it was \"widespread and serious.\") \n \n Yahoo did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. \n \n Motherboard was told by the hacker who held the data (and was selling it for 3 bitcoins, worth $1,860 at the time) that the breach was carried out in 2012 \u2014 and was never made public. Data included usernames, encrypted passwords, date-of-births, and some email addresses. \n \n A spate of historic data breaches affecting millions of users have recently been coming to light, affecting companies including LinkedIn, MySpace, and Tumblr. If user passwords are unencrypted (or not encrypted properly), hackers can then use this login data to break into individual user accounts \u2014 and often, because people reuse passwords across multiple sites, the hackers can use the information to break into accounts on other sites as well. \n \n We saw multiple high-profile demonstrations of this problem this summer, as celebrities and public figures including Mark Zuckerberg and Drake had their Twitter accounts broken into. Twitter wasn't hacked \u2014 but the victims had reused passwords that were also used on hacked websites. \n \n This new attention on the alleged breach comes at an awkward time for Yahoo. The tech company is selling its core business to Verizon for $4.8 billion (\u00a33.7 billion) after years of flagging fortunes. \n \n There's nothing ordinary users can do to prevent these kinds of breaches, but using a strong, unique password on each website or service you have an account on (managing those passwords with a password-manager app if necessary) will help limit the damage.", "A notorious cybercriminal is advertising 200 million of alleged Yahoo user credentials on the dark web, and the company has said it is \u201caware\u201d of the hacker\u2019s claims, but has not confirmed nor denied the legitimacy of the data. \n \n On Monday, the hacker known as Peace, who has previously sold dumps of Myspace and LinkedIn, listed supposed credentials of Yahoo users on The Real Deal marketplace. Peace told Motherboard that he has been trading the data privately for some time, but only now decided to sell it openly. \n \n \u201cWe are aware of a claim,\u201d a Yahoo spokesperson told Motherboard in an email, before the data was made public. The company did not deny that the customer details were Yahoo users, despite being asked if it corresponded to the company's own records. \n \n \u201cWe are committed to protecting the security of our users\u2019 information and we take any such claim very seriously.

Yahoo says the personal information of 500 million accounts have been stolen... (Associated Press) \n \n SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Yahoo said hackers stole personal information from 500 million of its user accounts, a massive security breakdown it attributed to a \"state sponsored actor.\" The breach disclosed Thursday, the latest setback for the beleaguered internet company, dates back to late 2014. \n \n That's when high-tech thieves hacked into Yahoo's data centers, the company said. But Yahoo only recently discovered the break-in as part of an ongoing internal investigation. \n \n The stolen data includes users' names, email addresses, telephone numbers, birth dates, hashed passwords, and the security questions \u2014 and answers \u2014 used to verify an accountholder's identity. \n \n Last month, the tech site Motherboard reported that a hacker who uses the name \"Peace\" boasted that he had account information belonging to 200 million Yahoo users and was trying to sell the data on the web. \n \n Yahoo recommends that users change their passwords if they haven't done so since 2014. The Sunnyvale, California, company said its investigation so far hasn't found any evidence that information about users' bank accounts or credit and debit cards were swiped in the hacking attack. It said it has \"no evidence\" that the attacker is still in Yahoo's network. \n \n News of the security lapse could cause some people to have second thoughts about relying on Yahoo's services, raising a prickly issue for the company as it tries to sell its digital operations to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion. \n \n That deal, announced two months ago, isn't supposed to close until early next year. That leaves Verizon with wiggle room to renegotiate the purchase price or even back out if it believes the security breach will harm Yahoo's business. That could happen if users shun Yahoo or file lawsuits because they're incensed by the theft of their personal information. \n \n Verizon said it still doesn't know enough about the Yahoo break-in to assess the potential consequences. \"We will evaluate as the investigation continues through the lens of overall Verizon interests, including consumers, customers, shareholders and related communities,\" the company said in a statement."], "summary": "\u2013 Yahoo is confirming what Recode describes as a \"widespread and serious\" data breach affecting 500 million users. Yahoo blames \"state-sponsored actors\" for the personal data that was stolen in 2014 but only recently discovered to have been stolen, the AP reports. Yahoo had previously been expected to confirm an estimated 200 million users were affected.

Confirmation of such a breach\u2014which Hacked.com says could be \"the largest data breach on record\"\u2014could now affect Yahoo's $4.8 billion sale to Verizon. Not only is it a pain for Verizon, but Yahoo shareholders will be concerned about a possible drop in the company's sale price. The sources tell Recode that government investigations and legal action in regards to breach are expected. In its confirmation of the breach, Yahoo suggested users change their passwords, assuming they haven't already done so since 2014.", "ranking": [1, 0, 4, 3, 2]}

And he says the nations share a common interest in keeping the hemisphere safe and prosperous. \n \n The Republican presidential nominee said after meeting with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto that the pair had a substantive, direct and constructive exchange of ideas at the president's official residence in Mexico City. \n \n This is Trump's first foreign visit as his party's nominee. \n \n ___ \n \n 4:30 p.m. \n \n Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto is challenging Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's characterization of the situation on the U.S.-Mexican border. \n \n Pe\u00f1a Nieto notes that the number of immigrants crossing the border illegally is down significantly \"even to the point of being negative to a net effect.\" He spoke at a joint appearance Wednesday at the president's official residence. \n \n While Pe\u00f1a Nieto says the countries have shared challenges, he says that there exists \"an incomplete vision of the border issues,\" with weapons and cash flowing south from the U.S. and fueling violence. \n \n He's also stressing U.S. exports to Mexico and the number of jobs reliant on the countries' trade relationship. \n \n He says the Mexican people are people of \"good will\" who \"deserve everybody's respect.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 4:20 p.m. \n \n Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto says that he and Donald Trump may not agree on everything, but that their meeting underscores their countries' shared interests. \n \n Pe\u00f1a Nieto tells reporters that their meeting with the Republican nominee at the president's official residence in Mexico City was \"open and constructive.\" \n \n He says in Spanish that the next president \"will find in Mexico and its government\" a neighbor who \"wants to work constructively to strengthen even more\" the relationship between their nations. \n \n ___ \n \n 2:55 p.m. \n \n An official at the Mexico City international airport says a private plane carrying Republican candidate Donald Trump has touched down at the airport. \n \n The official was not authorized to be quoted by name, nor did he provide the plane's registry number, or say how Trump would reach the official residence of President Enrique Pena Nieto, where the meeting with the Mexican leader is to take place. \n \n Pena Nieto's office has confirmed there will be a meeting and subsequent press statement at the residence, which is across town from the airport. \n \n Trump appeared likely to fly to the residence by helicopter, rather than cross town in any kind of motorcade. \n \n \u2014By E.

Trump's speech is being closely watched to see if he softens proposals to deport millions of people living in the United States illegally. \n \n Kaine says Trump's words and actions have been \"frightening\" to Hispanics and he doesn't expect to hear a change in tone.

MacDonald said last week that white people in America are becoming a victimized minority. He has been accused of anti-Semitism by critics, including the Southern Poverty Law Center. \n \n MacDonald's tweet had to do with Clinton's State Department and perceived favoritism for UBS, a global financial services company that donated to the Clinton Foundation. \n \n Trump Jr.'s retweet prompted Richard Spencer, a leader of the alt-right movement, to tweet \"Wow.

He noted that Hillary Clinton received the same invitation but hasn't responded yet. \n \n Pence said that Trump and Pena Nieto are expected to discuss the logistics of Trump's proposed border wall \u2014 something Trump insists Mexico will pay for, despite Pena Nieto's condemnation of the plan. \n \n ___ \n \n 9:35 a.m. \n \n At least two demonstrations are planned in Mexico City as Mexicans express anger about the visit of Donald Trump. \n \n Former first lady Margarita Zavala wrote in a tweet aimed at Trump: \"Even though you may have been invited, we want you to know you're not welcome. We Mexicans have dignity, and we reject your hate speech.\" She's considered a potential presidential candidate for 2018. \n \n Pena Nieto's office hasn't said where or when the meeting would be held, possibly in a bid to avoid protests outside the meeting site. \n \n Leading historian Enrique Krauze also addressed Trump in a tweek, saying \"We Mexicans expect nothing less than an apology for calling us \"criminals and rapists\". \n \n Krauze told the Televisa TV network that, \"Tyrants are to be confronted, not pacified.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 8:30 a.m. \n \n Mexico has awakened to the news that President Enrique Pena Nieto is going to meet with Republican candidate Donald Trump Wednesday, and many Mexicans don't like it. \n \n Some analysts said the Republican nominee had left Pena Nieto flat-footed by accepting an invitation the Mexican president had made simply for appearances' sake. Trump is widely loathed in Mexico for calling migrants from the country \"rapists\" among other insults. \n \n Mexico City-based security analyst Alejandro Hope suggested that Pena Nieto \"wanted to invite Hillary (Clinton), but that meant inviting both of them, and nobody thought Trump would accept first.\" \n \n He added: \"What's in it for Mexico? \" \n \n The newspaper El Universal wrote in an editorial that Trump \"caught Mexican diplomats off guard\" by accepting the invitation. \n \n ___ \n \n 3:10 a.m. \n \n Donald Trump will be taking his first foreign trip as the Republican presidential nominee on Wednesday, making a quick visit to Mexico, a nation he derided as the home of rapists and criminals as he launched his campaign. \n \n The meeting with President Enrique Pena Nieto, who earlier this year compared the billionaire candidate to Hitler, comes hours before Trump is set to deliver a highly-anticipated immigration speech. It's a defining issue for Trump, but one on which he has appeared to waiver. \n \n After saying during his primary campaign he would expel all of the estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally with a \"deportation force,\" Trump has suggested recently he might be open to \"softening\" his stance as he tries to win over more moderate general election voters.", "GOP nominee Donald Trump waxed diplomatic during a joint news conference with Mexico's President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Mexico City on Wednesday afternoon. \n \n \"We had a very substantive, direct, and constructive exchange of ideas over quite a period of time,\" Trump said. The U.S. and Mexico \"are united by our support of democracy, a great love for our people and the contributions of millions of Mexican-Americans to the United States. And I happen to have a tremendous feeling for Mexican-Americans.\" \n \n Whether genuine or not, Trump on Wednesday diverged heavily from his hard-line primary rhetoric \u2014 about deporting 11 million illegal immigrants \u2014 and laid out a five-point plan for a hemispheric approach to U.S. relations with Mexico. \n \n Trump called illegal immigration \u2014 from Central and South America to the U.S. \u2014 a \"humanitarian disaster\" for \"the extreme physical dangers\" that the \"trek\" poses. \n \n \"Having a secure border is a sovereign right and mutually beneficial,\" he argued before alluding to his proposed wall along the southern border of the United States: \"We recognize and respect the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall on any of its borders to stop the illegal movement of people, drugs and weapons.\" \n \n As for his previous promises to supporters that the Mexican government would for whatever reason pay for said wall, Trump said, \"We didn't discuss that.\"", "Trump gets what he wanted in Mexico The Republican nominee gets his presidential moment south of the border. \n \n Donald Trump could barely have scripted it better. After a year of tormenting Mexico as a hostile foe, he stepped to a podium on Mexican soil \u2014 alongside the country\u2019s leader Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto \u2014 and got a president\u2019s welcome. \n \n Trump emerged from an hourlong huddle with Pe\u00f1a Nieto and the pair delivered side-by-side statements, embedding subtle criticisms of each other inside enthusiastic declarations of mutual respect. But it was the precise visual Trump had hoped for: a bilateral news conference that amounted to a preview of what similar international trips might look like in a Trump presidency. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n In written remarks \u2014 delivered in stilted bursts \u2014 Trump clung tightly to his arguments that the North America Free Trade Agreement had benefited Mexico disproportionately to the United States\u2019 detriment. He described a mutual agreement with Pe\u00f1a Nieto about each country\u2019s right to build a border wall. Pe\u00f1a Nieto even contended that Trump\u2019s hot-blooded rhetoric about Mexicans has been, in some cases, \u201cmisinterpretations.\u201d \n \n Yet the most striking development may have been Trump\u2019s decision to simply ignore the central policy proposal of his campaign: forcing Mexico to pay for the 2,000-mile wall. Trump, responding to a reporter\u2019s question, said financing for the wall simply didn\u2019t come up in the conversation with Pe\u00f1a Nieto, that the talks were \u201cpreliminary\u201d and could be continued later. (Pe\u00f1a Nieto later disputed that on Twitter, writing, \"At the start of the conversation with Donald Trump I made it clear Mexico will not pay for the wall.\") \n \n But it was a striking departure from his campaign-trail posture; so synonymous with the Trump candidacy is the wall proposal that adoring fans chant \u201cMexico!\u201d at rallies when he asks who will fund his plan. \n \n In a speech he plans to deliver later Wednesday in Phoenix, Trump is expected to detail his immigration policy, which has suddenly become a moving target despite forming the core of his candidacy for the past year. Along with a Mexico-financed wall, he\u2019s long pledged mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. \n \n A campaign spokesman reiterated as recently as Tuesday that Trump still intends to force Mexico to pay for the wall. Sean Spicer, a Republican National Committee spokesman, added that he doesn\u2019t expect Trump's speech to include much of a departure from his previously stated policies. \n \n \u201cI don't want to get ahead of the speech, but he's made it very clear that everyone who is not in the country legally must leave the country so I don't expect to see any kind of departure from that,\u201d he said on CNN Wednesday afternoon. \n \n Pe\u00f1a Nieto, squeezed by political leaders in his own country, strained to deliver subtle rejections of Trump\u2019s language while maintaining his pledge to be impartial in the American election. He delivered a methodical dismantling of Trump\u2019s anti-NAFTA arguments, noting that trade with Mexico supports as many as 6 million American jobs. He also reminded Trump that for all the undocumented immigrants and drugs flowing north, illegal cash and weapons are flowing south. \n \n \u201cThis is a point of view of border issues that\u2019s clearly incomplete because it doesn\u2019t consider the illegal flux of weapons and cash that come into the South,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery year millions of weapons and millions of dollars cross illegally into Mexico from the North that strengthen cartels and other criminal organizations that generate violence in Mexico and receives earnings from drug sales in the United States. This flow has to be stopped.\u201d \n \n Illegal immigration to the United States had slowed since its peak a decade ago, he added. And he referred obliquely to Trump\u2019s disparagement of undocumented immigrants from Mexico as rapists or criminals. \n \n \u201cPeople of Mexican heritage in the U.S. contribute every day with their work, talent, and creativity, to the prosperity and development of the U.S. and Mexico. Mexicans living in the U.S. are honest and hardworking people \u2014 they are people of goodwill, who respect family, who respect living in community, and who respect the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is why Mexicans deserve everyone's respect.\u201d \n \n Later, Pe\u00f1a Nieto lamented that there\u2019s been \u201cmisinterpretations and statements that have unfortunately hurt and affected Mexicans in the way he's presented his candidacy,\u201d but he added that \u201cI was sure that his genuine interest was to build a relationship.\u201d \n \n Trump, who delivered his statement second, embraced Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s language, referring to the \u201cdeep and sincere\u201d bond between America and Mexico and referred frequently to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and even \u201cour hemisphere\u201d when describing his posture toward Mexico, a far cry from the \u201cAmerica First\u201d language that typically threads his speeches at home. \n \n Republicans largely greeted Trump\u2019s visit as a success, primarily because he\u2019d set a low bar and managed to exceed it. \n \n \u201c[Hillary] Clinton's framework is that Trump would embarrass the country abroad. He didn't,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a Republican operative and former adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \u201cThis Mexico trip worked for Trump in the short term.\u201d \n \n Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s predecessors were less diplomatic about their president\u2019s decision to host Trump. Vicente Fox said the visit simply legitimized Trump\u2019s earlier harsh rhetoric. After the speech, Felipe Calderon called Trump a \u201chypocrite\u201d for changing his tone. \n \n \u201cI don't believe him. He is lying. He doesn't mean what he says,\u201d Calderon said on CNN. \u201cHe says we're rapists and tomorrow he says we're wonderful, smart, hardworking people. He is lying. And for that reason, I think, I was very, very sorry, I'm very sorry he came to Mexico. I think it was a very important mistake.\" \n \n Democrats and even Trump\u2019s detractors among Republicans argue that it\u2019s too late for him to persuade large numbers of Hispanic voters to support his candidacy. Rather, they viewed his trip as a chance to frame his immigration speech and also to convince undecided white voters with concerns about his temperament that he can be trusted with international affairs. \n \n Whether the speech turns out to be a watershed in the campaign or a too-little-too-late desperation play is unclear. \n \n But with a firm handshake, and a declaration that Pe\u00f1a Nieto is a \u201cfriend,\u201d Trump strode out of the presidential palace in Mexico City assured that, for a moment, he exceeded international expectations. And then he boarded his plane to Phoenix. \n \n Bianca Padro Ocasio and Tyler Pager contributed to this report.", "\"My job is to protect Mexicans wherever they are, and I will continue to do that,\" Pe\u00f1a Nieto told Trump, the two men standing at lecterns on a stage with one flag, Mexico's. \"Mexicans who live in the U.S. contribute to prosperity there.... They are people who are honest and hardworking. They respect the law ... and deserve the respect of everyone.\"", "Mexico President Enrique Pena Nieto and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump shake hands after a joint statement at Los Pinos, the presidential official residence, in Mexico City, Wednesday, Aug.... (Associated Press) \n \n MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 Standing alongside the president of Mexico, a measured Donald Trump on Wednesday firmly defended the right of the United States to build a massive border wall along its southern flank but declined to repeat his frequent promise to force Mexico to pay for it. \n \n Trump, the U.S. presidential candidate who is widely despised across Mexico, also sidestepped his repeated criticism of Mexican immigrants following a closed-door meeting at the official residence of the country's president, Enrique Pena Nieto. Trump and Pena Nieto, who has compared the New York billionaire to Adolf Hitler, addressed reporters from adjacent podiums flanked by a Mexican flag. \n \n \"We did discuss the wall. We didn't discuss payment of the wall,\" Trump said. \n \n In his announcement of his presidential candidacy last year, Trump derided Mexico as a source of rapists and criminals coming to the U.S., and his presence on Wednesday sparked anger and protests across the capital city. A former Mexican president bluntly told the celebrity businessman that, despite Pena Nieto's hospitality, he was not welcome. \n \n \"We don't like him. We don't want him. We reject his visit,\" former President Vicente Fox told CNN, calling the trip a \"political stunt.\" \n \n Pena Nieto was less combative as he addressed reporters alongside Trump. He acknowledged the two men had differences, but he described their conversation as \"open and constructive.\" They shook hands as the session ended. \n \n The trip, a politically risky move for Trump 10 weeks before America's presidential Election Day, came just hours before the Republican nominee was to deliver a highly anticipated speech in Arizona about illegal immigration. That has been a defining issue of Trump's presidential campaign, but also one on which he's appeared to waver in recent days. \n \n After saying during his Republican primary campaign he would use a \"deportation force\" to expel all of the estimated 11 million people living in the United States illegally, Trump suggested last week he could soften that stance. But he still says he plans to build a huge wall \u2014 paid for by Mexico \u2014 along the two nations' border. He is under pressure to clarify just where he stands in a speech that's been rescheduled several times as he and his staff has sent varied and conflicting messages on the issue. \n \n \"The American people are going to see more clearly that there's one candidate in this race who's prepared to take the steps necessary to end the flood of illegal immigration,\" Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, said Wednesday on CNN. \n \n Trump will also make clear, Pence later told CBS, \"that there will be no path to legalization, no path to citizenship. People will need to leave the country to be able to obtain legal status or obtain citizenship.\" \n \n The buildup to the speech was abruptly interrupted Tuesday night by the news that Trump would visit Mexico, accepting on short notice an invitation offered last week by Pena Nieto. The newspaper El Universal wrote in an editorial that Trump \"caught Mexican diplomats off guard.\" \n \n Campaigning in Ohio earlier in the day, Democrat Hillary Clinton jabbed at Trump's Mexican appearance as she promoted her own experience working with foreign leaders as the nation's chief diplomat. \n \n \"People have to get to know that they can count on you, that you won't say one thing one day and something totally different the next,\" she told the American Legion in Cincinnati. \"And it certainly takes more than trying to make up for a year of insults and insinuations by dropping in on our neighbors for a few hours and then flying home again.\" \n \n He has promised, if elected, to deport millions of immigrants who are in the United States illegally, force Mexico to build a wall to secure the nearly 2,000-mile border and renegotiate the NAFTA trade agreement to make it more favorable to the United States. \n \n Pena Nieto made his invitation to both Trump and Clinton, who met with him in Mexico in 2014. The inclusion of Trump puzzled many in Mexico, who said it wasn't clear why their own unpopular president would agree to meet with someone so widely disliked in his country. \n \n Mexico City-based security analyst Alejandro Hope suggested that Pena Nieto \"wanted to invite Hillary, but that meant inviting both of them, and nobody thought Trump would accept first.\" \n \n Pena Nieto has been sharply critical of Trump's immigration policies, particularly the Republican's plans to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it. In a March interview, he said that \"there is no scenario\" under which Mexico would do so and compared Trump's language to that of dictators Hitler and Benito Mussolini. \n \n Trump responded to Vicente Fox's criticism on Twitter earlier in the day, saying the former president had, like Pena Nieto, invited him to come. Fox shot back with a tweet of his own, saying he had invited Trump to \"come and apologize to all Mexicans. Stop lying! Mexico is not yours to play with, show some respect.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Peoples reported from Washington.

The ceremony is scheduled to start at 11:30 a.m., with a musical prelude beforehand. Afterward, President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are slated to participate in the traditional inaugural parade, which is scheduled to start at 3 p.m. \n \n Where can I watch the inauguration? \n \n If you\u2019re in Washington D.C., there is both ticketed and non-ticketed viewing locations for the ceremony. Security gates will open at 6 a.m. Tickets were distributed by members of Congress and the inaugural committee. If you\u2019re not in Washington, major broadcast and cable networks will show the ceremony, and POLITICO will stream the ceremony . \n \n The parade route will follow Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol to the White House, and much of it will be open to the public and unticketed. It will pass right past Donald Trump\u2019s hotel in the Old Post Office. \n \n Who is going to be at the inauguration? \n \n Besides Trump, his family and the Obamas, several living ex-presidents will be in attendance. Jimmy Carter was the first to say he will attend , and so will George W. Bush. Former Vice President Dick Cheney also said he will be there. Both former President Bill Clinton and 2016 presidential election nominee Hillary Clinton are also slated to attend . A George H. W. Bush spokesman said he will not be there, citing health concerns. \n \n Prominent faith leaders like Catholic Cardinal Timothy Dolan and the Reverend Franklin Graham will also be there. \n \n Donald Trump encouraged his supporters to set an \u201call time record\u201d for attendance, but planners are expecting about 800,000 people, well below President Obama\u2019s first inaugural. \n \n Who is going to perform at inauguration? \n \n The list thus far lacks the star power of events past. Three Doors Down and Toby Keith have also been added to the lineup, joining some of the Rockettes, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d runner-up Jackie Evancho, who will sing the national anthem. \n \n For his part, Trump tweeted that he didn\u2019t want any celebrities, writing : \u201cthe so-called \ufffd?A\u2019 list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary, NOTHING. I want the PEOPLE!\u201d \n \n Tom Barrack, the chair of the inaugural committee also told reporters that there will be a \u201csoft sensuality\u201d for the inauguration with a \u201cmuch more poetic cadence.\u201d \n \n What\u2019s the order of the ceremony at inauguration? \n \n The ceremony opens with the call to order from Sen. Roy Blunt, followed by readings and invocations and music from the Missouri State University chorale. Mike Pence will then take the Vice Presidential oath of office, administered by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir performs, and then Donald Trump takes the presidential oath of office, administered by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. \n \n Trump will give his inaugural address, followed by more readings and a benediction and close with the national anthem. The complete program is here . \n \n What should we expect for Trump\u2019s inauguration speech? \n \n Donald Trump tapped Stephen Miller to pen his much-anticipated speech. Miller frequently served as the warm-up act on the campaign trail for Trump. Early discussions of the speech focused on structural problems within the country and setting an agenda for Trump\u2019s first 100 days and beyond. \n \n What about the parade? \n \n The inaugural committee announced the parade lineup in late December, which includes high school bands, police troops and civic groups found across the country. The statement also said that all branches of the military will be represented. \n \n A minor controversy broke out over the parade\u2019s announcer. Charlie Brotman, an 89-year-old who has announced every inaugural parade since President Dwight D. Eisenhower's second term, was replaced by Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. Brotman is instead \u201cAnnouncer Chairmen Emeritus.\u201d \n \n What is the rest of the inauguration weekend schedule? \n \n The inauguration festivities are not confined to just the day-of events. Trump will attend a wreath laying ceremony at Arlington National Ceremony on January 19 and then host a \u201cMake America Great Again! Welcome Celebration\u201d at the Lincoln Memorial that evening, which is open to the public. After his inauguration, Trump will attend inaugural balls that evening \u2014 but only three, a sharp decline when compared to President Obama in 2009. \n \n \"The balls are kind of a confusing quagmire because the states themselves have their own celebratory events,\" Barrack told ABC News . \"We'll have basically three balls. Two in the [Washington] Convention Center, one called the Commander in Chief ball, which is a traditional military ball. And then we'll have a series of private dinners.\" The new president will also attend a national prayer service at Washington National Cathedral on January 21. \n \n There\u2019s also plenty of unofficial events taking place. Three separate pro-Trump biker groups are organizing rallies honoring the new president, and there\u2019s a litany of unofficial inaugural balls. \n \n The weekend is also expected to draw a lot of anti-Trump protests. The largest is expected to be the Women\u2019s March on Washington. Organizers of the march predicted 200,000 people will attend in a permit application . Other rallies, both pro and anti-Trump, predict anywhere from 100 to 50,000 attendees. \n \n What will President Obama do at inauguration? \n \n President Obama and Donald Trump will meet at the White House prior to the latter\u2019s inauguration, according to Barrack. The pair will ride with their wives to the inauguration from the White House. After the inauguration, Obama and his family will take one final flight on Air Force One to an as-of-yet-announced destination, which is customary. \n \n I live in D.C. and want to avoid the crowds. What\u2019s shut down during inauguration? \n \n Much of downtown D.C. will be closed for inauguration events. Closures in the \u201cred zone\u201d start at noon on January 18 and won\u2019t reopen until the January 23. Green zone streets become restricted to D.C. residents and businesses the morning of January 19. Additional streets around Capitol Hill, the Lincoln Memorial, Union Station, the convention center and the National Cathedral will be closed at various times during the weekend for inaugural events. \n \n Five of the Metro\u2019s stations - Archives, Mt. Vernon Square, Federal Triangle, Smithsonian and Pentagon, will be shut down on Inauguration Day. Metro says that there will be frequent service on all lines from opening until 9 p.m.", "Trump\u2019s inaugural speech: What experts say to look for \n \n WASHINGTON \u2014 Having smashed convention at every step of his unorthodox path to the presidency, Donald Trump will stand before the world Friday as heir to a 228-year tradition handed down from George Washington, in a setting steeped in the most cherished rituals of American democracy. \n \n The centerpiece of the day is the inaugural address. Trump\u2019s speech will be the liftoff point of his journey in office, defining its contours and tone, and setting a course for the nation. \n \n Trump offered a preview Wednesday, tweeting a photograph of himself holding a pen above a legal pad as he gazed sternly, from a bizarre tableau of Persian tiles and an eagle sculpture, meant to show him writing the speech himself from his \u201cWinter White House\u201d at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. \n \n Presidential scholars were at a loss to predict what Trump would say Friday. But they had ideas on what he should try to do. \n \n \u201cThis inaugural address will be carefully watched around the world, and the slightest little language usage could set his administration off on a very bad course,\u201d said San Francisco State political science Professor Robert Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear he\u2019s capable of becoming, not a politician, not a candidate, not a showman, but a statesman. The whole world is watching to see if he can at least, at the inaugural address, make the transition.\u201d \n \n Here are five things experts said to watch for: \n \n Conciliation: Trump takes office with a record low approval rating, after losing the popular vote by 2.8 million votes, a record for a winning candidate. He instills fear among some, and has alienated many women, Latinos, African Americans, Muslims and immigrants. \n \n \u201cIf he wants to appear to be more presidential, he needs to try to reach out to all of America, not just to his more conservative followers,\u201d said David Caputo, president emeritus of Pace University in New York. \u201cThat, I think, is his most difficult task, and his most difficult task during his presidency.\u201d \n \n Promise keeping: At the same time, Trump must also reassure his supporters. \u201cMost of the things he has proposed are profoundly controversial and divisive,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can abandon those promises, but he has to couch them in such a way as to ... reassure the country that he\u2019s not going to go off in any kind of radical new way.\u201d \n \n Vision: Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump will be \u201cphilosophical,\u201d giving \u201ca very personal and sincere statement about his vision for the country.\u201d He also will mention infrastructure, education and manufacturing. \n \n \u201cWe need to see a clear message as to what his priorities are,\u201d said James Thurber, a presidential scholar at American University. That\u2019s because Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees, in congressional testimony, have contradicted many of his positions, some of which also are at odds with the GOP majority in Congress. \n \n Trump \u201cis very adept at reading the mood of the country,\u201d Caputo said. \u201cHe now has the opportunity to come up with a message and programs that meet that mood.\u201d \n \n Ad libs: Trump campaigned by holding rallies where he rambled extemporaneously, dropping insults, boasts and prevarications along the way that would have sunk a normal politician. Even on a teleprompter, Trump is prone to ad lib. He speaks in the vernacular, using a limited, hyperbolic vocabulary. \n \n The question remains as to whether he can adapt this style to the occasion or adopt something with more heft. Aides said the speech will be short and Trump is reviewing previous inaugural speeches for style. \n \n \u201cHe wants to be a combination of Reagan and Kennedy,\u201d Thurber said. \u201cI don\u2019t see him doing that. I see him, in fact, probably going off cue, maybe trying to wing it. If he does, it would be a major problem.\u201d \n \n Foreign policy: Foreign leaders will be searching for signs of reassurance. Trump has alarmed foreign leaders around the globe with some of his statements, upsetting decades of U.S. policy on China, nuclear proliferation, NATO and other areas. \u201cAll of us are scared and so are the Europeans and so are the Asians,\u201d said Richard Abrams, professor emeritus of American history at UC Berkeley. \u201cHe\u2019s very unpredictable.\u201d \n \n What not to look for: Trump defies comparison with previous presidents. The interesting question, Caputo said, is whether \u201cthe Trump presidency is a transition to a new type of president and a new way the executive branch functions in the United States.\u201d \n \n Carolyn Lochhead is the San Francisco Chronicle\u2019s Washington correspondent. Email: clochhead@sfchronicle.com", "Even before his inauguration, Donald Trump has notched up at least one dubious achievement: He\u2019ll be the first modern president to enter the White House without a honeymoon. \n \n Most Americans give new presidents the benefit of the doubt. In 2001, for example, a solid majority rallied behind George W. Bush despite the fact that he lost the popular vote. \n \n Not Trump. On Tuesday, a CNN poll found that only 40% of Americans think he\u2019s done a good job as president-elect \u2014 well below the 61% who backed Bush in 2001, and far below the 84% who approved of Barack Obama in 2009. \n \n Indeed, the new poll showed that Trump has actually lost ground during his transition, normally a time when a new president\u2019s stature improves. In November, CNN reported, 46% of the public thought Trump was doing a good job; some of those supporters have already drifted away. \n \n We are already seeing Trump struggle between two instincts: the yearning to unite all Americans behind him, and the urge to attack every critic. \n \n Trump\u2019s reaction to the survey, and others with similar results, was predictable. The polls \u201care rigged just like before,\u201d he tweeted. \n \n But the erosion of his support was predictable too. Trump\u2019s standing bounced up at first, after he promised on election night to \u201cbind the wounds of division,\u201d and after he helped negotiate a deal saving some 800 jobs at an Indiana manufacturing plant. \n \n Since then, the president-elect has reverted to the truculent style of his campaign, tweeting complaints at critics from John Lewis to Meryl Streep. The news about his transition has focused on the controversy over his chumminess toward Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, not his promises to create jobs. \n \n That makes Trump\u2019s inaugural address on Friday an event with unusually high political stakes. It\u2019s not only an opportunity for the new president to set out his goals in office; it\u2019s also a chance to appeal to skeptical voters \u2014 and to renew the unifying tone of his election night remarks. \n \n There are signs that Trump wants to do just that. \u201cHis instruction to me was: The campaign is over. I am now president for all the people,\u201d inaugural chair Tom Barrack told reporters. \u201cI want you to build a bridge and tie them back in. I want to heal the wounds and I want to get back to work.\u201d \n \n And a few weeks ago, Trump told historian Douglas Brinkley that he was studying the inaugural speeches of John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Richard M. Nixon to prepare. \n \n The Kennedy and Reagan speeches are acknowledged as classics. But Nixon? \n \n Actually, Nixon\u2019s 1969 speech is the one most likely to be useful to Trump, because Nixon\u2019s circumstances were most similar to his. \n \n Nixon won a three-way race with only 43% of the popular vote (less than Trump\u2019s 46%), and was seeking to lead a country bitterly divided over racial tension and the Vietnam War. He decided that what the country wanted was fellowship, not division, and on Inauguration Day in 1969, he delivered a speech that was both generous and graceful \u2014 words not often attached to the 37th president. \n \n \u201cWhen we listen to the better angels of our nature, we find that they celebrate the simple things, the basic things, such as goodness, decency, love, kindness,\u201d Nixon said that day. \u201cTo lower our voices would be a simple thing. In these difficult years, America has suffered from a fever of words; from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver; from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds; from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading. We cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another.\u201d \n \n The speech, and Nixon\u2019s early efforts to govern from the center, launched his presidency on a wave of relative good feelings, according to John A. Farrell, author of a forthcoming biography, \u201cNixon: The Life.\u201d \n \n \u201cHe made a serious attempt to cast himself as a unifier,\u201d Farrell told me. \u201cIt did bring him a honeymoon.\u201d \n \n That was all the more striking because Nixon, like Trump, had always been a brawler. \n \n \u201cNixon spent his entire career as a champion of the politics of grievance, and aimed it at working-class and middle-class Americans \u2014 the people he called the forgotten man,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cThere\u2019s at least a distant parallel with Trump there.\u201d \n \n If Trump follows Nixon\u2019s example, he may sound like a new man on Friday, a president bent on reinstalling a measure of civility in public life. \n \n Even so, that New Trump may not last. The New Nixon didn\u2019t. \n \n \u201cThe Vietnam War got in the way,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cNixon couldn\u2019t resist going after his enemies. The Old Nixon came back.\u201d \n \n We are already seeing Trump struggle between two instincts: the yearning to unite all Americans behind him, and the urge to attack every critic. That battle won\u2019t be resolved on Inauguration Day, no matter what tone he strikes. \n \n doyle.mcmanus@latimes.com \n \n Twitter: @DoyleMcManus \n \n Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook", "Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed What We Can Learn From Trump's Speech Patterns 2:56 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n When President-elect Donald Trump gives his inaugural address Friday, his advisers say he will outline a vision for \"one America.\" \n \n But whether he can stitch together a compelling and convincing message will rely on something that has become Trump's trademark: his unique way with words. \n \n Putting aside partisan politics \u2014 and based on Trump's pattern of speech, his phrasings and diction \u2014 does the next president of the United States have a style that can be persuasive enough to bring Americans together? \n \n Trump holds a campaign rally at the Sioux City Convention Center on Nov. 6, 2016 in Sioux City, Iowa.

GLENN RUSSELL/FREE PRESS \n \n Commuters travel under a warning sign as they work their way down Highway 26 in Portland, Ore., earlier this month (Photo: Don Ryan, AP) \n \n Here's a winter driving tip for you: Don't warm up your car engine. \n \n There's no need in this modern era of fuel injection and on-board computers. Thirty seconds, a minute at the most, and you're good to go, no matter the weather outside. That's how long it takes for the oil to get from the bottom to the top of your engine, where the moving parts are. \n \n So says Chris Lague, service writer at Partner Tire & Service in Colchester, Vt. Lague has been everything from a certified master technician to a business manager at a dealership, spending 23 years in the car business. \n \n \"Manufacturers will say about 30 seconds and then you can start driving,\" Lague said. \"Most cars are engineered now so they'll actually warm up faster if you drive them than if you just let it sit there.\" \n \n Kristen McIntyre, a stay-at-home mom in Essex, Vt., said she was aware that modern engines don't need to be warmed up. McIntyre has another reason for a quick, idle-free getaway. \n \n \"Because of the environment,\" she said. \n \n CLOSE Here's the latest for Monday, December 26th: Russia plane crash possibly pilot error; Singer George Michael dead at 53; Blizzard conditions in northern Plains; Boxing Day shopping extravaganza in Australia. AP \n \n Vermont enacted a statute in 2014 that prohibits idling for more than 5 minutes out of any 60-minute period, with some exceptions, including health issues, frosted-over windshields and food refrigeration. \n \n \"It so happens cars fit their law,\" Lague said. \"You don't have to sit there for 10 minutes. Even though there are less emissions now than ever, you're still emitting something. The state rightfully wants to protect the environment.\" \n \n Dale Franklin, owner of Partner Tire, knows better than to think everyone will agree with his service writer. Franklin, who used to do a radio spot called the \"Partner Car Care Minute,\" said even when the spot was about something he believed was \"definitive,\" colleagues would track him down on the street to tell him he was wrong. \n \n It didn't take long on an afternoon stroll through Burlington Town Center to find someone who didn't agree with Lague. Bill Brisson, 54, said he warms his car up for eight to 10 minutes on cold winter mornings. \n \n \"At zero or 10 below, that (engine) oil is still like molasses,\" Brisson said. \"You don't want to start the car and start going down the road immediately. Let the crankshaft pull the oil to the top of the heads and warm up.\" \n \n Run out there real quick, start the car up, go back in the house and finish your last sip of coffee, throw on your shoes and your coat, and you're out the door in eight to 10 minutes, Brisson said. \n \n \"I'm old school,\" he said. \n \n Exactly, says the 41-year-old Lague. \n \n The old school hearkens back to the days of carburetors \u2014 the fuel delivery system that preceded fuel injection, and did require warming up on cold winter days. In the cold, old days, Lague said, you had to wait 10 minutes before you even thought about getting into your car. \n \n \"It would be warm a few miles down the road, maybe,\" he said. \n \n Unless you're driving a vintage 1960s muscle car with a carburetor instead of fuel injection, no warm-up is required, despite what Brisson and others like him believe, according to Lague. \n \n \"People our age were trained under people older than us,\" Lague said. \"This is how it was done under carburetors, so this is how it has to be done now. That has pretty much gone by the wayside. It's time for the newer generation, this generation, to say, 'Look, this is the way it is now. Computers have taken over. As far as getting warm, just drive it.'\" \n \n The computer systems in today's cars have two modes, Lague explained. One mode is designed to get the car to normal operating temperature as quickly as possible. That's the mode your car is in when you start it. The other mode runs the car as efficiently as possible once it reaches operating temperature. \n \n How about if you just want a nice warm car for the drive to work in the morning? No harm done, Lague says, but keep your warm-up to 5 minutes or less if you don't want to be a scofflaw. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iFhvDo", "Roseville man posts ticket he received for warming car in own driveway Local News Roseville man posts ticket he received for warming car in own driveway A Roseville man is becoming Facebook famous after he posted a picture of a ticket he received from a Roseville cop for warming up his vehicle in his own driveway. \n \n - A Roseville man is becoming Facebook famous after he posted a picture of a ticket he received from a Roseville cop for warming up his vehicle in his own driveway. \n \n Nick Taylor posted the sarcastic Facebook post on Thursday, thanking the officer who gave him the ticket. According to the picture, the ticket is for his car that was left running in the driveway with no one around. \n \n \"I've never heard of any city ordinance of law like that,\" Taylor said. \n \n On Thursday, it was frigidly cold and he wanted to keep his car running while he ran into his girlfriend's house. But he left it unlocked with the key in the ignition. Chief James Berlin said that's a problem. \n \n \"This is purely a public safety issue. You can't do it. You see it all the time, people hop in a running car and Steal them. Something bad happens when that occurs,\" Berlin said. \n \n The post received thousands of comments and shares since he posted it. \n \n \"I mostly just put it online to see what people thought of it and see if it's happened to anyone else because I've never heard of this,\" Taylor said. \n \n The ticket shows ordinance listed as 99006 but there is no ordinance in the city or state that corresponds to 99006. Under the description of the offense, it lists VEH/MOTOR ON UNATTENDED 895. Ordinance 895 is listed as being part of 'rodent control' on Roseville's website. \n \n FOX 2 contacted the Michigan State Police for more information. Lt. Mike Shaw says there is no state law that prohibits letting your car idle with the keys in the ignition. \n \n At this point, it seems difficult to decipher which code the officer was enforcing. Either way, Nick has an appointment on January 26th in District Court in Roseville. \n \n The ticket shows it was written for a 1997 Chrysler Concorde - and it likely did not come equipped with remote start. Berlin said if the car would have had auto-start, this would not be an issue. \n \n \"Our officers are cognizant of the fact that some people have auto-start. Auto-start has numerous safeguards built in to prevent the car from being stolen: car must be locked, must be in gear. you cannot put the car in gear until the key is inserted into the ignition. That is done to prevent the car from being stolen. That was not the case,\" Berlin said. \n \n Taylor wrote on Facebook \"Let's all take a moment to thank officer dips*** K.

When he went back outside, he had received a ticket that said \"motor vehicle unattended.\" \n \n \"Vehicle parked in drive with keys in ignition, motor running -- no one around,\" the Roseville officer wrote on the ticket. \n \n The officer didn't knock on the door to inform Taylor of the problem. \n \n \"That would have been respectful,\" Taylor said. \"I had no clue that this was a law, an ordinance.\" \n \n Police said the key component of the case is whether the key is in the car. Using a remote starter is OK because the key isn't in the car. If the key is in the car, it's a state and local violation, because somebody could take off in the car. \n \n \"You're putting the public at risk,\" Roseville police Chief James Berlin said. \"This is purely a public safety issue.\" \n \n Taylor posted a picture of the ticket on his Facebook page and called the officer an insulting name.

Taylor posted a photo of the ticket on his Facebook page and railed against the \"dip----\" Roseville police officer who left it there for \"wasting the taxpayer's money.\" (He later \"retracted\" the insult.)

H&M has since apologized for using the photograph. \n \n On Monday, Liam\u2019s parents, Terry Mango and Frank Odhiambo, addressed the controversy on the U.K.\u2019s This Morning program on ITV. \n \n \u201cI wouldn\u2019t see such a connection to anything other than my son modeling a shirt,\u201d said Mrs. Mango, speaking about the racial connotations of the advertisement. \u201cWith the furore going on, you look back and wonder, if you had noticed it, what would be my initial response to it?\u201d \n \n Mango went on to say that she doesn\u2019t feel the controversy is an overreaction, however, and supported people speaking out about racism\u2014though she doesn\u2019t necessarily share the same opinion in this instance. \n \n \u201cEverybody should act differently based on their opinions of what racism is,\u201d said the boy\u2019s mother. \u201cI know what racism is\u2014I\u2019ve had racist remarks directed to me.

He believes people love him for his modeling job, and he\u2019s cool, and [for] his confidence in his job,\u201d said Mango.", "Surely the year of Sociopathic Baby Men, 2017 was also the year of pathetic apologies. From random Jay-Z quotes to omitting the actual words \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d and implying sexual harassment is fun, misogynistic men (and their lawyers) demonstrated a profound inability to discern between self-absorption and remorse. \n \n And as 2018 began, it appeared the trend would continue. On Jan. 8, H&M came under fire after a product shot on the Swedish fast-fashion brand\u2019s UK site used a black child to sell a hoodie that says \u201ccoolest monkey in the jungle.\u201d \n \n As Marc Bain explained in Quartz, the image was seen as disgracefully racist. Singer and songwriter The Weeknd, who has collaborated with H&M on a fashion line tweeted that he was \u201cshocked and embarrassed\u201d will no longer work with the company. Drummer and producer Questlove used an Instagram post to write, \u201call this tells me about @HM is that the seats in the boardroom lack something\u2026wanna take a guess?\u201d Others questioned whether the advertisement was an embarrassing instance of cultural ignorance, given how the racial history of Sweden differs from that of the US. \n \n H&M says sorry, round one \n \n Responding to the internet\u2019s rage, H&M swiftly apologized\u2014kind of. \n \n \u201cWe sincerely apologize for offending people with this image of a printed hooded top,\u201d H&M\u2019s PR representative said in a statement sent to Bain. \u201cThe image has been removed from all online channels and the product will not be for sale in the United States.\u201d \n \n Many people were not satisfied with this apology\u2014with good reason. The hoodie was still being sold on its UK site, Business Insider reported. What\u2019s more, this initial apology commits one of the most egregious apology errors: Instead of sincerely apologizing for creating and promoting an offensive product, H&M apologized for \u201coffending people with this image.\u201d The subtle difference between saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I did\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry if you feel badly\u201d is profound. \n \n As Nicole McCance, a Toronto-based relationship psychologist who works with couples and families, tells Quartz, \u201cEven if they\u2019re well intentioned, saying phrases like \u2018I\u2019m sorry if you feel like I was mean\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m sorry if you feel angry,\u2019 will not work because they minimize the other person\u2019s feelings and experience.\u201d \n \n Instead, McCance advises following \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d with genuine expressions of remorse, and phrases like \u201cI can imagine you\u2019re so disappointed.\u201d Most important, make sure \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d includes clear and specific examples of what, exactly, you are sorry for. \n \n \u201cSaying \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 alone is fairly empty. It\u2019s just a hollow statement that doesn\u2019t do much for the giver or the receiver of the apology,\u201d Joanne Lescher, a certified non-violent communication facilitator, tells Quartz. \u201cIf you are really sorry, maybe it\u2019s because you regret your actions or words, because you\u2019ve seen how whatever you said or did impacted the other person. So you should continue your apology by saying something like, \u2018I regret that I said X because I see how deeply it impacted you, and how hurt you are by my words, and that wasn\u2019t my intention.\u201d Apologizing with your regret is deeper and richer than \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d because it shows that you see how much you hurt the other person, she says. \n \n While removing the hoodie from the US site is a step in the right direction, H&M\u2019s first apology essentially equates to: \u201cUgh, we\u2019ll take it down, but we don\u2019t regret it.\u201d \n \n H&M says sorry, round two \n \n No statement can reverse H&M\u2019s ill-informed advertisement. However, as public figures and companies continue to issue flailing, seemingly fake remorse, the progress H&M demonstrated in their second apology is worth learning from. \n \n Yesterday (Jan. 10), H&M sent that longer apology to its media list, opening with the stark statement: \u201cOur position is simple and unequivocal\u2014we have got this wrong and we are deeply sorry.\u201d After explaining its full commitment to addressing societal issues such as diversity and environmental protection, H&M admitted \u201cwe clearly haven\u2019t come far enough. We agree with all the criticism that this has generated\u2014we have got this wrong and we agree that, even if unintentional, passive or casual racism needs to be eradicated wherever it exists.\u201d \n \n This second pass, which can be read in full below, models the most essential element of an apology: taking full responsibility for your actions, and not attempting to justify the ways in which your wrongs may have been right. \u201cFirst and foremost, it\u2019s really important to avoid explaining the reasons behind what you did,\u201d McCance tells Quartz. \u201cThere are always reasons behind behavior, but laying out these reasons can come across as excuses. If you do this, the other person will feel like you aren\u2019t sincere and don\u2019t get it.\u201d \n \n H&M also put action behind their words, removing the hoodie from sale everywhere and committing to recycling the remaining stock. \u201cIf the apology doesn\u2019t have that following piece of \u2018what I want to do differently,\u2019 then the person may not ever change their behavior,\u201d Lescher says. \u201cUntil you take responsibility for your behavior, and create a plan of action on how to improve, most of us fall back into old patterns.\u201d \n \n H&M\u2019s second apology, in full \n \n To all customers, staff, media, stakeholders, partners, suppliers, friends and critics. \n \n We would like to put on record our position in relation to the image and promotion of a children\u2019s sweater, and the ensuing response and criticism. \n \n Our position is simple and unequivocal\u2014we have got this wrong and we are deeply sorry. \n \n H&M is fully committed to playing its part in addressing society\u2019s issues and problems, whether it\u2019s diversity, working conditions or environmental protection\u2014and many others. Our standards are high and we feel that we have made real progress over the years in playing our part in promoting diversity and inclusion. But we clearly haven\u2019t come far enough. \n \n We agree with all the criticism that this has generated\u2014we have got this wrong and we agree that, even if unintentional, passive or casual racism needs to be eradicated wherever it exists. We appreciate the support of those who have seen that our product and promotion were not intended to cause offence but, as a global brand, we have a responsibility to be aware of and attuned to all racial and cultural sensitivities\u2014and we have not lived up to this responsibility this time. \n \n This incident is accidental in nature, but this doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t take it extremely seriously or understand the upset and discomfort it has caused. \n \n We have taken down the image and we have removed the garment in question from sale. It will be recycled. \n \n We will now be doing everything we possibly can to prevent this from happening again in future. \n \n Racism and bias in any shape or form, conscious or unconscious, deliberate or accidental, are simply unacceptable and need to be eradicated from society.

It is a great deal... for # ZTE & China. # China crushes U.S. companies with no mercy & they use these telecomm companies to spy & steal from us. Many hoped this time would be different. Now congress will need to act.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/us/politics/trump-trade-zte.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&smid=nytcore-ipad-share \u2026", "Although top senators, including Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Marco Rubio, are urging the administration not to bend on ZTE, President Trump is planning to ease penalties on the Chinese telecommunications giant for violating sanctions against Iran and North Korea. \n \n But what Mr. Trump may not realize is that ZTE is also one of the world\u2019s most notorious intellectual property thieves \u2014 perhaps even the most notorious of all. And since stopping Chinese theft of U.S intellectual property is supposed to be one of the President\u2019s top trade objectives, he should not ease up on ZTE until it stops its high-tech banditry and starts playing by the rules in intellectual property (IP) matters. \n \n To get a sense of just how egregious ZTE\u2019s behavior truly is, we need only to consult PACER, the national index of federal court cases. A search of PACER reveals that in the U.S. alone, ZTE has been sued for patent infringement an astonishing 126 times just in the last five years. This number is even more shocking when you consider that only a subset of companies who believe their IP rights have been violated by ZTE has the means or the will to spend the millions of dollars needed to wage a multi-year lawsuit in federal courts. \n \n But ZTE\u2019s IP thievery is not confined just to the United States. According to one Chinese tech publication, ZTE has also been sued for patent infringement an additional 100 times in China, Germany, Norway, the Netherlands, India, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and other countries. As an intellectual property renegade, ZTE certainly gets around. \n \n Even when it\u2019s not being sued, ZTE thumbs its nose at the traditional rules of fair play in intellectual proper matters, commonly engaging in delay, misrepresentation, and hold out when dealing with patent owners. While ZTE is more than happy to accept royalty payments for the use of its own intellectual property, it rarely if ever pays for the use of others\u2019 IP. \n \n Consider ZTE\u2019s treatment of San Francisco-based Via Licensing Corp, a Swiss-neutral operator of patent pools covering wireless, digital audio, and other building-block components of complex products. Patent pools offer one-stop shopping for product makers to acquire licenses to patents from multiple innovative companies at once. Pools are generally a more efficient, and less litigious, way for product makers to acquire the IP rights they need at reasonable prices. \n \n In 2012, ZTE joined Via\u2019s LTE wireless patent pool, whose members also include Google, AT&T, Verizon, Siemens, China Mobile, and another Chinese tech powerhouse, Lenovo, maker of Motorola-branded smartphones. It helped set the royalty pricing of the pool\u2019s aggregated patent rights, and even received payments from other product makers for their use of ZTE\u2019s own patents within the pool. \n \n But in 2017, precisely when it was ZTE\u2019s turn to pay for its use of other members\u2019 patents in Via\u2019s LTE pool, it suddenly and without ceremony quit the patent pool. Via and its member companies are still trying to get ZTE to pay for its use of their intellectual property \u2014 and to abide by the very rules it helped establish in the first place. \n \n Even among much-criticized Chinese companies, ZTE\u2019s behavior is completely outside the norm. Despite what you may hear, some Chinese companies are actually good IP citizens \u2014 Lenovo for one. In fact, Via\u2019s various patent pools include more than two dozen Chinese companies who play by the rules. \n \n But ZTE is not one of them. It is a blatant serial IP violator who gives other Chinese companies a bad name. And our government should not reward such behavior. \n \n Ease sanctions on ZTE only when it finally starts respecting intellectual property rights.", "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration told lawmakers the U.S. government has reached a deal to put Chinese telecommunications company ZTE Corp back in business after it pays a significant fine and makes management changes, a senior congressional aide said on Friday. \n \n U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to confirm the deal in a tweet late on Friday. \u201cI closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees, change of management and board, must purchase U.S. parts and pay a $1.3 Billion fine.\u201d \n \n The reported deal involving China\u2019s second-largest telecommunications equipment maker ran into immediate resistance in Congress, where Democrats and Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans accused him of bending to pressure from Beijing to ease up on a company that U.S. intelligence officials have suggested poses a significant risk to U.S. national security. \n \n ZTE was banned in April from buying U.S. technology components for seven years for breaking an agreement reached after it violated U.S. sanctions against Iran and North Korea.. After ZTE makes a series of changes it would now be allowed to resume business with U.S. companies, including chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. \n \n The deal, earlier communicated to officials on Capitol Hill by the Commerce Department, requires ZTE to pay a substantial fine, place U.S. compliance officers at the company and change its management team, the aide said. \n \n The Commerce Department would then lift an order issued in April preventing ZTE from buying U.S. products. ZTE shut down most of its production after the ruling was announced. \n \n Fox News said Trump told them on Thursday that he had negotiated the $1.3 billion fine with Chinese President Xi Jinping in a phone call. \n \n ZTE, which is publicly traded but whose largest shareholder is a Chinese state-owned enterprise, agreed last year to pay a nearly $900 million penalty and open its books to a U.S. monitor. The penalty stemmed from for breaking an agreement after it was caught illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran and North Korea, in an investigation dating to the Obama administration. \n \n The company has lost over $3 billion since the April 15th ban on doing business with U.S. suppliers, according to a source familiar with the matter. \n \n Trump on Tuesday floated a plan to fine ZTE up to $1.3 billion and shake up its management as his administration considered rolling back more severe penalties that have crippled the company. \n \n Responding to news of the administration\u2019s deal with ZTE, Republican Senator Marco Rubio tweeted: \u201cYes they have a deal in mind. It is a great deal ... for #ZTE & China. #China crushes U.S. companies with no mercy & they use these telecom companies to spy & steal from us.\u201d \n \n Rubio, as well as Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer and Chris Van Hollen, said Congress should act to stop Trump from letting ZTE get back into business. \u201cIf the administration goes through with this reported deal, President Trump would be helping make China great again,\u201d Schumer said Friday on Twitter. \u201cWould be a huge victory for President Xi, and a dramatic retreat by Pres Trump. Both parties in Congress should come together to stop this deal in its tracks.\u201d \n \n U.S. intelligence and U.S. law enforcement agencies have serious concerns that ZTE and other Chinese telecommunications firms use their equipment to gather intelligence on U.S. citizens. \n \n The U.S. Department of Defense has also stopped selling ZTE\u2019s mobile phones and modems in stores on its military bases, citing potential security risks. \n \n William Evanina, the acting director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said at his May 15 confirmation hearing that he would not use a ZTE phone nor recommend that anyone in a sensitive position in government use one. \n \n Chinese officials sought a pullback on ZTE as part of any broader deal to prevent a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is scheduled to visit China next week for another round of talks. White House legislative director Marc Short told PBS Friday that Ross \u201cwould be making that announcement in the coming day\u201d of a resolution of the ZTE issue. \n \n ZTE needs U.S. components for its mobile phones and network equipment. U.S. companies provide an estimated 25 percent to 30 percent of components in ZTE\u2019s equipment. \n \n FILE PHOTO - Visitors pass in front of the Chinese telecoms equipment group ZTE Corp booth at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 26, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Picture \n \n As part of the agreements ZTE made last year it dismissed four senior employees. \n \n Shares of ZTE\u2019s U.S. suppliers traded higher on Friday. Optical networking equipment maker Acacia Communications Inc, which got 30 percent of 2017 revenue from ZTE, rose 4.4 percent. Optical component company Oclaro Inc, which received 18 percent of its fiscal 2017 revenue from ZTE, rose 2.7 percent. \n \n Reuters reported earlier this week citing sources that a proposed trade deal with China would lift the ZTE ban. In return, China would eliminate tariffs on U.S. agriculture or agree to buy more farm products from the United States."], "summary": "\u2013 Well, ZTE is back in business\u2014sort of.

President Trump tweeted more, saying that \"I closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees, change of management and board, must purchase U.S. parts and pay a $1.3 Billion fine.\" But he's taking political fire from Democrats and Republicans alike for dealing with a company that many consider a national security threat. \"President Trump would be helping make China great again,\" says Sen. Charles Schumer, per the Washington Post. \"Simply a fine and changing board members would not protect America\u2019s economic or national security.\" Sen.

But Trump was under pressure, with Beijing demanding mercy for ZTE in order to resume China-US trade talks on June 2, the Financial Times reports.

Trump has promised to reverse Obama's opening with Cuba unless President Raul Castro agrees to more political freedom on the island, a concession considered a virtual impossibility. \n \n Speaking of Cuba's leaders, Communist Party member and noted economist and political scientist Esteban Morales told the Telesur network that \"they must be worried because I think this represents a new chapter.\" \n \n Carlos Alzugaray, a political scientist and retired Cuban diplomat, said a Trump victory could, however, please some hard-liners in the Cuban leadership who worried that Cuba was moving too close to the United States too quickly. \n \n While many Cubans were unaware of the state of the race early Wednesday morning, those watching state-run Telesur or listening to radio updates said they feared that a Trump victory would mean losing the few improvements they had seen in their lives thanks to the post-detente tourism boom. \n \n \"The little we've advanced, if he reverses it, it hurts us,\" taxi driver Oriel Iglesias Garcia said. \"You know tourism will go down. If Donald Trump wins and turns everything back it's really bad for us.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 1:10 a.m. \n \n A couple of Chinese participants at a U.S. Embassy event in Beijing say they'd welcome a Trump presidency, while another says he thinks the Republican candidate projects a flawed image of the United States. \n \n Blogger Wang Yiming says he hopes Trump will win because the Republican Party has been typically more willing to demonstrate American leadership globally, and he hoped a Republican president would do more to encourage freedom of speech in China. \n \n Wang says: \"I think America has stagnated and Trump represents justice, the rule of law and personal freedom.\" \n \n Lou Bin, a 43-year-old academic at a university in Beijing, says he didn't support either candidate but Trump didn't come across as much of a \"gentleman.\" He says: \"As president you want someone who represents the country's image.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 1 a.m. \n \n Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says at this stage, it would appear that Donald Trump is most likely to claim the presidency. \n \n Bishop told reporters in Canberra, Australia's capital, that her government is ready to work with whomever the American people, \"in their wisdom,\" choose to be their president. \n \n She says a U.S. presidential election is always a momentous occasion, and in this instance, \"it has been a particularly bruising, divisive and hard-fought campaign.\" \n \n She also says the new administration will face a number of challenges, including in Asia-Pacific, and Australia wants to work constructively with the new administration to ensure the continued presence and leadership of the United States in the region. \n \n She calls the U.S. \"our major security ally\" and the largest foreign direct investor and the second-largest trading partner. \n \n She says: \"The United States is also the guarantor and defender of the rules-based international order that has underpinned so much of our economic and security issues. And interests.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 11:45 p.m. \n \n Watching the results of the U.S. election at a New Zealand bar, 22-year-old student Sarah Pereira says she is looking forward to working as an intern in the U.S. Congress, but dreads the prospect of Donald Trump winning the presidency. \n \n Pereira, a master's student in strategic studies, says she will leave for Washington this weekend after winning a scholarship to work for Democratic Congressman Gregory Meeks. \n \n She predicts the effects of a Trump on international relationships would be \"catastrophic.\" \n \n Pereira commented while attending an event hosted by the U.S. Embassy in Wellington. \n \n ___ \n \n 11:20 p.m. \n \n Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has told an aide that \"the competition is closer than expected\" in the U.S. election. \n \n Aide Takeo Kawamura tells Japan's Kyodo News service that Abe is following the vote count in his office. \n \n The Japanese government has remained neutral in public statements, but analysts on both sides of the Pacific have talked about a possible change in U.S. policy toward Japan and the rest of Asia if Republican candidate Donald Trump should win. \n \n Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga is reaffirming his government's commitment to the U.S.-Japan security alliance. He tells reporters that whoever is the next president, the Japan-U.S. alliance will remain the cornerstone of Japan-U.S. diplomacy. \n \n \u2014 This item corrects spelling of Takeo. \n \n ___ \n \n 11 p.m. \n \n Chinese state media outlets are casting the U.S. election as the embodiment of America's democracy in crisis in contrast to China's perceived stability under authoritarian rule. \n \n The state-run Xinhua News Agency says the campaign has highlighted that, in its words, \"the majority of Americans are rebelling against the U.S.'s political class and financial elites.\" \n \n The official Communist Party newspaper People's Daily says in a commentary that the presidential election reveals an \"ill democracy.\" \n \n On Tuesday, the Chinese state broadcaster CCTV ran man-on-the-street interviews with unidentified American voters in which they expressed disgust with the system and dissatisfaction with both candidates.", "\n \n CTVNews.ca Staff \n \n \n \n \n \n Following a deeply divisive election campaign, Americans have elected Donald Trump their next president. \n \n Over the course of the campaign, Trump has made many controversial remarks about America\u2019s relationship with other countries. Here\u2019s what his presidency could mean for Canada: \n \n Trade and the economy \n \n Trump\u2019s campaign trail proclamations could spell trouble for Canadian exporters. \n \n He has slammed the North American Free Trade agreement as the \u201cworst trade deal ever.\u201d He is also against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the proposed free trade agreement between a dozen Pacific Rim countries, including Canada. \n \n One expert told The Canadian Press that Canadian officials have likely thought of specific proposals to update NAFTA and protect Canadian interests should Trump demand changes to the agreement or tear it up altogether. \n \n But others have pointed out that withdrawing from NAFTA is not that simple. The U.S. Congress would have to repeal the legislation that enables NAFTA. \n \n Daniel Kiselbach, a partner at Deloitte Tax Law LLP, told CTVNews.ca last month that if Trump moves to ditch NAFTA, American importers would likely take the U.S. government to court. \n \n Keystone XL and climate change \n \n Trump has said that he would invite TransCanada to revive its application for the pipeline, which was vetoed by President Barack Obama. The pipeline would give Alberta crude a more direct route to refineries in the U.S. \n \n Since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has supported Keystone XL, a re-do of the pipeline approval process would likely be welcomed by the Canadian government. And if the pipeline is built in the coming years, it would be a much-needed boost for Alberta\u2019s economy. \n \n On the broader issue of climate change, Trump has vowed to \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris climate deal that U.S., Canada and nearly 200 other nations signed last year. \n \n Security and defence \n \n Trump has repeatedly vowed to deport illegal immigrants from the U.S. and institute \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of Muslim immigrants and refugees. He has also promised to implement a biometric entry-exit visa tracking system at all border crossings. \n \n Since the U.S. and Canada work closely together on national security and border issues, this could create headaches for the Canadian government. \n \n Trump has also threatened to withhold American military support from NATO if its partner countries don't meet their targeted defence spending. All NATO countries pledged to devote two per cent of their GDP to their defence budgets, but Canada is among the countries that don't hit that target. That\u2019s another potential conflict with the U.S. once Trump is sworn in. \n \n With files from CTV\u2019s Laura Payton and The Canadian Press", "A woman watches a television broadcast of U.S. election in Hong Kong, Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016.

That reflects fears that the Mexican economy could slide if Trump wins. \n \n Perhaps no other country outside the United States is as invested in the election as Mexico. It is the polarizing figure of Trump \u2014 widely reviled here as a Mexico basher \u2014 that drove up interest in the U.S. presidential contest. \n \n \"American elections are always important to us, because we're neighbors,\" said Cecilia Beaven, 30, who was watching election results roll in at the Legion Americana bar. \"But this year it feels personal.\" \n \n \"What will happen to me when I'm in the U.S.?\" asked Beaven, a Fulbright scholar who will be going to the U.S. to study art next year. \"I'm scared. There has never been anyone more threatening to Mexicans and immigrants in general.\" \n \n Throughout Tuesday, the election received extensive coverage in the Mexican media, with stations featuring expert panels and hours of talking-head air time. \n \n The two major networks, Televisa and Television Azteca, dispatched anchors to the United States to direct the detailed coverage \u2014 often focusing on the expected critical role of the Latino vote. \n \n Special correspondent Cecilia Sanchez contributed to this report. \n \n ALSO \n \n How Donald Trump put together such a strong showing in the presidential election results \n \n The people at Clinton's election night party wanted to celebrate.

{"document": ["A Maypole topped with a swastika is raised for a May Day parade in the Lustgarten in Berlin. The May holiday became an important celebration in the Nazi calendar. Germany, April 26, 1939. \n \n The swastika is an ancient symbol that was in use in many different cultures for at least 5,000 years before Adolf Hitler made it the centerpiece of the Nazi flag. Its present-day use by certain extremist groups promotes hate. \n \n It was used at least 5,000 years before Adolf Hitler designed the Nazi flag. The word swastika comes from the Sanskrit svastika, which means \u201cgood fortune\u201d or \u201cwell-being.\" The motif (a hooked cross) appears to have first been used in Neolithic Eurasia, perhaps representing the movement of the sun through the sky. To this day it is a sacred symbol in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. It is a common sight on temples or houses in India and Indonesia. Swastikas also have an ancient history in Europe, appearing on artifacts from pre-Christian European cultures. For centuries a symbol of good luck and auspiciousness, the swastika even found expression in Byzantine and Christian art. \n \n The symbol experienced a resurgence in the late nineteenth century, following extensive archaeological work such as that of the famous German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann. Schliemann discovered the hooked cross on the site of ancient Troy in modern Turkey. He connected it with similar shapes found on pottery in Germany and speculated that it was a \u201csignificant religious symbol of our remote ancestors.\u201d \n \n However, the work of Schliemann soon was taken up by movements that wanted to evoke racial purity, \u201cAryan identity\u201d and German nationalist pride. \n \n This belief that the \u201cGerman race\u201d descended from the Aryan race is likely one of the main reasons the Nazi party formally adopted the swastika or Hakenkreuz (Ger., hooked cross) as its symbol in 1920. \n \n The Nazi Party, however, was not the only party to use the swastika in Germany. After World War I, a number of far-right nationalist movements adopted the swastika. As a symbol, it became associated with the idea of a racially \u201cpure\u201d state. By the time the Nazis gained control of Germany, the connotations of the swastika had forever changed. \n \n The swastika would become the most recognizable icon of Nazi propaganda, appearing on the flag referred to by Hitler in Mein Kampf as well as on election posters, armbands, medallions, and badges for military and other organizations. A potent symbol intended to elicit pride among Aryans, it also became a symbol of Nazi racial ideology that called for the elimination of Jews and other groups deemed inferior. \n \n In Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler wrote: \n \n \u201cI myself, meanwhile, after innumerable attempts, had laid down a final form; a flag with a red background, a white disk, and a black swastika in the middle. After long trials I also found a definite proportion between the size of the flag and the size of the white disk, as well as the shape and thickness of the swastika.\u201d \n \n Further reading \n \n Heidtmann, Horst. \u201cSwastika.\u201d In Encyclopedia of the Third Reich, 937-939.

[ See more Russian Nazca Lines Photos \n \n A huge geoglyph in the shape of an elk or deer discovered in Russia may predate Peru's famous Nazca Lines by thousands of years. \n \n The animal-shaped stone structure, located near Lake Zjuratkul in the Ural Mountains, north of Kazakhstan, has an elongated muzzle, four legs and two antlers. A historical Google Earth satellite image from 2007 shows what may be a tail, but this is less clear in more recent imagery. \n \n Excluding the possible tail, the animal stretches for about 900 feet (275 meters) at its farthest points (northwest to southeast), the researchers estimate, equivalent to two American football fields. The figure faces north and would have been visible from a nearby ridge. \n \n \"The figure would initially have looked white and slightly shiny against the green grass background,\" write Stanislav Grigoriev, of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of History & Archaeology, and Nikolai Menshenin, of the State Centre for Monument Protection, in an article first detailing the discovery published last spring in the journal Antiquity. They note that it is now covered by a layer of soil. \n \n Fieldwork carried out this past summer has shed more light on the glyph's composition and date, suggesting it may be the product of a \"megalithic culture,\" researchers say. They note that hundreds of megalithic sites have been discovered in the Urals, with the most elaborate structures located on a freshwater island about 35 miles (60 km) northeast of the geoglyph. [See Photos of Russia's Nazca Lines] \n \n The Russian geoglyph was made out of stone, now covered by soil, and an archaeological team has been at work studying it.

He alerted researchers, who sent out a hydroplane and paraglider to survey the giant structure. \n \n This has since progressed to an on-the-ground excavation by a team led by Grigoriev. They've found that the stone architecture of the geoglyph is quite elaborate. When they excavated part of a hind leg the largest stones were on the edges, the smaller ones inside. This past summer they also found the remains of passageways and what appear to be small walls on the hoof and muzzle of the animal. \n \n \"The hoof is made of small crushed stones and clay. It seems to me there were very low walls and narrow passages among them. The same situation in the area of a muzzle: crushed stones and clay, four small broad walls and three passages,\" Grigorievwrote in an email to LiveScience. He cautioned that his team didn't excavate all the way down to the bottom of the walls, not wishing to damage the geoglyph. \n \n An image of the makeup of the leg of the Russian geoglyph. Credit: Image courtesy Stanislav Grigoriev. \n \n Dating the geoglyph \n \n Among the finds from the excavations are about 40 stone tools, made of quartzite, found on the structure's surface. Most of them are pickaxe-like tools called mattocks, useful for digging and chopping. \"Perhaps they were used to extract clay,\" he writes in the email. \n \n The style of stone-working called lithic chipping used on one artifact dates it to the Neolithic and Eneolithic (sixth to third millennia B.C.), though Grigoriev says the technology is more typical of the Eneolithic, between the fourth and third millennia B.C. \n \n If that date is correct, it would make the geoglyph far older than Peru's Nazca Lines, the very earliest of which were created around 500 B.C. Grigorievadded that current studies of ancient pollen at the site will help to narrow down the age. [Gallery: Aerial Photos Reveal Mysterious Stone Structures] \n \n In the Antiquity journal article, Grigoriev and Menshenin point out that palaeozoological studies show that the landscape in the southern Urals supported fewer trees in the Eneolithic, with forest growth not appearing until about 2,500 years ago. \"This means that there were open landscapes in the Eneolithic and Bronze Age, which allowed the hill figure to be created,\" they write. \n \n A megalithic culture \n \n Researchers say this geoglyph may have been built by a \"megalithic culture\" in the region that created stone monuments in prehistoric times. \n \n \"[M]any megalithic sites with features in common with European megaliths have been located: Some 300 are known but have not yet been studied in detail,\" write Grigoriev and Menshenin in the Antiquity article. Among these megaliths are numerous \"menhirs,\" large upright standing stones. \n \n The most spectacular megalithic complexes are on the relatively small Vera Island, located on Turgoyak Lake, about 35 miles (60 km) northeast of the geoglyph. \n \n Grigoriev and Julia Vasina of the South-Ural State University described the Vera Island megaliths in a 2010 article, noting the surviving portion of one monument, megalith two, as being covered by a mound and supporting a gallery and square chamber. Another monument, megalith one, is cut into the bedrock and covered by a mound consisting of stones, brown sand and lots of grass. It is more than 60 feet (19 meters) long and 20 feet (6 meters) wide. It contains three chambers one of which has \"bas relief sculptures\" in the shape of animals, probably a bull and wolf. \n \n Stone tools and ceramics found at the megalithic sites date them to between the Eneolithic period and the early Iron Age, around 3,000 years ago. Researchers emphasize more dating work needs to be done to verify; however, if the evidence holds, the giant geoglyph, along with the megaliths, were constructed millennia before Peru's Nazca Lines, a testament to the building prowess of an ancient prehistoric culture in the Ural Mountains. \n \n Follow LiveScience on Twitter at @livescience.

In Asia, the symbol first appears in archaeological records around 2,500 BC in the Indus Valley Civilisation. \n \n \"As of today, we can say only one thing \u2013 the geoglyphs were built by ancient people,\" archaeologists Irina Shevnina and Andrew Logvin, who discovered the Kazakh geoglyphs, told Live Science. \n \n They added that other structures and evidence of fireplaces within the geoglyphs suggest rituals took place there. \n \n Experts have compared the findings in Kazakhstan to the famous Nazca Lines in Peru, which were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994. \n \n Although some of the Peruvian geoglyphs resemble Paracas motifs, an Andean society that lived between 800 and 100 BCE, scholars believe they were created by the Nazca culture between 400 and 650 AD. \n \n In the past year, researchers from Kostanay University and Vilnius University in Lithuania have been conducting archaeological excavations, aerial photography and ground-penetrating radar surveys to examine the geoglyphs in Kazakhstan. \n \n The symbols vary in shapes and size. One swastika was made from timber, although the majority of the geoglyphs were made using mounds of earth. \n \n One of the largest measures 1,312ft in diameter, suggesting it was created by a larger, well-established culture, the researchers said. \n \n Ancient tribes may have used the geoglyphs to mark ownership of the land, but the reason behind the creation of the patterns remains unknown. \n \n Central Asia is pockmarked with other mysterious ancient constructions called kurgans, mounds heaped over a burial chamber. Found across Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Poland, the earliest kurgans appeared in the 4th millennium BC in the Caucasus and are associated with the Indo-Europeans. \n \n Geoglyphs and similar patterns have been discovered across the world, including in Britain, thanks to the introduction of Google Earth. In 2012, a giant elk-shaped geoglyph was discovered near Lake Zjuratkul in the Ural Mountains in Russia. \n \n The Kazakh geoglyphs were presented at the European Association of Archaeologists' annual meeting in Istanbul.", "More than 50 geoglyphs, including one shaped like a swastika, have been discovered in northern Kazakhstan. \n \n More than 50 geoglyphs with various shapes and sizes, including a massive swastika, have been discovered across northern Kazakhstan in Central Asia, say archaeologists. \n \n These sprawling structures, mostly earthen mounds, create the type of landscape art most famously seen in the Nazca region of Peru. \n \n Discovered using Google Earth, the geoglyphs are designed in a variety of geometric shapes, including squares, rings, crosses and swastikas (the swastika is a design that was used in ancient times). Ranging from 90 to 400 meters (295 to 1,312 feet) in diameter, some of them are longer than a modern-day aircraft carrier. Researchers say that the geoglyphs are difficult to see on the ground, but can easily be seen from the sky. [See Photos of the Amazing Geoglyphs in Kazakhstan] \n \n Over the past year, an archaeological expedition from Kazakhstan's Kostanay University, working in collaboration with Vilnius University in Lithuania, has been examining the geoglyphs. The team, which is conducting archaeological excavations, ground-penetrating radar surveys, aerial photography and dating, recently presented its initial results at the European Association of Archaeologists' annual meeting in Istanbul. \n \n The geoglyphs were made of earthen mounds. \n \n Archaeological excavations uncovered the remains of structures and hearths at the geoglyphs, suggesting that rituals took place there, said archaeologists Irina Shevnina and Andrew Logvin, of Kostanay University, in an email to Live Science. Ancient tribes may also have used the geoglyphs to mark ownership of the land, the researchers noted. \n \n \"As of today, we can say only one thing \u2014 the geoglyphs were built by ancient people. By whom and for what purpose, remains a mystery,\" said Shevnina and Logvin. \n \n Why they're builders used geometric shapes is also a mystery, although the swastika is an ancient symbol found throughout Europe and Asia. \n \n Geoglyphs around the world \n \n While Peru's Nazca Lines are the world's most famous geoglyphs, archaeological research suggests that geoglyphs were constructed in numerous areas around the world by different cultures. \n \n For instance, in the Middle East, archaeologists have found thousands of wheel-shaped structures that are easily visible from the sky, but hard to see on the ground. Also recently in Russia, archaeologists excavated a geoglyph shaped like an elk, which appears older than the Nazca Lines. \n \n Ancient geoglyphs have also been reported in many other countries, including the United Kingdom, Brazil and even the Southwestern United States.

Researchers believe that they date back to antiquity, at least 2,000 years ago. They are often found on lava fields and range from 82 feet to 230 feet (25 meters to 70 meters) across. [See gallery of wheel structures] \n \n \"In Jordan alone we've got stone-built structures that are far more numerous than (the) Nazca Lines, far more extensive in the area that they cover, and far older,\" said David Kennedy, a professor of classics and ancient history at the University of Western Australia. \n \n Kennedy's new research, which will be published in a forthcoming issue of the Journal of Archaeological Science, reveals that these wheels form part of a variety of stone landscapes. These include kites (stone structures used for funnelling and killing animals); pendants (lines of stone cairns that run from burials); and walls, mysterious structures that meander across the landscape for up to several hundred feet and have no apparent practical use. \n \n His team's studies are part of a long-term aerial reconnaissance project that is looking at archaeological sites across Jordan. As of now, Kennedy and his colleagues are puzzled as to what the structures may have been used for or what meaning they held. [History's Most Overlooked Mysteries] \n \n Fascinating structures \n \n Kennedy's main area of expertise is in Roman archaeology, but he became fascinated by these structures when, as a student, he read accounts of Royal Air Force pilots flying over them in the 1920s on airmail routes across Jordan. \"You can't not be fascinated by these things,\" Kennedy said. \n \n Indeed, in 1927 RAF Flight Lt. Percy Maitland published an account of the ruins in the journal Antiquity. He reported encountering them over \"lava country\" and said that they, along with the other stone structures, are known to the Bedouin as the \"works of the old men.\" \n \n Kennedy and his team have been studying the structures using aerial photography and Google Earth, as the wheels are hard to pick up from the ground, Kennedy said. \n \n \"Sometimes when you're actually there on the site you can make out something of a pattern but not very easily,\" he said. \"Whereas if you go up just a hundred feet or so it, for me, comes sharply into focus what the shape is.\" \n \n The designs must have been clearer when they were originally built. \"People have probably walked over them, walked past them, for centuries, millennia, without having any clear idea what the shape was.\" \n \n (The team has created an archive of images of the wheels from various sites in the Middle East.) \n \n What were they used for? \n \n So far, none of the wheels appears to have been excavated, something that makes dating them, and finding out their purpose, more difficult. Archaeologists studying them in the pre-Google Earth era speculated that they could be the remains of houses or cemeteries. Kennedy said that neither of these explanations seems to work out well. \n \n \"There seems to be some overarching cultural continuum in this area in which people felt there was a need to build structures that were circular.\" \n \n Some of the wheels are found in isolation while others are clustered together. At one location, near the Azraq Oasis, hundreds of them can be found clustered into a dozen groups. \"Some of these collections around Azraq are really quite remarkable,\" Kennedy said. \n \n In Saudi Arabia, Kennedy's team has found wheel styles that are quite different: Some are rectangular and are not wheels at all; others are circular but contain two spokes forming a bar often aligned in the same direction that the sun rises and sets in the Middle East. \n \n The ones in Jordan and Syria, on the other hand, have numerous spokes and do not seem to be aligned with any astronomical phenomena. \"On looking at large numbers of these, over a number of years, I wasn't struck by any pattern in the way in which the spokes were laid out,\" Kennedy said. \n \n Cairns are often found associated with the wheels. Sometimes they circle the perimeter of the wheel, other times they are in among the spokes. In Saudi Arabia some of the cairns look, from the air, like they are associated with ancient burials. \n \n Dating the wheels is difficult, since they appear to be prehistoric, but could date to as recently as 2,000 years ago.

Geoglyphs are large designs on the ground, usually created out of mounds of dirt and other natural elements, that can be seen from above. Scientists from Kostanay University, who made their announcement about the structures at an archaeology meeting in Istanbul, say the geoglyphs range in size from 295 feet to 1,312 feet in diameter and come in the shape of squares, circles, crosses\u2014and even a giant swastika, LiveScience reports.

Geoglyphs like these that resemble Peru's famous Nazca Lines have been found all over the world, including giant \"wheels\" in the Middle East and an elk-like structure in Russia.

Robert Bales, named as the suspect who allegedly went on a rampage, killing 16 Afghan civilians, was remembered by his neighbors in Lake Tapp, Wash., as a family man and \"good guy,\" but news of a criminal record has surfaced and his wife's blog posts reveal a man frustrated with not being promoted. \n \n Between the 38-year-old's deployments, he had scattered trouble at home, including a criminal record that includes a misdemeanor arrest for assaulting a girlfriend in 2002 that led to 20 hours of court-ordered anger management, and a report of a drunk driving arrest in 2005 for which he wasn't charged. \n \n His record also includes a hit-and-run in 2008. Witnesses saw a bleeding man in a military-style uniform with a shaved head running into the woods, where the police found him. Bales said he fell asleep at the wheel, and paid about $1,000 in fines and restitution, according to The Associated Press. The case was dismissed. \n \n Bales' wife, Karilyn Bales, a public relations and marketing manager, wrote on her blog in March of last year that her husband was very disappointed about not getting promoted to E-7, sergeant first class. \n \n \"Bob didn't get a promotion and is very disappointed, after all the sacrifices he has made for his love of country. But I am also relieved. We can finally move on to the next phase of our lives,\" she wrote. \n \n The Bales' house was recently listed for sale, and his wife wrote that they hope to move closer to family in the Midwest. \n \n He Was 'One of the Best Soldiers I Ever Worked With' \n \n Neighbors painted a picture of the career soldier as a family man who spoke little about his deployments. \n \n \"I just can't believe Bob's the guy who did this,\" neighbor Paul Wohlberg told the Associated Press. \"A good guy got put in the wrong place at the wrong time.\" \n \n Kassie Holland, a neighbor, told the Associated Press that she would see Bales playing with his daughter Quincy, 4, and son Bobby, 3. \n \n \"My reaction is that I'm shocked,\" she said. \"I can't believe it was him. There were no signs. ... He always had a good attitude about being in the service. He was never really angry about it. When I heard him talk, he said, it seemed like, 'Yeah, that's my job. That's what I do.' He never expressed a lot of emotion toward it.\" \n \n Bales' platoon leader in Iraq described him to the Washington Post as an exemplary soldier who \"saved many a life.\" \n \n \"Bales is still, hands down, one of the best soldiers I ever worked with,\" Army Capt. Chris Alexander , 28, told the newspaper. \n \n Bales remains locked up today in Fort Leavenworth, Kan., where he is being housed in a private cell away from other inmates. \n \n Charges are expected soon against the career soldier, who was flown out of Afghanistan and arrived at the Army prison Friday night. \n \n Bales is accused of breaking into several Afghan homes in the middle of the night last Sunday and killing 16 civilians, mostly women and children. He could face the death penalty if found guilty. \n \n Pentagon officials said that Bales' being brought back to the U.S. does not necessarily mean that his military court proceedings will be held in the U.S., holding out the possibility that they could be held in Afghanistan. The Afghan government is demanding that Bales be tried in Afghanistan. \n \n Details of Bales' military record have also emerged and they depict a soldier who has seen intense combat and lost part of a foot. \n \n Bales, who enlisted shortly after the 9/11 terror attacks, was first deployed in November 2003 when his unit spent a year in Mosul, Iraq. \n \n In June 2006, he and his unit were sent back to Iraq and their year-long deployment was given a three-month extension until September 2007. During that time, he saw duty in Mosul in the north, Bagdad when the city was pressed by militants, and then Baquba, where his unit took major casualties. \n \n His final Iraq deployment was from September 2009 to September 2010 in Diyala province, which was also a hotbed of insurgent activity. \n \n In December 2011, he was ordered to Afghanistan. \n \n Bales' alleged murderous rage stood in stark contrast to what he said after a fierce battle in Zarqa, Iraq, in 2007. \n \n \"I've never been more proud to be a part of this unit than that day for the simple fact that we discriminated between the bad guys and the noncombatants and then, afterward, we ended up helping the people that three or four hours before were trying to kill us,\" he told Fort Lewis' Northwest Guardian. \n \n \"I think that's the real difference between being an American as opposed to being a bad guy, someone who puts his family in harm's way like that,\" Bales said at the time. \n \n John Henry Browne, Bales' lawyer in Seattle, told The Associated Press Thursday that the soldier had witnessed his friend's leg blown off the day before the massacre. \n \n Bales reportedly spent his entire 11-year career at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state and lived not too far from the base. Originally from the Midwest, he was deployed with the Second Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division in December. \n \n Browne said that he was highly decorated and had once been nominated for a Bronze Star though he did not receive it. He also lost part of a foot because of a combat injury. \n \n \"He's never said anything antagonistic about Muslims. He's in general very mild-mannered,\" Browne told the AP. \n \n Bales reportedly left Camp Belambay -- where he was stationed to protect Special Operation Forces creating local militias -- in the middle of the night, wearing night-vision goggles, according to a source. The shooting occurred at 3 a.m. in three houses in two villages in the Panjway district of southern Kandahar province. \n \n In the first village, more than a mile south of the base, he allegedly killed four people in the first house. In the second house, he allegedly killed 11 family members -- four girls, four boys and three adults. \n \n According to a member of the Afghan investigation team and ABC News' interviews, he then walked back to another village past his base and killed one more person. He reportedly returned to the base on his own and turned himself in calmly. \n \n An official told ABC News that the soldier had suffered a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the past, either from hitting his head on the hatch of a vehicle or in a car accident. He reportedly went through the advanced TBI treatment at Fort Lewis and was deemed to be fine. \n \n He also underwent mental health screening necessary to become a sniper and passed in 2008. He had routine behavioral health screening after that and was cleared, the official said. \n \n When the soldier returned from his last deployment in Iraq he had difficulty reintegrating, including marital problems, the source told ABC News. But officials concluded that he had worked through those issues before deploying to Afghanistan. \n \n On Thursday, Browne said that Bales' marriage was \"fabulous.\" \n \n Afghan political leaders have called for Bales to be tried publicly in Afghan courts, but U.S. military officials said the case will be handled in U.S. military courts. A U.S. military official said Afghan officials were made aware of Bales' transfer out of Afghanistan before it occurred. \n \n The Associated Press contributed to this story.", "Washington state court records describe a 2008 hit-and-run accident involving the U.S. soldier now accused of killing 16 civilians in Afghanistan. \n \n According to Pierce County Municipal Court documents, Robert Bales was cited in a single-vehicle rollover in the early morning of Oct. 11, 2008. It isn't clear what Bales hit, but the report refers to damaged property. \n \n Witnesses saw a man in a military-style uniform, with a shaved head and bleeding, running away. \n \n Deputies found him in the woods, and Bales told them he fell asleep at the wheel. \n \n Bales paid nearly $800 in fines and court costs in monthly increments of $56. He paid $180 restitution, and the case was dismissed in October 2009.", "Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A Taliban commander expressed skepticism that one soldier carried out a massacre last week that left 16 Afghan civilians dead, and anger that the suspect subsequently was flown out of Afghanistan. \n \n \"We don't think that one American was involved,\" the Taliban official told CNN, refusing to give his name or be otherwise identified. \"The foreigners and the puppet regime (in Afghanistan) are blind to the truth of what happened here. \n \n \"But if this was the act of one soldier, we want this soldier to be prosecuted in Afghanistan, and according to Islamic law. The Afghans should prosecute him.\" \n \n Stunned friends recall suspect's good deeds \n \n The commander also explained that the Islamic fundamentalist group had halted talks with U.S. officials. It had set up an office in Qatar on January 3 to reach \"an understanding with the international community\" and discuss specific issues with American officials. \n \n In a statement Thursday, the Taliban said work from their Qatar office was being suspended, a decision made due to what the group called U.S. officials' \"alternating and ever-changing position.\" Preliminary talks had already begun over the exchange of prisoners, the Taliban said. \n \n The Taliban commander said the burning of Qurans in February by U.S. troops and issues surrounding the U.S. possibly transferring five Taliban members from the U.S. prison facility in Guantanamo Bay to Qatar were the main reasons for the decision. \n \n \"The peace talks with the Americans were limited to discuss the prisoner deal. And those promises were not kept by the Americans,\" he said. \n \n The Taliban official had harsh words for the U.S. regarding the March 11 rampage in two villages in the district of Panjwai in Kandahar province, though he did not tie that directly with the group's decision to suspend talks. \n \n A resident of one of the villages, Ali Ahmed, described to CNN how what he and some others claimed were multiple attackers had come into a home before dawn that morning, asked his uncle where the Taliban were and then shot him dead. \n \n \"Finally, they came to this room and martyred all the children,\" Ahmed said from the home, claiming a 2-month-old child was among the nine children killed. Later, he said some of the dead were piled in a room and set on fire. \n \n U.S. officials have said that one man, Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, left his outpost and singlehandedly carried out the massacre in two villages. \n \n He is currently at the U.S. military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, pending trial, having flown back to the United States last week. \n \n The incident, as well as the fact the suspect isn't set to be tried in Afghanistan where the crime occurred, has infuriated many Afghans and heightened tensions between that nation and the United States. \n \n After the shooting spree, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said that relations between the two countries were at the \"end of the rope.\" The incident came weeks after U.S. troops burned Qurans at a coalition base in Afghanistan, sparking outrage and fierce protests across the central Asian nation. \n \n Yet Afghanistan's ambassador to the United States insisted Sunday that his nation trusts the U.S. investigation into the rampage. \n \n \"We do trust the United States and we do know how important this relationship is, and we are working as a partner to resolve all the issues as a partner,\" Ambassador Eklil Hakimi told CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday. \n \n Hakimi said both the shooting rampage and Quran burning are tragic, but he acknowledged they come after more than 10 years of a U.S. presence in his country that has claimed the lives of more than 1,700 U.S. troops, according to the official U.S. military count. \n \n \"We do understand sacrifices that our allies, especially our main allies, the United States -- that they have suffered quite a lot, those men in uniform, those women in uniform,\" Hakimi said. \"Those are the things that we are grateful (for) and we are appreciating that.\" \n \n U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta promised Karzai a full investigation and said the United States will bring the shooter to justice. \n \n \"He accepted that and hoped that it could be a transparent process so that the Afghanistan people would see that the U.S. is indeed going to not only prosecute this individual but ensure he's held accountable,\" Panetta said after meeting Karzai on Wednesday. \n \n \"I also indicated to him that we take these kinds of incidents seriously. We need to look at just exactly was involved here that caused this terrible crime,\" Panetta said. \"Was it related to combat stress? Other factors? We need to pay attention to those so it won't happen again.\" \n \n The shooting prompted Karzai to demand that foreign troops pull back from their outposts in Afghan villages and confine themselves to military bases. In his meeting with Panetta, Karzai also demanded that the transfer of security responsibilities from Washington to Kabul be accelerated. \n \n Family friends who knew Bales, the shooting spree suspect, growing up in the Cincinnati suburb of Norwood, Ohio, described him as \"quiet\" and \"very nice.\" The Army said that he enlisted in the military two months after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. \n \n Bales went on to serve four combat tours, the last one to Afghanistan beginning in January. And in between them, he settled down with his wife and their two young children near Joint Base Lewis-McChord outside Tacoma, Washington. \n \n The family owned a townhouse in a modest, middle-class neighborhood in Auburn, about 30 minutes from the base, before purchasing a house in 2006 for $280,000 near Lake Tapps, according to realty records. \n \n Tim Burgess, whose Auburn townhouse shared a wall with that of the Bales family, on Sunday described his former neighbor as \"a really good guy (who) just wanted to serve.\" \n \n \"I know he just wanted to go back and serve overseas, that was his goal,\" Burgess recalled from their conversations, while noting the two hadn't spoken in about five years. \n \n Robert Baggett, president of the Riverpark Homeowners Association, said Sunday that -- after the Bales family moved to Lake Tapps -- there were occasionally renters in the residence. \n \n But several years ago, their townhouse was foreclosed upon, according to Baggett and Burgess. The Bales also didn't pay homeowners association fees for \"at least three or four years,\" said Baggett. \n \n \"We don't know what happened,\" Baggett said of the Bales and their Auburn property, which Sunday had a notice that read \"Do Not Occupy\" on its front door. \n \n One of Bales' lawyers, John Henry Browne, said upon arriving at the Kansas City, Missouri, airport -- where he'd come so he can drive to meet with his client -- that all the reports surrounding Bales have been a \"shock\" to those who know him as a \"very mild mannered person and a great person.\" \n \n Browne added that the entire situation was unique and challenging. \n \n \"You couldn't imagine a more difficult case, I don't think,\" the lawyer said. \"This case has political ramifications, it has legal ramifications, it has social ramifications.\" \n \n CNN's Sara Sidner in Kabul, Afghanistan, and Paul Vercammen in Auburn, Washington, contributed to this report.", "With formal charges looming against his client within days, the lawyer for an Army sergeant suspected in the horrific nighttime slaughter of 16 Afghan villagers flew to Kansas and was preparing for his first face-to-face meeting with the 10-year veteran. \n \n A white van, believed to be transporting Staff Sgt.

(Associated Press) \n \n John Henry Browne of Seattle said he planned to meet Monday with Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, who is being held in an isolated cell at Fort Leavenworth's military prison. \n \n Bales, 38, hasn't been charged in the March 11 shootings, which have endangered relations between the U.S. and Afghanistan and threaten to upend U.S. policy over the decade-old war. But formal charges are expected to be filed within a week and if the case goes to court the trial will be held in the United States, said a legal expert with the U.S. military familiar with the investigation. \n \n That expert said charges were still being decided and that the location for any trial had not yet been determined. If the suspect is brought to trial, it is possible that Afghan witnesses and victims would be flown to the United States to participate, he said. \n \n Military lawyers say once attorneys involved in the initial investigation of an alleged crime involving a service member have what they believe to be a solid understanding of what happened and are satisfied with the evidence collected, they draft charges and present them to a commander. That person then makes a judgment on whether there is probable cause to believe that an offense was committed and that the accused committed it. \n \n That commander then \"prefers\" the charges to a convening authority, who typically is the commander of the brigade to which the accused is assigned but could be of higher rank. \n \n Bales' defense team said in a statement late Saturday that \"it is too early to determine what factors may have played into this incident and the defense team looks forward to reviewing the evidence, examining all of Sergeant Bales' medical and personnel records, and interviewing witnesses.\" \n \n The lawyers' statement also said Bales' family was \"stunned in the face of this tragedy, but they stand behind the man they know as a devoted husband, father and dedicated member of the armed services.\" \n \n Military officials have said that Bales, after drinking on a southern Afghanistan base, crept away March 11 to two slumbering villages overnight, shooting his victims and setting many of them on fire. Nine of the 16 killed were children and 11 belonged to one family. \n \n Court records and interviews in recent days have revealed that Bales had a string of commendations for good conduct after four tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. But he also faced a number of troubles in recent years: a Florida investment job went sour, his Seattle-area home was condemned as he struggled to make payments on another, and he failed to get a recent promotion. \n \n Legal troubles included charges that he assaulted a girlfriend and, in a hit-and run accident, ran bleeding in military clothes into the woods, court records show. He told police he fell asleep at the wheel and paid a fine to get the charges dismissed, the records show. \n \n Rebecca Steed, spokeswoman at Fort Leavenworth, said Bales would be able to meet with Browne in what is described as a privileged visit. Along with medical visits, such meetings are generally more private than others conducted in the prison. \n \n Browne, 65, has represented clients ranging from serial killer Ted Bundy to Colton Harris-Moore, known as the \"Barefoot Bandit.\" He has said he has handled only three or four military cases. Bales will also have at least one military lawyer. \n \n Tall and stylish, Browne has been a prominent figure in Washington state legal circles since the 1970s, known equally for his zeal in representing his clients and his flair before television cameras. \n \n _____ \n \n Also contributing were Associated Press writers Manuel Valdes in Seattle, John Milburn in Topeka, Kan., and Deb Riechmann in Kabul, Afghanistan.", "Pentagon officials on Friday identified the soldier who allegedly killed 16 Afghan villagers as Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, a trained Army sniper who had served three tours in Iraq and suffered war wounds. \n \n Bales, a 38-year-old married father of two who enlisted in the months after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, was flown Friday to a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., to await possible criminal charges, according to a U.S. Army statement. \n \n Bales is accused of leaving his base in the Panjwai district of Kandahar province; shooting 16 people, including nine children; and attempting to burn their bodies before returning to the base and turning himself in. He could face the death penalty, military officials have said. \n \n The incident has sparked significant backlash in Afghanistan, straining already difficult relations with the United States over conduct of the war there. \n \n The suspect\u2019s name had been a closely kept secret since he allegedly surrendered to authorities after the shootings on Sunday morning. Officials confirmed his name after news organizations began reporting it Friday evening. \n \n Bales\u2019s attorney, John Henry Browne, has said that Bales did not want to deploy to Afghanistan in December, had experienced post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his deployments and had suffered a head injury during a deployment in Iraq. Bales also had seen one of his fellow soldiers lose his leg in an explosion hours before he allegedly went on a rampage, Browne told reporters. \n \n Army Capt. Chris Alexander, 28, who was Bales\u2019s platoon leader during a deployment in Iraq, said in an interview Friday night that he \u201csaved many a life\u201d by never letting his guard down during patrols. \n \n \u201cBales is still, hands down, one of the best soldiers I ever worked with,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cThere has to be very severe [post-traumatic stress disorder] involved in this. I just don\u2019t want him seen as some psychopath, because he is not.\u201d \n \n Bales, a member of the 3rd (Stryker) Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, lived with his wife and young children in Lake Tapps, Wash., about a 20-minute drive east of Joint Base Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma. He attended high school in a Cleveland suburb but spent the past several years in Washington or on military deployments overseas. \n \n His family was moved onto the base in recent days for their protection, officials have said. \n \n The neighborhood where Bales lived includes many military families, according to neighbors. The family lived in a two-story beige house with a cedar-shake roof and a small front porch. \n \n In 2007, Bales was part of a long, bloody battle in southern Iraq in which 250 enemy fighters were killed and 81 were wounded while members of Bales\u2019s unit suffered no casualties, according to an Army account that described the battle as \u201capocalyptic.\u201d \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve never been more proud to be a part of this unit than that day,\u201d Bales was quoted as saying. \u201cWe discriminated between the bad guys and the noncombatants and then afterward we ended up helping the people that three or four hours before were trying to kill us. I think that\u2019s the real difference between being an American as opposed to being a bad guy, someone who puts his family in harm\u2019s way like that.\u201d \n \n Bales said of the battle that \u201cthe cool part about this was World War II-style. You dug in. Guys were out there digging a fighting position in the ground.\u201d \n \n He also described an intense firefight as his unit tried to secure a downed helicopter: \u201cIt was like a match lit up. It looked like a toy with a candle lit underneath it.\u201d \n \n He received more than a dozen medals and badges for his service overseas and for good conduct, according to the Army statement. But in her blog last year, his wife, Karilyn, said he was disappointed that he was not promoted to sergeant first class. \n \n In a post dated March 25, she noted \u201call of the work Bob has done and all the sacrifices he has made for his love of his country, family and friends.\u201d \n \n \u201cI am sad and disappointed too,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut I am also relieved, we can finally move on to the next phase of our lives.\u201d \n \n That meant a different duty station, hopefully in Germany, Italy or Hawaii, she wrote. \n \n In previous blog posts she wrote of how difficult it was for her while Bales was deployed during the pregnancy of her first child but how excited he was to learn that their first born was going to be a girl. \u201cOur baby girl will most definitely be Daddy\u2019s Little Girl!\u201d she wrote. \n \n Government officials, in some news reports, have said Bales may have been drinking on the night of the shootings and was agitated by marital problems at home. Browne disputed that, saying the reports were \u201cvery offensive.\u201d The couple had financial problems but nothing severe, he said, adding that they had \u201ca very strong marriage.\u201d \n \n Family members of Bales could not be reached for comment Friday night. \n \n While living outside Tacoma, Bales had brushes with the law, according to court records and news accounts. In 2002, he was charged with misdemeanor criminal assault, according to the Tacoma News Tribune. The charge was dismissed after he paid a $300 fine and completed an anger management assessment, the newspaper reported. \n \n Then in 2008, witnesses told police they saw him running from a single-car rollover, the newspaper reported. \n \n Witnesses told the News Tribune they saw a \u201cwhite man wearing military style uniform, shaved head and bleeding\u201d running into the woods. Bales later told a police officer that he had fallen asleep while driving. Bales received a 12-month deferred sentence and paid a fine of $250 and the charges were dismissed, according to the report. \n \n With limited facts about the motive in Sunday\u2019s shooting, some veterans groups and mental health advocates fear that the image being stitched together from the loose assemblage of facts is of a crazy veteran gone wild. \n \n \u201cThe main concern is that we\u2019ll be back where we started with a stigma that all veterans that return are broken in some way,\u201d said Ryan Gallucci, deputy director of national legislative service for the Veterans of Foreign Wars. \n \n On Friday, Gen. David M. Rodriguez, commander of the U.S. Army Forces Command, which is in charge of training and equipping soldiers for war, said the Army has done a \u201cvery, very good job of sustaining\u201d troops through multiple combat deployments.\u201d He said the decision of whether to send soldiers on multiple deployments are made \u201con a case-by-case basis.\u201d \n \n \u201cThere is not a cookie-cutter solution or rule that says this guy can handle two or three [tours],\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about taking care of soldiers.\u201d \n \n Some fear that the stereotype of veterans as unstable at best and violent at worst will be resurrected. Many veterans spoke out against a headline about the shootings in the New York Daily News this week that read, \u201cSergeant Psycho.\u201d \n \n Tom Tarantino, the deputy policy director at Iraq and Afghanistan of America, said that without the facts, \u201cyou have this wired mind-set in the public consciousness and immediately everyone goes to the \u2018Sergeant Psycho\u2019 thing.\u201d \n \n Many veterans advocates have dismissed simple theories about what set off the killings. \n \n \u201cThere are plenty of service members with stress and trauma who are drinking and self-medicating every day to deal with their conditions, and they don\u2019t go out and gun down a bunch of women and children,\u201d said Josh Renschler, the director of Men of Valor, a service member support group. \n \n He argued that while bouts of rage can be caused by traumatic brain injuries or post-traumatic stress disorder, they alone are not sufficient to explain killing of this magnitude. \n \n Jonathan Shay, a clinical psychiatrist and author who was awarded a MacArthur \u201cgenius grant\u201d for his work with veterans, wondered about the soldier\u2019s relationship with the Special Operations forces \u2014 which can be very standoffish to outsiders \u2014 that he was attached to at a remote outpost in Afghanistan. \u201cTo me this is a presumptive case of leadership failure,\u201d he said. \u201cWhoever was directly responsible for this soldier did not do his job in the sense of getting to know him.\u201d \n \n Flaherty reported from Tacoma. Staff writers Craig Whitlock, Peter Finn and William Branigin, staff researchers Julie Tate, Lucy Shackleford and Madonna Leibling, and research editor Alice Crites contributed to this report."], "summary": "\u2013 Taliban leaders are insisting that US Staff Sergeant Robert Bales didn't act alone when he allegedly massacred 16 Afghan civilians as they slept. \"We don't think that one American was involved,\" a Taliban official told CNN, without offering further details. \"The foreigners and the puppet regime\" in Afghanistan \"are blind to the truth of what happened here.\" But whatever the case, Bales should be \"prosecuted in Afghanistan, and according to Islamic law,\" he added. \"The Afghans should prosecute him.\" The comments followed a move by the Taliban last week to cut off talks with the US because of American officials' \"ever-changing position,\" said a spokesman. Meanwhile, more details continue to emerge about Bales, including his and his family's difficulty with repeated war tour deployments, and an arrest record that includes an assault on a girlfriend, and a hit-and-run in 2008.

A new... (Associated Press) \n \n Most of the 370,000 children in Fukushima prefecture (state) have been given ultrasound checkups since the March 2011 meltdowns at the tsunami-ravaged Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant. The most recent statistics, released in August, show that thyroid cancer is suspected or confirmed in 137 of those children, a number that rose by 25 from a year earlier. Elsewhere, the disease occurs in only about one or two of every million children per year by some estimates. \n \n \"This is more than expected and emerging faster than expected,\" lead author Toshihide Tsuda told The Associated Press during a visit to Tokyo. \"This is 20 times to 50 times what would be normally expected.\" \n \n The study was released online this week and is being published in the November issue of Epidemiology, produced by the Herndon, Virginia-based International Society for Environmental Epidemiology. The data comes from tests overseen by Fukushima Medical University. \n \n Making sense of the relationship between radiation and cancer is precarious: It's scientifically impossible to link an individual cancer case to radiation. Looking harder with routine check-ups, like the one in Fukushima, leads to quicker discovery of tumors, inflating the tallies in a so-called \"screening effect.\" \n \n Right after the disaster, the lead doctor brought in to Fukushima, Shunichi Yamashita, repeatedly ruled out the possibility of radiation-induced illnesses. The thyroid checks were being ordered just to play it safe, according to the government. \n \n But Tsuda, a professor at Okayama University, said the latest results from the ultrasound checkups, which continue to be conducted, raise doubts about the government's view. \n \n Thyroid cancer among children is one sickness the medical world has definitively linked to radiation after the 1986 Chernobyl catastrophe. If treated, it is rarely fatal, and early detection is a plus, but patients are on medication for the rest of their lives. \n \n Scientists are divided on Tsuda's conclusions. \n \n In the same Epidemiology issue, Scott Davis, professor at the Department of Epidemiology in the Seattle-based School of Public Health, said the key limitation of Tsuda's study is the lack of individual-level data to estimate actual radiation doses. \n \n Davis agreed with the findings of the World Health Organization and UNSCEAR, or the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, both of which have carried out reviews on Fukushima and predicted cancer rates will remain stable, with no rises being discernable as radiation-caused. \n \n David J. Brenner, professor of radiation biophysics at Columbia University Medical Center, took a different view. While he agreed individual estimates on radiation doses are needed, he said in a telephone interview that the higher thyroid cancer rate in Fukushima is \"not due to screening. It's real.\" \n \n Conclusions about any connection between Fukushima radiation and cancer will help determine compensation and other policies. Many people who live in areas deemed safe by the government have fled fearing sickness, especially for their children. \n \n An area extending about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the nuclear plant has been declared an exclusion zone. The borders are constantly being remapped as cleanup of radiated debris and soil continues in an effort to bring as many people back as possible. Decommissioning the plant is expected to take decades. \n \n Noriko Matsumoto, 53, who used to work as a nurse in Koriyama, Fukushima, outside the no-go zone, fled to Tokyo with her then-11-year-old daughter a few months after the disaster. She had initially shrugged off the fears but got worried when her daughter started getting nosebleeds and rashes. \n \n \"My daughter has the right to live free of radiation,\" she said. \"We can never be sure about blaming radiation. But I personally feel radiation is behind sicknesses.\" \n \n Andrew F. Olshan, professor at the Department of Epidemiology at the University of North Carolina, in Chapel Hill, noted that research on what follows a catastrophe is complex and difficult. \n \n \"Dr. Tsuda's study had limitations including assessment of individual radiation dose levels to the thyroid and the ability to fully assess the impact of screening on the excess cases detected,\" he said. \n \n \"Nonetheless, this study is critical to initiate additional investigations of possible health effects, for governmental planning, and increasing public awareness.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Yuri Kageyama: http://twitter.com/yurikageyama", "Background: After the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami in March 2011, radioactive elements were released from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Based on prior knowledge, concern emerged about whether an increased incidence of thyroid cancer among exposed residents would occur as a result. \n \n Methods: After the release, Fukushima Prefecture performed ultrasound thyroid screening on all residents ages <=18 years. The first round of screening included 298,577 examinees, and a second round began in April 2014. We analyzed the prefecture results from the first and second round up to December 31, 2014, in comparison with the Japanese annual incidence and the incidence within a reference area in Fukushima Prefecture. \n \n Results: The highest incidence rate ratio, using a latency period of 4 years, was observed in the central middle district of the prefecture compared with the Japanese annual incidence (incidence rate ratio = 50; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 25, 90). The prevalence of thyroid cancer was 605 per million examinees (95% CI = 302, 1,082) and the prevalence odds ratio compared with the reference district in Fukushima Prefecture was 2.6 (95% CI = 0.99, 7.0). In the second screening round, even under the assumption that the rest of examinees were disease free, an incidence rate ratio of 12 has already been observed (95% CI = 5.1, 23). \n \n Conclusions: An excess of thyroid cancer has been detected by ultrasound among children and adolescents in Fukushima Prefecture within 4 years of the release, and is unlikely to be explained by a screening surge. \n \n This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

Fukushima Medical University took the lead in \n \n planning and implementing this survey. The primary purposes of this survey are to monitor the long-term health of \n \n residents, promote their future well-being, and confirm whether long-term low-dose radiation exposure has health \n \n effects. \n \n Survey population \n \n The Fukushima Health Management Survey consists of a basic survey and 4 detailed surveys, namely, the thyroid ultrasound examination, comprehensive health check, mental health and lifestyle survey, and pregnancy and birth survey. The target population of the basic survey is about 2.05 million. To be selected for the basic survey, individuals had to be either a registered resident of Fukushima Prefecture during the period of 11 March to 1 July (including those evacuated or transferred to residence registration in another prefecture); a resident of Fukushima Prefecture who was registered in another prefecture during the period of 11 March to 1 July; a resident of another prefecture who commuted to Fukushima Prefecture during the period of 11 March to 1 July; or a resident of another prefecture who temporarily stayed in Fukushima Prefecture during the period of 11 March to 25 March. The detailed surveys targeted selected people on the basis of the particular criteria used for each survey. \n \n External exposure dose, as indicated on the basic survey, and information from the detailed surveys will be linked and maintained in the database for later analysis. \n \n Basic Survey \n \n The Basic Survey is a questionnaire targeting roughly 2,050,000 residents of and visitors to Fukushima Prefecture as of 11 March 2011. Estimated external radiation doses were calculated based on recorded movements of respondents in the four months following the nuclear accident. \n \n Detailed Surveys \n \n Thyroid Ultrasound Examination: The examination covers roughly 360,000 residents aged 0 to 18 years at the time of the nuclear accident. The initial screening is to be performed within the first three years after the accident, followed by complete thyroid examinations from 2014 onwards, and the residents will be monitored regularly thereafter. \n \n Comprehensive Health Check: The program aims at early detection and treatment of diseases as well as prevention of lifestyle-related diseases. Its main target includes 210,000 former residents of evacuation zones whose lifestyle changed drastically after the accident. Additional tests such as differential leukocyte count are performed apart from the routine tests included in the general medical check-up at the workplace or by the local government. \n \n Mental Health and Lifestyle Survey: The survey aims to provide adequate care mainly for evacuees who are at a higher risk of developing mental health problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and stress. \n \n Pregnancy and Birth Survey: The survey aids in providing appropriate medical care and support to mothers who were given a Maternal and Child Health Handbook between 1 August 2010 and 31 July 2011 and to their children.", "Fukushima Study Links Children's Cancer To Nuclear Accident \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Chris Meyers/Reuters/Landov Chris Meyers/Reuters/Landov \n \n Updated at 3:40 p.m. ET \n \n A new analysis of data from Fukushima suggests children exposed to the March 2011 nuclear accident may be developing thyroid cancer at an elevated rate. \n \n But independent experts say that the study, published in the journal Epidemiology, has numerous shortcomings and does not prove a link between the accident and cancer. \n \n The work, led by Toshihide Tsuda of Okayama University, is based on a large public health survey that was set up in Japan's Fukushima prefecture following the accident. As part of the survey, children who were living near the plant at the time of the accident have been offered regular thyroid screenings. \n \n Thyroid cancer can be caused by radioactive iodine released in a nuclear accident. Children are particularly susceptible because their thyroids are growing rapidly. Thyroid cancer was listed as a possible health risk in a World Health Organization report on Fukushima, though the report stated it would be difficult to link cancer cases to the accident. \n \n In the past year or so, the Fukushima Health Survey of more than 150,000 children has turned up 25 \"suspicious or malignant cases\" of thyroid cancer. Thyroid screenings in previous years have also found numerous cases. \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Wally Santana/AP Wally Santana/AP \n \n Japanese officials believe the screening process itself may be behind the numbers. Increased vigilance might be turning up thyroid abnormalities that otherwise would have gone undetected. \n \n But the new paper contradicts that view. The increase in cancer is \"unlikely to be caused by a screening surge,\" the paper says. It says thyroid cancer rates are highly elevated throughout Fukushima. \n \n Other researchers are skeptical of the new result. Geraldine Thomas, a professor at Imperial College who has studied thyroid cancer from Chernobyl, says the analysis incorrectly compares the screening in Fukushima to clinical cases of thyroid cancer in which patients are already sick. The comparison falsely suggests thyroid cancer in Fukushima is elevated by as much as 50 times compared with the general population. \"This is not a very good paper to be basing opinions on,\" she says. \n \n More accurate comparisons between residents within different parts of Fukushima prefecture show no statistically significant variations in cancer rates, she says. \n \n David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University, adds that the study makes no effort to trace the exposure of patients. \"It's simply relating geographic regions to cancer risks and not looking at individual radiation doses,\" he says, adding that without that information, it's virtually impossible to connect the screenings to the accident. \n \n \"It really doesn't tell us the whole story,\" he says."], "summary": "\u2013 For four years, nearly all kids living in Japan's Fukushima prefecture have received ultrasounds to gauge the effects of the nuclear disaster there in March 2011. Now a research team says the alarming results are in: Children living near the nuclear plant have thyroid cancer rates that are 20 to 50 times higher than those found in children elsewhere, the AP reports. Per a study being published in the November issue of Epidemiology, of the 370,000 or so kids 18 and under in the Fukushima region who received thyroid exams since the disaster, 137 of them have suspected or confirmed cases of thyroid cancer, a number that rose by 25 from last year, the AP notes. \"This is more than expected and emerging faster than expected,\" lead author Toshihide Tsuda tells the AP.

Tsuda and his team claim that the numbers aren't simply the result of a \"screening effect\"\u2014in which more routine checkups like the ones in Fukushima have simply found tumors earlier and more often\u2014as the Japanese government has suggested. Other experts, however, aren't so sure how accurate Tsuda's study is and note the complexity of studying such an issue. The director for Columbia University's Center for Radiological Research, for example, tells NPR that just tying certain geographic areas to higher cancer rates doesn't prove anything without looking at individual radiation exposure, a claim that's echoed in a report by the World Health Organization.(The residents of the Japanese town of Nahara are finally allowed back\u2014but many don't want to go.)", "ranking": [1, 4, 2, 3, 0]}

British digger maker JCB announced it would send heavy machinery and generators to help clear up the debris that still lines the streets. \n \n Despite the arrival of aid and a concerted effort by the military to restore order to the town, thousands of stricken residents still crammed the crumbling airport desperate for a way out of the city that has borne the brunt of the storm and its aftermath. \n \n On Wednesday night the Tacloban mayor, Alfred Romualdez, led a mass burial in a graveyard just outside the city. Officials said every effort had been made to ensure those buried could be identified in the weeks to come. \n \n The official death toll of 2,357 is a considerably lower figure than that estimated by aid workers, who say the lack of information coming from various areas \u2013 some 29 municipalities in all are affected \u2013 could mean that the devastation is far greater than yet realised. Most casualties seem to have been around the islands of Samar and Leyte, where the storm first made landfall at 195mph on Friday morning, with accompanying sea surges of up to 20ft. \n \n The resulting damage in the region \u2013 a coastal flatland that has seen whole villages blown apart by the storm's heavy winds and rain \u2013 has created a state of pandemonium in Tacloban, where survivors have had to loot shops and malls for water, while others have resorted to scavenging for food among the bloated bodies of the dead. \n \n On Wednesday stories of heightened violence and tension circulated around the city as eight were killed after stampeding a rice warehouse looking for food. A Philippine Red Cross convoy was allegedly hijacked by armed men who were later shot dead by police, and a 13-year-old boy was knifed in the neck and stomach by unknown men, AFP reported. There were unverified reports that prisoners from the local jail, who had successfully broken out of their cells after the storm, were ambushing people carrying supplies across San Juanico bridge, which connects Tacloban with Samar island. \n \n A Facebook status warning of traffickers posing as relief workers and targeting women and children circulated on Thursday but the Guardian was not able to verify the report. Officials urged people to stay calm and not believe everything they heard. \"There have been so many reports of looting and rape which have turned out not to be correct,\" Ricky Caradang, a spokesman for President Benigno Aquino III, told the local ABS-CBN TV channel. \n \n A nighttime curfew has been in place since Monday and in a televised report on Wednesday the BBC correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes said Tacloban had turned into a \"war zone\". Footage showed tanks rolling through the centre of the devastated town and soldiers crouching behind walls with automatic rifles. Just what the threat was to the city had not been made clear, he said. \n \n Some aid agencies, fearing for the safety of their employees, have ordered teams to evacuate. Plan International has withdrawn all 15 of its employees \u2013 normally permanently based in Tacloban \u2013 until security is restored in the city, according to spokesman Ian Wishart. The fact that many aid workers had arrived in Tacloban but little aid had yet been distributed was creating a security concern, one aid worker told the Guardian. A memo was circulating among relief workers advising them not to move around in Tacloban as some UN staff had already been pulled out for security reasons. \n \n But officials have pointed to an increased presence of police and military, and the arrival of aid, as a turning point for the ravaged city. \n \n Carandang said 26 of 138 barangays (neighbourhoods) in Tacloban had received aid, with many of the roads previously blocked by fallen trees and debris now cleared. \n \n Oxfam has sent enough emergency water supplies for 20,000 families in Tacloban on a first-run delivery of effort, although the charity added that delivery was dependent on a stable security situation in the town itself. \n \n Plans are to provide half a million people affected by the super storm with emergency shelter, water and construction materials to rebuild their homes and boats. The World Food Programme successfully delivered nearly 25 tonnes of high-energy biscuits on Wednesday and another 10 tonnes were on their way, the UN body said. \n \n Much of the devastation wrought by Haiyan occurred in the Philippines' agricultural belt, with the majority of residents in Leyte and Samar working on farms or as fishermen.", "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes: \"Progress is being made\" \n \n The relief operation in the central Philippines to help those affected by Typhoon Haiyan is making progress following the arrival of a US aircraft carrier and its escort of two cruisers. \n \n More victims are receiving help but a BBC correspondent at the scene says there is still no large-scale food distribution taking place. \n \n The first mass burials have been carried out in Tacloban. \n \n The confirmed death toll, more than 2,300, is expected to continue rising. \n \n More than 11 million people have been affected by the typhoon, according to the UN. \n \n Unprecedented \n \n The top US commander in the Philippines told the BBC that US military support would be on an unprecedented scale. \n \n The USS George Washington, carrying 5,000 crew and moored off the east of Samar island, will expand search-and-rescue operations and provide a platform for helicopters to move supplies, the White House said. \n \n Two US destroyers are already in the Philippines and other US vessels are expected to arrive in about a week, the US Navy said. \n \n Pallets loaded with food and water have been taken from the aircraft carrier to Tacloban, the capital of badly hit Leyte province, and Guiuan, which was also devastated by the typhoon, on Samar's east coast. \n \n Image caption The big international aid operation is being given a further boost by the arrival of a US aircraft carrier \n \n Image caption Survivors have been forming long queues in the worst hit areas to collect food and water \n \n Image caption Aid officials are trying to gain a more accurate picture of the typhoon damage from the air \n \n Image caption Many buildings were flattened by the storm and others heavily damaged including this church in Tacloban \n \n US Marine Brigadier General Paul Kennedy told BBC Radio 5 live that the US aid effort was being stepped up to a level that has \"probably never been applied\" to a humanitarian crisis. \n \n The presence of the USS George Washington is expected to triple the number of available helicopters, which can also deliver hundreds of thousands of gallons of water every day. \n \n Food, water and medical help are beginning to reach residents of Tacloban as soldiers clear roads blocked by debris. \n \n But thousands of people continued to line up at the city's airport on Thursday to escape the difficult conditions. \n \n Aid at a glance Asian Development Bank: $500m (\u00a3312m) emergency loans and $23m in grants Australia: A$30m ($28m, \u00a317m) package, including aircraft, medical staff, shelter materials, water containers and hygiene kits China: 10m yuan ($1.6m; \u00a31m) in relief goods plus $200,000 (\u00a3120,000) from government and Red Cross European Commission: $11m (\u00a36.8m) Indonesia: Logistical aid including aircraft, food, generators and medicine Japan: $10m (\u00a36.2m), including tents and blankets.

Power generators were flooded as well. \n \n Most of the aid is stuck in Manila and the nearby airport of Cebu, a 45-minute flight away. \n \n \"There's a lot of dead bodies outside. There's no water, no food,\" said Dr. Victoriano Sambale, one of the dozen medical workers tending to thousands of people at the airport clinic. \n \n Until Wednesday there was no anesthetic. \n \n \"Patients had to endure the pain,\" Sambale said. \n \n Clutching her swollen belly, 26-year-old Reve Rose was writhing on her side on a wooden bench as her husband looked on. Her first child was not due until around Christmas, but she feared she was in labor already. Sambale felt her belly and tried to calm her down, certain it was just a panic attack. \n \n \"I am nervous, sad,\" she said. \"The house is lost. Everything is gone.\" \n \n Thelma Superable, 74, was vomiting and needed emergency dialysis. She, her 51-year-old son, Danny Superable, and his young son have made their way to the clinic from their home, 20 miles away, by walking and hitching rides. \n \n \"I am trembling because I am hungry,\" Danny Superable said. \"It's survival of the fittest.\" \n \n The government says planes, ships and trucks were on their way with generators, water-purifying kits and emergency lights. The U.S. military said it was installing equipment to allow the damaged Tacloban airport to operate at night. \n \n Rick said more doctors and medical help is needed but there will be a great need to fly people in serious distress. The Belgian government was setting up a field hospital hospital Wednesday with doctors and nurses who can help with basic health needs, he said. \n \n \"But certainly more chronic or serious cases will have to be evacuated from the zone and taken somewhere where there are still functioning health institutions,\" he said. \n \n But it could all be overwhelmed with an epidemic of diseases from people drinking dirty water and exposure to filth. \n \n \"There could be other threats from especially the lack of proper sanitation facilities, children in the open getting chronic coughs or lung infections,\" he said. \"All these issues are a threat to the population at the moment.\" \n \n Contributing: The Associated Press \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1cp4Zyo", "MANILA \u2014 Five days after Typhoon Haiyan ripped through the central Philippines, panic was spreading Wednesday and parched, hungry residents were resorting to increasingly desperate measures, including breaking into the homes of the dead. \n \n Eight people were crushed to death when a huge crowd stormed a rice warehouse near Tacloban, one of the worst-hit cities, authorities said. More than 100,000 bags of rice were carted away in the melee, according to news reports Wednesday. \n \n Elsewhere, residents dug up underground pipes and smashed them open to get water. \n \n PHOTOS: Central Philippines devastated by Typhoon Haiyan \n \n The official death toll stood at 2,275, but aid workers feared it would continue to grow. The United Nations estimates that more than 11 million people were affected by the storm, one of the most powerful ever to make landfall. \n \n As concerns grew about rampant looting and lawlessness, Philippine security forces sent reinforcements and imposed a nighttime curfew in Tacloban. Armed assailants have been holding up aid convoys headed to the city. On Tuesday, troops killed two suspected communist rebels who attacked one such convoy, the military said. \n \n Local officials said bands of looters, having cleaned out shops in Tacloban, were beginning to break into the homes of people who had died or fled the city. But there were reports that newly arrived troops were restoring order. \n \n Flights delivering aid from around the world are arriving at the airport in Cebu, which has been turned into a logistics hub for the relief effort. The many donations included a field hospital from Belgium and a portable purification plant from Germany, according to European officials. \n \n By the end of the day Wednesday, the United States had delivered nearly 274,000 pounds of supplies to Tacloban, about 100 miles northeast of Cebu, said two senior Obama administration officials who briefed reporters in Washington on condition of anonymity. The shipments included plastic tarps, hygiene kits, blankets and medical supplies. \n \n U.S. military personnel had also evacuated about 800 people from Tacloban to Manila for medical treatment. \n \n Philippine welfare personnel loaded up packages of rice and canned food provided by the World Food Program and distributed them to nearly 50,000 Tacloban residents. But even there, where the bulk of assistance has been delivered, bodies still lined the streets because, authorities said, there were not enough hands to remove them. \n \n Hundreds of additional Marines are expected to arrive in the Philippines by week's end to bolster the relief effort, which has struggled against logistical hurdles and the scale of the devastation. \n \n Aid has yet to reach many victims of the typhoon, known by Filipinos as Yolanda, particularly on outlying islands. \n \n \"The major challenge is logistics,\" said Mathias Eick, a regional spokesman for the European Commission's humanitarian aid directorate. \"With all this aid arriving and at the same time, the various Philippine authorities \u2014 military, civilian structures, the Philippine Red Cross \u2014 trying to distribute aid to so many communities ... obviously there are bottlenecks.\" \n \n Some of the logistical problems eased Wednesday, as remote airstrips and major roads were cleared of debris. However, fuel shortages and lack of power remain problems in rural areas. \n \n The longer the aid takes to arrive, the more people try to leave. Every day, desperate residents gather at Tacloban airport hoping for a spot on one of the departing supply planes. \n \n \"It's a very natural decision to take,\" Eick said. \"However, that of course makes it difficult for aid agencies to find out where people are going to, where people are staying, and how much is needed in the various towns.\" \n \n With much of the aid headed to Tacloban, on the island of Leyte, concern is growing for other hard-hit communities, such as the port of Ormoc. \n \n \"There is enough food in Ormoc for about two or three days, but if aid doesn't come through soon ... the situation could descend into chaos,\" said Julien Anseau, a spokesman for the U.S.-based aid group ChildFund International. \"What we are seeing is aid coming into Ormoc, but it's not staying in Ormoc, it's going on to Tacloban.\" \n \n An assessment team from the international aid group Doctors Without Borders visited Guiuan, in Eastern Samar province, where the typhoon first made landfall. \n \n \"The village has been flattened \u2014 houses, medical facilities, rice fields, fishing boats, all destroyed. People are living out in the open; there are no roofs left standing in the whole of Guiuan,\" team leader Alexis Moens said in a statement. \"The needs are immense, and there are a lot of surrounding villages that are not yet covered by any aid organizations.\" \n \n Defending the relief effort, Philippine Cabinet Secretary Rene Almendras said Wednesday that major roads have been cleared of debris and authorities have reached all but four affected areas to assess the needs. Additional logistics hubs are being established in Ormoc and at an airstrip in Guiuan. \n \n Aid deliveries will accelerate, Almendras told reporters. \"It's just we have not seen anything on the magnitude that we are talking now.\" \n \n Amid the devastation, there were heartwarming moments of resilience. Daryl Dano flew from Manila to Tacloban to search for her family, whom she found alive. When she arrived in the morning, she said residents were busy sifting through the vast fields of debris for anything they could salvage. But at night, she said, she was amazed to see people light a bonfire and gather in a circle to sing. \n \n \"They were sitting like Boy Scouts, sharing survival stories and what they did,\" she said. \"They were sometimes even making jokes about the destruction around them. \n \n \"I asked them why or how they could laugh?\" she said. A person replied, \"I just have to think happy thoughts. This is my second life. I just have to move on from this point to the next.\" \n \n [For the Record, 11:47 a.m. PST Nov. 14: In an earlier version of this post, Mathias Eick's last name was incorrectly given as Rick.] \n \n alexandra.zavis@latimes.com \n \n De Leon is a special correspondent."], "summary": "\u2013 Help is finally beginning to reach hundreds of thousands of people struggling to survive in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan.

A Red Cross convoy was allegedly hijacked by armed men and there are rumors that inmates who escaped during the storm have been ambushing people carrying supplies. Communist rebels have declared a ceasefire in disaster areas, but troops say there has been at least one attack. Some 2,357 people have been confirmed dead, but the toll is expected to rise significantly as remote areas hit hard by the storm are reached. In Tacloban, where bodies are being trucked to mass graves, the city administrator says he is sticking by his original estimate of 10,000 dead in the city alone.

The volunteer surgeons\u2014working by flashlight in Tanawan's ruined town hall\u2014believe the region will need help for months. \"I don\u2019t know when or how we are going to be able to leave,\" one doctor says. \"This is just the beginning of a wave of misery.\" USA Today has more on that front: The few doctors in Manila are already overwhelmed with hundreds of patients\u2014and those are mostly minor injuries. They're soon expecting to see big problems like pneumonia, diarrhea, infections, and dehydration. And the New York Times looks at a hospital in Tacloban that has no power, where victims lay waiting for care.

{"document": ["What would Donald Trump do to fix the Middle East? Listening to his prescriptions, it\u2019s not an easy question to answer. \n \n Trump sought to clarify his worldview with a prepared speech in Youngstown, Ohio, on Monday after a week of battles over his claim that President Obama \u201cfounded ISIS\u201d and was the \u201cMVP\u201d of the Islamist terror group. \n \n But setting aside the debate over that rhetoric, which he did not repeat in his speech, the national security framework he described was so contradictory and filled with so many obvious falsehoods that it\u2019s virtually impossible to tell what he would do as president. \n \n Trump\u2019s \u201cObama founded ISIS\u201d catchphrase is inflammatory, but it\u2019s not a literal argument (even though Trump initially insisted it was). Instead he's used the term to stitch together a patchwork of more mainstream criticisms that blame Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and former President George W. Bush for creating the current Middle East crisis. \u201cOur current strategy of nation building and regime change is a proven, absolute failure,\u201d Trump said on Monday. \n \n Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed Trump Proposes 'Extreme Vetting' Screening Process 1:59 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n Under Trump\u2019s telling, Bush committed the initial sin by destabilizing the Middle East with his 2003 invasion of Iraq. This is a version of events more common on the left, but one that exists on the right as well. \n \n Obama then made things worse with a \"reckless\" withdrawal of troops that created a \"vacuum\" for groups like ISIS to assert control. This is a frequent complaint from more neoconservative Republicans. \n \n In addition, Trump said, Clinton exacerbated the problem by supporting airstrikes against Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi's \"stable\" regime, which provided Islamic radicals another weak state to serve as a base. He also argued Clinton and Obama should have supported Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak, rather than encouraged him to step down in the face of street protests. These too are relatively ordinary criticisms. \n \n But these arguments, while unremarkable enough on their own, say nothing about Trump's instincts or how he would govern. \n \n That\u2019s because Trump previously supported every single foreign policy decision he now decries. \n \n Despite claiming daily that he opposed the Iraq War from the start, Trump endorsed deposing Saddam Hussein in a 2002 interview and there\u2019s no record of him opposing the war until after it had began. As for exiting the Iraq War, he said repeatedly in 2007 and 2008 that America should withdraw immediately and later recommended the same course for Afghanistan. \n \n Turning to Libya, Trump recorded a video in 2011 demanding the Obama administration remove Gadhafi from power on humanitarian grounds. He went on to lie about his support for the Libya intervention in a Republican debate only to admit to it when confronted with footage of his old statements in a CBS interview. Finally, Trump called Mubarak\u2019s departure \u201ca good thing\u201d at the time before turning against the idea years later. \n \n The result is that the only thing we know about Trump is that he\u2019s good at criticizing decisions by other presidents in hindsight. Unfortunately, this is not a very useful skill for the person tasked with making the decisions in the first place. \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s best when he\u2019s making forceful retrospective critiques,\u201d Colin Dueck, a professor at George Mason University who\u2019s researched the history of Republican foreign policy, said when asked to describe Trump\u2019s worldview. \u201cBut when you ask him what specifically are you proposing going forward, he doesn\u2019t have a coherent proposal.\u201d \n \n As Colin Powell famously cautioned George W. Bush ahead of the Iraq War, \u201cyou break it, you own it.\u201d The consequences of military action \u2014 or inaction, in some of these cases \u2014 are irreversible. \n \n A 'Blathering Jumble of Nonsense' \n \n Trump\u2019s chameleon-like prescription for Middle East is not consistent with any one school of thought \u2013 or with itself. Sometimes he resembles a non-interventionist in the vein of Ron Paul, like when he decried nation building and regime change in his speech on Monday. At other times, he sounds like Genghis Khan, like when he demanded in the very same speech that American troops conquer oil fields in Iraq by force and claim the profits for America. He previously suggested in 2011 that the US claim Libya's oil as well. \n \n Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed Donald Trump: 'We Should Have Kept The Oil' 1:18 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n \u201cIn the old days when we won a war, to the victor go the spoils,\u201d Trump said on Monday, describing a doctrine that runs directly counter to the international regime America led the world in establishing and currently enforces. \n \n The result of this confusing mix is that Trump has alienated Republican national security minds across a range of policy schools. \n \n John Noonan, who advised Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign on national security, said Obama\u2019s \u201cpremature withdrawal from Iraq\" was an avoidable mistake that contributed to the rise of ISIS and that Trump was accurate to point it out. But that doesn\u2019t mean Noonan is on board with the GOP nominee \u2014 far from it. \n \n \u201cThe rest of his foreign policy is an absolutely blathering jumble of nonsense,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cI can\u2019t in good conscience sign my name to it.\" \n \n In March, Noonan signed onto a letter with dozens of Republican foreign policy hands disavowing Trump in part because his policies are \u201cwildly inconsistent and unmoored in principle.\" \n \n Daniel Larison, a writer at the American Conservative, has spent years criticizing the Republican Party\u2019s foreign policy for leaning too hard on military operations to advance American interests. But despite Trump\u2019s stated opposition to \u201cnation building\u201d and toppling dictators by force, Larison opposes the nominee as well. \n \n \u201cTrump has relatively few antiwar conservative friends because he is not really reliably antiwar in any meaningful sense,\u201d Larison said. \u201cHe favors a much larger military budget, he usually has no strong objections to foreign wars when they begin, and he has little or no interest in diplomatic engagement that might avert conflict.\u201d \n \n Trump\u2019s views on intervention weren\u2019t the only place where things ran off the rails. Adopting a standard GOP talking point, he decried Obama for a mythic \u201capology tour\u201d on Monday and chided him for not championing feminism and gay rights abroad. \n \n But this is at odds with his stated views as well, which have long been characterized by a deep contempt for any notion of human rights that might impede raw material gains. In addition to celebrating torture and regaling audiences with apocryphal tales of Americans committing war crimes, Trump has regularly argued America\u2019s own leaders should refrain from criticizing dictatorial regimes because America lacks the moral authority to do so. \n \n Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed Trump: 'I Think We Can Find Common Ground With Russia' 0:59 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n \u201cWhen the world looks at how bad the United States is, and then we go and talk about civil liberties, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re a very good messenger,\u201d Trump said last month when asked about concerns over a crackdown on opposition by Turkish leader Reccep Erdogan. \n \n Pressed on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe last year over his praise for Russian dictator Vladimir Putin despite allegations he\u2019s murdered journalists and rivals, Trump responded: \u201cI think our country does plenty of killing also.\u201d \n \n In 2013, Trump also lavished praise on Putin in multiple interviews for writing an op-ed that criticized the very concept of American exceptionalism. \n \n \u201cYou use a term like \u2018American exceptionalism,\u2019 and frankly, the way our country is being treated right now by Russia and Syria and lots of other places and with all the mistakes we've made over the years, like Iraq and so many others, it's sort of a hard term to use,\u201d Trump said on Fox News, adding that Putin was \u201cextremely diplomatic\u201d for pointing this out. \n \n 'America First' a Departure From GOP Philosophy \n \n Outside of the Middle East, Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy views are at least somewhat more consistent. He\u2019s long described international relations as a zero-sum gain between strong winners and weak losers in ways that apply to both national security and trade. Trump has consistently called for new tariffs to protect workers from foreign competition and he\u2019s cast a skeptical eye towards alliances like NATO, which he\u2019s threatened to abandon in recent months if member states don\u2019t pay enough for protection. \n \n Dueck compared Trump\u2019s perspective to the original \u201cAmerica First\u201d movement, which resisted foreign entanglements and sought American neutrality in World War II. \n \n \u201cTrump\u2019s actually been saying for decades that he thinks U.S. alliances are more of a burden than an asset, he\u2019s been saying for decades he against free trade deals like NAFTA,\u201d Dueck said. \u201cHe\u2019s very volatile and contradictory day to day but he has been actually saying this for years.\u201d \n \n All of this would be a major break from the last seven-plus decades of Republican and Democratic presidents. But at least American voters could fairly say they were warned if he implemented this approach. No one, probably not even Trump himself, knows how what he\u2019d do about the Middle East. \n \n Editor\u2019s Note: This story has been updated to reflect that Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that the U.S. claim Libya\u2019s oil fields was made in 2011, not during his speech Monday as first reported.", "Donald Trump\u2019s speech on Monday about the war on \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d was indifferently delivered and in many ways familiar. But there were some new elements \u2014 including an alarming suggestion that the Cold War offers a useful lesson in how to combat Islamic State. \n \n Again Trump said that he had opposed the war in Iraq; again he attacked President Obama for opening the way for (if not \u201cfounding\u201d) Islamic State by precipitously withdrawing U.S. forces from that country; again he disdained \u201cnation-building and regime change\u201d; and again he disparaged Hillary Clinton\u2019s work as the country\u2019s chief diplomat, this time adding the grace note that she lacked the \u201cmental and physical stamina\u201d necessary to deal with Islamic State. \n \n Trump also promised to \u201ctemporarily suspend immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism\u201d \u2014 the latest variation on his notorious proposal last year for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d There are too many immigrants coming in from the Middle East to perform adequate screening, he argued. But even if that\u2019s true, many of the terrorist attacks he cited in Europe and the United States were conducted by people who wouldn\u2019t have been subject to such scrutiny because they held European or American passports. \n \n Requiring assent to a checklist of values would punish thoughts rather than deeds and might encourage newcomers to dissemble about their beliefs. \n \n Trump said he would call for an international conference on halting the spread of radical Islam and described an alliance comprising NATO (which he claimed had decided to focus on terrorism at his suggestion), Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Russia. Never mind that something similar already exists under the imprimatur of the United Nations Security Council, although Russia seems more interested in propping up Syrian President Bashar Assad than in defeating Islamic State. \n \n More interesting \u2014 and alarming \u2014 was Trump\u2019s description of how he would combat \u201cradical Islamic extremism\u201d at home. Essentially, he would seek to promote liberal values, such as autonomy for women and tolerance for gays and lesbians, by adopting the conservative tactics of the 1950s. \n \n \u201cIn the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today.\u201d Instead of excluding immigrants with communist views, he suggested, a Trump administration would bar immigrants \u201cwho have hostile attitudes toward our country or its principles \u2014 or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law.\u201d (How he would test for such attitudes \u2014 and why those who harbored them wouldn\u2019t conceal them \u2014 went unexplained.) \n \n And where the House Un-American Activities Committee delved into the alleged disloyalty of Americans during the Cold War, Trump would establish a Commission on Radical Islam that would \u201cexpose the networks in our society that support radicalization.\u201d Trump said that \u201creformist voices in the Muslim community\u201d would be invited to take part \u2014 an invitation unlikely to be accepted. \n \n The goal of these initiatives, Trump suggested, would be to promote assimilation of Muslims and spare the United States the sort of alienation that has produced violence in Europe. What he apparently doesn\u2019t recognize is that Muslims are far better assimilated in America than they are in the European countries that have been victimized by Islamist terrorists. \n \n Obviously Americans aren\u2019t immune to the siren call of Islamist extremism; witness the attacks in Boston, San Bernardino and Orlando, all of which Trump mentioned. Screening of potential immigrants and asylum-seekers for possible connections to terrorism is a matter of common sense as well as national security. \n \n But ideological litmus tests for immigrants and a national commission to study \u201cradical Islam\u201d could be catastrophically counterproductive. Requiring assent to a checklist of values would punish thoughts rather than deeds and might encourage newcomers to dissemble about their beliefs. A commission designed to expose radicals could bring back the days of blacklists and guilt by association. These are frightening ideas. It\u2019s no surprise that they have been proposed by Donald Trump. \n \n Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook", "People familiar with the immigration system say that many of Donald Trump's ideas will be nearly impossible to implement. | AP Photo Why Trump's immigration ideas won't work The Republican nominee's proposals appear nearly impossible to implement \u2014 and critics say they could actually fuel the terrorist threat. \n \n Donald Trump on Monday laid out some big plans to change the U.S. immigration system, calling for the suspension of immigration from regions that have \"a history of exporting terrorism\" and the roll-out of an ideological test to weed out foreigners who may support \"radical Islamic terrorism.\" \n \n The problem, people familiar with the immigration system say, is that many of Trump's ideas will be nearly impossible to implement. And some may wind up actually increasing the terrorist threat. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n The Republican presidential nominee unveiled the proposals during a speech in Ohio on national security. \"We should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people. I call it extreme vetting,\" the real estate mogul said, ad-libbing the \"extreme vetting\" line. \"Those who do not believe in our Constitution, or who support bigotry and hatred, will not be admitted for immigration into the country.\" \n \n Critics argue that Trump's plans are just a way to bar Muslims from the U.S., an idea he suggested months ago but which even some Republicans called an \"un-American\" religious test. (Trump also wants a ban on Syrian refugees.) Regardless of his true intentions, the basics that Trump proposed Monday left observers struggling to envision how they could ever become a reality. \n \n For instance, some asked, what does Trump mean by \"terrorism\" and \"regions\" with \"a history of exporting terrorism?\" Who counts as an immigrant \u2014 people who want to move to the U.S. permanently or the many millions who come as tourists, often without a visa? What counts as \"bigotry and hatred?\" And how will the ideological test be administered? \n \n Trump's proposals now are \"no more specific than saying you\u2019re going to screen out Muslims \u2014 it\u2019s less specific than that. In a way he\u2019s made his proposal less narrow and even vaguer than it was before,\" said David Bier, an immigration analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. \"Vague proposals rarely get implemented in any sort of specific, targeted way.\" \n \n Trump's team has promised more details in the coming weeks. As they figure them out, they'll face some tough realities. \n \n For one thing, there are few regions in the world not affected at some point by some form of terrorism. In Europe alone, Spain has suffered from attacks by Basque separatists the U.S. labels as terrorists, while Northern Ireland is still troubled by offshoots of the Irish Republican Army. Even if Trump were to focus purely on Islamist-inspired terror, that would still presumably include much of Europe, including France and Britain, most of whose citizens currently enjoy visa-free tourist travel to America. \n \n \"Are we calling for restrictions on visas to countries that have some of the best criminal justice and international policing programs?\" asked Greg Chen, a top official with the American Immigration Lawyers Association, in reference to Western European states. \n \n Then there's the Middle East, which is deeply scarred by terrorism but includes countries such as Jordan, Egypt and Israel, whose governments are important partners in the fight against Islamist extremists. Trump actually singled out those three countries in his speech, calling them friends \"who recognize this ideology of death that must be extinguished.\" But those countries \u2014 not to mention others \u2014 may resent seeing their citizens barred by the U.S. That could affect their cooperation on fighting extremists just as the U.S. is making headway in the fight against the Islamic State terrorist group in Syria and Iraq. \n \n \"Freedom of travel, whether regulated by visa or not, to the United States is a critical element of our relationship with these countries. It\u2019s a matter of dignity,\" said Jeremy Shapiro, director of research at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \n \n Trump also kept using the word \"region,\" but the U.S. immigration and visa policies are largely built around country-to-country relationships, and some countries don't clearly fall into one region or another: Turkey, for example, is a country that straddles Europe and the Middle East. \n \n U.S. immigration policy is incredibly complex and it is often affected by political decisions that seem questionable. For instance, earlier this year, the Obama administration imposed special visa restrictions on foreigners who have traveled in recent years to Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. But the administration chose not to include on that list Saudi Arabia or Pakistan, two countries notorious for producing terrorists, because the governments in Riyadh and Islamabad are, technically, allies in the fight against extremism. \n \n The U.S. government has very broad authority when it comes to deciding which foreigners it allows on its soil, and it does occasionally bar people, such as foreign government officials believed to be human rights violators. Historically, the U.S. also has barred people based on their beliefs, including in communism, a Cold War approach Trump alluded to in his speech. Legislative changes have made such ideological bans less likely today, but the rules are not black and white. Some experts assert that even if a Trump administration were to try to bar people based on their religion it may not technically be unconstitutional, even if it would seem to violate the spirit of the First Amendment. \n \n Constitutionality aside, the ideological test proposed by Trump poses challenges on a sheer logistical level, and could cost huge amounts of money to implement. Would the test come in the form of a questionnaire? Interviews with consular officers? The deployment of people to scour immigration applicants' social media accounts? \n \n And what counts as an un-American value? \n \n In his speech, Trump castigated radical Islamists for their hatred of gays, but would he argue that evangelical Christians from South Korea who also denounce homosexuality should be barred from visiting the United States? \n \n \"Immigration to the United States would grind to a near halt if millions of people are subject to background checks based on subjective criteria,\" said Cornell University law professor Stephen Yale-Loehr, who added: \"This proposal would also cost billions of dollars to implement. Business people and visitors could not be able to plan quick trips to the United States because they would not know how long an ideological background check would take.\" \n \n Trump on Monday also slammed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for saying in the past that she wanted to see more Syrian refugees be allowed in the United States, warning that terrorists and criminals are hiding among the refugees (though Clinton has said refugees must be carefully vetted). But refugee advocates warn that Trump's comments only worsen America's reputation in the Middle East, spurring more young people to turn to Islamist extremism. \n \n Hina Shamsi, director of the National Security Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, said that, despite the change in language, Trump's overall goal appears to still be keeping out Muslims. She believes that would be unconstitutional. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how these proposals do not pose significant legal, policy and practical hurdles, and rightly so,\u201d she said.", "A HEAVILY trailed speech by Donald Trump on counter-terrorism, delivered in Ohio on August 15th, included little that made sense as a plan for keeping America safe, but offered some fresh insights into the self-obsessed, fact-scorning temperament of the businessman who wants to hold the world\u2019s most powerful job. \n \n As his poll numbers slide and the murmuring from his allies grows in volume, Mr Trump increasingly sounds like someone with a political version of Tourette\u2019s Syndrome. Much of the speech could have been given by any of the 16 Republicans that the businessman defeated for the party\u2019s presidential nomination, amounting to a committee-drafted recital of conventional conservative talking points. A subdued Mr Trump, reading from a teleprompter, dutifully accused Barack Obama of staging a blame-America \u201cglobal apology tour\u201d after taking office in 2009, and\u2014together with his first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton\u2014of destabilising the world by coddling tryants and snubbing allies, while refusing to take seriously the threat from Islamic terrorism. \n \n But every now and then Mr Trump sensed an opportunity to boast about how prescient he had been in his assessment of foreign affairs, even as a private businessman with no seat in the councils of state, and began shouting about some of his favourite ideas, and how clever they were. Rather often this required brutalising the historical record. In his Ohio speech Mr Trump claimed, falsely, to have opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq from the very start, then called Mr Obama \u201cincompetent\u201d for withdrawing troops too fast from Iraq. He scolded the \u201cObama-Clinton group\u201d for toppling the Qaddafi regime in Libya (though he actually praised that overthrow at the time). Mr Trump simultaneously grumbled that the Obama administration had both betrayed Reaganite ideas about freedom, and naively thought that democracy could ever be brought to such countries as Iraq. \n \n The foreign policy speech had been billed as a chance for Mr Trump to show that he has sober, workable ideas for fighting the Islamic State (IS) terror network. The property developer ploughed through some proposals that ranged from policies already in place, such as drone strikes on terrorist leaders, to ideas that seemed to bore him as he read them out, such as a presidential commission on radical Islam, including moderate Muslims, which would craft new protocols on tackling extremism for use by local police departments. Bowing to off-stage pressure from Republican bigwigs, he backed away from his earlier, unconstitutional talk of banning Muslims from entry to America. Instead, he offered a plan for what he called \u201cextreme, extreme vetting\u201d of immigrants, reviving ideological screening tests last seen during the Cold War, under which consular officials and immigration officers would somehow identify those with \u201chostile attitudes\u201d towards America and its values; anyone who believes that Sharia law should \u201csupplant American law\u201d; or any arrivals who do not \u201cbelieve in the constitution or who support bigotry and hatred\u201d; and ensure that visas only go to those \u201cwho we expect to flourish in our country.\u201d To that end, once elected president he would ask the State Department and Department of Homeland Security to draw up a list of regions where \u201cadequate screening\u201d is not possible, and he would suspend immigration from dangerous regions with a \u201chistory of exporting terrorism.\u201d \n \n He sounded much more excited when his text gave him the chance to engage in personal abuse, accusing Mrs Clinton of wanting to be \u201cAmerica\u2019s Angela Merkel\u201d, claiming that the German chancellor has allowed \u201cmassive immigration\u201d bringing \u201ccatastrophe\u201d to her country. Mr Trump sounded even happier when peddling conspiracy theories, as when he flatly declared that Mrs Clinton \u201clacks the mental and physical stamina\u201d to take on IS \u201cand every other challenge we face.\u201d He sounded happiest of all when he congratulated himself for his idea that America should have seized Iraqi oilfields (while shunning all other forms of nation-building in Iraq), leaving behind American troops to guard this war booty. \u201cI said: \u2018keep the oil, keep the oil, keep the oil, don\u2019t let somebody else get it\u2019,\u201d Mr Trump said, adding: \u201cIn the old days, when we won a war, to the victor belonged the spoils.\u201d \n \n The audience in Ohio liked some bits of Mr Trump\u2019s speech, as when he promised to dismantle terror networks in America \u201cviciously if necessary\u201d. His supporters were quiet through one of the few passages that amounted to a foreign-policy strategy that Mr Trump could realistically deliver as president, possibly because it was a fresh statement of his desire to forge closer links with the authoritarian government of Russia led by President Vladimir Putin, and \u201cfind common ground\u201d in the fight against IS and in Syria policy. \n \n A short while before Mr Trump\u2019s speech, Hillary Clinton, campaigning in the scrappy, blue-collar city of Scranton, Pennsylvania, preemptively mocked her rival for taking so long to reveal his counter-terror plans, saying that his secret is that \u201che has no plan\u201d. Mrs Clinton was joined in Scranton by the vice-president, Joe Biden, who condemned Mr Trump\u2019s praise for authoritarian leaders, saying that the businessman \u201cwould have loved Stalin\u201d, and joked that Mrs Clinton had forgotten more than Mr Trump and his entire foreign policy staff ever knew about geopolitics. \n \n Real Cold War veterans may be forgiven for finding the 2016 election a little odd. The party of Eisenhower and Reagan has nominated a man who calls looting of foreign assets the highest priority for America in war, and who sucks up to Russia. The Democrats are running on their candidate\u2019s national-security credentials. Meanwhile Mr Trump\u2014judged simply as a man standing on a stage\u2014sounds angrier and unhappier every day. This election is not about to grow more inspiring.", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump says that as president he would end \"our current strategy of nation-building and regime change\" because they don't work. His dislike for nation-building is shared by many, including none other than the target of his criticism, President Barack Obama. \n \n In fact it was Obama's predecessor, Republican George W. Bush, who committed the U.S. to large-scale nation-building projects in Iraq and Afghanistan. Obama discarded that strategy while trying to keep enough U.S. influence there to prevent those two countries from crumbling. Obama's approach may not have worked, but it's not Bush-like \"nation-building.\" \n \n And while the Republican presidential nominee argued against nation-building in a foreign policy speech Monday, he advocated for something even more grandiose: seizing Iraq's oil wealth in the aftermath of the U.S. invasion in 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein. \n \n \"I have long said that we should have kept the oil in Iraq,\" he said in Youngstown, Ohio. \"I said, 'Keep the oil. Keep the oil. Keep the oil. Don't let somebody else get it.'\" It would have required U.S. troops to protect the oil, he said, but the benefit would have been clear today. \n \n \"If we had controlled the oil like I said we should, we could have prevented the rise of ISIS in Iraq, both by cutting off a major source of funding and through the presence of U.S. forces necessary to safeguard the oil and vital infrastructure products necessary for us to have the oil.\" \n \n Rather than nation-building, this would have been nation-grabbing, making Iraq a de-facto American colony. \n \n In the final months of his administration, Bush negotiated an agreement with the Iraqi government that called for all U.S. troops to leave the country by December 2011. Obama stuck to that schedule, believing that the Iraqis needed to stand on their own while the U.S. turned its attention to other pressing needs at home and abroad, what he called \"nation building at home.\" Obama, supported by his first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, saw Bush's nation-building effort as a proven failure. \n \n Iraqi politics, however, never overcame sectarian divisions, undermining the Iraqi army and leaving an easy target for IS. \n \n Trump is right that the Islamic State capitalized on the political and security vacuum in Iraq in 2014, but it's not clear that a long-term U.S. military occupation to hold and exploit Iraqi's oil resources would have led to a more stable outcome. \n \n Trump says he would have used money from the sale of Iraqi oil to pay for the care of wounded soldiers and the families of those Americans killed in the war. \n \n \"This proposal by its very nature would have left soldiers in place of our assets,\" he said. \"We would have had soldiers there guarding this valuable supply of oil. In the old days, when we won a war, to the victor belonged the spoils.\" \n \n After major military victories, the 240-year-old United States has tended to pour money and aid back into countries it has fought to help re-establish governments and services. It was, in fact, a kind of nation-building approach. The U.S. still has troops in Germany and Japan, with the permission of those nations, but it never confiscated their natural resources. \n \n In his speech, Trump said that as president he would discard \"nation-building.\" In its place would be what he called a new approach, which he described simply as halting the spread of \"radical Islam.\" He said that if elected he would convene an international conference on the topic and work closely with Israel, Jordan, Egypt, Russia, the NATO alliance and \"all others who recognize this ideology of death that must be extinguished.\" \n \n Trump also called Monday for \"extreme\" ideological vetting of immigrants seeking admission to the United States, vowing to significantly overhaul the country's screening process and block those who sympathize with extremist groups or don't embrace American values. \n \n \"Those who do not believe in our Constitution, or who support bigotry and hatred, will not be admitted for immigration into our country,\" Trump said. \"Only those who we expect to flourish in our country \u2014 and to embrace a tolerant American society \u2014 should be issued visas.\" \n \n Trump's proposals were the latest version of a policy that began with his unprecedented call to temporarily bar foreign Muslims from entering the country \u2014 a religious test that was criticized across party lines as un-American. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Lolita C. Baldor contributed to this report."], "summary": "\u2013 Donald Trump delivered what one analyst calls a \"surprisingly serious\" speech on foreign policy and counterterrorism Monday\u2014but serious may not equal coherent. Many analysts were taken aback by the mix of proposals in the speech, which included policies favored by the Obama and George W. Bush administrations, along with ideas dating back to the Cold War and some touches that were pure Trump. A roundup of reactions: Some elements of Trump's speech on the war on \"radical Islamic terrorism\" were familiar, but what was new was \"alarming,\" according to the Los Angeles Times editorial board. His calls for a Cold War-style \"ideological screening test\" and a Commission on Radical Islam could be \"catastrophically counterproductive,\" they write\u2014and \"would punish thoughts rather than deeds,\" as well as encourage newcomers to the US to conceal their beliefs. Former Bush administration official Peter Feaver tells the New York Times that he gives Trump credit for the \"surprisingly serious\" speech, but a striking amount of it \"depends on counterterrorism ideas developed by the Bush administration.\" The \"good parts are not new,\" and \"the new parts are not good,\" he says. Robert Burns at the AP believes there was a lot more Obama than Bush in Trump's disdain for nation-building. Obama ditched Bush's large-scale projects in Iraq and Afghanistan while \"trying to keep enough US influence there to prevent those two countries from crumbling,\" he writes, noting that Trump's argument that the US should have seized Iraq's oil isn't nation-building, it's \"nation-grabbing.\" John Noonan, Jeb Bush's former national security adviser, tells NBC News that Trump is completely correct about Obama's contribution to the rise of ISIS, and not much else. \"The rest of his foreign policy is an absolutely blathering jumble of nonsense,\" he says. \"I can't in good conscience sign my name to it.\" At Politico, Nahal Toosi looks at the \"extreme vetting\" proposal that has replaced Trump's ban on Muslim immigration and finds numerous problems. She notes that focusing on regions with a \"history of exporting terrorism\" would include much of Europe, even if only Islamist-inspired terrorism is included. Trump seemed bored by much of his own speech and only seemed excited when congratulating himself on his prescience or accusing Hillary Clinton of \"wanting to be 'America's Angela Merkel,'\" per the Lexington column at the Economist. The article notes that real Cold War veterans will find this election very strange. \"The party of Eisenhower and Reagan has nominated a man who calls looting of foreign assets the highest priority for America in war, and who sucks up to Russia,\" it says. Glenn Kessler at the Washington Post is equally scathing in his fact-checking of the speech. Kessler debunks claims, including the notion of an Obama \"apology tour\" in 2009, and notes that Trump was not an outspoken opponent of the Iraq War until well after it began\u2014and that he has apparently forgotten that he \"was a fervent advocate of intervening in Libya.\"", "ranking": [4, 3, 1, 2, 0]}

(July 23, 2015) \u2014 A 560-pound man from Danville is biking across the United States in hopes of losing weight and saving his marriage. \n \n Eric Hites started his journey two weeks ago in Falmouth, Massachusetts. Thus far, he\u2019s traveled 90 miles and he\u2019s already lost 60 pounds, but a bent rim on his bicycle has kept him in Tiverton, Rhode Island since late last week \n \n The Newport Daily News reports that Newport Bicycle is outfitting him with a new bike that can withstand his weight so he can continue his journey. \n \n Hites, who currently wears size 70 pants and a 10X T-shirt, says he\u2019s always been a big person. \n \n \u201cI hit 40 and I said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to change this,\u2019\u201d Hites told The Newport Daily News. \n \n He hopes to lose hundreds of pounds, and he says he\u2019ll be happier and healthier if he can get down to 300 pounds. \n \n Hites has a website called Fat Guy Across America where people can follow his journey.", "When 560-pound Eric Hites was dropped off by his dad on the side of the road in Massachusetts with his $170 bike last month, nobody believed that he\u2019d actually start pedaling across the entire country. But he had nothing to lose. \n \n And he wanted his wife back. \n \n At 40 years old and weighing more than a quarter-ton, Hites hit a wall in life. His estranged wife, already a widow, said she didn\u2019t want to repeat the past. He couldn\u2019t hold a job, in part because of his weight, and prospects in his hometown in Danville, Indiana, were scarce. Friends and loved ones were tired of his excuses, and so was he. \n \n \u201cI was just failing as a human being,\u201d said Hites, a DJ, pizza maker, telemarketer. \u201cYou name it, I\u2019ve done it.\u201d \n \n Today: Hites is 60 pounds lighter and 55 miles into the journey of his life. And a man who described himself as a miserable failure just a few months ago now finds himself in a story becoming bigger than, well, himself. \n \n \u201cEveryone seems connected to this story,\u201d he said from a tent outside Bliss Congregational Church in Tiverton, a coastal town in Rhode Island where he\u2019s been on a layover for more than a week. \u201cEveryone is coming forward and wants to be a part of it.\u201d \n \n When he wobbled into town, his rims were warped from all the bumps in the road against his immense weight. His spirits were a bit dashed, his meager funds were dwindling and any sane soul would say he should probably call it quits. \n \n \u201cI get thinking a lot and parts of me scream \u2018What are you doing? Go home you idiot. But I know I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d \n \n With not much cash left and a busted bike, he was thinking about rigging up a harness and pulling his trailer of 300 pounds of stuff like a horse, feet on the ground, heading forward. \n \n From a post inside a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, Hites has been doing what he\u2019s done since he first pushed off from the side of the road in Falmouth, MA, and that\u2019s telling his story. A story of love for a woman, determination to shed not just weight, but the self-loathing and sadness that comes with it. \n \n \u2018Bigger than just me\u2019 \n \n It didn\u2019t take long for word to spread, and on Friday, Hites will set off once again on a brand new bike donated by Newport Bicycle, supplies donated by the Tiverton Police Department, and a growing online community of thousands rooting for him and inspired by his story. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m just trying to lose weight and build a new future for me and my family,\u201d Hites said. \u201cBut now, it\u2019s grown bigger than just me.\u201d \n \n Like many people who arrive at crossroads in life, Hites knew something had to change. And he was determined to finally follow through. After decades of falling short of expectations, it was time to prove everyone wrong \u2014 including himself. \n \n A few months into the separation, he called his wife and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to change. I\u2019m going to get my health back and give us a future.\u201d \n \n \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it,\u201d she replied. \n \n She thought he was all talk, as usual, but he was driven in part by a song by The Proclaimers: \u201c500 Miles.\u201d \n \n \u201cI told her, \u2018I don\u2019t think I can walk 500 miles, but I\u2019ll ride my bike that far just to prove my love for you,\u2019\u201d Hites said. \u201c\u2019While on the road I\u2019ll find somewhere for us to move, out of our crappy town, to start our life over again.\u2019\u201d \n \n He started hitting the gym to prepare. He picked what he thought was a sturdy bike. He rigged a trailer to haul 300 pounds of stuff. And on June 10, after a long ride from Indiana, he was alone on the side of the road, watching his dad drive away. \n \n And he was ready to pedal across the United States. \n \n Overcoming obstacles \n \n The initial goings were a slog. It turns out he got a bike with the wrong type of suspension and less-than-ideal gearing, so much of his energy was wasted. He labored to make progress, sleeping on the side of bike paths, in a hostel and sometimes resorting to a hotel room if no kind stranger offered a place. He posted his progress on his blog and on Facebook, though not many people noticed at first. \n \n He kept pushing ahead as best as he could. \n \n It didn\u2019t take long for his wife to take notice. After two weeks, she realized that he\u2019d actually meant what he said. \n \n \u201cWhen she realized I was gone, that I had left and actually was doing what I said, she said it pretty much was the most romantic thing,\u201d Hites said. \n \n Along the way he\u2019s met artists, shopkeepers, craftspeople, tourists, young children, old men and women. He\u2019s fought rain, heat, met up with a personal trainer in Martha\u2019s Vineyard and attended church services in places of worship dotting the route. One night, he nearly lost all his charging gear and his wife\u2019s diamond ring, but a friendly police officer saved the day and found it after multiple trips. \n \n It has been lonely and there were occasions, \u201cI get thinking a lot and parts of me scream \u2018What are you doing? Go home you idiot,\u2019\u201d he wrote on June 27. \u201dBut I know I\u2019m not going to do that, but it still makes me feel like I\u2019m never going to make it home, or hit my goal, or that I will fail and be a laughing stock and lose what I hold so dear.\u201d \n \n When he rolled into Tiverton about a week ago, Hites was facing yet another crossroads. It looked like he had won his wife back, but his bike was broken and the Herculean effort ahead was no less daunting than when he began. He could have stopped. \n \n Afterall, he did win his woman back. \n \n Community steps up \n \n Things, though, have taken on a life of their own. His posts on Facebook made the rounds and messages started to pour in. Even after Newport Bicycle offered to give him a bike with a suspension set up for his frame, offers and messages kept pouring in. Meanwhile, his dwindling GoFundMe account started to balloon in value, increasing from a few hundred to nearly $3,500. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve had offers for 60 bikes now,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody came through.\u201d \n \n By Wednesday, his story was starting to get national attention. The Beach Body network of personal trainers is working to launch a national campaign to get people moving with Hites as he pedals his way across the nation. \n \n \u201cWhen she realized I was gone, that I had left and actually was doing what I said, she said it pretty much was the most romantic thing.\u201d \n \n And most profound for Hites are the messages he has been getting from people who find themselves exactly where he was a few months ago: stuck, alone and overweight. \n \n \u201cThis trip has so many meanings for me and now it seems to have so many meanings for everyone else,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my job now. To make it the whole way.\u201d \n \n As his coach said, \u201cThis is your job until you\u2019re done. You job is to talk to people and do all of these things.\u201d \n \n And even if he wanted to quit, he can\u2019t now. For a man who set off to save his life, he now finds himself the driving force for others to save their own. \n \n \u201cEveryone is counting on me now,\u201d Hites said. \u201cI don\u2019t have an exact route or a plan. I\u2019m taking it day by day, sort of letting myself randomly choose which roads to go on.\u201d \n \n \n \n Whatever route Hites takes, he\u2019s blazing a trail.

Abrams has gathered an eclectic group of actors for the franchise's future. \n \n \"They have a good group of people who have a mix of demonstrated talent and fresh resumes. (These are) people who can fill into any role they need to and who won't be recognized for something they've done that will take audiences out of the movie,\" says Eric Geller of the Star Wars fan site TheForce.net. \n \n But fans were also excited when Lucas put a talented group including Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor together for 1999's first Star Wars prequel, the much-maligned The Phantom Menace, reminds Mike Ryan, senior editor for Screencrush.com. \n \n The big difference with the new crew? \"Han Solo is sitting right there with them,\" Ryan says. \n \n Ford, Fisher and Hamill have been rumored for months to reprise their roles as Han Solo, Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker \u2014 arguably the most famous sci-fi trio in history. \n \n That wasn't good enough for Abrams, though. He also signed on stalwarts such as Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker to play droids C-3PO and R2-D2, plus Peter Mayhew as Han's Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca. \n \n One notable snub, though, is Billy Dee Williams, notes Geller, who expected Williams to return as Cloud City huckster-turned-hero Lando Calrissian. \n \n While Williams might still have a cameo, \"Abrams has to make a movie that features Han, Luke and Leia, while handing the movie off to the newcomers,\" Ryan adds. \"Perhaps there just wasn't enough room for Lando.\" \n \n The returning six actors are fan favorites yet are getting up in age \u2014 Ford is 71, Hamill 62, Fisher 57 \u2014 and this is most likely Abrams' way to send them off in style while also passing the torch to a younger generation of potential icons. \n \n Like Lucas with his original Star Wars in 1977, Abrams balanced slim resumes with vaunted ones to fill out his cast. And while no characters, good or bad, Jedi or Sith, have been assigned to any of the actors, Abrams cast a trio of youngsters much like Lucas' core three. \n \n When they joined the first Star Wars, Ford was a veteran of TV roles and had a credit in Lucas' American Graffiti in 1973; Fisher boasted of a supporting role in Shampoo and a TV movie with her mom Debbie Reynolds; and Hamill hadn't even been seen on a big screen. \n \n Similarly, Episode VII cast members John Boyega, Domhnall Gleeson and Daisy Ridley are all relative unknowns in the U.S. Boyega starred in the cult British alien-invasion flick Attack the Block and is \"an excellent choice,\" Ryan says; Gleeson is the son of Irish actor Brendan Gleeson and had roles in the last two Harry Potter films; and Ridley's first big-screen credit is for a yet-to-be-released movie from last year, according to the TV/movie database IMDb. \n \n \"This is going to make her career,\" Geller says of Ridley, whom he guesses may play Han Solo's daughter. \"If that's the case, I think it's a great choice to pick someone in her position.\" \n \n Driver and Oscar Isaac may be more familiar to audiences. Isaac had a breakout role as a folk musician in last year's Coen brothers movie Inside Llewyn Davis, while Driver is famous for Girls. \n \n Meanwhile, Abrams adds some geek royalty in Serkis and von Sydow. \n \n Fans are probably wondering if Serkis will be seen as himself or whether he'll don the motion-capture suit for which he's become famous. He's helped bring life to the creepy, computer-generated Gollum in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit movies, as well as Caesar the ape in Rise of the Planet of the Apes and July's sequel Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. \n \n Lucas brought in Hollywood thespians in Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing for that first Star Wars movie, and 85-year-old von Sydow fills that role in Episode VII and is famous for his role in 1980's Flash Gordon. \n \n \"It's funny that Lucas originally wanted the Flash Gordon rights, couldn't get them, then made Star Wars instead,\" Ryan says. \"Now, Star Wars has Ming the Merciless. \n \n Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Shannon Rae Green reveals what Star Wars fans are saying on social media about the cast list for Episode VII.

The one thing we can all agree on is it beats the hell out of The Phantom Menace, and although it strikes a little close to the vanilla side, it may be reassuring to some who are glad the new trilogy is going tried-and-true rather than skewing campy, vague, or avant-garde. \n \n It does raise one question: Has the Force been \u2026 slumbering? We certainly saw it help Luke Skywalker launch those proton torpedoes into the thermal exhaust port of the original Death Star, and as \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic sang in his immortal Kinks spoof Yoda \u201cI picked up a box / I lifted some rocks / While I stood on my head.\u201d The Force was certainly at work there, right.

The shoot \u2014 spanning from the deserts of Abu Dhabi to the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, England \u2014 was anything but smooth, having been thrown into crisis after Han Solo himself, Harrison Ford, broke his leg on set in an accident involving a falling door on the Millennium Falcon. \n \n The set was also plagued by spoiler leaks \u2014 or was it? The flow of rumors and apparent concept images has been non-stop, but how much of it is accurate remains an open question. The grapevine got the title wrong, with some fan sites such as Ain\u2019t It Cool News grabbing headlines by reporting that it had confirmed the film would be called The Ancient Fear. \n \n Of course, Return of the Jedi was filmed under the fake title Blue Harvest, a common technique on high profile films to remain slightly more low-key.

{"document": ["Michaela Myers said she was first groped by her supervisor after a crew pizza party last summer, shortly after starting a new job as a firefighter with the U.S. Forest Service. She was 22 and excited about the job. She had worked out diligently to prepare for the season, running and hiking with a heavy pack. She is from the Pacific Northwest, and had always loved the outdoors and a challenge. \n \n She remembers her supervisor, a Forest Service veteran, offering her beers at a crew member\u2019s house after dinner. He told her he was glad she was on the crew because she was \u201csexy\u201d and had \u201ca nice ass,\u201d she said. According to her account, he led her to a couch, rubbed her butt as she sat down, and slid his hand between her legs. Myers was shocked and upset, but didn\u2019t stop him. She had heard from other crew members that this manager could fly off the handle, and didn\u2019t want to make a scene. \n \n \u201cYou don\u2019t feel like you can say \u2018no\u2019 loudly to your supervisor,\u201d she said. \u201cI keep looking back on it and wishing I could have just punched him or something.\u201d \n \n \u201cI keep looking back on it and wishing I could have just punched him or something.\u201d \n \n According to Myers, the harassment and groping continued for the rest of the summer. When she confided in a fellow crew member, he told her this was an unfortunate reality for a female firefighter. She had a choice, she recalls him saying: report it and face retaliation, or do nothing and stay in fire. \n \n But in September, after the end of her three-month season in Oregon, Myers had enough. She reported the harassment to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Forest Service\u2019s parent agency. In October, she provided a sworn statement to a USDA investigator detailing all the allegations. At first, Myers found the Human Resource department\u2019s response encouraging. She was optimistic action would be taken. But two months later, the Forest Service sent her a letter that said the investigation was complete, no misconduct had been found, and the case was closed. \n \n Myers was furious. \n \n \u201cThis means they don\u2019t believe me that I was sexually harassed,\u201d she said. \u201cOr they don\u2019t care.\u201d \n \n When reached by phone, the manager, who still works for the Forest Service, said he was made aware of the allegations. \u201cI was cleared of all wrongdoing,\u201d he said. \n \n \u2018We all live in this fear\u2019 \n \n Harassment of women in the Forest Service has been a problem for years. As far back as 1972, women have joined together to file class action complaints and lawsuits about gender discrimination and sexual harassment. More recently, in 2016, a congressional hearing was held to address the problem within the Forest Service\u2019s California workforce, which had also been the focus of previous complaints. The PBS NewsHour investigated what\u2019s happened since then, and found the problem goes much deeper. \n \n Firefighter Darla Bush said her career \u201cspiraled downhill\u201d after she notified her supervisor that she was pregnant with twins in 2011. Video by Joshua Barajas \n \n In interviews with 34 current and former U.S. Forest Service women, spanning 13 states, the women described a workplace that remains hostile to female employees. They complained of a pattern of gender discrimination, bullying, sexual harassment and assault by crew members and supervisors. Three women said they were raped after-hours by co-workers or interagency firefighters while working for the Forest Service. Many women alleged retaliation after reporting these incidents. \n \n The retaliation they described took different forms: verbal threats, bullying notes, duties stripped, negative performance reviews, and demotions. Myers applied to work another season with the Forest Service and said she received interest from several states, but not Oregon, where she reported the abuse. \u2018It\u2019s like I\u2019m on some Oregon blacklist, the Oregon #MeToo blacklist,\u201d she said. \n \n Watch our complete series on harassment and retaliation in the U.S. Forest Service. Video by Lorna Baldwin, Emily Carpeaux and William Brangham \n \n Some women interviewed said they never reported the harassment for fear of retaliation. In a survey of nearly 2,000 Forest Service employees in California, conducted by the USDA Office of Inspector General last summer, the majority of respondents said they knew of the agency\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for harassment. But the survey, released in February 2018, also showed that most who experienced harassment did not report it, either because they didn\u2019t trust the reporting process, didn\u2019t believe that the process would be confidential, or feared a negative impact on their job. \n \n \u201cWe all live in this fear \u2026 So if I have to speak up I will. But it\u2019s frustrating because there\u2019s so many more out there who are not talking.\u201d \n \n Seven of the 34 women interviewed asked to remain anonymous for fear of further retaliation. Fear was a common theme in the interviews. One woman said she went to the hospital multiple times for \u201cher nerves\u201d after reporting harassment. Another asked the NewsHour to destroy her interview transcript, because she became too afraid of the consequences. A third, a firefighter who resigned from her position in 2016 after she reported to police that she was raped on assignment in Montana, said: \u201cWe all live in this fear \u2026 So if I have to speak up I will. But it\u2019s frustrating because there\u2019s so many more out there who are not talking.\u201d \n \n Reporting harassment \n \n In interviews, Forest Service employees, union representatives, lawyers, and congressional investigators said the agency struggles with a long-standing \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d culture, not just in California, but all over the country. Women are often assigned to remote forests, where they may work in close quarters with male-dominated crews in high-risk scenarios. Socializing after hours can involve heavy drinking. Many women described the worst offenses in the agency\u2019s wildland firefighting division, where the gender disparity is even greater: 6,633 fire employees are male, while just 890, or 13 percent, are female. \n \n Debra D\u2019Agostino, a federal employment lawyer who has represented at least five Forest Service women with gender discrimination complaints, said: \u201cThe stories I hear from female firefighters really sound like they are from the 1970s. It\u2019s really old-fashioned sexist conduct that you just don\u2019t expect to see these days.\u201d \n \n U.S. Forest Service Acting Associate Chief Lenise Lago said the agency is \u201con the right track.\u201d In November 2017, she said, it created a harassment reporting center with a toll-free hotline. And later this year, the agency will for the first time require every employee to undergo identical sexual harassment training. \n \n The Forest Service declined to comment on specific cases due to privacy, but said it takes \u201call reports of sexual harassment very seriously.\u201d \n \n \u201cThere are more numerous people doing the right thing than not,\u201d Lago said. \n \n In the private sector, employees can file discrimination complaints directly with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an independent agency tasked with investigating workplace discrimination. But federal employees, including those in the Forest Service, must first contact their agency\u2019s EEO counselor, who starts an investigation and then makes a decision with the agency on how to handle the complaint. Federal employees dissatisfied with the results can appeal that decision to the EEOC or pursue a case in federal district court. \n \n Many of the women interviewed described the reporting process as long, complicated, and never ending in a satisfying conclusion. Investigations can take years and stretch into hundreds of pages, especially if there is more than one allegation. \n \n The EEOC said the average processing time for all complaints in fiscal year 2016 was 464 days, and that it\u2019s exploring ways to shorten the process. The Forest Service\u2019s new hotline, which is staffed by contractors specifically trained to handle sexual harassment, aims to more efficiently respond to these claims. \n \n Joe Duran, a union leader in California who has been with the Forest Service for more than 40 years, said: \u201cI take an awful lot of phone calls with individuals \u2026 All I can do is give them counsel and advice. I\u2019ll say, \u2018you have to go through this or move on. And if you go the EEO route that could be years.\u2019 That really tears them apart \u2026 People want to know why.\u201d \n \n But Duran said an even bigger issue is the retaliation people face after reporting bad behavior. \u201cThe ones that do [report] are harassed or reprised or stuck away someplace,\u201d he said. And management does sometimes investigate this reprisal, he said, but \u201cyou\u2019ll never hear the outcomes.\u201d \n \n \u2018You are a prime example of why women don\u2019t belong in fire\u2019 \n \n Last summer, one woman in the South was startled from the start of her season by the behavior of the men on her hotshot crew, an elite team that fights wildfires. The woman, who is 27 and asked for anonymity because she continues to work for the Forest Service, said they made disparaging sexual comments about a former female worker and implied that an EEO complaint had no consequences. \u201cThe only thing that EEO taught us is that we can get away with anything,\u201d she recalled one man saying. \n \n Melissa Moore \u201cTo be a chick in fire, you have to be excellent\u201d Engine captain \n \n Fremont-Winema National Forest \n \n Oregon Moore, 35, says that while on assignment at the National Wildland Firefighter Apprentice Program in 2015, a student at the academy groped her buttocks and vagina at an after-hours gathering at a local bar. She said she submitted a statement about the incident to the Forest Service. In a statement to Congress, Moore said she was told her allegations had been substantiated, but it wasn\u2019t clear whether action was taken against the perpetrator. \u201cIt\u2019s less a culture of harassment than just blatant misogyny. \u2026 A lot of men \u2026 [aren\u2019t] used to seeing the types of women that would fight fire \u2026 To be a chick in fire, you have to be excellent to be good. And if you\u2019re not that, then you just kind of get eaten alive.\u201d \n \n One day in mid-August, according to her records, a senior crew member directed an \u201cemotional outburst\u201d at her after she had trouble keeping up on a hike: \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be here \u2014 this is a hotshot crew. She needs to go the f**k home.\u201d \n \n Two weeks later, while fighting a fire in Montana, the woman was struck in the back by a falling fir tree cut down by a fellow crew member. She said he failed to call out a warning as it fell. \u201cI don\u2019t know about if he dropped it intentionally, but he definitely knew I was there and didn\u2019t care. He didn\u2019t care if he hurt me,\u201d she said. \n \n The tree weighed 100 pounds and sprained the ligaments of her lumbar spine, according to medical records. Her supervisor did not initially sign the necessary paperwork required for her medical treatment, according to a Forest Service police report. Patti Adkinson, a workers\u2019 compensation representative who handled the woman\u2019s case, found this disturbing. \u201cMy personal opinion is that happened because they were were trying to prove to her that she wasn\u2019t a fit candidate to be a hotshot, so they were trying to make her suffer,\u201d Adkinson said. \u201cAbsolutely they were intimidated by her being able to do what they could do.\u201d \n \n In California, firefighter Darla Bush had over the years grown accustomed to bullying, such as men putting lizards on her back or rocks in her pack. For the most part, it didn\u2019t bother her. She put her head down, worked hard, and eventually advanced to the position of engine captain. But everything changed in 2011 when she told her supervisor she was pregnant with twins. According to Bush, who is now 40, he repeatedly told her she was \u201cuseless\u201d because her doctor had ordered her to be on light duty. In the years that followed, she said, her duties were stripped away, trainings were denied, and she was ultimately demoted from her engine captain position. \u201cI had a lot to contribute to the district,\u201d she said. \u201c[But] after I got there and reported that I was pregnant, is when my career spiraled downhill. And it\u2019s been nonstop ever since.\u201d Bush said she now sits in an office with almost no duties to perform. She is the lead complainant in a 2014 class action complaint alleging harassment and retaliation in the Forest Service. \n \n Battalion chief Abby Bolt, 39, was raped while on assignment in 2012 in Colorado, by another firefighter who was not with the Forest Service. While she reported the rape to police, she did not report it to the Forest Service because she feared retaliation. \u201cI had previously tried to report some bad behavior that\u2019s not near as bad as sexual assault. So I can\u2019t even imagine if I had reported the rape,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Forest Service would have made it so hard on me.\u201d Because she felt she could not trust the formal reporting channel, she confided instead in a fellow firefighter who she saw as a kind of protector. A year later, that friend died while fighting a fire. \u201cAnd then that piece of security was gone too,\u201d she said. \n \n In the years since, Bolt said she has faced bullying and harassment from her male supervisors, which intensified after she contacted the Forest Service about filing a gender discrimination complaint in 2014. In January 2015, she filed a formal EEO complaint. Her case has been winding its way through that process ever since. \n \n This past fall, Bolt said she received anonymous notes in her mailbox. \u201cYou are a prime example of why women don\u2019t belong in fire, especially single mothers,\u201d one of the notes read. \u201cLet it go.\u201d After she reported the notes, she received a letter from management saying the investigation was closed because \u201cthere was no accused person to interview.\u201d And then in October, she found \u201cQUIT\u201d scrawled on the back of her dusty vehicle. After getting the notes, she said, \u201cI have sat in my truck, in the parking lot, for hours and hours and actually, days. Like, there\u2019s been days \u2026 after the notes that were left, that I couldn\u2019t get out of my truck. I would pull up to the office and I just couldn\u2019t get out.\u201d \n \n Jim Lopez, a union representative who has taken up Bolt\u2019s gender discrimination case, said she is \u201cthe epitome of a bullying target \u2014 they tend to be high performers, good communicators and they tend to make the supervisors look bad.\u201d \n \n Fire, he said, remains \u201cone of the last strongholds in the Forest Service of male domination,\u201d and of men who don\u2019t want women in their ranks. \n \n Decades of disparity, and efforts to close the gap \n \n The Forest Service was created in 1905 as an arm of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, though in many ways its mission echoed the goals of the National Parks Service, that of protecting and managing the public lands. Among those duties were firefighting and other responsibilities often seen as grueling tasks, work that a 1971 pamphlet describes as \u201cmen who don\u2019t mind roughing it.\u201d \n \n In its early days, the Forest Service did employ women, but they were not expected to do field work. Hallie M. Daggett, the first woman to be employed in fire in the agency, joined in 1913 \u201cafter considerable exertion,\u201d according to American Forestry magazine. \u201cFew women would care for such a job, fewer still would seek it,\u201d the magazine wrote. \n \n Janine McFarland \u201cI still love the Forest Service.\u201d Archaeologist \n \n Deschutes National Forest \n \n Oregon \n \n McFarland, 55, said she has filed two dozen harassment and discrimination complaints over the years while working for the Forest Service. In 2002, she reported pornographic photos of women were plastered across work vehicles on the Los Padres National Forest. Afterward, she said, she faced retaliation, including death threats against her and her son. \u201cWhat the Forest Service is allowing to happen is all this retaliation and reprisal, and then it never gets resolved. Women quit or retire or leave \u2026 I still love the Forest Service. Think it\u2019s one of the best agencies in the world. I still believe all that stuff.\u201d \n \n Deanne Shulman, the first female smokejumper in the Forest Service, didn\u2019t gain entry into the agency until 1981, nearly 70 years after Daggett took a post as fire lookout. Smokejumpers are part of an elite crew that jumps out of airplanes and parachutes down to fight fires below. Shulman passed the physical tests, but was initially denied the job because she was told she hadn\u2019t met weight requirements; she was five pounds under the 130-pound minimum. It wasn\u2019t until Shulman filed a formal EEO complaint did the agency open the work to women. \n \n Today, a third of the Forest Service\u2019s nearly 30,000 employees are women, according to the most recent agency figures, updated in January of this year. \n \n Efforts to fix this gender disparity began decades ago. In 1973, Gene Bernardi, a research sociologist with the Forest Service, filed a class action lawsuit against the agency for gender discrimination in California. The suit led the Forest Service to later agree to a \u201cconsent decree\u201d that required it to increase the number of women among its California staff to 43 percent, roughly the same percentage of women in the civilian workforce at the time. \n \n The decree bred resentment among male Forest Service employees. In 1991, a bitter male fire captain wrote to The Hartford Courant newspaper, saying that the decree\u2019s requirements were \u201ctearing the agency apart, creating animosity and mistrust between men and women \u2026 and lowering the agency\u2019s ability to do its job.\u201d A group of male employees attempted to challenge the decree, but it was dismissed in court a year earlier. \n \n Jonel Wagoner, one of the \u201cBernardi women\u201d hired after the 1981 decree, said she retired last year after 37 seasons due to the mistreatment she endured. \n \n \u201cThis agency, they just detest women, do not want women in their ranks. They hate educated strong women,\u201d said the former firefighter, who is 57, and who also represented harassed women as a union representative. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to be one of the good old boys, you\u2019re going to fail.\u201d \n \n A second class action lawsuit came in 1995 when two female former Forest Service employees alleged sexual harassment and reprisal on behalf of 6,000 women, also in California. The lawsuit led to another decree, requiring that the agency re-evaluate how it processed complaints. That decree expired in 2006. \n \n And in 2014, a class action complaint was filed with the EEOC, claiming \u2014 again \u2014 sexual harassment of and retaliation against women in the Forest Service in California. That same year, California Rep. Jackie Speier recalls sending one of her staffers to a meeting with Forest Service officials. Media reports at the time pointed to continued problems with sexual misconduct within the agency. After the meeting, Speier said the staffer returned to the D.C. office \u201cdemonstrably shocked\u201d and in disbelief. \n \n When the staffer asked Forest Service officials about the sexual misconduct, she recalled to the NewsHour, they responded with the sentiment of \u201cBoys will be boys.\u201d \n \n Two years later, the National Parks Service was flagged by the Interior Department for similar problems. At the time, then-Forest Service Chief Thomas Tidwell told employees in an agency-wide email that stories of sexual abuse within the Forest Service were mostly \u201colder allegations.\u201d \n \n Darlene Hall, who is 53, and one of three named complainants in the 2014 case, said that isn\u2019t true. To her, the misbehavior today is as bad or worse, just more covert than in the past. The message remains clear, she said: \u201cYou\u2019re female, you don\u2019t belong here. Speak up, and you get hammered.\u201d \n \n Lack of follow-up \n \n In December 2016, the congressional hearing was held to publicly address the concerns of rampant sexual misconduct, assault and discrimination within Region 5 \u2014 the California arm \u2014 of the Forest Service. \n \n At the hearing, Lesa Donnelly, an early class action complainant and a whistleblower who has advised many California-based Forest Service women, shared story after story of misconduct she\u2019d heard. Forest Service firefighter Denice Rice also testified about her own experience, detailing that her supervisor had asked for sex, stalked her, and poked her breasts with a letter opener. \u201cThe instant I filed\u201d a complaint, she said, \u201ceverything changed.\u201d Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle grilled the agency about their poor record of responding to these issues. \n \n In her opening statement, Lago, then-deputy chief of business operations at the Forest Service, defended the agency, saying: \u201cWe investigate all allegations. We hold people accountable.\u201d \n \n Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah, vowed that members would \u201cuse every power we possibly can from this pulpit\u201d to ensure that women \u201cnever have to go through that again in any way shape or form.\u201d \n \n Your browser does not support HTML5 video. \n \n A \u201cThank you, firefighters\u201d sign seen on the way into the Los Padres National Forest in southern California. Video by Joshua Barajas \n \n But more than a year later, there\u2019s been little follow-up from the Hill. The Office of the Inspector General is expected to release an audit in April that will evaluate how well the Forest Service has addressed complaints of workplace misconduct. \n \n The Forest Service, for its part, said it updated its anti-harassment policy ahead of the hearing, in September 2016, and launched the national hotline the following November. Since the new anti-harassment policy was put in place, the agency said, it has received 1,013 reports of harassment, and completed inquiries or investigations in 632 of those cases. Of those, the agency said it found misconduct in 150 cases. \n \n For every misconduct finding, the agency said it delivered a corrective action that ranged from a warning letter to termination, \u201cdepending on the severity and facts gathered in each case,\u201d Babete Anderson, an agency spokeswoman, wrote in an email. \n \n Darla Bush \u201cOnce you say something....you get a target on your back\u201d Fire operations specialist \n \n Sequoia National Forest \n \n California Bush, 40, is the lead complainant in a 2014 class action complaint with the EEOC that alleges a culture of harassment and retaliation in the Forest Service. She fears speaking up will jeopardize her retirement, which is seven years away. \u201cOnce you say something, there\u2019s no shutting that door and you get a target on your back. It\u2019s been my experience [that] if you open your mouth and you speak up in regards to your standards or what should be right or wrong, there\u2019s no going back.\u201d \n \n But nearly every female Forest Service employee the NewsHour spoke with said they did not believe the hotline was fixing anything. Wagoner, who remembers a previous Forest Service hotline in California that later went away, said she had seen women retaliated against for calling. Bolt, the battalion chief in California who received the harassing notes, said she submitted more than one complaint to the new hotline and never received any follow up. \n \n Frustrated, Bolt sent a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the USDA to try to figure out what happened to her hotline complaints. She received a letter back from the USDA that said the FOIA office had a backlog, and said she hasn\u2019t received any correspondence since. \n \n The ones who leave \n \n Nearly all of the women interviewed said they loved the Forest Service. They loved the mission of protecting forests. The time outside. The adrenaline of fighting fires. The dirty work. The camaraderie. And the skill required. For these reasons, despite the harassment they faced, many of them chose to stay. \n \n But there were also the women who quit or were pushed out, and never returned. \n \n At first, Erinn Whitmer loved her job as a seasonal firefighter. She was an adrenaline junkie who always wanted to be outdoors. And she grew up in Northern California, in wildfire country, where her home was twice evacuated for fires. \u201cI grew up near fire crews,\u201d she said, and admired them. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t realize how naive I was to the culture.\u201d \n \n Whitmer worked eight seasons in fire for public land agencies: first the Park Service, then the Bureau of Land Management, and then the Forest Service in California. She soon saw what she called a \u201cwomanizing\u201d culture in all three \u2014 but the Forest Service was the worst, she said. There, crew members constantly talked about sex and pressured women for it. Hard-drinking seemed part of being on the crew. One night in November 2011, according to a police report at the time and later sworn testimony to a Forest Service investigator, Whitmer and her coworkers drank for several hours at a local bar. Things started to get fuzzy from there. She remembers hanging out with several people back at the barracks, and one crew member talking his way up to her room. Her next memory is waking up in her bed and realizing he was having sex with her. \n \n \u201cI just want these guys to stop getting these women drunk and using them for sex\u2026\u201d \n \n \u201cI heard stories \u2026 I never thought these terrible things would happen to me,\u201d she scrawled in the margins of her typed testimony in September 2013, which she sent back to the investigator. \u201cI just want these guys to stop getting these women drunk and using them for sex\u2026\u201d and: \u201cI\u2019m not the only female who has gone through this hell.\u201d \n \n Whitmer, who is now 37, did not ever press charges, telling police she didn\u2019t want to ruin his life. But she was was shocked in 2013 when she was assigned to the same fire as the crew member. \n \n \u201cThis was my first contact with [him] since the incident,\u201d she wrote in a December 2013 letter she said she shared as part of an EEO complaint. \u201cI did not know until we were in route [sic] to the fire that [he] would be there \u2026 I did not know I would have such a strong reaction to seeing him.\u201d At the fire, she told her squad leader, \u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d before she began crying and walked off the fire line. A few weeks after that, she received a letter placing her on administrative leave for \u201cdisruptive behavior.\u201d \n \n She ultimately left the Forest Service in late 2013. \n \n Speaking up \n \n A common thread in conversations with all 34 Forest Service women was that the time had come to speak up. Some formed new communities on social media where they talked about how to deal with the harassment. Others filed complaints or spoke to supervisors about harassment for the first time. They said the #MeToo movement factored into why they wanted to talk to the media. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s little girls coming up, and there\u2019s teenagers coming up \u2026 that want to be in these jobs,\u201d said Bolt, who in February was suspended, according to her, in part for failure to follow instructions for not drug testing a new mother. \u201cIf I lose my job now, but it helps it get a little bit better,\u201d it will have been worth it, she said. \n \n Meanwhile the hotshot crew member who was hit by a falling tree said she was gathering documentation to file her first ever report of misconduct, to the USDA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General. She said she\u2019d frame it as a safety issue, instead of gender discrimination, because she thought that would be more likely to get a response. \n \n Out West, Michaela Myers was offered another firefighting job in the Forest Service, not in Oregon, but with a crew in Washington. She said she\u2019d heard from a network of agency women \u2014 and hoped \u2014 that it was a better forest in which to work. \n \n And Darla Bush, who said she was told she was useless after getting pregnant, continues to pursue her class action complaint. Today, she has three girls. Two of them want to become firefighters, she said, and then started to cry. \u201cI won\u2019t say it out loud to them, but I would never wish for them to become firefighters. Not in this agency.\u201d \n \n Lorna Baldwin, Emily Carpeaux and William Brangham contributed to this reporting. \n \n Editor\u2019s Note: This story has been updated.

There are no words to express the sorrow that we are all feeling. \n \n \n \n Donations raised here will be used to provide relief and financial support to the victims and families of the horrific shooting. \n \n \n \n Together with Superintendent Robert Runcie, the School Board of Broward County, Broward County Mayor Beam Furr and Commissioners, Broward Legislative Delegation and Broward County Public Schools family, our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families, as well as the entire Marjory Stoneman Douglas community. \n \n \n \n In response to the mass shooting, the Foundation, the National Center, and GoFundMe are collaborating to serve victims by maximizing resources and ensuring a victim-centered, transparent distribution process. Broward Education Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit direct support organization solely dedicated to raising funds for Broward County Public Schools, will serve as the central repository for the Stoneman Douglas Victims\u2019 Fund and will organize a local steering committee responsible for setting the fund\u2019s distribution policy. The National Center for Victims of Crime, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and a leading authority on how victims are compensated for loss, will advise the committee, assist with ongoing fundraising efforts, administer victim application and vetting processes, and coordinate the distribution of proceeds from the Foundation\u2019s official GoFundMe campaign, other fundraisers, and third-party donation sources. GoFundMe will advise the Foundation and support both ongoing fundraising and distribution of proceeds to victims and their families. \n \n \n \n In consultation with the National Center, the Foundation will form the steering committee that includes local leaders, and victim representatives to ensure that the voices of the victims are heard, as they are integral to the distribution process. Experts with experience in mass crime victim compensation and the needs of crime victims will also be asked to serve in a volunteer capacity. The fund and committee are completely transparent, and the committee will inform the public of its deliberations in the distribution of funds. \n \n \n \n There are no platform fees for using GoFundMe, so 100% of the funds collected after payment processing charges will go directly to the victims and families. GoFundMe has also donated $50,000 to the Fund to cover the committee\u2019s and the National Center\u2019s operating costs associated with developing and implementing the distribution plan so that 100% of the donations can be distributed directly to the victims and their families. \n \n \n \n Thank you for your support. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"], "summary": "\u2013 He might not get a full military funeral, but Parkland school shooting victim Peter Wang will get a nod from the US Army.

But a State Department official said that the fact the money wasn't transferred on Jan. 1 doesn't mean it was frozen. \"There are still deliberations taking place, and we have until mid January to decide what we are going to do,\u201d the official said. \n \n The Trump administration has frozen $125 million in funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, according to three Western diplomats who were informed of the move. They said the funding, one third of the annual U.S. donations to the agency, was supposed to be transferred by Jan. 1 but was withheld. \n \n The details: The diplomats, who asked to speak on conditions of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the funding was frozen until the Trump administration finishes its review of U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority. \n \n The move comes after the Palestinian Authority suspended their contacts with the Trump administration in response to its decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. A senior White House official said no decision have been made yet, but confirmed that a review of the U.S. assistance to the Palestinians is underway \"in light of the Palestinians' recent conduct.\" \n \n The diplomats added that U.S. officials told U.N. officials in the last two days that President Trump is considering totally cutting the part of the funding which was frozen, and is even considering cutting up to $180 million, which amounts to half of the U.S. funding to UNRWA. \n \n The impact: The Western diplomats said freezing or cutting of such a big part of the U.S. funding would be catastrophic for the organization, would hamper its work and might lead to negative consequences for the Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan and Lebanon. \n \n U.N. secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has spoken with senior U.S. official about the UNRWA funding and also consulted with foreign ministers from other donor countries, according to the diplomats. \n \n The Israeli security establishment and the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories \u2014 the Israeli organization that oversees government activities in the West Bank and Gaza \u2014 are concerned about possible freezing or cutting of U.S. funding to UNRWA, fearing the escalation of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. \n \n \u201cThe humanitarian situation in Gaza is complicated enough and harming UNRWA funding will only make it more complicated,\" a senior Israeli security official told me. \n \n What we're hearing: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not enthusiastic about the cutting of U.S. funding to UNRWA, but is politically pressed by conservative ministers in his cabinet and by the fact he can't be more dovish on the Palestinian issue than President Trump. \n \n Officials in the prime minister's office told diplomats from several western countries that Israel does not object to the cutting of U.S. funding to the Palestinian Authority, but prefers that the U.S. doesn't cut funding to UNRWA due to the fact it also serves Israeli security interests. \n \n A senior Israeli official told me Netanyahu is in touch with the White House on the UNRWA funding issue, and conveyed the message that Israel prefers \u201cgradual disengagement\" with UNRWA by the U.S. and not a big funding cut. \n \n The prime minister's office said in a statement: \"Netanyahu supports President Trump's critical attitude towards UNRWA and believes practical steps need to be taken in order to change the fact that UNRWA is being used to entrench the Palestinian refugee problem instead of solving it.\"", "This is the full text of the Articles of Impeachment adopted by the House Judiciary Committee on July 27, 1974. \n \n Note: The articles of impeachment were passed only by the Committee on the Judiciary.

Nixon, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his consitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice, in that: On June 17, 1972, and prior thereto, agents of the Committee for the Re-election of the President committed unlawful entry of the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington, District of Columbia, for the purpose of securing political intelligence. Subsequent thereto, Richard M.

He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful.

Newsweek notes it's not clear which section of Article II Dowd refers to, though it speculates on one part involving the president seeking the opinion \"of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices.\" Allen notes that with this pronouncement, Trump's legal team is \"setting the stage\" to keep Trump insulated from obstruction of justice or collusion charges in the Russia probe\u2014meaning, Allen speculates, that his lawyers may be nervous charges are coming down the pike. But one of Barack Obama's former counsels notes \"it is certainly possible\" for Trump to have obstructed justice, and Allen points out Richard Nixon's Articles of Impeachment were jump-started with the assertion that Nixon \"has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice.\" But whether Trump can or can't be held responsible for such a transgression may be moot, Allen adds. \"The one thing everyone agrees on is that the House of Representatives, with its impeachment power, alone decides what is cause for removal from office,\" he writes. \"For now, at least, the House is run by Republicans.\"", "ranking": [4, 2, 0, 1, 3]}

Scientists have known for decades that a wide variety of unpleasant emotions, like shame, depression and anxiety, are linked to greater rates of ills like heart disease, inflammation, cancer and premature death. Conversely, positive feelings have been shown to be good for you. \n \n Far less is known, however, about the health benefits of specific upbeat moods \u2014 whether contentment, say, might promote good health more robustly than joy or pride does. A new study singles out one surprising emotion as a potent medicine: awe. And happily, awe seems to be much easier to come by than many might expect, even for the busy and stressed-out. \n \n For the study, published in January in the journal Emotion, researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, and other institutions focused on some particularly moody subjects: college freshmen. Ninety-four Berkeley students were recruited to fill out questionnaires about how frequently during the past month they felt various positive and negative emotions, like hostility, enthusiasm and inspiration. The students then supplied saliva samples, which were analyzed for interleukin-6, a molecule known to promote inflammation throughout the body. Because inflammation is tied to poor health, researchers figured that low levels of IL-6 might signal good health. As anticipated, when students\u2019 moods were checked against their IL-6 levels, those who had experienced more positive emotions generally had lower levels of IL-6 than classmates whose moods were more frequently sour. \n \n Researchers next enlisted 119 students to complete more elaborate questionnaires about their normal dispositions and the extent to which they had recently felt seven specific emotions: awe, amusement, compassion, contentment, joy, love and pride. The students also provided a saliva sample. While happy moods were collectively still associated with low IL-6 levels, the strongest correlation was with awe. The more frequently someone reported having felt awe-struck, the lower the IL-6. \n \n \u201cThere seems to be something about awe,\u201d says Dacher Keltner, a professor of psychology and the senior author of the study, who is also the faculty director of the Greater Good Science Center at Berkeley. (He has studied laughter, empathy and blushing, too.) \u201cIt seems to have a pronounced impact on markers related to inflammation.\u201d \n \n Somewhat surprisingly, awe isn\u2019t necessarily a rare occurrence, he adds. On average, the students in the study reported feeling the emotion three or more times a week. \u201cHow great is that?\u201d Dr. Keltner says. \n \n While acknowledging that awe is conceptually squishy and subjective, Dr. Keltner says that in general, a primary attribute of an awe-inspiring event is that it \u201cwill pass the goose-bumps test.\u201d And he advises that people \u201cseek it often.\u201d He is just not certain what that means for everyone. \u201cSome people feel awe listening to music,\u201d Dr. Keltner says, \u201cothers watching a sunset or attending a political rally or seeing kids play.\u201d \n \n \n \n For more fitness, food and wellness news, \u201clike\u201d our Facebook page.", "News \n \n Being in Awe Can Expand Time and Enhance Well-Being \n \n It doesn\u2019t matter what we\u2019ve experienced \u2013 whether it\u2019s the breathtaking scope of the Grand Canyon, the ethereal beauty of the Aurora Borealis, or the exhilarating view from the top of the Eiffel Tower \u2013 at some point in our lives we\u2019ve all had the feeling of being in a complete and overwhelming sense of awe. \n \n Awe seems to be a universal emotion, but it has been largely neglected by scientists\u2014until now. \n \n Psychological scientists Melanie Rudd and Jennifer Aaker of Stanford University Graduate School of Business and Kathleen Vohs of the University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management devised a way to study this feeling of awe in the laboratory. Across three different experiments, they found that jaw-dropping moments made participants feel like they had more time available and made them more patient, less materialistic, and more willing to volunteer time to help others. \n \n The researchers found that the effects that awe has on decision-making and well-being can be explained by awe\u2019s ability to actually change our subjective experience of time by slowing it down. Experiences of awe help to brings us into the present moment which, in turn, adjusts our perception of time, influences our decisions, and makes life feel more satisfying than it would otherwise. \n \n Now that\u2019s awesome. \n \n The study, \u201cAwe Expands People\u2019s Perception of Time, Alters Decision Making, and Enhances Well-Being,\u201d will be published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science.", "Opinions \n \n Dacher Keltner Professor of psychology at the University of California.

Let me add one more to your list: seek more daily awe. Awe is the feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends your understanding of the world. Early in human history, awe was reserved for feelings toward divine beings \u2013 e.g., gods humans invoked in the village ritual houses that sprang up some 10,000 years ago, the spirits Greek families felt guarded over their fates, and encounters with the divine at the center of the world\u2019s great spiritual traditions.

The first forays into philosophy and science put the night sky at the center of inquiry. Thales, often considered the first philosopher, was an accomplished astronomer who predicted the solar eclipse of May 28, 585 BC. An old tradition, derived from Plato, holds that after dusk he would walk about, eyes fixed on the stars, until the night he tumbled into an open well. Of course, one need not be a philosopher to be awestruck by natural beauty. Sunrises and sunsets, views from a mountaintop or from the edges of the sea, desert vistas or the silence of deep forests\u2014all of these can inspire a sense of awe and wonder. What precisely are such feelings, and from where do such experiences arise? Read More \n \n Kathryn A. Johnson Assistant research professor of psychology at Arizona State University. People often experience awe when they encounter things like the vastness of the Grand Canyon, great feats of architectural engineering, or a perfectly pitched symphonic orchestra. These \u201cpeak experiences\u201d typically involve moments of self-forgetfulness and a sense of great wonder. We simply cannot grasp the immensity of the Canyon or the colossal challenge of building the Great Pyramid. Any amazing or information-rich encounter that challenges one\u2019s ability to comprehend can elicit awe. For instance, people can also experience awe when they are exposed to new scientific theories, scientific discoveries, or novel religious and philosophical perspectives outside their perceived norm. Consequently, many psychologists study awe in terms of learning theory and cognitive development. In that sense, awe is an emotion that arises when we try to comprehend or accommodate new information that challenges, disorients, or overwhelms our existing knowledge structures.

More than 4.5 million people visited the Grand Canyon National Park in 2013; more than 3.5 million visited Yosemite. That same year, worldwide revenues for Cirque du Soleil, the Quebecois theatrical venture emphasizing extreme feats of acrobatics and agility, were close to $850 million. Fireworks displays, first developed in seventh-century China, are now featured in celebrations throughout the world at tremendous public expense. The Hubble telescope, which provides our most vivid images of outer space, initially cost $1.5 billion to launch\u2014and accumulated costs of the project have been estimated at over $10 billion. A behavioral scientist looks at these numbers and asks, Why? Why do people spend huge amounts of time, effort, and money on these apparently pointless activities? An economist might conclude that they are all an appalling waste of resources. Why are fireworks, circuses, and images of distant space experienced as so moving and meaningful, when they offer neither material nor social reward?

Let me add one more to your list: seek more daily awe. \n \n Awe is the feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends your understanding of the world. Early in human history, awe was reserved for feelings toward divine beings \u2013 e.g., gods humans invoked in the village ritual houses that sprang up some 10,000 years ago, the spirits Greek families felt guarded over their fates, and encounters with the divine at the center of the world\u2019s great spiritual traditions. \n \n In 1757, a revolution in our understanding of awe began thanks to Irish philosopher Edmund Burke. In A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful, Burke detailed how we feel the sublime (awe) not just during religious ritual or in communion with God, but in everyday perceptual experiences: in hearing thunder, in being moved by music, in seeing repetitive patterns of light and dark. Awe was to be found in daily life. \n \n Today in our Berkeley lab when we study people\u2019s narratives of awe, we find evidence of awe in the quotidian. Yes, awe arises during the extraordinary: when viewing the Grand Canyon, touching the hand of Iggy Pop, or experiencing the sacred during meditation or prayer. More frequently, though, people report feeling awe in response to more mundane things: after the perfect burrito, when seeing the leaves of a Gingko tree change from green to yellow, in beholding the night sky when camping near a river, in seeing a stranger give their food to a homeless person, in seeing their child laugh just like their brother. \n \n A new science is now asking \u201cWhy awe?\u201d This is a question we can approach in two ways. First is the distal sense of why awe became part of our species\u2019 emotional repertoire during seven million years of hominid evolution. A preliminary answer is that awe binds us to social collectives and enables us to act in more collaborative ways that enable strong groups. \n \n For example, in one study from our Berkeley lab, Michelle Shiota had participants fill in the blank of the following phrase: \u201c I AM ____.\u201d They did so 20 times, either while standing next to an awe-inspiring replica of a T. rex skeleton in UC Berkeley\u2019s Museum of Paleontology or in the exact same place but oriented to look down a hallway. Those next to the T. rex were more likely to define their individual selves in collectivist terms \u2013 as a member of a culture, a species, a university, a moral cause. Awe embeds the individual self into social collectives. \n \n Near to Berkeley\u2019s Museum of Paleontology is a stand of eucalyptus trees, the tallest in North America. When you look up into these trees, and their peeling bark and surrounding nimbus of greyish green light, goosebumps may ripple down your neck, a sure sign of awe. So in the spirit of Emerson and Muir \u2013 who found awe in nature and changed our understanding of the sublime \u2013 Paul Piff staged a minor accident near that grove to see if awe would prompt greater kindness. Participants first either looked up into the tall trees for one minute or oriented 90 degrees away to look up at the facade of a large science building. Participants then encountered a person who stumbled, dropping a handful of pens into the soft dirt. Our participants filled with awe picked up more pens. In subsequent studies, we have found that awe \u2013 more so than emotions like pride or amusement \u2013 leads people to cooperate, share resources, and sacrifice for others, all of which are requirements for our collective life. And still other studies have explained the awe-altruism link; being in the presence of vast things calls forth a more modest, less narcissistic self, which enables greater kindness toward others. \n \n A first answer, then, to the question of \u201cWhy awe?\u201d is coming into focus. In the course of our evolution, we became a most social species. We defended ourselves, hunted, reproduced, raised vulnerable offspring, slept, fought, and played in social collectives. This shift to more collective living required a new balancing act, that between the gratification of self-interest and an orientation toward enhancing the welfare of others. Awe emerged as one solution to this problem. Brief experiences of awe redefine the self in terms of the collective and orient our actions toward the interests of others. \n \n A second answer to the question of \u201cWhy awe?\u201d is of the proximal kind: what does awe do for you in the present moment? And here, the science is proving to be clear. Momentary experiences of awe stimulate wonder and curiosity. Parents have long known this. Sleep deprived, they watch, on occasion awe-struck, as their four-year-old marvels at every object in the world, in a perpetual state of awe, peppering them with endless questions of why. Biographers routinely discover this in their studies of innovators. Awe drives people to paradigm-shifting discoveries and new technologies. Such was the case of Darwin, Muir, and Einstein. Our studies at Berkeley are finding that simply watching short videos of expansive images of the Earth leads people to generate more unusual exemplars of a category (e.g., \u201cfurniture\u201d), to find greater interest in abstract paintings, and to persist longer at working at difficult puzzles when compared to appropriate control conditions. \n \n Awe also may be important for good health. The focus in our lab is on one branch of the immune system known as the cytokine system. Cytokines are chemical messengers that are often produced by cells in damaged tissue. Many cytokines elicit an inflammatory response, which is important for killing pathogens and healing wounds. Psychology is discovering that a hyperactive cytokine response renders the individual chronically sick and vulnerable to disease, a process that may be involved in how poverty shortens lives. Jennifer Stellar from our lab recently documented that of all the positive emotions humans experience, only awe predicted reduced levels of cytokines. Though this is still quite speculative, it raises the possibility that some of the pernicious effects of poverty are due to awe deprivation. \n \n One last study from our Berkeley lab speaks to the promise of daily awe. Amie Gordon gathered people\u2019s daily reports of awe for two weeks and found that it is surprisingly common in everyday living. Every third day, people feel that they are in the presence of something vast that they do not immediately comprehend. For example, seeing gold and red autumn leaves pirouette to the ground in a light wind; being moved by someone who stands up to injustice; and hearing music on a street corner at 2 AM all elicited such an experience. Intriguingly, each burst of daily awe predicted greater well-being and curiosity weeks later. \n \n Thus, I suggest that you add \u201cseek more daily awe\u201d to this year\u2019s resolutions. Take the time to pause and open your mind to those things which you do not fully understand, and you will be the better for it. \n \n Dacher Keltner is professor of psychology at the University of California."], "summary": "\u2013 News that's kind of, well, awesome: Research suggests that the feeling of awe offers a health boost, and it actually happens quite frequently. \"Some people feel awe listening to music,\" University of California, Berkeley, researcher Dacher Keltner tells the New York Times, \"others watching a sunset or attending a political rally or seeing kids play.\" When a moment has \"passed the goosebumps test,\" his team finds, it has a physical effect that can be detected in your saliva. Based on two sets of surveys of and saliva samples from freshmen at the school, Keltner's team found an apparent link between low levels of the molecule interleukin-6\u2014associated with inflammation, and thus unhealthiness\u2014and positive feelings. In the study, published in January in the journal Emotion, researchers note that \"awe was the strongest predictor of lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines.\" And students actually experienced it fairly frequently: at least three times weekly on average, the Times reports. Awe itself is the subject of increasing scientific interest, Slate notes; indeed a 2012 study found that after experiencing awe, participants felt \"like they had more time available\" and were in turn more patient and willing to help others. Writing for Slate, Keltner himself recommends that we \"seek more daily awe,\" noting that researchers have linked it to a sense of community and even more kindness. And he drives home the idea that awe can be found in moments as simple as \"after the perfect burrito.\" (Optimism, meanwhile, may have other benefits.)", "ranking": [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]}

The judge had the option to sentence Mason to anywhere between two to 20 years in prison or probation. \n \n Mason told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that she was never told she was not eligible to vote, and she would not intentionally risk her freedom to vote. \n \n \"I inflated returns,\" Mason told the Star-Telegram. \"I was trying to get more money back for my clients. I admitted that. I owned up to that. I took accountability for that. I would never do that again. I was happy enough to come home and see my daughter graduate. My son is about to graduate.

It is not automatic. Florida is similar, only there, convicted felons must wait at least five years after serving their full sentences before they can apply. (Felons\u2019 voting rights in Florida have been the subject of a high-profile court battle in recent months, and residents there will vote on the issue this year.) \n \n Other states where felons may have to apply to regain voting rights, often depending on the severity of the crime, are Wyoming, Nevada and Delaware. \n \n Prison, parole or probation? \n \n In most states, felons cannot vote while they are in prison but can regain their voting rights after they are released (as in Massachusetts and Hawaii), after they complete their parole (as in Colorado and Connecticut), or when they are no longer on parole or probation (as in New Jersey and Texas). \n \n California relaxed its rules a little in 2016. Convicted felons sentenced to county jails there can now vote while in custody, but the shift did not apply to those who were sentenced to a state or federal prison. \n \n And there are two states that do not revoke criminals\u2019 right to cast a ballot: Vermont and Maine. There, felons can vote even when they are behind bars. \n \n \u201cThe state disparities are really astounding,\u201d said Christopher Uggen, a professor of sociology and law at the University of Minnesota who also worked on the 2016 Sentencing Project study. \u201cIt is definitely confusing at election time, and many former felons are risk-averse \u2014 they may not vote if they are afraid of getting a felony conviction for illegal voting.\u201d", "[Where do states stand on voting rights for felons?

Mason tried to vote and the state did not count that vote after determining that she was ineligible. But the sentence handed down was unfair, Stevens said. \n \n \"Of the prosecutions we've seen engaging in election misconduct, the sentence that Mason received is far more aggressive,\" Stevens said. \"The problem with that, at least anecdotally, is that people of color are being prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, versus an election official actually forging signatures who got probation.\" \n \n In the end, the judge agreed with the state. Grinter said she will file an appeal with the Second Court of Appeals in Fort Worth. Grinter also said the ruling dovetails with a U. S.

The judge had the option of sentencing Mason to anything from probation to 20 years, reported the Dallas Morning News in March. Whether a felon can vote varies by state. For example, as the New York Times notes, in Vermont, a person convicted of murder retains the right to vote, even while in prison.

A pattern of abuse or a pattern of lies?] \n \n \n \n Dashawn McGrier suffered a broken jaw, nose and ribs, his attorney said. (Warren Brown) \n \n The agency has been going through an overhaul after the Justice Department under President Barack Obama found that its officers engaged in widespread discrimination and unconstitutional policing policies that disproportionately affected African Americans. The city has agreed to a federal consent decree, which imposes rules on policing and requires monitoring of the agency\u2019s activities. \n \n The latest incident happened at about 11:45 a.m. Saturday, when two officers encountered McGrier in east Baltimore. The police department said that one of the officers is familiar with McGrier and that \u201cthe situation escalated\u201d after McGrier refused to give officers identification. In the video, a second officer can be seen standing near McGrier while he is being punched. At one point, that officer, who has been placed on administrative duties while the investigation is ongoing, appeared to be trying to stop his colleague. \n \n Baltimore police said the officer who struck McGrier had been with the department for just over a year. The agency has not released his name. But Baltimore defense lawyer Warren Brown, McGrier\u2019s attorney, identified him as Arthur Williams and said the same officer arrested McGrier in June, when his client was charged with assault, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. A video of the June 26 encounter showed McGrier being held on the ground by the same officer, Brown said. \n \n [A man was shot and killed by police.

The consent decree, which is more than 200 pages, outlines rules on vehicle stops, searches, arrests and more. The department under Attorney General Jeff Sessions challenged the agreement, saying it had been rushed and would reduce the powers of the police department.

De Sousa replaced Kevin Davis, whom the mayor fired in January, citing the city\u2019s record-setting homicide rate. \n \n In February, while De Sousa was commissioner, a report raised questions about the qualification of Baltimore\u2019s academy recruits. Sgt. Josh Rosenblatt, the academy\u2019s head of legal instruction, told the Baltimore Sun that a third of recruits don\u2019t have an understanding of the laws on constitutional policing, but the department gives them badges anyway. \n \n Brown, McGrier\u2019s defense attorney, said the beating \u201cmight be Exhibit 1 in that regard.\u201d \n \n \u201cThis officer is fresh out of the academy, which makes you wonder what are they teaching them there and what type of psychological screening they employ with these cadets,\u201d Brown said. \n \n A spokesman for the police department did not answer questions about the officer\u2019s performance while in the academy. \n \n The Baltimore Sun reported that the officer graduated from the academy in April. A video of a ceremony that month showed a graduate named Officer Arthur Williams receiving three top honors, including the Police Commissioner\u2019s Award of Excellence and the Director\u2019s Leadership Award.

Brown said McGrier was not being charged with a crime, but was taken to a hospital and was having X-rays taken of his jaw, nose and ribs late Saturday for suspected fractures from the altercation. \n \n Brown said McGrier had a previous run-in with the same police officer \u2014 whom he identified as Officer Arthur Williams \u2014 in June that resulted in McGrier being charged with assaulting the officer, disorderly conduct, obstructing and hindering, and resisting arrest. Brown said that in that incident and in the one Saturday, McGrier was targeted without justification by the officer. \n \n \u201cIt seems like this officer had just decided that Dashawn was going to be his punching bag,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd this was a brutal attack that was degrading and demeaning to my client, to that community, and to the police department.\u201d \n \n Williams could not be reached for comment. \n \n Tuggle did not identify the officer or the man who was punched, but the department said the officer has been on the force for just over a year. \n \n At Williams\u2019 graduation from the police academy last year, he received awards for top performance, including for high marks in \"defense tactics, physical training and emergency vehicle operations,\u201d for his \"academic achievement, professional attitude, appearance, ability to supervise,\u201d and for his \"tireless and unwavering dedication\" and \"outstanding leadership ability,\u201d according to a video of the graduation ceremony. \n \n The police department said the incident Saturday began after two officers stopped McGrier, let him go, then approached him again to give him a citizen contact sheet. \n \n \u201cWhen he was asked for his identification, the situation escalated when he refused,\u201d the department said. \u201cThe police officer then struck the man several times.\u201d \n \n Brown said McGrier was sitting on steps when Williams passed by in his vehicle, then moments later was walking down the street when the officer, now on foot, told him to stop without giving him a reason. \n \n \u201cMy client was saying, \u2018What is this all about? You don\u2019t even have probable cause,\u2019 \u201d Brown said. That\u2019s when Williams began shoving McGrier, Brown said. \n \n Tuggle asked anyone who witnessed the incident to contact the Office of Professional Responsibility at 410-396-2300. \n \n \u201cWhile I have an expectation that officers are out of their cars, on foot, and engaging citizens, I expect that it will be done professionally and constitutionally,\u201d he said. \u201cI have zero tolerance for behavior like I witnessed on the video today. Officers have a responsibility and duty to control their emotions in the most stressful of situations.\u201d \n \n The incident occurred Saturday outside Q\u2019s Bar and Liquors in the 2600 block of E. Monument St. in East Baltimore. \n \n The video shows the officer pushing McGrier against a wall, with his hand on McGrier\u2019s chest, and then McGrier pushing the officer\u2019s hand off his chest. It is then that the officer starts swinging. \n \n The officer throws repeated punches, shoves McGrier onto rowhouse steps and continues beating him until McGrier lands on the pavement. McGrier appears to be bleeding when he gets to the ground. \n \n McGrier appears to try to deflect some of the officer\u2019s punches but does not punch back. \n \n A second officer, who the department did not identify, briefly places his hand on McGrier\u2019s arm as McGrier tries to avoid the blows but does not appear to try to stop the first officer from throwing punches. \n \n Shantel Allen, 28, who said she grew up with McGrier and considers him like a brother, called the escalation of the encounter by Williams shocking. \n \n \u201cI was speechless. I was enraged. I was hurt. I was shocked more than anything. That is really something you don\u2019t expect,\u201d she said. \u201cI truly feel as though this officer needs to be dealt with in a very serious manner, so none of his fellow officers or anyone else in the criminal justice system feels like they can use this kind of force. \n \n \u201cThis is a crime. You can\u2019t just go around putting your hands on people,\u201d she said. \n \n Brown said Internal Affairs officers were at the hospital to speak with McGrier. Brown said he also had spoken with the office of Baltimore State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby. Mosby\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. \n \n The police department said Mosby\u2019s office \u201cprovided information related to this case,\u201d but did not explain what that meant. \n \n Several men on Monument Street at the time \u2014 who asked not to be named, for fear of reprisal from the police for discussing the matter \u2014 said the officer who threw the punches knew McGrier from prior interactions, and that they believed he was targeting him. \n \n They said the officer is young and had previously worked foot patrol along the corridor, but recently began working out of a car. \n \n The men said the officer stopped McGrier on Saturday without good reason, which is why McGrier was talking back to the officer before the officer started throwing punches. \n \n \u201cHe knows his rights, and he felt as though his rights were being violated, and he took offense to that,\u201d one man said. \n \n That the officer responded physically was completely out of line, and must result in serious consequences, the men said. \n \n \u201cWe want justice. We don\u2019t want things like that to happen. We want him to be held accountable, and not no paid suspension,\u201d one man said. \n \n Mayor Catherine Pugh echoed Tuggle in a statement late Saturday, in which she also called the encounter between the officer and McGrier \u201cdisturbing.\u201d She said she was in touch with Tuggle and had \u201cdemanded answers and accountability.\u201d", "... \n \n d with the keys in the ignition. You can help prevent auto theft. \n \n No matter how cold it is outside, never leave your vehicle unattende"], "summary": "\u2013 An incident that \"deeply disturbed\" Baltimore's interim police commissioner has led to one police officer's resignation and another being put on administrative duty. CNN has bystander video of a man shouting at one officer as another stands nearby; the first starts throwing punches and 10 seconds later both men are on the ground, with the officer on top and blood from the civilian streaked across the sidewalk. The second officer is seen trying to get his hands into the tussle but doesn't appear to try to stop the first officer's punches. Neither officer has been identified, but Warren Brown, an attorney repping the civilian, identifies his client to the Baltimore Sun as 26-year-old Dashawn McGrier. Brown says the cops stopped his client without offering a reason; witnesses tell the Sun the officer who threw the punches knew McGrier and may have targeted him. In a statement, the Baltimore PD says the cops stopped McGrier as part of a crime probe; they say McGrier refused to provide ID for a citizen's contact sheet, said to be required when cops talk to a citizen during an investigation. After initially being suspended, the punch-throwing officer resigned, per the Baltimore PD; the second officer is still on administrative duties pending an investigation. McGrier wasn't charged, police say. Brown says McGrier suffered jaw, rib, and nose fractures, per the Washington Post. \"I have zero tolerance for behavior like I witnessed on the video today,\" Gary Tuggle, the PD's interim commissioner, said. \"Officers have a responsibility and duty to control their emotions in the most stressful of situations.\" Brown says McGrier will sue, per WBAL.

Sanctions that have so far focused on individuals via visa bans and asset freezes may be expanded to target specific areas of the economy. \n \n President Vladimir Putin sent his popularity surging to a five-year high by making Crimea a part of Russia again after 60 years and says he won\u2019t be swayed by foreign retaliation. Even so, the costs of the decision are starting to unfold, with Russian stocks this year\u2019s worst performers and the economy set to suffer more than the West, said Mircea Geoana, Romania\u2019s government representative for diplomacy and economic projects. \n \n It's Personal: The Individuals Targeted by U.S. Sanctions \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re witnessing the start of a new geopolitical and economic Cold War and I think it will take at least two to three years to establish some sort of equilibrium,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ones who\u2019ll pay the bill for this aggression, no matter how popular and patriotic it looks, will be the Russian people because there\u2019s a huge difference between the economic force of the EU and the U.S. and that of Russia.\u201d \n \n Stocks, Ruble \n \n Russia\u2019s Micex stock index has plunged 13.7 percent this year compared with a 5 percent decline for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. It was down 0.7 percent at 6:50 p.m. in Moscow. \n \n The ruble is the second-worst performer against the dollar behind Argentina among 24 developing-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg, weakening 9 percent. It rose 0.4 percent today. \n \n Full Coverage of the Crisis in Ukraine: \n \n Investors pulled out $5.5 billion from Russian equities and bonds this year through March 20, already approaching the total outflow of $6.1 billion for the whole 2013, according to data compiled by EPFR Global, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based firm tracking fund flows. \n \n After the U.S. expanded sanctions March 20 to include businessmen linked to Putin, such as billionaires Gennady Timchenko and Arkady Rotenberg, Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch Ratings cut their outlook on Russia\u2019s credit grade to negative from stable, suggesting a downgrade is most likely next. \n \n The two companies, which said Western banks are becoming reluctant to lend to Russia, rate the world\u2019s biggest energy exporter at BBB, the second-lowest investment grade and on par with Brazil and South Africa. \n \n Crisis Signs \n \n A Snapshot of Ukraine's Past and Future \n \n Even before the standoff with the West, the worst since the Cold War, Russia\u2019s economy was facing the weakest growth since a 2009 recession as consumer demand failed to make up for sagging investment. The current situation in the economy \u201cbears clear signs of a crisis,\u201d Deputy Economy Minister Sergei Belyakov said March 17 after the first European Union and U.S. sanctions. \n \n Russia will probably dip into a recession in the second and third quarters of this year as \u201cdomestic demand is set to halt on the uncertainty shock and tighter financial conditions,\u201d according to Moscow-based VTB. \n \n Russia\u2019s central bank unexpectedly raised its benchmark interest rate by 150 basis points after the armed takeover of Crimea triggered a rout in the ruble. Putin completed his annexation of the Black Sea peninsula March 21. \n \n \u2018Mosquito Bite\u2019 \n \n Russia may shun foreign debt markets in 2014 because of higher borrowing costs, according to Finance Minister Anton Siluanov. He expressed frustration at disruptions to MasterCard Inc. and Visa services for cards issued by banks on or linked to persons on the U.S. sanctions list. \n \n \u201cSome people say these sanctions won\u2019t affect Russia\u2019s financial system but they already are,\u201d he said March 21. \n \n Even so, the measures may not have much effect on the individuals targeted or on Putin\u2019s thinking on Ukraine, whose government accuses the Russian leader of stirring up unrest elsewhere and planning an invasion of the country\u2019s east. \n \n The sanctions represent \u201ca mosquito bite\u201d because most officials on the list aren\u2019t permitted to travel abroad privately and have most of their business in Russia, said Konstantin Kostin, a Kremlin adviser who heads the Civil Society Development Fund. Government members featured in a new EU list March 21 include Putin aides Sergei Glazyev and Vladislav Surkov. \n \n Putin, meanwhile, would require stiffer penalties to budge, according to Ariel Cohen, senior fellow at the Republican-leaning Heritage Foundation in Washington. \n \n No Retreat \n \n \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with an individual who won\u2019t be easily intimidated,\u201d he said March 21 by phone from Washington. \u201cThe West is escalating sanctions but Russia isn\u2019t going to back off on Crimea and Ukraine that easily. It will take more than pinpointed individual sanctions to start rolling this back.\u201d \n \n Russia imposed retaliatory sanctions on 13 Canadians today, banning them from entering the country. In a possible escalation, U.S. President Barack Obama has authorized potential future penalties on Russian industries, including financial services, energy, metals and mining, defense and engineering. \n \n The EU, which relies on Russia for a third of its energy imports, has struggled to find ways of punishing Putin because trade steps risk damaging Europe\u2019s economy. Banking curbs would hurt Britain, an arms embargo would bar France from selling Mistral-class helicopter carriers to the Kremlin and cutbacks in gas purchases would harm a swathe of EU nations. \n \n Threat Effect \n \n The declines in Russian stocks, weakness in the ruble and the risk of downgrades to the country\u2019s credit rating show threats of future sanctions can erode business confidence and hurt the economy, according to Fredrik Erixon, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy. \n \n \u201cInvestors and ratings agencies are basing their views not on what\u2019s happened with sanctions so far but on what may happen,\u201d he said March 21 by phone from Brussels. \n \n The benchmark Micex stock index has lost 13 percent and the ruble is down 8.4 percent against the dollar since Nov. 21, the start of protests that ousted Kremlin-backed former President Viktor Yanukovych and triggered the crisis. \n \n Capital outflows from Russia may reach $70 billion in the first quarter, more than the $63 billion recorded in the whole of 2013, London-based Capital Economics Ltd. said last week in a report. \n \n Outflows of $100 billion this year would risk zero growth, Herman Gref, chief executive officer of Russia\u2019s biggest lender, OAO Sberbank, said today. \n \n To contact the reporters on this story: Andra Timu in Bucharest at atimu@bloomberg.net; Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.net; Olga Tanas in Moscow at otanas@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editors responsible for this story: Balazs Penz at bpenz@bloomberg.net Andrew Langley", "Visa and MasterCard suspended services for Bank Rossiya, whose main branch in St. Petersburg is shown here. (Photo: Elena Ignatyeva, AP) \n \n MOSCOW \u2014 Sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle won't affect him, experts here say, but average Russians believe it is they who will feel the brunt of the economic penalties. \n \n The United States and Europe have issued travel bans and asset freezes against 20 Russian officials and businessmen to deter the Kremlin from further aggression against Ukraine, where Russian troops have effectively taken over the province of Crimea. \n \n \"The position of officialdom and business is that these sanctions aren't hitting Russia very hard, while harsher economic sanctions are problematic for Western countries themselves,\" said Dmitry Danilov, head of the European security department at the Institute of Europe of the Russian Academy of Sciences. \n \n The effects of the sanctions were felt in Moscow on Friday, where several banks said that Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services for payment transactions. \n \n Visa and MasterCard suspended services on Friday for Bank Rossiya, whose shareholder, Yuri Kovalchuk, is widely reputed to be close to Putin. Both Kovalchuk and Bank Rossiya fell under the sanctions imposed Thursday. \n \n The bank, ranked the 17th largest in Russia, provides services for 24,000 corporate clients and 470,000 private clients. Russia's SMP Bank, whose shareholders, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, had been sanctioned, also said that Visa and MasterCard had suspended services for the bank's card holders. \n \n The credit card companies resumed working with SMP on Saturday, Interfax quoted a bank representative as saying, because the sanctions had been imposed on shareholders but not on the bank itself. \n \n However, credit card services at Bank Rossiya continued to be blocked. Ordinary Russians feared the fallout from the sanctions would trickle down to them. \n \n \"These sanctions are taking us back to central planning,\" said entrepreneur Sonya Sokolova, who heads the Zvuki.ru online music portal. \"No one can punish Russia as much as it punishes itself.\" \n \n Others who have grown accustomed to taking advantage of Western payment transaction services such as Visa and MasterCard fear that the problems could spread to other banks, with entrepreneurs asking who could be next after Kovalchuk and the Rotenberg brothers. \n \n The problem will affect mostly regular workers, says Sokolova. Employees are increasingly asking that their salaries be transferred in cash, local entrepreneurs told Moscow news media. \n \n Russia's RTS index fell 4.5% on Friday on news of the new round of Washington sanctions. But what Russians feared more than the sanctions themselves were the Russian government's response to the penalties. \n \n A bill was introduced into Russia's parliament on Friday to ban transaction services that were based outside of Russia. While the draft was part of a bid to develop Russia's own transaction services, in effect it would mean that credit card companies such as Visa and MasterCard would not service clients in Russia. \n \n \"The fact that our banks use infrastructure that they cannot control carries a real threat for national security and makes it possible for Russian banks to be cut off from international payment services, in the manner which we have seen today,\" ITAR-TASS quoted lawmaker Vladislav Reznik, who introduced the bill, as saying on Friday. \n \n \"There is talk of creating a national payment transaction system, and what that means is that no one's deposits will be safe,\" said Sokolova, the entrepreneur. \"Isolation will increase.\" \n \n \"From the standpoint of the average population, they will blame the West for this, not Putin,\" Sokolova said, noting that polls indicate Putin's popularity has skyrocketed since Russia intervened in Ukraine earlier this month. \n \n Danilov said the current sanctions would not be very effective. \n \n \"There is no consensus on sanction within the European Union,\" which has a trade turnover of nearly $400 billion with Russia that many EU countries would not want to jeopardize. \n \n \"Given Russia's power structure, it's clear that business is oriented toward politics and they would have to adapt [to new political realities] in any case,\" Danilov said. \"Business and officialdom are more concerned about the situation in Ukraine and their trade ties there than they are about the sanctions.\" \n \n Putin laughed off the sanctions on Friday, joking that he would have to \"stay away\" from the 20 sanctioned officials. He warned that Russia can sanction, too, and has issued travel bans to Moscow against Western officials. He also pledged to open an account at Bank Rossiya out of solidarity. \n \n Pro-Kremlin expert and adviser Sergei Markov said that average Russians would not really be affected by the sanctions. \n \n \"In fact, they will be enthusiastic about the sanctions, because they help solve one of Russia's key problem, that the elite is seen as stealing Russia's resources and taking them abroad,\" Markov said. \n \n \"These sanctions lower the dependence of Russia's business elite on the West.

He and a partner owned half of RosUkrEnergo, which was founded in 2004 and emerged as Ukraine\u2019s sole gas importer in 2006 to 2009, between price disputes with Russia that led to supply halts and shortages across Europe. \n \n Gazprom oversaw the other half of RosUkrEnergo, which Ukraine\u2019s security service in 2005 said may be indirectly controlled by Semion Mogilevich, an organized crime suspect on the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s most-wanted list.

The RosUkrEnergo deals allowed the company to sell cheap gas from Turkmenistan at much higher rates in Europe, which helped subsidize Ukraine\u2019s domestic market. Gazprom investors criticized the scheme at the time for introducing an unnecessary player in transactions that the Russian monopoly could perform itself. \n \n \u2018Personal Bank\u2019 \n \n The twin pillars of Putin\u2019s economy, Gazprom, the world\u2019s largest gas producer, and state oil champion OAO Rosneft (ROSN), are already both potential targets of sanctions. Gazprom Chief Executive Officer Alexey Miller and Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin may be among officials banned from the European Union, Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper reported March 15, a move the bloc has yet to carry out in two rounds of sanctions. \n \n Obama signed a separate order on March 20 authorizing potential penalties on Russian industries such as energy, finance, mining and defense. Bank Rossiya, a St. Petersburg lender founded by three Putin associates in 1990, was put on the sanctions list last for being, as the Treasury Department said, \u201cthe personal bank for senior officials.\u201d \n \n Graphic: What Crimea Is Costing Putin \n \n Leaders of the U.S., the European Union, China, Japan and others meet in The Hague today, with Obama seeking to mobilize opposition to Putin\u2019s incursion into Crimea. \n \n Russian anti-corruption activist and opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who\u2019s under house arrest in Moscow, said March 20 that Miller and Sechin, as longtime Putin allies with key positions in his power structure, should be included in any regime of penalties put together by the West. \n \n \u2018Loyal Elite\u2019 \n \n \u201cWestern nations could deliver a serious blow to the luxurious lifestyle enjoyed by the Kremlin\u2019s cronies who shuttle between Russia and the West,\u201d Navalny said in a commentary in the New York Times. (NYT) \u201cThis means freezing the oligarchs\u2019 financial assets and seizing their property.\u201d \n \n Miller, 52, and Sechin, 53, both worked for Putin in the St. Petersburg mayor\u2019s office in the 1990s. Miller, CEO since 2001, declined to comment on the possibility of his inclusion on the blacklist, according to Kupriyanov. Sechin, a former deputy premier who\u2019s overseen Rosneft since 2004 as chairman, then CEO, denounced all Western \u201cthreats and blackmail,\u201d according to an e-mailed comment. \n \n \u201cAs far as the loyal elite is concerned, sanctions have always led to a consolidation of forces to counter pressure from outside,\u201d said Sechin, who spearheaded Rosneft\u2019s takeover of Yukos Oil Co. to become Russia\u2019s largest crude producer after the 2003 jailing of Yukos owner Mikhail Khodorkovsky. \n \n Excluding Miller and Sechin leaves \u201cheadroom for additional sanctions,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, an analyst at Eurasia Group in New York. So far, the U.S. sanctions have been \u201ctargeted,\u201d unlike the sweeping penalties against Iran over its nuclear program that are designed to sever \u201cvast swathes of the economy\u201d from the West, Kupchan said in a research note. \n \n FBI Probe \n \n The U.S. law, if passed by both houses of Congress and signed by Obama, would authorize the president to impose sanctions against Russian officials or their associates or family members involved in the \u201cexpropriation of private or public assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, bribery, or the facilitation or transfer of the proceeds of corruption to foreign jurisdictions.\u201d \n \n Firtash, worth $2.3 billion according to Kiev-based Korrespondent magazine, was arrested March 14 on suspicion of bribery and criminal conspiracy, according to an Austrian police statement. The charges are the result of several years of investigation by the FBI and aren\u2019t \u201crelated to recent events in Ukraine,\u201d the U.S. Department of Justice said. \n \n Firtash, who owns titanium assets in Crimea, paid a record 125 million-euro ($172 million) bail on March 20 to win release during extradition hearings. He criticized his arrest as a \u201cpurely political\u201d act. \n \n Boeing, India \n \n The case involves allegations of bribes paid by a Swiss company controlled by Firtash, Bothli, to obtain licenses to mine titanium ore in Andhra Pradesh with a state-run Indian company and build plants to produce titanium sponge with Boeing Co. (BA) in India, according to two people familiar with the investigation who asked not to be identified. \n \n Boeing agreed in 2006 to conduct a feasibility study into the project with Bothli and then decided not to pursue it, the Chicago-based company said in an e-mailed response to questions. Firtash\u2019s point man for the project, Suren Gevorgyan, said Bothli never paid a bribe to get permits because India was eager to receive Boeing\u2019s planned investment. \n \n The charges seem designed to get Firtash inside the U.S. and persuade him to cut a deal for information about Gazprom and people close to Putin, Ariel Cohen, senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, said by phone. \n \n \u2018Severe Consequences\u2019 \n \n \u201cFirtash was very deeply involved in the fine print of Gazprom\u2019s dealings in Ukraine, in the financial transactions,\u201d said Korchemkin of East European Gas Analysis. \u201cIf Firtash strikes a deal with the FBI and starts to give testimony it could threaten severe consequences for Gazprom managers and the company itself.\u201d \n \n Any disclosure that shows Gazprom managers causing losses to U.S. investors, who hold more than half of the company\u2019s depositary receipts, could lead to sanctions, major fines and lawsuits, Korchemkin said. Putin\u2019s political protege, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, was Gazprom\u2019s chairman in 2002-2008. Medvedev\u2019s spokeswoman, Natalia Timakova, declined to comment on the possibility that the premier may face sanctions. \n \n \u201cThese sanctions are designed to touch important people close to the Kremlin and have a geopolitical impact rather than a direct effect on earnings at other banks,\u201d said Hadrien de Belle, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods, a New-York based financial services company. \u201cThis has to be perceived as going after the financial conduits for the wealth of the targets.\u201d \n \n Abramovich, Usmanov \n \n Two other billionaires close to Putin, former Gazprom adviser Alisher Usmanov and Roman Abramovich, both of whom are shareholders of London soccer clubs, are prime candidates for sanctions, said Navalny, the opposition leader. \n \n The bulk of Abramovich\u2019s $14 billion wealth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire\u2019s Index, came from the sale of OAO Sibneft, the oil company he acquired for about $100 million in 1996. He sold it to Gazprom for $13 billion a decade later. Abramovich\u2019s spokesman, John Mann, declined to comment. \n \n Usmanov, 60, is Russia\u2019s richest man, with a fortune of $17.4 billion. He cut his U.S. stock holdings this year, selling his shares in Apple Inc. and reducing his interest in Facebook Inc., according to Ivan Streshinskiy, head of Usmanov\u2019s asset-management company USM Advisors LLC. \n \n Sanctions are \u201ccounterproductive\u201d for all parties involved because the global economy is interconnected, Usmanov told reporters in Moscow on March 20. He didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment sent to his representatives. \n \n \u201cEveryone has to decide whether they want to bring back their assets to Russia and stay within sealed borders,\u201d Lipman of the Carnegie Center said. \u201cThis is a bleak prospect for many people.\u201d \n \n To contact the reporters on this story: Irina Reznik in Moscow at ireznik@bloomberg.net; Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editors responsible for this story: Hellmuth Tromm at htromm@bloomberg.net; Balazs Penz at bpenz@bloomberg.net Brad Cook", "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Cameron: \"There's not going to be a G8 summit this year in Russia\" \n \n The G8 summit will not take place in Russia this year, UK Prime Minister David Cameron has said. \n \n Speaking in the Netherlands, Mr Cameron said it was \"absolutely clear\" the planned June meeting of world leaders in the Russian resort of Sochi would not happen owing to events in Ukraine. \n \n The EU and US have imposed sanctions on Russian officials after Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. \n \n Moscow has also been warned of further action if it does not change course. \n \n The announcement that the Sochi meeting had been effectively cancelled came after Russian troops seized control of the last major military base in Crimea. \n \n Mr Cameron, US President Barack Obama and other G8 leaders are attending a nuclear co-operation summit in The Hague, to which Russian President Vladimir Putin was not invited. \n \n 'Illegal annexation' \n \n \"We should be clear there's not going to be a G8 summit in Russia,\" Mr Cameron said, urging Russia to \"change course\". \n \n The G7 leaders plus EU representatives issued a declaration after their meeting in The Hague noting that \"international law prohibits the acquisition of part or all of another state's territory through coercion or force\". \n \n Image copyright AFP \n \n \"To do so violates the principles upon which the international system is built,\" they said. \n \n \"We condemn the illegal referendum held in Crimea in violation of Ukraine's constitution.

{"document": ["Abstract \n \n During 1988 through 1990, California experienced its worst measles epidemic in more than a decade, with 16,400 reported cases, 3,390 hospital admissions, and 75 deaths. More than half of the patients were younger than 5 years; the highest incidence was among infants younger than 12 months. The epidemic centered in low-income Hispanic communities in southern and central California. The major cause of the epidemic was low immunization levels among preschool-aged children and young adults. Rates of complications, admission to hospital, and death were surprisingly high. Outbreak control efforts met with indeterminate success. Problems with these efforts included insufficient funding early in the epidemic and disappointing public response to community-based immunization campaigns. The cost of medical care and outbreak control for the epidemic is conservatively estimated at $30.9 million. Unless the level of immunization in preschool-aged children is increased, this type of epidemic will probably recur.", "Bill Gates proves that one person can make a difference\u2014if he happens to be the richest person in the world. Since forming the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2014and especially since leaving Microsoft in 2008 to dedicate himself full-time to the foundation\u2019s work\u2014Gates and his wife Melinda have emerged as two of history\u2019s most powerful philanthropists, funding efforts from polio eradication to sewage-treatment plants, and setting the agenda for aid organizations around the world. They have convinced 127 fellow billionaires to sign their giving pledge, an oath to donate the majority of their wealth to philanthropic organizations. Today, the Gates Foundation has an endowment of $42 billion, almost four times the size of the Ford Foundation, and it distributes between $3 and $4 billion every year. As WIRED Science writer Maryn McKenna put it a few years ago, \u201cWhere Gates goes, governments and the media follow.\u201d \n \n So when Gates releases his annual letter each January, summarizing the foundation\u2019s progress and laying out its priorities for the coming year, the world pays attention. Last year\u2019s edition, a feisty debunking of \u201cmyths\u201d about poverty, went viral. This year\u2019s letter, co-written by both Bill and Melinda Gates and released today, is even more ambitious than usual. Titled \u201cOur Big Bet for the Future,\u201d it lays out a series of goals for the next decade and a half\u2014cutting childhood deaths by half, eradicating polio and three other diseases, and making Africa capable of feeding itself, among others. Altogether, the letter predicts, \u201cthe lives of people in poor countries will improve faster in the next 15 years than at any other time in history.\u201d \n \n The letter is modeled on the UN\u2019s Millennium Development Goals, a set of 15-year targets that expire this year and that Gates refers to as \u201cone of the most important documents the UN ever did.\u201d Representatives from every country in the world signed the goals in 2000, pledging among other things to reduce extreme poverty by 50 percent, slash child mortality by two thirds, and cut the maternal mortality rate by three quarters. Although not every target was reached\u2014a full report card can be found here\u2014the document is generally credited with focusing global aid efforts and providing a yardstick against which they can be measured. The UN is set to introduce a new set of development goals this September, and some observers worry that they will be a disappointment rather than an inspiration. Writing for the Guardian, Kevin Watkins frets that the discussions to date have been \u201champered by a paralyzing lack of ambition, weak leadership, and the absence of a credible agenda to galvanise public engagement.\u201d \n \n That certainly does not describe this year\u2019s Gates letter, the most rabble-rousing edition to date. Toward the end, the Gateses announce Global Citizens, a new program to educate and inspire action among the general public. \u201cWe want to give global citizens a way to lend their voice, urging governments, companies, and nonprofits to make these issues a priority,\u201d the letter explains. In particular, the Foundation will ask its Global Citizens to push for a meaningful reboot of the UN\u2019s Millennium Goals, and to hold their governments accountable for meeting those targets. It\u2019s a surprisingly populist approach for the Foundation, which has tended to turn to billionaires for the bulk of its support. \n \n In a wide-ranging phone conversation, WIRED spoke with Gates about this year\u2019s letter, global inequality, and President Obama\u2019s tax proposals. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. \n \n __The UN is working on its update to the Millennium Development Goals. How do you think it\u2019s going? __ \n \n We\u2019re definitely on track. It will be a much longer document, and a broader set of goals than the MDGs were. \n \n But the MDGs were so powerful because they were so succinct. Do you worry that if these goals become too broad, it will be harder to keep people focused? \n \n That absolutely is a concern that I have. Then again, there are unfinished MDGs, and they will always have a very unique position. Key things like child health are so critical. If you have malnutrition you can\u2019t do education very well. \n \n I do think the new document will be so long that fewer people will read the whole thing. Then again, when we talk about books like the Koran or the Bible, not everybody reads every word of those things. I think of the MDGs like the Ten Commandments. \n \n You operate from the belief that the world is radically improving in the fields of health, agriculture, and poverty. But there\u2019s one area that you flick at in this letter where things seem to be getting worse, and that\u2019s climate change. We\u2019ve just learned that 2014 was the hottest year on record. Tech solutions are being developed, but they\u2019re facing headwinds\u2014be it political stagnation or extremely cheap gas prices. Do you have the same sense of optimism when you look at energy? \n \n I have billions invested in various energy-related things\u2014like battery companies, or cheaper ways of making electricity. I have a company that\u2019s working on something called fourth-gen nuclear, this new super-safe nuclear design. So I think it is feasible to have energy sources that are even cheaper\u2014although, as you say, that benchmark gets tougher as the price of natural gas and oil are so low. \n \n There\u2019s no doubt that we\u2019re going to have some warming even as we start to deploy these solutions, because of the lags in the system. Nathan Myhrvold has written a few articles on this, about how even if you do the right things you still have some locked-in change. \n \n I\u2019ve been a big proponent that rich world governments should raise their energy R&D budgets. It is possible\u2014based on the basic science of big energy, nuclear fuels, the photons that hit the earth from the sun\u2014to have cheap energy. In the meantime we have to do some adaptation, which is mostly investing in agricultural systems so that farmers in the areas that will be most affected can have enough productivity and enough storage so that if they have lean years, their kids are not significantly malnourished. \n \n __You\u2019ve dedicated a ton of resources to delivering vaccines to remote areas of the world. It must drive you nuts when people in the rich world choose not to vaccinate their kids. __ \n \n I just read this book called On Immunity: An Inoculation\u2014which is so well written, it\u2019s unbelievable\u2014that talks about this. It\u2019s a little bit unsurprising considering you\u2019re saying to parents, \u201cHey, take this needle and inject it into your kid! Honestly, we\u2019re sure that it does no harm!\u201d It really takes explaining to people why this is not only beneficial to their child but to society as a whole. \n \n The anti-vaccination crowd, it\u2019s very unfortunate. They create risk and in some cases there have been pertussis-based deaths and measles deaths. Those are the two that show up pretty quickly when you get any group of kids that haven\u2019t been vaccinated. People thought, \u201cOK, we have the Internet, information will get out there.\u201d But misinformation got out there as well. \n \n I do think we\u2019ll keep vaccination rates high in the US. Rationality will succeed. But it will take cases like this Disneyland thing to remind people how irresponsible it is. The science about the safety is very, very strong. \n \n Another source of discouraging data: income inequality. You\u2019ve read Thomas Piketty\u2019s Capital, and had nice things to say about it. But you also said that some inequality is built into the capitalist system, and the question is when it begins to do more harm than good. Has inequality become a hinderance? \n \n I don\u2019t think in some huge way. Of course, at a global level, income inequality is going down, because countries like China and India are getting richer much, much faster than the rich world is getting richer. So the overall picture on income inequality is very, very positive. And yet, each country has to look at the fact that, because of the nature of capitalism, there\u2019s a tendency at the country level to have greater inequality unless you have tax policies to moderate it. So it\u2019s a great democratic debate: What should those tax policies be? For the one country whose tax policies I know, the US, I\u2019ve been in favor of more progressive tax approaches. \n \n I also think philanthropy, although not a total solution to it, does moderate the problem. Especially if those who have been lucky give of their time and money to causes\u2014like improving education or health\u2014that speak to the most basic inequities. \n \n So it\u2019s a great topic for debate. A democracy is a self-correcting system, and over time I\u2019d expect them to get it right. The founders were a little worried that the masses would get rid of capitalist incentives by going too far, but at least in the US that certainly hasn\u2019t been a problem. The system has worked well for hundreds of years. \n \n We\u2019re speaking the day of the State of the Union. What do you think of the President\u2019s tax proposals? \n \n I don\u2019t know the specifics very well so I really can\u2019t comment. Just being pragmatic, the likelihood of a change in the tax system is fairly low. But I\u2019ll be very interested. He no doubt will be promoting things that are progressive in nature so it\u2019ll be interesting to see what he picks. \n \n Let\u2019s talk about your Global Citizen Initiative. This seems like a departure for you. How did it come about? \n \n Some 6.5 million children die every year. There\u2019s a subset of that where there\u2019s an earthquake or flood, and people are so anxious to give and help. It reminds you that when people can connect and have an image of what\u2019s going on, in those acute situations, they care and are willing to get involved. But 98 percent of childhood death comes from chronic, ongoing things, not those headline, one-time events. It\u2019s malaria every day, diarrhea every day, pneumonia every day. The idea is that, if you sign up, on an ongoing basis, a few times a month we\u2019ll give you an update on how things are going. It won\u2019t just be a headline about an earthquake. \n \n The idea is getting people to use their voice to say their governments should continue to be generous on aid. We're dealing with tight budgets. Even countries that have been generous, like the Netherlands or Australia, have made cuts to their aid budgets. And within the universe of NGOs, some are agricultural, some are environmental, some are health, you can pick one of those that you want to dive down into and get involved with. \n \n That is a new thing. We\u2019re not sure how well that will resonate. But we do think people\u2019s basic morality, the desire to care about humanity broadly, that it\u2019s fairly timely. There\u2019s a bit of a vacuum there. There\u2019s not an alternate way for people to grab on and see how they might contribute more. \n \n At the same time, critics have grown dismissive of \u201cclicktivism,\u201d little bursts of online activity that don\u2019t result in any sustained commitment or change. How do you keep this from being a mile wide and an inch deep? \n \n The starting point is very shallow. But the beauty is you can use that to get in more deeply. If you sign up to be a global citizen, we won\u2019t send you too much email but we\u2019ll say, \u201cHey, if you\u2019re interested in going to Africa, not only can you do some interesting fun things, but you\u2019d have a chance to get exposed to these issues, see this stuff on the ground.\u201d Once you do that, people tend to get hooked. They\u2019ll see something and latch onto it\u2014a particular village or disease. \n \n But you\u2019re right. Just because we have 10 million global citizens who give us their email address, that\u2019s not our final metric. That\u2019s a starting metric. The metric I care about is people who get involved in real activism, really take trips, really start donating and volunteering. This is just a gateway toward deeper involvement, if we do our job right.", "The vaccination exemption rate among kindergarten students in California \u2014 cases in which parents said they did not want their children vaccinated for health, religious or other reasons \u2014 was 3.1 percent in the 2013-14 school year, according to the C.D.C. report. Oregon had an exemption rate of 7.1 percent, the nation\u2019s highest, the report found. Health officials said the vaccination rate needed to be above 95 percent in all communities to prevent outbreaks. \n \n Still, the California figure can be deceiving. Health officials said there were pockets across the state, including wealthy neighborhoods in Los Angeles and Orange Counties and enclaves in Northern California, where the exemption rate jumped into the double digits. California has long been viewed as particularly prone to this kind of outbreak because of its population size and the number of people arriving from overseas. \n \n \u201cThe problem is that there are these pockets with low vaccination rates,\u201d said Dr. Jane Seward, the deputy director of the viral diseases division at the C.D.C. \u201cIf a case comes into a population where a lot of people are unvaccinated, that\u2019s where you get the outbreak and where you get the spread.\u201d \n \n Organizations that have led the campaign of doubts about vaccinations suggested that it was too soon to draw such a conclusion. The groups cautioned parents not to be pressured into having their children receive vaccinations, which the organizations say have been linked to other diseases. Health professionals say those claims are unfounded or vastly overstated. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s premature to blame the increase in reports of measles on the unvaccinated when we don\u2019t have all the facts yet,\u201d said Barbara Loe Fisher, the president of the National Vaccine Information Center, a group raising concerns about inoculations. \u201cI do know this: Fifty-seven cases of measles coming out of Disneyland in a country with a population of 317 million people is not a lot of cases. We should all take a deep breath and wait to see and get more information.\u201d \n \n A handful of doctors seem sympathetic to these views. Dr. Jay Gordon, a Santa Monica pediatrician who has cautioned against the way vaccines are used, said he had \u201cgiven more measles vaccines\u201d than ever before but did not like giving the shot to younger children. \n \n \u201cI think whatever risk there is \u2014 and I can\u2019t prove a risk \u2014 is, I think, caused by the timing,\u201d he said, referring to when the shot is administered. \u201cIt\u2019s given at a time when kids are more susceptible to environmental impact. Don\u2019t get me wrong; I have no proof that this vaccine causes harm. I just have anecdotal reports from parents who are convinced that their children were harmed by the vaccine.\u201d", "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Seventy people have been infected in a measles outbreak that led California public health officials to urge those who haven't been vaccinated against the disease, including children too young to be immunized, should avoid Disney parks where the spread originated. \n \n FILE - This Nov. 20, 2009 photo shows Sleeping Beauty's Castle in winter dress with the iconic \"Partners\" statue featuring images of Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse in the foreground, at Disneyland in Anaheim,... (Associated Press) \n \n New infections linked to the theme parks emerged Wednesday in the outbreak that has spread to five U.S. states and Mexico, though the vast majority \u2014 62 \u2014 occurred in California. \n \n Because measles is highly contagious, people who have not received the measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine are susceptible and should avoid visiting Disney \"for the time being,\" state epidemiologist Gil Chavez said. \n \n The same holds true for crowded places with a high concentration of international travelers, such as airports, Chavez said. People who are vaccinated don't need to take such precautions, he said. \n \n Disneyland Resorts spokeswoman Suzi Brown said officials agreed with the advice that \"it's absolutely safe to visit if you're vaccinated.\" \n \n The people who have been infected range in age from 7 months to 70 years old. The vast majority were not vaccinated, and a quarter had to be hospitalized. \n \n Among those sickened were five Disney employees. Three have since returned to work. The company previously said park employees who may have been in contact with those infected were asked to show proof of vaccination or have a blood test to show immunity against measles. Those with pending results were put on paid leave. Vaccinations are also being offered to all employees. \n \n Measles has hit California hard recently. The state typically sees four to 60 measles cases a year. \n \n \"We are off to a bad start in 2015,\" Chavez said. \n \n Since the outbreak, two dozen unvaccinated students at an Orange County high school were sent home for three weeks after an infected pupil showed up. \n \n Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can spread by air through coughing or sneezing. Symptoms include fever followed by cough, runny nose and a blotchy rash. Though the virus has been eradicated in the U.S. since 2000, it can still enter the country through an infected traveler. \n \n While health officials said they likely may never find \"patient zero\" or the trigger of the outbreak, they believe it was either a resident from a country where measles is widespread or a Californian who went abroad and brought home the virus. \n \n People at highest risk are those who are unvaccinated, pregnant women, infants under 6 months old, and those with weakened immune systems. \n \n ___ \n \n Contact Alicia Chang at http://twitter.com/SciWriAlicia", "Persons using assistive technology might not be able to fully access information in this file.

However, importations of measles into the United States continue to occur, posing risks for measles outbreaks and sustained measles transmission. During 2011, a total of 222 measles cases (incidence rate: 0.7 per 1 million population) and 17 measles outbreaks (defined as three or more cases linked in time or place) were reported to CDC, compared with a median of 60 (range: 37\u2013140) cases and four (range: 2\u201310) outbreaks reported annually during 2001\u20132010. This report updates an earlier report on measles in the United States during the first 5 months of 2011 (2). Of the 222 cases, 112 (50%) were associated with 17 outbreaks, and 200 (90%) were associated with importations from other countries, including 52 (26%) cases in U.S. residents returning from abroad and 20 (10%) cases in foreign visitors. Other cases associated with importations included 67 (34%) linked epidemiologically to importations, 39 (20%) with virologic evidence suggesting recent importation, and 22 (11%) linked to cases with virologic evidence of recent importation. Most patients (86%) were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. The increased numbers of outbreaks and measles importations into the United States underscore the ongoing risk for measles among unvaccinated persons and the importance of vaccination against measles (3). \n \n Confirmed measles cases in the United States are reported by state and local health departments to CDC using a standard case definition.* A measles case is considered confirmed if it is laboratory-confirmed or meets the clinical case definition (an illness characterized by a generalized rash lasting \u22653 days, a temperature of \u2265101\u00b0F [\u226538.3\u00b0C], and cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis) and is linked epidemiologically to a confirmed case. Laboratory confirmation of measles is made by detection in serum of measles-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM), a significant rise in measles immunoglobulin G (IgG) level, isolation of measles virus, or detection of measles virus by nucleic acid amplification from a clinical specimen. Cases are considered importations if exposure to measles virus occurred outside the United States 7\u201321 days before rash onset and rash occurred within 21 days of entry into the United States, with no known exposure to measles in the United States during that time. \n \n For this report, U.S. residents were classified as eligible or ineligible for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination according to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations for measles vaccination (3). Vaccine-eligible patients were defined as U.S. residents who 1) were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, 2) did not have any contraindications for vaccination, and 3) were either born after 1957 and aged \u226512 months without previous documentation of presumptive evidence of immunity to measles\u2020 or aged 6\u201311 months with recent history of international travel. \n \n During 2011, a provisional total of 222 measles cases were reported from 31 states (Figure 1). The median age of the patients was 14 years (range: 3 months to 84 years); 27 (14%) were aged <12 months, 51 (26%) were aged 1\u20134 years, 42 (21%) were aged 5\u201319 years, and 76 (39%) were aged \u226520 years. Most patients were unvaccinated (65%) or had unknown vaccination status (21%). Of the 222, a total of 196 were U.S. residents. Of those U.S. residents who had measles, 166 were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, 141 (85%) were eligible for MMR vaccination, 18 (11%) were too young for vaccination, six (4%) were born before 1957 and presumed immune, and one (1%) had previous laboratory evidence of presumptive immunity to measles. Among the 141 patients who were unvaccinated and eligible for MMR vaccination, nine (6%) were infants aged 6\u201311 months and had recent history of international travel; 14 (10%) were aged 12\u201315 months, the age recommended for receiving the first dose of MMR vaccine; and 66 (47%) were aged 16 months through 19 years. Of those 66 patients, 50 (76%) had not been vaccinated because of a philosophic, religious, or personal objection. \n \n Among the 70 (32%) measles patients who were hospitalized, 17 (24%) had diarrhea, 15 (21%) were dehydrated, and 12 (17%) had pneumonia. No cases of encephalitis and no deaths were reported. \n \n Of the 222 U.S. measles cases, 200 (90%) were associated with importations, of which 72 (36%) were importations from other countries, 67 (30%) were linked epidemiologically to importations, 39 (20%) had virologic evidence (i.e., isolation of a viral genotype known to circulate in a country with measles) that suggested recent importation, and 22 (11%) were linked to cases with virologic evidence of recent importation. The source of measles acquisition in 22 cases was not determined through contact tracing or viral isolation (i.e., linking the patient to a country with measles or isolation of a viral genotype known to circulate in a country with measles). Importations were reported during 31 of the 52 reporting weeks (Figure 2). Among the 72 cases of measles importation, 52 were linked to U.S. residents who had traveled abroad, and 20 were linked to foreign visitors. Almost half (46%) of the 72 measles importations occurred among persons who acquired the disease in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region (Table). \n \n Seventeen outbreaks accounted for 112 (50%) of the 222 cases. The median outbreak size was six cases (range: 3\u201321 cases), and outbreaks lasted a median of 18 days (range: 6\u201369 days). \n \n Measles was laboratory confirmed in 200 (90%) cases: 94 (47%) by detection of measles-specific IgM and measles virus nucleic acid, 69 (35%) by detection of IgM only, and 37 (19%) by detection of measles virus nucleic acid only. Six genotypes of measles virus were identified among samples collected: D4, D9, D8, B3, G3, and H1 (Table). \n \n Reported by \n \n Div of Viral Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, CDC. Corresponding contributor: Huong McLean, PhD, hmclean@cdc.gov. \n \n Editorial Note \n \n Measles elimination has been maintained in the United States for more than a decade through high population immunity secondary to high MMR vaccination coverage. Coverage with 1 dose has been >90% among children aged 19\u201335 months since 1996. The increase in measles importations and outbreaks during 2011 serves as a reminder that measles remains endemic in many parts of the world and unvaccinated U.S. residents continue to place themselves and others in their communities at risk for measles and its complications. \n \n The increase in importations reflects recent increases in the incidence of measles in countries visited by U.S. travelers. The source of almost half of the measles importations in 2011 was the WHO European Region, which reported >30,000 cases of measles, including 27 cases of measles encephalitis, a complication that often results in permanent neurologic sequelae, and eight measles-related deaths in 2011. Five countries (France, Italy, Romania, Spain, and Germany) accounted for more than 90% of cases reported to the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (4). Although measles has been eliminated in the Region of the Americas since 2002 and considerable progress has been achieved in global measles control, measles is still common in many countries. Importations of measles virus into the United States will likely continue and cause outbreaks in communities that have clusters of unvaccinated persons. Maintenance of high MMR vaccination coverage is essential to prevent measles outbreaks and sustain measles elimination in the United States. Despite the relatively small number of reported cases in the United States, the public and the health-care providers must remain vigilant. A drop in MMR vaccination coverage in a community can increase the risk for large, sustained measles outbreaks, as experienced recently in Canada and France (4,5), or reestablishment of endemic transmission, as experienced in the United Kingdom (6). \n \n Occasionally, measles cases are reported without apparent links to importations, but virologic evidence suggests recent importation of an undetected case or chain of cases. Given travel patterns, the highly infectious nature of measles virus, and limitations of surveillance systems, not every importation of measles virus into the United States is detected. Therefore, collection of samples for virus detection is extremely important. Genetic characterization of viruses can help to confirm or suggest the likely source of imported viruses because measles genotypes are distributed heterogeneously in regions that have not yet eliminated measles (7,8). \n \n Health-care providers play an important role in maintaining elimination of measles in the United States. Patients with measles frequently seek medical care; therefore, health-care providers should maintain a high awareness of measles and suspect measles in persons who have a febrile rash illness and clinically compatible symptoms (e.g., cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis) and who recently have traveled abroad or have had contact with travelers. Providers should implement isolation precautions immediately and promptly report suspected measles cases to their local health department to limit spread to other susceptible persons, including those who cannot be vaccinated because of medical contraindications or those too young for vaccination. In several outbreaks during 2011, despite seeking medical care, the source case was not identified until after the first or second generation of cases was reported. Misdiagnosis and delayed reporting resulted in missed opportunities to prevent additional cases because of delayed implementation of control measures. Nevertheless, for most cases, early reporting by providers and rapid control efforts by state and local public health agencies have prevented measles transmission and limited the size of outbreaks. \n \n Health-care providers should encourage vaccination of all eligible patients, including children and adults. MMR vaccine is recommended routinely for all children at age 12\u201315 months, with a second dose at age 4\u20136 years. Two doses of MMR vaccine also are recommended for unvaccinated health-care personnel, international travelers, and students attending post\u2013high school educational institutions. Other adults without evidence of measles immunity should receive 1 dose of MMR vaccine (3). In addition, providers should remind their patients who plan to travel internationally of the increased risk for measles and potential exposures during bus, train, or air travel and at large international events or gatherings (e.g., Euro 2012 and the 2012 Summer Olympics), and of the importance of vaccination. All persons aged \u22656 months who will be traveling outside the United States and are eligible to receive MMR vaccine should be vaccinated before travel. Children aged \u226512 months should receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days, before travel (3). \n \n References \n \n What is already known on this topic? Achievement of measles elimination was declared in the United States in 2000, but the disease remains poorly controlled in much of the world. Cases of measles are imported regularly into the United States. What is added by this report? During 2011, 222 cases of measles and 17 outbreaks were reported in the United States, an increase compared with cases and outbreaks reported during 2001\u20132010. Importations accounted for 72 (32%) cases, including 52 (72%) cases among U.S. residents who had traveled abroad recently. Among patients who were U.S. residents, 85% were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status and were eligible for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination. What are the implications for public health practice? MMR vaccine is highly effective in preventing measles and its complications. Rapid public health response and high 2-dose MMR vaccine coverage are essential in preventing measles outbreaks and sustaining elimination in the United States. One dose of MMR vaccine is recommended routinely for all children at age 12\u201315 months, with a second dose at age 4\u20136 years. Adults without evidence of measles immunity should receive 1 MMR vaccine dose, whereas 2 doses are recommended for unvaccinated health-care personnel, international travelers, and students attending post\u2013high school educational institutions. \n \n FIGURE 1.

The glitch threw the plans of tens of thousands of travelers into disarray. \n \n Cruz told Sky News Monday the problem started at 9:30 Saturday morning when \"there was indeed a power surge that had a catastrophic effect over some communications hardware which eventually affected all the messaging across our systems.\" \n \n He said there was no evidence indicating the airline had come under cyberattack. \n \n BA operates hundreds of flights from Heathrow and Gatwick on a typical day \u2014 and both are major hubs for worldwide travel. \n \n Passengers, some of whom had spent the night at London's Heathrow Airport, faced frustrating waits to learn if and when they could fly out. \n \n Some endured hours-long lines to check in, reclaim lost luggage or rebook flights at Terminal 5, BA's hub at Heathrow. Many complained about a lack of information from the airline. \n \n Cruz apologized in a video statement, saying: \"I know this has been a horrible time for customers.\" \n \n The British union GMB linked the IT problems directly to the company's decision to cut IT staff last year. \n \n \"This could have all been avoided.

USA TODAY \n \n Maya Rudolph (left) and Melissa McCarthy share screen time with puppets in the comedy \"The Happytime Murders.\" (Photo: HOPPER STONE/STX ENTERTAINMENT) \n \n Hardcore puppet sex and four-letter words that would make Big Bird blush sound like a googly-eyed good time until you\u2019re faced with 90 unfunny minutes of it. \n \n \"The Happytime Murders\" (\u2605\u00bd out of four; rated R; in theaters nationwide Friday) tries hard, and annoyingly so, to be a raucous, adult-oriented departure from the Muppets and denizens of \u201cSesame Street,\u201d one in which an octopus milks a cow to orgasmic effect and a bunny shops for chicken porn. Stuffed full of rampant badness, the scattershot comedy isn\u2019t nearly as clever or subversive as it thinks it is. \n \n Set in a world where men and puppets co-exist, though the latter are second-class citizens, the noir-ish narrative centers on blue-skinned former cop (and now private eye) Phil Phillips (puppeteer Bill Barretta) and his human ex-partner, L.A. detective Connie Edwards (Melissa McCarthy). A violent incident in the past soured their relationship \u2013 and resulted in a ban on puppet cops \u2013 so when they run into each other at a crime scene, snarky and vicious banter ensues. \n \n Sandra puts the moves on private eye Phil in \"The Happytime Murders.\" (Photo: HOPPER STONE/STX ENTERTAINMENT) \n \n A robbery gone wrong at a puppet sex store and a series of dead bodies (usually with stuffing falling out of them) leads Phil to believe that the stars of cheesy 1990s-style sitcom \u201cThe Happytime Gang,\u201d the first hit to feature both human and puppet stars, are being targeted. The show just happens to be up for syndication, which means a windfall for those still alive. \n \n To solve the case, Phil and Connie form an uneasy alliance and begin to reconnect as they delve into a puppet underworld of bunny-filled strip clubs, sugar-snorting poker games and assorted places unfit for colorful characters who look like rejects from a children\u2019s program. (\"Sesame Street\" notably sued filmmakers and lost, worrying the explicit content would tarnish its brand. No worries there, since the only thing this film ruins is an hour and a half of your life.) \n \n More: 'Happytime Murders' shocks with raunchy puppets (not Muppets) \n \n Also: How Melissa McCarthy really 'snorted' puppet drugs in 'Happytime Murders' \n \n More: 10 movies you absolutely must see this fall, from 'Halloween' to 'A Star Is Born' \n \n There is definite artistry in the puppeteering for director Brian Henson (son of legendary Muppets creator Jim Henson): Phil, his client/love interest Sandra (Dorien Davies), pervy rabbit Mr. Bumblypants (Kevin Clash, formerly Elmo) and others have lived a hard-luck and/or oversexed life, and it shows in their felt bodies. But by the time one character poops plastic eggs and another ejaculates Silly String, the novelty of puppets behaving badly is long gone. \n \n Exotic dancer Jenny (Elizabeth Banks) entertains her rabbit clientele in \"The Happytime Murders.\" (Photo: HOPPER STONE/STX ENTERTAINMENT) \n \n The gags make Fozzie Bear a comedic genius by comparison, but at least the talented human actors keep the film from being a \u201cHappytime\u201d disaster. McCarthy is as sharp-witted as ever with one-liners and caustic put-downs, Maya Rudolph boosts the proceedings as Phil\u2019s loyal secretary Bubbles, and Elizabeth Banks has a fun role as an exotic dancer also connected to the resident gumshoe. \n \n Yet all the film's most interesting aspects have been done better elsewhere. \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is the gold standard for portraying cutesy personalities as a disenfranchised population, and \"Happytime Murders\" completely fumbles that theme. It unfortunately doesn\u2019t fully commit to the raunch the way, say, \"Sausage Party\" does. And nothing touches \"Team America: World Police\" when it comes to hilarious puppet intercourse. \n \n At the risk of being as Muppet-y self-righteous as Sam the Eagle, there are much better uses of your time than this travesty of fluffy shenanigans. \n \n Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2w96Slx", "Rescue me, Elmo! \n \n That\u2019s what you\u2019ll shout if you\u2019re trapped in a movie theater playing \u201cThe Happytime Murders,\u201d the wretched puppets-behaving-badly comedy directed by Brian Henson. \n \n The son of Muppets creator Jim Henson has delivered a clich\u00e9-ridden, laughless bore that wastes lead actress Melissa McCarthy\u2019s prodigious comic talents and beats well-trod territory with a mallet. \n \n \u201cThe Happytime Murders\u201d is as fresh as the old \u201cWayne\u2019s World\u201d jokes it shoves in. It\u2019s a movie in which puppet crabs make cracks about getting pelvic crabs, and the line \u201cLooks like the carpet doesn\u2019t match the drapes\u201d is uttered twice. \n \n As stale as a neglected saltine, the flick is another police-noir parody with all the familiar hallmarks: brooding narration, a cigarette-smoke-filled office, a door with a frosted window and a helpless blond bombshell. Think \u201cWho Framed Roger Rabbit\u201d minus the innovation or fun. \n \n The bawdy tale is set in a decrepit Los Angeles that\u2019s plagued by crime, and where our felt-y friends are an oppressed minority. Kids yell \u201cstupid puppet!\u201d and beat them up, while the word \u201csock\u201d is now a racial slur. \n \n The smoky office belongs to Phil Philips (Bill Barretta), a puppet private investigator and former cop. He was kicked off the LAPD years earlier when, his bosses believe, he purposefully didn\u2019t gun down a puppet perp. His human partner, Detective Connie Edwards (McCarthy), was nearly killed in the botched operation. \n \n That bumbling duo is thrust back together when puppet and human cast members of popular TV show \u201cThe Happytime Gang,\u201d including Phil\u2019s famous stuffed brother, start getting killed off one by one. He goes rogue to solve the case with Connie. \n \n What\u2019s not solved is the film\u2019s No. 1 problem: It\u2019s not funny. \n \n Most bits are either gross or groaners. A gag involving boudoir silly string is amusing until it becomes nauseating. Watching McCarthy snort puppet crack didn\u2019t make me crack a smile. The only cast member who earns some giggles is Maya Rudolph as Phil\u2019s secretary, who\u2019s secretly in love with him. She\u2019s a comedy alchemist who can turn turds into gold. \n \n \u201cThe Happytime Murders\u201d is the latest addition to McCarthy\u2019s do-not-see CV. Since \u201cBridesmaids,\u201d filmmakers have slapped her in mostly dumb schlock like this. \n \n Being a Henson project, you\u2019d expect the film\u2019s puppetry to be the one redeemable factor. But those characters are strangely generic and clumsily handled. Forgettable. \n \n There\u2019s more fun to be had watching a kid play with some socks.", "\u201cThese aren\u2019t the Muppets,\u201d director Brian Henson might remind us, but his smile and wink would hint at what he really thinks. The son of Muppets creator Jim Henson and the man who filled his dad\u2019s shoes directing The Muppet Christmas Carol and Muppets Treasure Island, Henson has decided to cross over to the dark side with his \u201calternative Muppets\u201d farce, The Happytime Murders. Careful to avoid copyright issues (and to avoid giving kids nightmares), Henson doesn\u2019t give us a faux Kermit or Miss Piggy. However, although all the puppets in The Happytime Murders are new, they are obviously Muppets, regardless of how vociferously the filmmakers may deny it. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, say no more, say no more. \n \n Despite being one of the shortest theatrical releases of the year, clocking in at about 75 minutes (not counting end credits), The Happytime Murders feels overlong. That\u2019s probably because the plot is nonsensical and pointless. This is all about the concept of oversexed, hard-swearing Muppets interacting with humans in an alternative universe version of L.A. The film\u2019s \u201chigh concept\u201d catches the attention, but it\u2019s like the first time we heard Betty White drop the f-bomb. There was a certain shock value, it was worth a laugh, but where do you go from there? It\u2019s the same thing with nasty Muppets. The transgressive element is edgy and at times amusing, but it wears thin quickly and once it has worn out, we\u2019re left with warmed-over Dashiell Hammett, complete with the Sam Spade-inspired voiceover. \n \n Recognizing that there has to be something more than Muppets cursing, flashing their crotches in imitation of Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct, and doing un-family friendly things, Henson sets up the puppet culture as a thinly-veiled allegory. The social commentary about puppet discrimination and marginalization isn\u2019t subtle but it gives The Happytime Murders a claim to being more than a raunchy look at what happens on Sesame Street when the cameras are turned off. \n \n The Happytime Murders reunites two former partners, (human) LAPD detective Connie Edwards (Melissa McCarthy) and (puppet) PI Phil Phillips (voice of Bill Barretta), when an investigation into a series of puppet murders involves them both. For Connie, it\u2019s her job. For Phil, it\u2019s personal \u2013 his brother is the second victim. All of the dead \u201csocks\u201d were stars of a once-popular TV show, The Happytime Gang (the first program with a mostly-puppet cast to achieve \u201ccrossover\u201d popularity \u2013 a nod to The Cosby Show). Additional deaths indicate an inside job and, once the finger of suspicion points to Phil, it\u2019s up to Connie to solve the crime and clear her ex-partner. Aiding her in this endeavor is Phil\u2019s secretary, Bubbles (Maya Rudolph), who has a crush on her boss. \n \n The film\u2019s puppet/human dynamics are strange. All the energy and color resides with the puppets. In an odd reversal of what one might expect, they are more animate than their human counterparts. Melissa McCarthy, for example, has the life of a piece of background furniture \u2013 a surprise since, even in her worst films, she\u2019s normally able to dominate the screen. Fading into the background isn\u2019t her style but that\u2019s what happens here. The situation is only a little better with Maya Rudolph and Elizabeth Banks (whose role, as The Happytime Gang\u2019s only human, is small). Leslie David Baker (as Connie\u2019s lieutenant) and Joel McHale (as a racist FBI agent) gain attention by being as cartoonish as possible. \n \n The noir mystery element never works. Fortunately, it\u2019s treated as a framework and the filmmakers aren\u2019t overly invested in attempting to mine deeply into the territory. The Happytime Murders is intended primarily as a comedy and, while there\u2019s a cheeky freshness in the early scenes, it eventually becomes tiresome and a little off-putting. This would seem like the perfect playground for McCarthy, so it\u2019s strange that she seems so out of place. \n \n The obvious antecedent to The Happytime Murders is Who Framed Roger Rabbit? The differences, however, go beyond the derivative nature of the former. While Roger Rabbit felt like a fully-formed story worth telling, The Happytime Murders too often comes across as a skit that runs for too long. Everything about the movie is stunted \u2013 from the running time to the production values to the story. Although it might work perfectly well on television (there are enough bawdy laughs to ensure an acceptable level of entertainment), it never gels on the big screen. This is unquestionably a better bet for home viewing than a trip to a theater. \n \n \n \n \n \n Happytime Murders, The (United States/China, 2018)", "1.5 stars (out of 4) \n \n Hi there, everyone! This Happytime Murders review is brought to you by the letter \u201cI.\u201d Insipid. Imbeciles. Incomprehensible. Insane. You can use that last word in a sentence such as \u201cThe person that thought this witless, crude black noire puppet farce would be a rousing crowd-pleaser must be insane.\u201d The letter also can be used on its own, as in \u201cI think we have a strong contender for the worst film of 2018.\u201d \n \n Let\u2019s address the stuffed elephant in the room: This scathing review isn\u2019t a case of a critic not having the bawdy sense of humor gene required to appreciate crass humor, OK? Married with Children and Howard Stern are two of my all-time favorite pop culture touchstones. I have a brother. I\u2019m not offended or shocked by the sight of two puppets having porn star sex. Just make it brutally funny and inspired. The Happytime Murders simply goes for the lowest common denominator of comedy from beginning to end. And those 90 minutes in between are excruciating. Let me put it in italics for emphasis. Excruciating. \n \n This was never going to be a genius hybrid of Avenue Q meets The Great Muppet Caper. Not with this old-timey set-up: Hard-nosed detective Phil Phillips (voiced by Bill Barretta) is the only puppet to have ever served on the police force. Now he\u2019s a private eye working on behalf of marginalized puppets in Los Angeles. After his brother gets stuffed out, he starts investigating and realizes that someone is killing all the stars of a popular 80s kids TV show called The Happytime Gang. Who would do such a thing?! \n \n To solve the case, Phil is paired with his former human partner. She\u2019s played by Melissa McCarthy, who does her usual obnoxious, tough-talking caricature shtick. The two are not on good terms, as evidenced by the fact that McCarthy bites down on Phil\u2019s man part in a moment of pent-up rage. The novelty of puppets acting like lewd rejects from Sausage Party or Team America: World Police is already worn off by the time McCarthy enters the picture. She does nothing with the limp script. Same goes for Maya Rudolph, Joel McHale and Elizabeth Banks. \n \n The tangled web of The Happytime Gang syndication contract negotiations won\u2019t raise anyone\u2019s pulse, so the filmmakers (writer Todd Berger and director Brian Henson) rely heavily on the R-rated shock factor. The piece de resistance, as seen in The Happytime Murders trailer, involves a graphic and messy sexual encounter that drags on and on and on until all traces of laughter have been metaphorically squeezed out. You\u2019ll see that in Act 1. Or, you know, just watch the trailer for free. \n \n There actually is a place and time for puppets behaving badly. Even a family-driven product as accessible as The Muppet Show had an air of subversion \u2014 and Kermit the Frog and Justin Timberlake once wrestled each other on a memorable episode of Saturday Night Live. But despite Henson\u2019s lineage as the son of late Muppets creator (and genius) Jim Henson, The Happytime Murders is a terribly misguided move. Indeed, it doesn\u2019t take an investigator with a heart of felt to figure out that a half-baked flick with poorly executed ideas and lazy use of gross-out humor will end up DOA. \n \n The Happytime Murders opens in theaters on Friday, August 24. \n \n For the latest TV news and interviews, subscribe to our new podcast \u201cWatch With Us\u201d below! \n \n \n \n \n \n Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox! \n \n Want stories like these delivered straight to your phone?

Well, The Happytime Murders is out Friday, starring Melissa McCarthy as a detective probing a series of puppet murders with her puppet partner. Critics, meanwhile, are busy investigating why the R-rated film is, in their opinions, downright awful. (The film has a 26% \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes.) What they're saying: While \"there's a cheeky freshness in the early scenes,\" the film \"too often comes across as a skit that runs for too long \u2026 probably because the plot is nonsensical and pointless,\" James Berardinelli writes at ReelViews. McCarthy surprisingly doesn't help, he writes. She \"has the life of a piece of background furniture.\" Brian Truitt argues \"McCarthy is as sharp-witted as ever,\" but his praise basically ends there. With gags that \"make Fozzie Bear a comedic genius by comparison,\" this \"scattershot comedy isn't nearly as clever or subversive as it thinks it is,\" he writes at USA Today, adding \"there are much better uses of your time than this travesty.\" \"There's more fun to be had watching a kid play with some socks,\" Johnny Oleksinski writes at the New York Post, noting the film is \"as stale as a neglected saltine.\" The prevailing problem: \"It's not funny,\" Oleksinski writes. In fact, \"the only cast member who earns some giggles is Maya Rudolph.\" Mara Reinstein is just relieved her viewing experience is over. \"The Happytime Murders simply goes for the lowest common denominator of comedy from beginning to end. And those 90 minutes in between are excruciating. Let me put it in italics for emphasis. Excruciating,\" she writes at US Weekly, calling out the \"lazy use of gross-out humor.\"", "ranking": [0, 3, 2, 1, 4]}
{"document": ["Image copyright PA Image caption Police said the suspected drone had struck an inbound Airbus A320, similar to this one \n \n A police investigation is under way after a passenger plane approaching Heathrow Airport flew into what is believed to have been a drone. \n \n The British Airways flight from Geneva, with 132 passengers and five crew on board, was hit as it approached the London airport at 12:50 BST on Sunday. \n \n If confirmed, it is thought it would be the first such incident in the UK. \n \n BA said it would give the police \"every assistance with their investigation\". No arrests have been made, police say. \n \n The Metropolitan Police said the plane was hit by the drone at about 1,700ft (580m) while flying over the area of Richmond Park, in south west London. \n \n No debris has been found and police have asked for anyone who finds drone parts in the Richmond area to come forward. \n \n The force's aviation security unit, based at Heathrow, is leading the investigation. \n \n 'Very real danger' \n \n After safely landing the plane, the pilot reported an object had struck the front of the Airbus A320. \n \n A BA spokesman said: \"Our aircraft landed safely, was fully examined by our engineers and it was cleared to operate its next flight.\" \n \n Chief Superintendent Martin Hendy, head of the Met's aviation policing command, said the incident highlighted \"the very real dangers of reckless, negligent and some times malicious use of drones\". \n \n A Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) spokesman said it was \"totally unacceptable\" to fly drones - which are generally used to capture aerial film or photographs - close to airports. \n \n Steve Landells, from the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa), said it had been \"only a matter of time before we had a drone strike\". He called for greater enforcement of existing rules. \n \n Are drones dangerous or harmless fun? \n \n London music video drone footage draws criticism \n \n The rules for flying domestic drones \n \n Analysis \n \n Image copyright PA \n \n Leo Kelion, Technology editor \n \n Flying a drone near an airport can already be punished with up to five years in prison, and rules also forbid flying them \"beyond the direct unaided line of sight\" of the operator or near buildings and crowds of people. Drones may not fly above 400ft (122m). \n \n But the latest incident will only add to the pressure for further steps to be taken. \n \n The US recently introduced a compulsory registration scheme so any drone recovered from an accident can be traced back to its owner. \n \n In addition, officials could make it mandatory for drones to run geo-fencing software - that would prevent them flying in restricted areas. \n \n The Department for Transport has promised to publish a strategy for unmanned aircraft this year. \n \n Pilots have also called for it to fund tests into what would happen if a drone got sucked into an engine or crashed into a plane's windscreen. \n \n Last month, the British Airline Pilots Association noted that while the threat of bird strikes had been well researched, there was little data about how much damage a drone could cause a plane. \n \n The incident follows a warning earlier this year by the head of the International Air Transport Association Tony Tyler that drones flown by the general public are \"a real and growing threat\" to civilian aircraft. \n \n The UK Air Proximity Board - which investigates near-miss incidents in UK airspace - said there had been a number of serious near-misses at UK airports involving drones. \n \n David Black, from Blackwing Aerial Services - a company that specialises in licensed commercial drones - said education and enforcement of the current rules were important, particularly for hobbyists. \n \n \"I think a register is a good idea,\" he said. \n \n \"With firearms it has shown it's a good thing... but it has not stopped bad guys from getting guns. If you're going to use them as weapons, bad guys can build them themselves. \n \n \"You need enforcement, but the problem with enforcement is that it costs money and people to carry it out.... There needs to be better technology for detection and avoidance.\" \n \n Geo-fencing is available in some drones - a database within the drone will not let it take off if it is near an airport so that operators cannot accidentally fly into trouble. \n \n Mr Landells from Balpa added: \"The law as it stands says you're not supposed to go above 400ft (122m) or 500m away from the base unit, depending on the drone you're using, but we've been seeing incidents up at 8,000 feet, where drones just have no place to be, so we've got to do something. \n \n \"That's a registration process, some sort of tracking, some sort of electronic security - we've got to do something about this.\" \n \n Drone incidents at UK airports \n \n Image copyright BAA \n \n 17 April 2016 - A British Airways plane approaching Heathrow is believed to have hit a drone while in midair \n \n 28 November 2015 - The pilot of an A321 plane narrowly missed a drone hovering at 100ft above a runway at Gatwick Airport \n \n 30 September 2015 - A small drone helicopter passed within 30ft of the cockpit of an A319 plane while on the approach to Heathrow \n \n 22 September 2015 - A \"quadcopter-type drone\" missed the right-hand side of a B777 plane by about 25m while at 2,000ft after it left Heathrow Airport \n \n 13 September 2015 - A silver drone with a \"balloon-like\" centre missed an E170 aircraft by about 20m, while the plane was approaching London City Airport over the Thames \n \n 13 September 2015 - A drone flew over the top of a B737 aircraft while at 4,000ft, missing it by about 5m, shortly after it left Stansted \n \n 27 August 2015 - A DO328 aircraft flew within 50ft of a drone while approaching Manchester Airport at 2,800ft \n \n Source: The UK Airprox Board", "Story highlights London police seek public's help in finding operator of drone that may have struck airliner \n \n No one was hurt and the plane wasn't damaged, but authorities worry about potential for catastrophe \n \n London (CNN) Did a drone hit an airliner trying to land at London's Heathrow Airport? \n \n The pilot of a British Airways flight certainly thinks so, and now authorities would like to find out who might have been behind the weekend incident. \n \n British Airways Flight BA727 from Geneva was approaching Heathrow on Sunday afternoon when what the pilot believed to be a drone struck the front of the aircraft, London Metropolitan Police said.

We have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area.\u201d \n \n Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that the agency was exploring ways to increase the screening of passengers on both sides of the Atlantic. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re working very intensively on the screening process,\u201d Frieden said in a conference call with reporters Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at that entire process to see what more can be done.\u201d \n \n While he promised that \u201cadditional steps\u201d were coming, Frieden did not elaborate on what that would include. Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in an interview Tuesday that Frieden told him that the plan is to have \u201ctougher types of screening on U.S. soil.\u201d \n \n Still, Frieden said the CDC has had teams on the ground working to strengthen the screening of passengers leaving West Africa. The screening has included taking temperatures, keeping an eye out for other symptoms and having travelers fill out questionnaires. \n \n He said the CDC methods have been used to screen more than 36,000 people over two months. And of those travelers, a small portion of whom were coming to the United States, only 77 people had a fever or other symptoms that caused them to be taken out of line, he said. \u201cAs far as we know, none of those 77 people had Ebola,\u201d Frieden noted. \n \n Of course, these methods are not perfect, as was made clear when Duncan filled out a questionnaire, had his temperature taken by a person trained by the CDC and boarded multiple flights on his way to Dallas. \n \n President Obama\u2019s promise of stepped-up screening for Ebola at U.S. airports that handle international flights will fall on the shoulders of the Customs and Border Protection officers who greet passengers arriving from abroad. \n \n Though they often seem preoccupied with scrutinizing passports and luggage, customs officers are trained to detect signs of illness, and they routinely do just that, officials said. \n \n \u201cCBP personnel review all travelers entering the United States for general overt signs of illnesses,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \n \n In addition to visual observations, CBP officers question passengers about their health and are instructed to alert the CDC if a passenger appears to be seriously ill. If a person is believed to have \u201ca possible communicable disease,\u201d they are isolated while the CDC and local authorities conduct the evaluation. \n \n Federal law requires pilots to radio ahead if a passenger dies or falls ill with certain symptoms. \n \n \u201cIf somebody comes in on a flight that has a fever or any one of those triggers, CDC can insert themselves at any point in the process,\u201d said Rob Yingling, spokesman for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which runs Dulles International and Reagan National airports. \u201cThey can say [to the pilot], \u2018Tell us more about this case,\u2019 or they can actually physically go to the plane.\u201d \n \n The CDC maintains an office at Dulles and other major airports that handle international flights. \n \n Meanwhile, up to 4,000 service members are expected to head to West African countries ravaged by the Ebola epidemic. They will be monitored several times a day and, if any of them contract Ebola, they will be flown back to the United States aboard a specially designed plane for treatment. \n \n Among the tasks laid out for the military is the construction of 17 treatment centers for people with the disease. This will take until the middle of next month, according to Gen. David Rodriguez, chief of U.S. Africa Command. \n \n Mark Berman, Ashley Halsey III, Dan Lamonthe and Amy Ellis Nutt contributed to this report from Washington.", "DALLAS (AP) \u2014 The family of a man diagnosed with the first U.S. case of Ebola again visited him at the hospital Tuesday but declined to view him via video the last time had been too upsetting. \n \n Nowai Korkoya, mother of Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, center, walks with the Rev.

Family members who were briefed by doctors said they were told Mr. Duncan\u2019s temperature and blood pressure are back to normal and the debilitating diarrhea Ebola brings had slowed. \n \n A little more than a week after testing positive for the virus, the patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, remained in critical condition on Tuesday, while getting an experimental antiviral drug that doctors hope will help him recover. \n \n But his family, who gathered here today and held a vigil with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, said they had some reasons to be optimistic. \n \n \u201cWe are happy Eric is doing better. If all goes well we will be able to see him,\u201d his nephew, Josephus Weeks, said. \n \n Photo \n \n It is a critical week not just for Mr. Duncan but for the 48 people who had some contact with him after he showed signs of the disease. In this city, on edge over fears that Ebola could spread, officials have urged calm, saying those potentially exposed to the virus are being tracked and none have showed symptoms. \n \n Dr. David Lakey, the Texas health commissioner, said Tuesday that the next few days could be decisive in determining whether any of the 48 people who came in contact with Mr. Duncan develop the virus. \n \n According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the maximum incubation period for the virus is 21 days, but symptoms typically appear in eight to 10. Mr. Duncan, who apparently contracted the virus before flying to the United States, began complaining of symptoms on Sept. 24 and was hospitalized in isolation on Sept. 28. The 10-day threshold will pass by the middle of this week. \n \n Of the 48 people under observation, 10 are deemed to be at high risk, officials said. Three of those people shared an apartment with Mr. Duncan and seven are health care workers. The other 38 people are considered to be at lower risk. \n \n \u201cNone of them are sick, none of them have a fever,\u201d Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the C.D.C., said Tuesday. \n \n Dr. Frieden said Mr. Duncan\u2019s condition and the lack of new cases were positive signs with implications for what he said will be a long fight against the disease. \n \n \u201cGlobally, this is going to be a long hard fight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can never forget that the enemy here is a virus, the enemy is Ebola, not people, not countries, not communities, a virus. And it\u2019s a virus that doesn\u2019t spread through the air, that we do know how to control. We do know how to stop it by isolating patients, doing contact tracing and breaking the chains of transmission. I can say one week in that there are real signs of progress not only in Dallas but also around the world.\u201d \n \n Since Saturday, Mr. Duncan has been receiving brincidofovir \u2014 an experimental drug developed to fight smallpox and other highly infectious viruses. The C.D.C. said there are no more doses of ZMapp, another experimental drug used on two American aid workers who later recovered from Ebola. \n \n Mr. Duncan\u2019s nephew said that despite signs of improvement, the virus has given his uncle serious infections in his lungs and kidneys, and Mr. Duncan has not yet turned a corner toward recovery. \n \n Mr. Duncan came to Dallas a few weeks ago from Liberia to reunite with Louise Troh, with whom he has a son. Now Ms. Troh, one of her other sons and two men who were staying with them are quarantined until late October. Local officials moved them a few days ago from a small apartment, which had towels and bedding contaminated with Ebola, to a modest four-bedroom ranch house that was donated by a church after officials were unable to find a house for the potentially infected family through traditional landlords. \n \n More Ebola Coverage \n \n \u201cThey are doing very well,\u201d said the Rev. George Mason of Wilshire Baptist Church, which Ms. Troh attends. \u201cThey are counting the days until they can come out.\u201d \n \n At the church on Tuesday night, Karsiah Duncan, Mr. Duncan\u2019s 19-year-old son with Ms. Troh, spoke publicly about his father for the first time. The younger Mr. Duncan had not seen his father since he was 3, when his parents separated in an Ivory Coast refugee camp and Ms. Troh left for the United States. He is a freshman at Angelo State University, west of Dallas, where he plays on the football team. \n \n A reunion was to be one of the highlights of Mr. Duncan\u2019s visit. Instead, Karsiah visited his father at the hospital on Tuesday evening. \n \n Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Liberians in the area have come to bring traditional foods such as potato greens, cassava leaves and pepper sauce, not supplied by aid agencies. A number of local officials coordinating the response, including Mayor Mike Rawlings of Dallas and Judge Clay Jenkins of Dallas County, have also stopped by. \n \n While they are careful to avoid contact, Mr. Mason said, they wear no protective clothing. \n \n \u201cThe science is clear,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have symptoms, they are not contagious.

He had been on a ventilator, was given an experimental medicine and began receiving dialysis when his kidney\u2019s failed Oct. 4, the hospital has said. His treatment included fluids replacement, blood transfusions and drugs to maintain blood pressure.

They are covered by the group\u2019s health and workers\u2019 compensation insurance plans, and SIM plans to pay their $25,000 deductibles, said George Salloum, the group\u2019s vice president for finance and operations. Writebol\u2019s evacuation from Liberia was covered in full by one of SIM\u2019s insurance carriers, Aetna Inc. (AET), he said. He\u2019s still waiting for bills from other carriers, whom he declined to name, and said he didn\u2019t know what the hospital care cost. \n \n \u201cThe hospitals have not disclosed that information to us,\u201d Salloum said in a phone interview. \u201cI\u2019m very anxious to find out, personally, just wondering what they\u2019re charging for that kind of care.\u201d \n \n Emory and Nebraska are known for their expertise in exotic diseases and careful isolation of infectious patients. Texas Health Presbyterian has no such pedigree. \n \n Hospital Rank \n \n It is ranked the fifth-best hospital in the Dallas-Fort Worth region and 15th-best in Texas by U.S. News and World Report. Duncan arrived there in an ambulance on Sept. 28, after being initially sent home two days earlier from the emergency room with antibiotics. The hospital has blamed a communication failure in its electronic record system for Duncan\u2019s initial release. \n \n \u201cThey have an excellent reputation in the community\u201d and \u201cvery good infectious disease physicians,\u201d Stephen Love, president and CEO of the Dallas-Fort Worth Hospital Council, a trade group, said in a phone interview. \n \n Anderson, who is a former federal health official, said that as a foreign citizen Duncan wouldn\u2019t have been eligible for any U.S. health programs such as Medicaid, for low income people. Texas hospitals charge $8,176 per day on average for treatment of viral illnesses, including exotic diseases such as West Nile virus and Dengue fever, said Andrew Fitch, a health-care pricing expert at NerdWallet, a San Francisco-based company that provides consumer finance and health data. \n \n That figure \u201cis actually probably on the low end\u201d for Ebola, Fitch said in a phone interview. \u201cThe isolation ward would bump up the charge a lot.\u201d \n \n Area Costs \n \n Health care generally is more costly in Dallas than in the rest of the country, according to the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, a project of Dartmouth University that tracks regional variation in spending by Medicare, the U.S. health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. Medicare beneficiaries in Dallas cost about $11,484 on average in 2012, placing the area within the 90th percentile for the U.S. \n \n Isolation procedures can include placing patients by themselves in rooms capable of negative air pressure, to prevent microorganisms from escaping, said Pritish Tosh, an infectious diseases physician and researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Physicians and nurses treating the patients must don gloves, gowns and masks with eye protection before entering the room and dispose of the gear afterward, he said. \n \n Intensive Care \n \n That can roughly double the cost of standard treatment in an intensive care unit, Anderson said. If a U.S. outbreak occurs, something federal health officials say is unlikely, the cost of care may fall as hospitals gain experience and streamline procedures, said Jeffrey Rice, CEO of Healthcare BlueBook Inc., a Brentwood, Tennessee, company that calculates health-care prices for consumers. \n \n There is no approved cure for Ebola, though some patients have received experimental medications. Standard treatment includes supportive care to maintain body fluids, replace blood and fight off opportunistic infections. \n \n The Ebola outbreak originated in West Africa, where it has infected 8,033 people, killing 3,879, primarily in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, according to a report today from the World Health Organization. \n \n To contact the reporter on this story: Alex Wayne in Washington at awayne3@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editors responsible for this story: Reg Gale at rgale5@bloomberg.net Andrew Pollack", "DALLAS (AP) \u2014 The Fort Worth, Texas, company Cleaning Guys has dealt with hazardous spills.

{"document": ["Wind Shear Tutorial \n \n Wind shear is often the most critical factor controlling hurricane formation and destruction. In general, wind shear refers to any change in wind speed or direction along a straight line. In the case of hurricanes, wind shear is important primarily in the vertical direction--from the surface to the top of the troposphere. The troposphere is the region of the atmosphere that our active weather is confined to, and extends up to about 40,000 feet altitude (a pressure of about 200 mb) in the tropics in summer. Hurricanes fill the entire vertical extent of the troposphere, and are steered by the average wind through this layer. When one hears the phrase, \"wind shear is 20 knots over the hurricane\", this typically refers to the difference in wind speed between 200 mb (the top of the troposphere, 40,000 feet altitude) and a layer where a pressure of 850 mb is found--about 5,000 feet above the surface. This wind shear is computed over a large area--a circle of 700 miles in diameter centered on the hurricane is one technique used. This 200-850 mb wind shear is a crude measure of the actual wind shear a storm experiences, since only changes in wind speed--not wind direction--are considered. Furthermore, the computed shear does not consider any smaller scale changes that may occur within this large volume of the atmosphere. For example, it is common to find a strong jet of wind at about 600 mb blowing along the edge of the Saharan Air Layer (SAL)--that area of dry, dusty air that frequently lies to the north of developing tropical cyclones in the mid-Atlantic. This jet will create significant wind shear that will not show up on the standard 200-850 mb wind shear plots. Since upper-air measurements are very sparse over the open ocean, wind shear that is invisible on 200-850 mb wind shear analysis charts will often unexpectedly kill or weaken a developing tropical cyclone. \n \n Tropical cyclones are heat engines powered by the release of latent heat when water vapor condenses into liquid water. Wind shear hurts tropical cyclones by removing the heat and moisture they need from the area near their center. Shear will also distort the shape of a hurricane by shearing it (blowing the top away from the lower portion), so that the vortex is tilted. A tilted vortex is usually a less efficient heat engine--the delicate balance of inflowing low-level winds and outflowing upper-level winds that ventilate the storm gets disrupted. Dr. Bill Gray of Colorado State University was one of the first scientists to study the effect of winds shear on hurricane formation. In his classic 1968 paper, \"Global View of the Origin of Tropical Disturbances and Storms\", Dr. Gray writes: \n \n \"In the SW Atlantic and central Pacific, where tropical storms do not occur, the observed climatological tropospheric wind shear is large (i.e., 20-40 kt). This is believed to be the major inhibitor to development in these areas. Large vertical wind shears do not allow for area concentration of the tropospheric distributed cumulonimbus condensation. Large shears produce a large ventilation of heat away from the developing disturbance. The condensation heat released by the cumulus to the upper troposphere is adverted in a different direction relative to the released heat at lower levels. Concentration of heat through the entire troposphere becomes more difficult. \n \n Dr. Gray also discovered that the east-west or \"zonal\" component of the wind shear was what mattered most to hurricanes. Wind shear in the north-south or \"meridional\" direction did not significantly affect the storms. This is why one often sees \"zonal wind shear\" plotted in addition to the total wind shear. (By the way, we now know that tropical storms do occur in the central Pacific, thanks to satellite imagery--and we have also had one tropical cyclone in the SW Atlantic, Hurricane Catarina of 2004).\" \n \n Rules of thumb \n \n A general rule of thumb is that the shear must be 20 knots or less for intensification to occur. Most instances of rapid intensification of hurricanes occur when the wind shear is 10 knots or less. However, large and powerful hurricanes can be resistant to shear values as high as 40 knots, as demonstrated by Hurricane Wilma (Figure 1). We often see tropical disturbances under 10 knots of wind shear that do not develop. Why? Oftentimes, this is because cold, dry air aloft associated with an upper level trough of low pressure is interfering with development. Tropical cyclones develop most readily when an upper level anticyclone (high pressure system aloft) is present overhead. \n \n Figure 1. Wind shear plot of Hurricane Wilma at 00GMT October 25, 2005. At time time, Wilma had just intensified to a Category 3 hurricane with 125 mph winds and a 955 mb pressure, despite the presence of 40 knots of wind shear over the storm. Just to the west of Wilma one can see wind shear values of 120 knots, associated with the jet stream. \n \n One excellent web site to diagnose current wind shear values is the University of Wisconsin CIMSS site. They compute upper level winds by looking at cloud motion from satellites. A mean low level wind, averaged over a layer between 925 mb and 700 mb (1500 feet to 10,000 feet), is subtracted from a mean upper level wind, averaged over a layer between 300 mb and 150 mb (30,000 to 45,000 feet). If a tropical cyclone is present, the winds due to the circulation around the storm are removed, so that one can just look at the environmental wind field the storm is embedded in. A sample of one of their wind shear analyses is shown in Figure 1. Yellow contour lines mark wind shear values in knots. Pink lines with arrows show the direction of the shear (which is almost always the same as the direction of the upper level winds at 200 mb, since winds aloft are almost always stronger than winds near the surface). The contour lines are overlaid on a water vapor satellite image. Dark areas show where dry air is. The CIMSS plots are updated every three hours, and available about two hours after the time stamped on the image. All times are Greenwich time (UTC), four hours ahead of EDT. \n \n Shear example: Tropical Storm Gabrielle of 2007 \n \n Figure 2 shows a still image of the disturbance that eventually became Tropical Storm Gabrielle of 2007. At the time, Gabrielle had a well defined circulation from the surface to 850 mb, but could not develop any heavy thunderstorm activity near the center because strong upper level winds from the southwest blew away the thunderstorms as quickly as they formed. A 0.5Mb animation of satellite images shows this process quite clearly. The low level vortex of Gabrielle is stationary, and one can see thunderstorms trying to form at the center get sheared away by strong upper level southwesterly winds at 200 mb. The winds carry high, wispy cirrus clouds from lower left to upper right in the animation. These winds blew at about 20 knots (Figure 3), creating 20 knots of wind shear over the center of Gabrielle (where the winds were calm). Just north of the Gabrielle's center, the low-level flow from the surface to 850 mb (5,000 feet) was out of the northeast at about 10 knots, due to the counter-clockwise flow of air around the vortex. As one can see from Figure 3, the shear was thus 20 knots at 200 mb minus negative 10 knots at 850 mb (since the 850 mb winds were blowing in the opposite direction as the 200 mb winds), for a total wind shear of 30 knots. To the south of the vortex, the surface to 850 mb flow was out of the southwest (same direction as the 200 mb flow), so the shear was 20 knots minus positive 10 knots, for a total of 10 knots of shear. \n \n Figure 2. Visible satellite image of the tropical disturbance that eventually became Tropical Storm Gabrielle of 2007. The thick band of clouds extending from southwest to northeast is due to the presence of an upper level trough of low pressure.

These non-tropical systems will be moving around. \n \n \"At this early stage, it is unclear whether a non-tropical storm will draw Irma toward the U.S., push it away or miss affecting it entirely prior to the middle of the month,\" Kottlowski said. \n \n Possibilities range from a landfall from the northern Caribbean islands to Florida, the Carolinas or Bermuda. There is also a chance the system curves northward and avoids North America entirely. \n \n \"At some point this week, Irma will begin to take a more west-northwest path,\" Kottlowski said. \"Whether Irma then continues to curve northwestward and then northward or remains on a steady west-northwest path is uncertain.\" \n \n RELATED: \n \n AccuWeather hurricane center \n \n Downpours may hinder cleanup and recovery efforts in Texas, Louisiana early this week \n \n How to help: Donate to assist Harvey victims reeling from the storm's catastrophic damage \n \n AccuWeather predicts Hurricane Harvey to be more costly than Katrina, Sandy combined \n \n Reports: Water supply cut off for entire city of Beaumont, Texas, amid Harvey\u2019s horrific flooding \n \n More details on the path of Irma will follow in the coming days. \n \n Residents who live along the East Coast or have interests in the Caribbean Sea should take time to review emergency procedures and make sure they are prepared for extreme tropical conditions. \n \n Cruise and shipping interests may need to adjust their route as Irma approaches. \n \n Report a Typo", "(CNN) While much attention remains on Texas and the destruction left by Hurricane Harvey and its historic rainfall , powerful Hurricane Irma is rapidly intensifying in the open Atlantic and poses a major threat to the Caribbean and potentially to the United States next week. \n \n Satellite image taken at 8 a.m. ET Friday shows Hurricane Irma in the eastern Atlantic \n \n With the storm still five days away from the outermost Caribbean islands and at least a week away from any potential US impacts, there is still a lot of uncertainty about where it will go. \n \n The range of possibilities presented by the forecast models more than a week out literally spreads from Mexico to Canada -- and everywhere in between. \n \n Good bet at a casino is an intense Hurricane Irma at Cat 4 or 5.

Hope it's a \"fish storm\" pic.twitter.com/w6rWbbGVts \n \n Irma was designated a tropical storm Wednesday morning, and by Thursday afternoon, it had strengthened into a large Category 3 hurricane, with winds of 115 mph. \n \n Such explosive strengthening is known as \"rapid intensification,\" defined by the National Hurricane Center as having its wind speed increase at least 30 knots (35 mph) in 24 hours. \n \n \"Irma has become an impressive hurricane,\" the National Hurricane Center said Thursday, noting the rapid intensification. \"This is a remarkable 50 knot (58 mph) increase from yesterday at this time.\" \n \n Hurricane Harvey underwent rapid intensification just before it made landfall late last Friday, strengthening quickly from a tropical storm into a Category 4 hurricane when it moved onshore near Corpus Christi, Texas. \n \n Hurricane kryptonite not in the mix \n \n Irma is a classic \" Cape Verde hurricane ,\" a type of hurricane that forms in the far eastern Atlantic, near the Cape Verde Islands (now known as the Cabo Verde Islands), then tracks all the way across the Atlantic. Cape Verde storms frequently become some of the largest and most intense hurricanes. Examples are Hurricane Hugo, Hurricane Floyd, and Hurricane Ivan \n \n Hurricane Irma is forecast to continue to strengthen as it moves westward over the next five days, and the official forecast from the National Hurricane Center puts a dangerous Category 4 Hurricane Irma on the doorstep of the Caribbean by the end of the five-day forecast on Wednesday. \n \n #Irma has continued to strengthen over the eastern Atlantic and is now a major hurricane. Details at https://t.co/tW4KeGdBFb pic.twitter.com/gRAl1hzRnN \u2014 NHC Atlantic Ops (@NHC_Atlantic) August 31, 2017 \n \n A strong high-pressure ridge to the north of Irma, over the Atlantic, is steering the storm to the west and limiting the wind shear in the upper levels of the atmosphere, which has allowed the storm to grow so quickly. Wind shear is like hurricane kryptonite, and prevents storms from forming or gaining strength. \n \n Unfortunately, Irma will remain in a low-shear environment for the next several days, so there isn't much hope that Irma will weaken any time soon. \n \n There is considerable confidence that Hurricane Irma will track to the west through the weekend and then take a slight jog to the southwest early next week in response \"to a building ridge (of high pressure) over the central Atlantic.\" \n \n From there, the forecast becomes a lot less clear, with some major differences among some of the key models meteorologists use to forecast hurricanes. The differences are so drastic that one prediction has Irma sliding harmlessly back out to sea, while in another, it makes multiple disastrous landfalls in the Caribbean and likely hits the United States after that. \n \n Dueling prediction models \n \n The European model, or ECMWF, and the American GFS model have had some notable showdowns before, most notably with Hurricane Sandy. \n \n With Sandy, the ECMWF correctly predicted a landfall in the Northeast nearly a week ahead, while the GFS continually kept the storm offshore in what became a major black eye for the US weather-modeling industry . There have been other examples in which the GFS model has outperformed its European counterpart, such as with a few major snowstorms in the Northeast. \n \n Right now, the GFS has Irma taking a more northerly track that curves to the north before it reaches the Caribbean, thus making a US landfall much less likely. \n \n The European model keeps the storm tracking further west, nearing the Bahamas by the end of next week. \n \n European vs American weather models \n \n \"The ECMWF sees a much stronger ridge or Bermuda High (than the GFS) which forces Irma west, whereas the GFS has a weaker ridge and a more rightward, parabolic track,\" said Ryan Maue, a meteorologist with WeatherBell Analytics. \n \n \"The prospects for major impacts anywhere from Cuba to Carolinas is concerning for this very reliable model,\" Maue said. \n \n Irma is still more than 1,700 miles east of the Leeward Islands, and any impacts from the storm wouldn't be felt until Tuesday or Wednesday for the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico. \n \n The forecast picture should become clearer after the weekend. \n \n Bottom line: Hurricane Irma is already a powerful hurricane and looks to only become more so. Those with interests in the Caribbean and southeast US coast should pay close attention to the forecast.", "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Hurricane Harvey has left major devastation in Texas, but there is another hurricane called Irma out in the Atlantic that could take aim at the United States within the next week or so. \n \n Irma became a hurricane early on Thursday and by the evening it was upgraded to a major hurricane, which requires sustained winds greater than 110 miles (177 km) per hour (reut.rs/2wqRtvW). \n \n Given the early stages, weather models are not in total agreement over Irma\u2019s likely path or potential power, but all hurricane-prone areas - from the Gulf of Mexico clear up the Eastern Seaboard - could be in its target. \n \n Concerns are heightened for residents in coastal regions of the Southern and Eastern United States in the wake of Harvey, which dumped a record amount of rainfall for the continental United States over the Houston area within the past few days, leaving tens of thousands homeless. \n \n The damage is so devastating that Texas could require as much as $125 billion in aid from the U.S. government, larger than the record $110.2 billion aid package assembled in 2005 following Hurricane Katrina. \n \n Recent runs of the U.S. GFS model suggest Irma could gain significant strength and impact the Eastern Seaboard the weekend of Sept. 9. Whether that means a direct hit on the Carolinas or the Northeast, or just an offshore encounter is still uncertain. \n \n The midday Thursday European model shows some more alarming possibilities, with the hurricane gaining strength, clipping the southern end of Florida, and heading into the Gulf of Mexico \u2013 perhaps the worst-case scenario for those still reeling from Harvey. \n \n Although the Atlantic hurricane season is near its peak and storms in close succession are common, the prospect of another hurricane is stomach-churning. In addition to the human impact, Harvey has sent shockwaves through the transportation, energy, and retail industries, causing supply shortages and billions in losses. \n \n COMMODITY MARKETS JOLTED \n \n With Houston at the heart of the U.S. oil and gas industry, Harvey\u2019s hit has been felt most directly in the energy markets. The catastrophic flooding has shut down nearly a quarter of U.S. oil-refining capacity, threatening a national supply crunch. \n \n As such, benchmark U.S. gasoline prices hit two-year highs on Monday and tested nearly three-year highs on Thursday, and gasoline margins have rallied to the strongest levels in five years for this time of year. \n \n Transportation woes are plaguing the agriculture market. Grain elevators in coastal Texas have not been significantly damaged, but loading for export has halted as they are unable to receive supplies due to closure of flooded rail lines in the Houston area. \n \n Cattle and cotton have also been affected, as Texas is the No. 1 producer of each. Some 27 percent of the state\u2019s 4.46 million-head beef cow herd resides in the disaster area and cotton crop losses are estimated around $150 million, though the vast majority of cotton production takes place in the Panhandle, out of the storm\u2019s path. \n \n Harvey\u2019s remnants are now moving into the U.S. Delta states, where 20 percent of the nation\u2019s cotton and 15 percent of soybeans are grown. Soybean harvest has just begun in the far south areas, but parts of the region could receive up to 8 inches (0.2 m) over the next five days. \n \n ACTIVE SEASON PREDICTED \n \n The hurricane threat in the North Atlantic Basin is far from over, though. \n \n Back in May, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center gave the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season \u2013 which began on June 1 \u2013 a 45 percent chance of featuring above-normal activity. In its Aug. 9 update, NHC bumped these chances to 60 percent and noted \u201cthe possibility that the season could be extremely active.\u201d \n \n Forecasters point to a few primary reasons. One is that the large-scale climate indicator El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation \u2013 or ENSO \u2013 has much higher chances of sustaining neutral conditions through the end of the year rather than trend toward the warm phase El Ni\u00f1o as earlier forecasts suggested. \n \n El Ni\u00f1o often suppresses tropical storm development in the North Atlantic since it features greater atmospheric stability and stronger winds that make it difficult for big, organized storms to form. ENSO\u2019s cool phase, La Ni\u00f1a, usually promotes a favorable environment for tropical development in the Atlantic. \n \n Additionally, sea surface temperatures in the key formation region of the ocean are warmer than models had previously predicted and the West African monsoon is stronger. Tropical cyclone formation in the North Atlantic often begins with an atmospheric wave off the African coast and most generally, warmer waters provide more fuel to the storm. \n \n As of Aug. 31, there have been nine named storms in the North Atlantic Basin \u2013 above the long-term average of five for the date \u2013 so the season has been more active than normal so far, including a rare April-forming tropical storm. \n \n NHC forecasters also mention that the enhanced early-season activity back in June and July in the tropical Atlantic usually suggests an above-average season ahead. \n \n The climatological peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is Sept. 10 and the season officially ends on Nov. 30. Activity can persist into December, but these storms usually never make it to hurricane status and have occurred only a handful of times in the last couple decades. \n \n During August and September, all coastal areas along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean are historically susceptible to tropical cyclones that could make landfall. Into October and beyond, this threat tends to focus more on Florida and the Eastern Seaboard rather than the Gulf (reut.rs/2wlDF7D). \n \n But to have another storm as severe as Harvey anytime soon may be unlikely, as Harvey was statistically rare. It was only the fifth hurricane in the last 50 years to make landfall in the United States with Category 4 strength or greater, with the last one being Charley in 2004. \n \n (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a market analyst for Reuters.)", "\n \n Back to Basic Definitions Page | Back to Main FAQ Page \n \n Subject: A2) What is a \"Cape Verde\" hurricane?

CNN reports on Irma, currently a Category 3 hurricane that experienced \"rapid intensification\" from Wednesday into Thursday, meaning its wind speed ramped up at least 35mph in that period\u2014though the National Hurricane Center on Thursday noted the \"remarkable\" increase measured 58mph. A National Hurricane Center alert issued early Friday pegs maximum sustained winds at 115mph, with higher gusts. The storm is expected to approach the Caribbean by Tuesday or so as a Category 4 storm, then possibly the US\u2014though meteorological models with wildly different scenarios show it's too early to make any definitive predictions on where the storm will land. Irma is what's called a \"Cape Verde\" hurricane, meaning one that forms off the coast of Africa then shoots across the Atlantic; CNN notes these storm systems can turn into particularly powerful ones (Hurricane Hugo is one example). What's emboldening Irma is a lack of the \"hurricane kryptonite\" known as wind shear, which often acts to tamp down hurricanes. A powerful high-pressure ridge is pushing Irma westward and keeping wind shear low. What one of the models is showing that has some concerned, per Reuters: Irma could head straight into the Gulf of Mexico, which could be bad news for areas still struggling after Harvey. \"All interests in the eastern Caribbean will need to monitor the progress of this evolving and dangerous hurricane,\" an AccuWeather hurricane expert notes, reiterating he can't say \"with certainty\" how the US will be affected.", "ranking": [2, 3, 1, 0, 4]}

I can\u2019t think of another way to describe the odd trick pulled off by \u201cThe Other Guys,\u201d a new goofballs-and-fireballs comedy directed by Adam McKay . The closing credit sequence is, in effect, a tease for a movie quite different from the one that has just concluded. \n \n Bold, brightly colored charts and graphs fill the screen with enraging data about bloated chief-executive bonuses, billion-dollar bank bailouts, Ponzi schemes and other entries in the encyclopedia of modern financial infamy. Looking at these shocking numbers in isolation, you might be tempted to think that you had just watched an angry populist satire skewering the powerful and the privileged. But such topical provocation has been missing from commercial American comedy for a very long time, and \u201cThe Other Guys\u201d is no exception. Its plot does feature a devious equity-fund manager (played by the reliable British weasel-for-hire Steve Coogan) and a Wall Street vixen, but the plot is neither the movie\u2019s point nor its most memorable feature. \n \n Instead, Mr. McKay plays to his strengths and those of his frequent collaborator and the movie\u2019s star, Will Ferrell. In other words, \u201cThe Other Guys\u201d is most authentically itself when it indulges in a free-form but nonetheless highly disciplined silliness that has the effect of dissolving, rather than piquing, whatever worldly anger or frustration you may be harboring. Once again, and for the first time in a while, Mr. Ferrell uses his big body, his quick mind and his infinitely fungible voice to yoke disparate and ridiculous traits into a brand new and yet instantly archetypal comic character. \n \n Allen Gamble, Mr. Ferrell\u2019s mild-mannered, desk-bound police detective, lacks the pompous aggression of Ron Burgundy in \u201cAnchorman,\u201d the aw-shucks aggression of Ricky Bobby in \u201cTalladega Nights\u201d or the infantile aggression of Brennan Huff in \u201cStep Brothers\u201d (all directed by Mr. McKay). Instead, he is aggressively, ostentatiously, explosively passive \u2014 a combustible milquetoast. Gamble is timid, gullible, irresistible to gorgeous women and yet oblivious to their interest. He makes no sense at all, except in the absurd context of the movie\u2019s craziest moments. \n \n Gamble\u2019s foil is Terry Hoitz, an unlucky detective played by Mark Wahlberg, who looks like an inflamed bantam rooster next to Mr. Ferrell\u2019s timorous ostrich. Actually, the two of them supply a more vivid \u2014 if less comprehensible \u2014 zoological metaphor in the film\u2019s funniest scene, a rhetorical sparring match in which lions battle tunas for animal-kingdom supremacy. \n \n When it operates in this nonsensical zone of verbal riffing and broad slapstick (the most inspired example of which is a brawl at a funeral conducted in respectful whispers), \u201cThe Other Guys\u201d provides some pretty good laughs. Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson make fun of their action-hero personae and then step aside to let Mr. Ferrell and Mr. Wahlberg do their thing.

Given the pressure at General Motors, can you do both well? \n \n Barra graciously answered the question, telling Lauer that she has a great team, a wonderful family and a supportive husband. Notably, she didn\u2019t turn that question back on Lauer to ask how he handles his demanding work schedule at NBC and still manages to be a good father. \n \n Male executives almost never hear that question. MongoDB\u2019s now-former CEO Max Schireson can attest to that. \n \n The head of the database company decided to step down Tuesday after asking himself how he can balance the dual demands of fatherhood and running a company. \n \n \u201cAs a male CEO, I have been asked what kind of car I drive and what type of music I like, but never how I balance the demands of being both a dad and a CEO,\u201d wrote Schireson in a blog post explaining why he decided to step down as the chief executive for MongoDB. \n \n Women are still the focus of the \u201chaving it all\u201d debate and questions of whether or not they can be wildly successful at both a high-powered job and day-to-day parenting. Now their male counterparts are asking the same question of themselves. \n \n Schireson, who helped grow the database company into a billion-dollar business, is on pace to fly 300,000 miles this year between the normal CEO travel duties and commuting from his home in Palo Alto, Calif. to the company\u2019s New York City office. \n \n All that time on the road adds up to many hours and days away from his family, including three kids. \n \n \u201cDuring that travel, I have missed a lot of family fun, perhaps, more importantly, I was not with my kids when our puppy was hit by a car, or when my son had (minor and successful, and of course unexpected) emergency surgery.\u201d \n \n He credits his wife for helping to pick up the slack when he was away. Not an easy task considering her high-pressure role as a doctor and Stanford professor. \n \n \u201cFriends and colleagues often ask my wife how she balances her job and motherhood,\u201d Schireson wrote. \u201cSomehow, the same people don\u2019t ask me.\u201d \n \n Questions like these have gnawed at women, who openly debate the value of work and family. Sheryl Sandberg has encouraged women to \u201clean in.\u201d Cover articles in national magazines have delved into the minutiae of making the right choice as a mom and a professional, not to mention the countless blog posts in response to both. \n \n While it\u2019s enviable that Schireson can step down as CEO to simply work \u201cnormal full time\u201d as vice chairman, the fact that a male CEO is asking the same questions that a female CEO might ask is an important step towards leveling the playing field for top executives, regardless of their gender. \n \n It\u2019s time for the \u201chaving it all\u201d debate to move beyond gender. The math is the same, as Schireson concludes, whether you\u2019re male or female:", "Juliette Kayyem, who several years ago left the Department of Homeland Security soon after her husband, David Barron, left a high position in the Justice Department, says their joint decision to leave Washington and return to Boston sprang from their desire to work on the \u201chappiness project,\u201d meaning quality time with their three children. (She borrowed the term from her friend Gretchen Rubin, who wrote a best-selling book and now runs a blog with that name.) \n \n It\u2019s time to embrace a national happiness project. As a daughter of Charlottesville, Virginia, the home of Thomas Jefferson and the university he founded, I grew up with the Declaration of Independence in my blood. Last I checked, he did not declare American independence in the name of life, liberty, and professional success. Let us rediscover the pursuit of happiness, and let us start at home. \n \n Innovation Nation \n \n As I write this, I can hear the reaction of some readers to many of the proposals in this essay: It\u2019s all fine and well for a tenured professor to write about flexible working hours, investment intervals, and family-comes-first management. But what about the real world? Most American women cannot demand these things, particularly in a bad economy, and their employers have little incentive to grant them voluntarily. Indeed, the most frequent reaction I get in putting forth these ideas is that when the choice is whether to hire a man who will work whenever and wherever needed, or a woman who needs more flexibility, choosing the man will add more value to the company. \n \n In fact, while many of these issues are hard to quantify and measure precisely, the statistics seem to tell a different story. A seminal study of 527 U.S. companies, published in the Academy of Management Journal in 2000, suggests that \u201corganizations with more extensive work-family policies have higher perceived firm-level performance\u201d among their industry peers. These findings accorded with a 2003 study conducted by Michelle Arthur at the University of New Mexico. Examining 130 announcements of family-friendly policies in The Wall Street Journal, Arthur found that the announcements alone significantly improved share prices. In 2011, a study on flexibility in the workplace by Ellen Galinsky, Kelly Sakai, and Tyler Wigton of the Families and Work Institute showed that increased flexibility correlates positively with job engagement, job satisfaction, employee retention, and employee health. \n \n This is only a small sampling from a large and growing literature trying to pin down the relationship between family-friendly policies and economic performance. Other scholars have concluded that good family policies attract better talent, which in turn raises productivity, but that the policies themselves have no impact on productivity. Still others argue that results attributed to these policies are actually a function of good management overall. What is evident, however, is that many firms that recruit and train well-educated professional women are aware that when a woman leaves because of bad work-family balance, they are losing the money and time they invested in her. \n \n Even the legal industry, built around the billable hour, is taking notice. Deborah Epstein Henry, a former big-firm litigator, is now the president of Flex-Time Lawyers, a national consulting firm focused partly on strategies for the retention of female attorneys. In her book Law and Reorder, published by the American Bar Association in 2010, she describes a legal profession \u201cwhere the billable hour no longer works\u201d; where attorneys, judges, recruiters, and academics all agree that this system of compensation has perverted the industry, leading to brutal work hours, massive inefficiency, and highly inflated costs. The answer\u2014already being deployed in different corners of the industry\u2014is a combination of alternative fee structures, virtual firms, women-owned firms, and the outsourcing of discrete legal jobs to other jurisdictions. Women, and Generation X and Y lawyers more generally, are pushing for these changes on the supply side; clients determined to reduce legal fees and increase flexible service are pulling on the demand side. Slowly, change is happening. \n \n At the core of all this is self-interest. Losing smart and motivated women not only diminishes a company\u2019s talent pool; it also reduces the return on its investment in training and mentoring. In trying to address these issues, some firms are finding out that women\u2019s ways of working may just be better ways of working, for employees and clients alike. \n \n Experts on creativity and innovation emphasize the value of encouraging nonlinear thinking and cultivating randomness by taking long walks or looking at your environment from unusual angles. In their new book, A New Culture of Learning: Cultivating the Imagination for a World of Constant Change, the innovation gurus John Seely Brown and Douglas Thomas write, \u201cWe believe that connecting play and imagination may be the single most important step in unleashing the new culture of learning.\u201d \n \n Space for play and imagination is exactly what emerges when rigid work schedules and hierarchies loosen up. Skeptics should consider the \u201cCalifornia effect.\u201d California is the cradle of American innovation\u2014in technology, entertainment, sports, food, and lifestyles. It is also a place where people take leisure as seriously as they take work; where companies like Google deliberately encourage play, with Ping-Pong tables, light sabers, and policies that require employees to spend one day a week working on whatever they wish. Charles Baudelaire wrote: \u201cGenius is nothing more nor less than childhood recovered at will.\u201d Google apparently has taken note. \n \n No parent would mistake child care for childhood. Still, seeing the world anew through a child\u2019s eyes can be a powerful source of stimulation. When the Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling wrote The Strategy of Conflict, a classic text applying game theory to conflicts among nations, he frequently drew on child-rearing for examples of when deterrence might succeed or fail. \u201cIt may be easier to articulate the peculiar difficulty of constraining [a ruler] by the use of threats,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwhen one is fresh from a vain attempt at using threats to keep a small child from hurting a dog or a small dog from hurting a child.\u201d \n \n The books I\u2019ve read with my children, the silly movies I\u2019ve watched, the games I\u2019ve played, questions I\u2019ve answered, and people I\u2019ve met while parenting have broadened my world. Another axiom of the literature on innovation is that the more often people with different perspectives come together, the more likely creative ideas are to emerge. Giving workers the ability to integrate their non-work lives with their work\u2014whether they spend that time mothering or marathoning\u2014will open the door to a much wider range of influences and ideas. \n \n Enlisting Men \n \n Perhaps the most encouraging news of all for achieving the sorts of changes that I have proposed is that men are joining the cause. In commenting on a draft of this article, Martha Minow, the dean of the Harvard Law School, wrote me that one change she has observed during 30 years of teaching law at Harvard is that today many young men are asking questions about how they can manage a work-life balance. And more systematic research on Generation Y confirms that many more men than in the past are asking questions about how they are going to integrate active parenthood with their professional lives. \n \n Abstract aspirations are easier than concrete trade-offs, of course. These young men have not yet faced the question of whether they are prepared to give up that more prestigious clerkship or fellowship, decline a promotion, or delay their professional goals to spend more time with their children and to support their partner\u2019s career. \n \n Yet once work practices and work culture begin to evolve, those changes are likely to carry their own momentum. Kara Owen, the British foreign-service officer who worked a London job from Dublin, wrote me in an e-mail: \n \n I think the culture on flexible working started to change the minute the Board of Management (who were all men at the time) started to work flexibly\u2014quite a few of them started working one day a week from home. \n \n Men have, of course, become much more involved parents over the past couple of decades, and that, too, suggests broad support for big changes in the way we balance work and family. It is noteworthy that both James Steinberg, deputy secretary of state, and William Lynn, deputy secretary of defense, stepped down two years into the Obama administration so that they could spend more time with their children (for real). \n \n Going forward, women would do well to frame work-family balance in terms of the broader social and economic issues that affect both women and men. After all, we have a new generation of young men who have been raised by full-time working mothers. Let us presume, as I do with my sons, that they will understand \u201csupporting their families\u201d to mean more than earning money. \n \n I have been blessed to work with and be mentored by some extraordinary women. Watching Hillary Clinton in action makes me incredibly proud\u2014of her intelligence, expertise, professionalism, charisma, and command of any audience. I get a similar rush when I see a front-page picture of Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, deep in conversation about some of the most important issues on the world stage; or of Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, standing up forcefully for the Syrian people in the Security Council. \n \n These women are extraordinary role models. If I had a daughter, I would encourage her to look to them, and I want a world in which they are extraordinary but not unusual. Yet I also want a world in which, in Lisa Jackson\u2019s words, \u201cto be a strong woman, you don\u2019t have to give up on the things that define you as a woman.\u201d That means respecting, enabling, and indeed celebrating the full range of women\u2019s choices. \u201cEmpowering yourself,\u201d Jackson said in her speech at Princeton, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to mean rejecting motherhood, or eliminating the nurturing or feminine aspects of who you are.\u201d \n \n I gave a speech at Vassar last November and arrived in time to wander the campus on a lovely fall afternoon. It is a place infused with a spirit of community and generosity, filled with benches, walkways, public art, and quiet places donated by alumnae seeking to encourage contemplation and connection. Turning the pages of the alumni magazine (Vassar is now coed), I was struck by the entries of older alumnae, who greeted their classmates with Salve (Latin for \u201chello\u201d) and wrote witty remembrances sprinkled with literary allusions. Theirs was a world in which women wore their learning lightly; their news is mostly of their children\u2019s accomplishments. Many of us look back on that earlier era as a time when it was fine to joke that women went to college to get an \u201cM.R.S.\u201d And many women of my generation abandoned the Seven Sisters as soon as the formerly all-male Ivy League universities became coed. I would never return to the world of segregated sexes and rampant discrimination. But now is the time to revisit the assumption that women must rush to adapt to the \u201cman\u2019s world\u201d that our mothers and mentors warned us about. \n \n I continually push the young women in my classes to speak more. They must gain the confidence to value their own insights and questions, and to present them readily. My husband agrees, but he actually tries to get the young men in his classes to act more like the women\u2014to speak less and listen more. If women are ever to achieve real equality as leaders, then we have to stop accepting male behavior and male choices as the default and the ideal. We must insist on changing social policies and bending career tracks to accommodate our choices, too. We have the power to do it if we decide to, and we have many men standing beside us. \n \n We\u2019ll create a better society in the process, for all women. We may need to put a woman in the White House before we are able to change the conditions of the women working at Walmart. But when we do, we will stop talking about whether women can have it all. We will properly focus on how we can help all Americans have healthy, happy, productive lives, valuing the people they love as much as the success they seek. \n \n We want to hear what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.", "In a blog post on his personal site Tuesday, Max Schireson, the CEO of the software company MongoDB, announced that he was leaving his position because he couldn't continue to properly run the company in New York and support his family in California. \n \n \"Friends and colleagues often ask my wife how she balances her job and motherhood,\" Schireson wrote, citing recent high profile interviews with the CEO of GM or the CEO of Pepsi. \"Somehow, the same people don't ask me.\" \n \n \"As a male CEO, I have been asked what kind of car I drive and what type of music I like, but never how I balance the demands of being both a dad and a CEO,\" Schireson added, explaining that he loves spending time with his kids but doesn't love what he's missing when he's away from them because of his job. He also discussed the amount of work his wife \u2013 herself a doctor and a professor \u2013 does when he's gone. \n \n Schireson will remain with the company as Vice Chairman, supporting MongoDB's new CEO. In an interview with Forbes, he said that choosing to spend time with his family (which is often a code phrase people use when they've been forced out) \"is not a euphemism.\" \n \n Advertisement \n \n \"I hope that me telling this story in my position will help others feel more comfortable in making similar choices,\" Schireson told The Today Show. \"And help people in senior leadership roles be more public about it.\" \n \n On his site, Schireson wrote that he's aware that this decision might put him out of the running \"from some future CEO role\": \n \n Will that cost me tens of millions of dollars someday? Maybe. Life is about choices. Right now, I choose to spend more time with my family and am confident that I can continue to have an meaningful and rewarding work life while doing so. At first, it seemed like a hard choice, but the more I have sat with the choice the more certain I am that it is the right choice. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The responses to his blog post are overwhelmingly positive; even his daughter wrote in to say, \"I'm glad you will be able to spend more time with us at home. yayyyyy.\" \n \n It's somewhat fascinating, however, to consider what the response would be if a woman did the same thing as Schireson; she'd probably be at the receiving end of concern from other women that she was giving up her career. (Though as Schireson touches on, women who focus too much on their careers are judged just as much. Women: they can't win.). But with regards to work-life balance, men and women are struggling to each be accepted for doing the thing the other one has traditionally done without notice or praise. Maybe eventually we'll meet in the middle.", "Earlier this summer, Matt Lauer asked Mary Barra, the CEO of GM, whether she could balance the demands of being a mom and being a CEO. The Atlantic asked similar questions of PepsiCo\u2019s female CEO Indra Nooyi. As a male CEO, I have been asked what kind of car I drive and what type of music I like, but never how I balance the demands of being both a dad and a CEO. \n \n While the press haven\u2019t asked me, it is a question that I often ask myself. Here is my situation: \n \n * I have 3 wonderful kids at home, aged 14, 12 and 9, and I love spending time with them: skiing, cooking, playing backgammon, swimming, watching movies or Warriors or Giants games, talking, whatever. \n \n * I am on pace to fly 300,000 miles this year, all the normal CEO travel plus commuting between Palo Alto and New York every 2-3 weeks. During that travel, I have missed a lot of family fun, perhaps more importantly, I was not with my kids when our puppy was hit by a car or when my son had (minor and successful, and of course unexpected) emergency surgery. \n \n * I have an amazing wife who also has an important career; she is a doctor and professor at Stanford where, in addition to her clinical duties, she runs their training program for high risk obstetricians and conducts research on on prematurity, surgical techniques, and other topics. She is a fantastic mom, brilliant, beautiful, and infinitely patient with me. I love her, I am forever in her debt for finding a way to keep the family working despite my crazy travel. I should not continue abusing that patience. \n \n Friends and colleagues often ask my wife how she balances her job and motherhood. Somehow, the same people don\u2019t ask me. \n \n A few months ago, I decided the only way to balance was by stepping back from my job. MongoDB is a special company. In my nearly 4 years at the company, we have raised $220 million, grown the team 15x and grown sales 30x. We have amazing customers, a great product which gets better with every release, the strongest team I have ever worked with, and incredible momentum in the market. The future is bright and MongoDB deserves a leader who can be \u201call-in\u201d and make the most of the opportunity. \n \n Unfortunately, I cannot be that leader given the geography of the majority of the company in New York and my family in California. \n \n I recognize that by writing this I may be disqualifying myself from some future CEO role. Will that cost me tens of millions of dollars someday? Maybe. Life is about choices. Right now, I choose to spend more time with my family and am confident that I can continue to have an meaningful and rewarding work life while doing so. At first, it seemed like a hard choice, but the more I have sat with the choice the more certain I am that it is the right choice. \n \n In one month, I will hand the CEO role to an incredibly capable leader in Dev Ittycheria. He will have the task of leading the company through its next phase of growth (though thankfully not of commuting across the country while doing it!). I know the company will be in great hands; his skills fit our next phase of growth better than mine do. And I will be there to help (full time, but \u201cnormal full time\u201d and not \u201ccrazy full time\u201d) in whatever areas he needs help. More about the announcement can be found in today\u2019s press release. \n \n I hope I will be able to find a way to craft a role at MongoDB which is engaging, impactful, and compatible with the most important responsibilities in my life. As great as this job has been, I look forward to creating one which is even better. \n \n \u2014 Max", "Billion-dollar database company MongoDB has announced a new CEO, outsider Dev Ittycheria, after just one year with Max Schireson at the helm. A former software CEO turned investor, Ittycheria will become president and CEO as of September 3, when Schireson will drop into a vice chairman role. \n \n Ittycheria joins from OpenView Partners, a middle-stage venture capital firm focused on software. Before that, he did a quick stint as a venture partner at Sand Hill Road stalwart Greylock Partners. An electrical engineer by trade, Ittycheria's managing experience comes as president of BMC Software and as cofounder and CEO of BladeLogic, a company he sold to BMC in 2008 for $900 million. \n \n The Palo Alto-based Schireson had been CEO of MongoDB for a year and a few months, assuming the title last January after joining the company in 2011 as president. But Schireson says his tour of duty as leader was really more the almost four years he spent in the two roles, because as he puts it, \"There wasn't a heck of a lot of difference as CEO from when I was president, because everyone except [cofounder and chairman] Dwight [Merriman] had to answer to me.\" He had joined the company from MarkLogic, where he'd served as COO, as well as nine years as a vice president at Oracle . \n \n [Update]: In a call with Forbes, Schireson says that he decided to step down because of the toll imposed on him by constant travel between the company's New York City and Palo Alto headquarters and from customer visits. Spending more time with his family, the outgoing CEO says, \"is not a euphemism. It's something I needed to do for my family, and there's never a convenient time.\" \n \n A tipping point for Schireson came on a long-delayed overnight flight to Austin. The CEO woke up in Tuscon to discover his flight had gone through an emergency landing and needed to replace some crew members traumatized by the experience--all while he slept, desperately trying to catch up on rest. \"In that moment, I realized, 'What am I doing?'\" \n \n Schireson's also been a CEO at times uncomfortable with the spotlight. Back in September, he wrote a blog post, \"The Challenge of Being an Introverted CEO,\" in which he noted that he struggled to meet new employees and handle the more social aspects of the job. He reflected: \n \n \"As for my effectiveness in running the company, perhaps I would be more effective if I were more gregarious with the team. Certainly they would like it day to day. On the other hand, I do think there are advantages to my style. In larger groups I often like to hang back and listen. One of the hardest things for a CEO as a company gets large is having good data. While I am not a magnetic outgoing leader, I think I can listen well and I have high empathy. And I think we have built a strong team and they are pointed in a good direction.\" \n \n Schireson says he's most proud of of the trust the company's gained from major customers like banks and big internet companies, but he also oversaw the company's ascent to the top of the private tech company ranks in New York City. Back in October, the company raised $150 million in October of 2013 from investors led by Fidelity Investments and with new investors Altimeter Capital and T. Rowe Price. That deal valued the company at $1.2 billion, putting it in the ranks of unicorn billion-dollar startups, and also validated its NoSQL database approach with some other tech heavyweights, as Salesforce.com , Intel Capital and Red Hat all invested alongside top venture firms Sequoia Capital and New Enterprise Associates. \n \n Ittycheria inherits a company with over $231 million in funding and more than 600 customers including Cisco, MetLife, MTV and Forbes, charging them annual subscription revenues per server for its database solution and additional features. \n \n The company once known at 10gen remains dual-headquartered in both New York and Palo Alto, where Schireson was based, with more than 400 employees across at least 8 global offices. 10gen had been founded in 2007 by Merriman, a cofounder of ad tech company DoubleClick that became the backbone of Google's online advertising offerings, as well as by ShopWiki cofounder Eliot Horowitz, now the company's CTO. Merriman also cofounded Business Insider and Gilt Groupe alongside longtime business partner Kevin Ryan and remains chairman of MongoDB. \n \n \"We are delighted that Dev will be leading the next leg of our amazing growth,\" Merriman said in a press release on the news. \"Max has built a world-class team that has shipped great software, raised a record amount of money from smart investors, attracted hundreds of great partners and generated millions in revenue from the world's leading companies. Dev's skills are a fantastic addition as we continue to grow our leadership in the market.\" \n \n Ittycheria brings more operations expertise than the company's two previous CEOs, both with technical backgrounds, which Schireson says will be critical for the company to continue to expand global sales. But perhaps most importantly, Ittycheria's willing to take up the bi-coastal challenge, which Schireson argues is tough on the top executive but good for customers who get local executive presences and sales reps. \n \n Most importantly, Ittycheria's got the spotlight from now on, as Schireson gets his wish for a future of more anonymity. \n \n This story has been updated with comment from MongoDB CEO Max Schireson."], "summary": "\u2013 Until now, the public debate of work-vs-family has focused more on female workers than male ones. So Max Schireson's decision to demote himself at a major software company and move back home with his family is turning a few heads, Jezebel reports. \"Friends and colleagues often ask my wife how she balances her job and motherhood,\" wrote Schireson in a blog post. \"Somehow, the same people don't ask me.\" His 19-month stint at the helm of MongoDB in New York City has been successful\u2014he helped turn it \"into a billion-dollar business,\" Fortune notes\u2014but the time away from his wife, children, and puppy in Palo Alto, Calif., has proved just too hard.

Lawyers successfully advocated for her to undergo hormone therapy while in prison. After six years behind bars, she was released from Fort Leavenworth prison on 17 May when, in one of his final acts as US president, Barack Obama commuted her sentence, saying \u201cjustice has been served.\u201d Manning has been living in New York since her release. \n \n Chelsea E.

Everyone keeps saying: \u2018You should have gone through the proper channels!\u2019 But the proper channels don\u2019t work.\u201d \n \n She also spoke about her time in prison, the psychological toll of which involved her making multiple suicide attempts and being shut away in solitary confinement. \n \n Since her release from prison, however, Manning\u2019s online persona has been a font of joy and positivity. In spite of relentless targeting by trolls and detractors, her tweets are frequently peppered with rainbows, hearts and smile emojis. \n \n Manning is not the first trans woman to feature in Vogue\u2019s pages, with models and trans women such as Hari Nef and Andreja Pejic having previously featuring in the fashion magazine. Earlier this year, French Vogue made headlines when Brazilian model Valentina Sampaio was revealed on the cover of their March issue \u2013 the first time the magazine had featured a transwoman on the cover.", "One hot, humid early-summer evening in New York, a hired car slows on Bleecker Street, and a young woman inside prepares for her first party out in years. She is wearing a midnight-colored semiformal dress by Altuzarra and Everlane ankle boots with heels. Her hair is trimmed into a pixie cut; her makeup softens, but won\u2019t hide, a dust of freckles. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll know anybody,\u201d she fretted earlier, but she seems to have quelled what nerves remain. She is accompanied by a couple of men who surround her like guards. For the first time in a long time, that\u2019s a welcome thing. \n \n Chelsea Manning\u2014graceful, blue-eyed, trans\u2014smiles and prepares herself. Since her release from the Fort Leavenworth prison, on May 17, Manning has been living in New York, with a low profile. Tonight she will make her social debut in her own skin. From February to April 2010, while living as Bradley, an Army intelligence analyst stationed in Iraq, Manning sent three-quarters of a million classified or sensitive documents to WikiLeaks. The breach\u2019s breadth was startling, as were its contents, ranging from the so-called Collateral Murder video, showing a U.S. helicopter killing a group of Baghdad pedestrians that included children and press, to hundreds of thousands of \u201cCablegate\u201d documents, disclosing 44 years of State Department messaging. When Manning\u2019s role became clear, she turned into a polarizing figure\u2014celebrated as a whistle-blower by some, condemned as a traitor by others. In August 2013, after pleading guilty to ten charges and being found guilty of 20, she was sentenced to 35 years in prison. The day after the sentencing, Manning came out publicly as trans. \n \n Tonight, a summer Monday, is a different kind of coming-out. To honor the occasion, she has picked an event with a celebratory turn: the after-party for the Lambda Literary Awards, which each year honor books by members of the LGBTQ community. The evening is glamorous; the guest list is varied. Here Manning will reintroduce herself to a community in which she seeks acceptance for more than her heavy past. \n \n The car stops in front of Le Poisson Rouge, a Washington Square art space. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how to do this,\u201d Chase Strangio, an ACLU lawyer, murmurs in the front seat. A gregarious young man with a trim Clark Gable mustache, Strangio has emerged as one of the nation\u2019s leading trans-rights lawyers, helping represent Gavin Grimm, the trans student in Virginia who challenged his exclusion from the boys\u2019 bathroom at his high school, and successfully advocating for Manning\u2019s hormone therapy in prison. With Manning now out in the world, however, he faces a new challenge: remaining alert to unwelcome attention. \n \n \u201cI think that looks pretty discreet,\u201d Tim Travers Hawkins, a filmmaker who\u2019s making a documentary on Manning, says, judging the entry. When his project, executive-produced by Laura Poitras, started two years back, he intended to use Manning\u2019s prison diaries to shape a documentary with an invisible hero. Then, in the final days of his term, President Obama commuted Manning\u2019s sentence. \u201cIt was kind of unbelievable,\u201d Poitras says. \u201cAll the news had been so, so bad.\u201d For Hawkins, Manning\u2019s release introduced new imperatives. \u201cIt was a radical shift in the way the film existed,\u201d Hawkins says. Tonight, he\u2019s brought a compact camera along. \n \n Manning, Strangio, and Hawkins clamber rapidly inside. A Lambda host guides Manning down a flight of steps. The party is just starting. At one end of the space, a platform, slightly raised above the dance floor, is marked off with velvet rope. A plate of crudit\u00e9s awaits; Manning orders a gimlet. She\u2019s extroverted, she says: \u201cI love being around people.\u201d While living as a man, she often went to clubs and parties, even in stodgy Washington, D.C. \u201cPeople are a lot more open and outgoing in New York,\u201d Manning explains. \u201cIn D.C., you really had to, like, know someone.\u201d \n \n Music pounds through the room, which is dim and bathed in blue and fuchsia light. As the space fills, a few brave souls approach Manning, then a few more. Soon the platform is packed with people hoping to take a flash-bleached selfie. \n \n \u201cI just wanted to say hello. You\u2019re, like, a perfect hero.\u201d \n \n \u201cI\u2019m going to give you this card. We\u2019d love to throw a party for your return.\u201d \n \n Manning seems startled by the attention. \u201cThank you!\u201d she keeps saying. She is 29 now, with a confidence that, even in a novel city, hits like sunlight at high altitude. Though she\u2019s petite\u2014just a few inches over five feet\u2014she speaks with a clarion directness, as if constantly projecting toward an unseen back row. In prison, she read the fashion press (\u201cI missed seven years of fashion, but I went through every season in a magazine!\u201d), and while she\u2019s embraced her femininity, she eschews what she calls \u201cfertility style\u201d\u2014\u201cbunnies and hearts and stuff\u201d\u2014for more current, gender-neutral garments. While serving out her sentence, she got her hands on photos from Barneys\u2019 2014 trans campaign, shot by Bruce Weber. \u201cThat was a really important thing for me to see,\u201d she says. \n \n From the stage, the DJ mixes sharpen: \u201cUptown Funk,\u201d \u201cI Feel It Coming.\u201d But there isn\u2019t time to dance. She\u2019s standing, greeting new faces from all sides, thanking, thanking some more. Her left arm is crossed over her belly, cradling her opposite elbow, which is straight. When Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cLove on Top\u201d begins its climbing modulations, she uncrosses her arms and begins fidgeting\u2014mindlessly, flirtatiously\u2014with the charm on her gold necklace, drawing it back and forth between her thumb and forefinger. She sways. She lets herself lean forward, laughing at a joke. When her newest friend wanders away, she turns around and smiles. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m starting to loosen up!\u201d she says. \n \n When Manning was growing up in Crescent, a town of some 1,400 north of Oklahoma City, she struggled to pinpoint a reason she felt so awkward. \u201cI knew that I was different,\u201d she says. \u201cI gravitated more toward playing house, but the teachers were always pushing me toward playing the more competitive games with the boys.\u201d She recalls, \u201cI spent so much time wondering, What\u2019s wrong with me? Why can\u2019t I fit in?\u201d Sometimes she felt left behind; at other times, she leaped out in front. Once, she and a group of other kids were allowed to take a field trip to Frontier City, an amusement park known for its loopy, soaring Silver Bullet roller coaster. Other students were petrified. Manning couldn\u2019t wait to get on and boarded the ride all alone: \u201cI\u2019m a bit of an adrenaline junkie, I think it\u2019s safe to say.\u201d \n \n It\u2019s a June afternoon, and we are sitting in a park along the Hudson River, a short walk from the sleek Tribeca building where Manning has been living since arriving in New York. Today she is dressed with a mixture of straightforward elegance and function: a casual black sleeveless Marc Jacobs dress with playful paisley lining, a small purse from The Row, Borderline boots by Vetements x Dr. Martens, and\u2014the cinching touch\u2014a black utility belt from 5.11 Tactical, a gear company that supplies law enforcement and the military. \u201cI\u2019ve been a huge fan of Marc Jacobs for many, many years, even going back to when I was wearing men\u2019s clothing,\u201d she explains. \u201cHe captures a kind of simplicity and a kind of beauty that I like\u2014projecting strength through femininity.\u201d \n \n In Manning\u2019s telling, strength was a necessity before it was a choice. When she was eleven, her father, a computer engineer who\u2019d gotten his start in the Navy, announced that he was moving out, effectively ending his marriage. That night, her mother swallowed a bottle of pills, then told Chelsea\u2019s older sister, Casey, what she\u2019d done. On the hurried drive to emergency room, the journalist Denver Nicks reports in Private, his book on Manning\u2019s early life, it was Chelsea\u2019s job to sit with her mother in the backseat and make sure that she did not stop breathing. \n \n Over the months that followed, Casey and Chelsea, then still known as Bradley, struggled to manage their mother\u2019s alcoholism while also learning to navigate basic domestic chores. Nicks reports that their mother, who\u2019d grown up in Wales and married early, didn\u2019t know how to write a check, let alone pay bills or seek alimony. \u201cI had to learn how to do all of this stuff with my mother and also deal with the friction between my parents,\u201d says Manning. \u201cI loved them both, but they were angry at each other. I always felt like I was doing something wrong and I had caused it.\u201d (Manning\u2019s family members have declined interviews since her release.) \n \n From twelve to thirteen, Manning grew up quickly. She realized that she was attracted to boys, and considered herself gay. Her father had introduced Manning to computers and programming at a young age, and Manning began to see the Internet\u2014vast, anonymous, and full of answers\u2014as an escape. \u201cI learned that I wasn\u2019t alone. I learned about all these different life possibilities and options,\u201d she explains. She began to find her first natural identity. \u201cBecause I would actually be anonymous online, I could be more myself.\u201d \n \n The Web also held constant through a series of displacements. In November 2001, when Manning was just shy of fourteen, her mother decided to return to Wales and took Manning with her. (Casey had moved away; their father had remarried.) Her responsibilities increased as her mother\u2019s health declined. In 2005, after a fluky brush with the July 7 London bombings\u2014Manning says she was near King\u2019s Cross station at the moment of the Tube explosions\u2014she moved in with her father, his wife, and his stepson. That arrangement didn\u2019t end well: Mounting tension ended with Manning allegedly brandishing a knife and her stepmother calling 911. Manning lived for a spell with a friend in Tulsa, then drifted to Chicago. In increasingly dire straits, she was taken in by her aunt Debbie, in suburban Maryland. She worked at Starbucks and Abercrombie & Fitch; she explored the LGBTQ scene of greater D.C.; she enrolled, briefly, in community college. At nineteen, she started seeing a psychologist for the first time. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s the part of my life I replay the most: whether or not, living in Maryland and seeing a therapist, I could have finally been able to say, \u2018This is who I am; this is what I want to do.\u2019 It was the first time in my life when I really considered transitioning. But I got scared,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI really regret the fact that I didn\u2019t know or realize I already had the love I needed, especially from my aunt and sister\u2014just to seek support.\u201d \n \n Rather, she made a defiantly different choice. It was the moment of the so-called surge in Iraq. The news on TV was grim. \u201cI don\u2019t know who I am,\u201d she recalls in the park. \u201cMaybe the military will allow me to figure that out.\u201d She looks out toward the river. \u201cIt was a naive thought, but it was very real to me in 2007.\u201d \n \n On the grass behind us, teenage girls are putting together a dance routine: \u201cFive, six, seven, eight!\u201d Not far away, upriver, are the piers where, for years, LGBTQ teens have congregated at the witching hour to vogue under the stars. If Manning had remained in Maryland and been a little braver, she now believes, her 20s could have been quite different. \n \n Instead, she traveled as a new Army enlistee to Fort Leonard Wood, in Missouri; trained as an intelligence analyst at Fort Huachuca, in Arizona; and worked for about a year at Fort Drum, in New York, as an analyst with a top-secret clearance. In October 2009, she was shipped to a base outside Baghdad, where she became Specialist Manning: an anguished 22-year-old in a harsh environment, with access to some of the military\u2019s darkest secrets. \n \n The clock has barely struck midnight at Le Poisson Rouge when Manning\u2019s first night at the ball seems to end. The music stops; fluorescent lights flicker on overhead. There will be a small after-after-party\u2014a loose, laid-back affair\u2014at Julius, a tavern in the Village that is sometimes called the oldest extant gay bar in New York. Strangio has peeled off\u2014he has a family to return to\u2014but Manning decides to continue: The world is new again, and she\u2019s not ready to go home. \n \n About a dozen people walk the half-mile to the tavern. It is 12:45 a.m. and quiet on the streets; sprinklers stutter softly over the Minetta Green. Manning has no I.D. yet, for arcane reasons\u2014she lost her old one with her old life\u2014but the doorman at Julius is expecting her. For weeks after coming to New York, she wandered all around the city, unrecognized. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m living in fear or anything,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to be out and about and walking around.\u201d \n \n Julius\u2019s interior creaks with landmark artifacts: black-and-white photos checkering the walls, posters commemorating the gay-rights Mattachine Society\u2019s 1966 \u201csip-in\u201d at the bar. Manning alights on a bench underneath an American flag whose stripes are replaced with the bars of the pride banner. Conversation foams around her while the jukebox plays. They are deep into drinks; people are sitting on laps. Manning falls into conversation with January Hunt, a writer, musician, and artist who is also a young trans woman. Manning is describing her trip into Brooklyn for a tech \u201cmeet-up\u201d in a derelict building; it struck her, she explains, as \u201cvery New York.\u201d \n \n Manning publicly came out in a written statement, sent to and read aloud on the Today show, in which she asked to be called by female pronouns and expressed interest in hormone therapy. She had thought of making an announcement earlier, she says\u2014she had taken her first outing in women\u2019s dress in February 2010 and had told guards at the detention center where she was first imprisoned that she was a woman\u2014but had been advised that it would complicate the trial. \u201cThe opportunity to do it on the Today show popped up, so it happened a little bit sooner and a little faster than I hoped it would,\u201d she told me. Still, she says, she was taken aback by the response. \u201cI was honestly a bit surprised by the outpouring of love and support that I got,\u201d she says. If there was backlash, too (and there was), she doesn\u2019t seem to have registered it\u2014a tellingly upbeat response from a woman who now sprinkles her tweets with hearts and rainbows. \n \n Prison bureaucracy was another story. Almost immediately after coming to the ACLU in 2013, Strangio\u2014a trans man himself\u2014began work on Manning\u2019s civil case, fighting for her to begin receiving hormone therapy. \u201cOur goal was to get her the health care that she needed,\u201d he explained. \u201cEven when there are legal principles that are pretty unambiguously on our side, there\u2019s so much cultural bias we\u2019re confronting in the courts and in other systems.\u201d Meanwhile, behind bars, Manning sought equilibrium in other ways. \u201cThe first thing I learned to do was avoid television,\u201d she says. She took out subscriptions to \u201c50 or 60\u201d periodicals, she says\u2014news and global-affairs publications, science magazines, technical journals, and, of course, fashion glossies. She describes it to me as \u201clike having a printed version of the Internet.\u201d And she read books: literary classics, fantasy series, contemporary histories. She liked biographies: Queen Isabella, Joan of Arc. She read Cheryl Strayed\u2019s memoir, Wild, three times. Many of Manning\u2019s favorites seemed to emphasize personal strength or bureaucratic disaffection. She read Catch-22, she says, more than once. \u201cI was institutionalized to such a point where my expectations were limited to, I\u2019m going to eat the next meal. I\u2019m going to go to sleep. I\u2019m going to be here the next day,\u201d Manning says. Before commutation, this outlook had psychological costs; as recently as last October, she tried to kill herself for the second time. Then, in January 2017, the White House phoned the office of one of her lawyers. \n \n In his statement announcing the commutation, President Obama emphasized that it was not a pardon for her crime. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Chelsea Manning has served a tough prison sentence,\u201d he said in a press conference. \u201cI feel very comfortable that justice has been served.\u201d \n \n On the day of Manning\u2019s release, things happened quickly. She picked her first outfit for life as a woman: a black-and-white striped blouse, with matching sneakers. She stopped at a roadside pizza joint, got a pepperoni slice, and posted a photo of it to Instagram. (\u201cFreest pizza ever!\u201d she tells me.) She had the lawyers who picked her up drive her to the countryside. \u201cI think I spent, like, five or six hours sitting outside.\u201d \n \n A day after leaving Fort Leavenworth, she posted a new photo (\u201cOK, so here I am everyone!!\u201d) with the coder-inspired hashtag #HelloWorld. She had on a trim black dress by one of her favorite designers, Gabriela Hearst. Her hair was crisply coiffed; she wore a vibrant lip. In a Guardian column, written while in prison, Manning had discussed her nervousness about moving through the world as a woman. Now that she\u2019s no longer worried about being \u201cfound out\u201d by the military, she says, the fear is gone. \u201cIt feels natural. It feels like it\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be, instead of this anxiety, this uncertainty, this ball of self-consciousness that comes with pretending to be male,\u201d she says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right. I didn\u2019t know what it was. I couldn\u2019t describe it. Now that\u2019s gone.\u201d \n \n Poitras, who met Manning for the first time after her release, says she was startled by the young woman\u2019s focus. \u201cThere are people who have really put their lives on the line for something, and they come out on the other side of it. You can feel that with her,\u201d Poitras tells me. \u201cNow that she\u2019s free, what is she going to do with her freedom?\u201d She adds, \u201cWhen I first met Ed Snowden in Hong Kong, he had the same sort of eerie power.\u201d \n \n Twice during our conversations, and in slightly different ways, I ask Manning what she regrets from the period when she was living as Specialist Bradley Manning. Her leaking of state secrets doesn\u2019t appear on the list, although that decision remains the most publicly controversial of her life, earning her accusations of treason and reckless endangerment. \u201cI\u2019ve accepted responsibility for my own decisions and my own actions,\u201d she says. When we speak, Reality Winner, the 25-year-old intelligence contractor, has recently been arrested on suspicion of leaking information about Russian hacking in the 2016 U.S. election, adding to a list of leakers who, like Snowden, have become household names. Manning tells me that she has nothing to say about Winner (\u201cAll I know is what I see in the media reports\u201d) but speaks about what she refers to as \u201cthe larger issue.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s important to remember that when somebody sees government wrongdoing\u2014whether it\u2019s illegal or immoral or unethical\u2014there isn\u2019t the means available to do something about it,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone keeps saying, You should have gone through the proper channels! But the proper channels don\u2019t work.\u201d \n \n Manning describes trying to release information to the press before WikiLeaks. \u201cIn 2010, I was literally scrambling around D.C. trying to get The Washington Post to publish this stuff, and then I went to The New York Times.\u201d Manning has said that a reporter at the Post with whom she spoke briefly over the phone wouldn\u2019t commit to a story, which she took as a sign of uninterest. At the Times, she says, she left a message on the voice mail of the ombudsman, confusingly called the Public Editor. The editor and his assistant later said that they had no memory of such a message, but explained that they received hundreds a week. \u201cI did this all on leave,\u201d Manning says. \u201cI had only twelve days.\u201d The approaching \u201cSnowmageddon\u201d made it harder still. Manning traveled from public phone to public phone, to avoid a traceable line. \u201cI ran out of time,\u201d she says. Before returning to Iraq, she sent files to WikiLeaks. \n \n Even so, Manning continues to take her struggle to find an outlet as proof of a systemic problem. \u201cWe need to have more ways to talk about what\u2019s going on in government,\u201d she says. I ask what those ways might look like. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s right,\u201d she says. \u201cI have certain values. I live by those.\u201d \n \n When it comes to information freedom, those values remain controversial. Many lawmakers bridled at her abbreviated sentence; at the time of the commutation, Paul Ryan said, \u201cChelsea Manning\u2019s treachery put American lives at risk and exposed some of our nation\u2019s most sensitive secrets.\u201d Others argue that her motives, like a public-interest journalist\u2019s, were honorable\u2014or that the actual damage of the leaks was small. Beyond some vocal LGBTQ advocacy (she was a star of the summer\u2019s Pride March in New York, waving from a drop-top Nissan alongside Gavin Grimm), Manning herself has mostly stayed circumspect on issues of politics. Still, in a Guardian column from January 25, a few days following her commutation, she offered a soft criticism of President Obama\u2019s tactical approach: \u201cThe one simple lesson to draw from President Obama\u2019s legacy: Do not start off with a compromise. They won\u2019t meet you in the middle.\u201d President Trump, newly elected, lambasted Manning over Twitter: \u201cUngrateful TRAITOR Chelsea Manning, who should never have been released from prison, is now calling President Obama a weak leader. Terrible!\u201d \n \n Manning has avoided a rejoinder to the president\u2019s tweet. And to the extent that WikiLeaks of 2017 (which seems to have pursued specific electoral outcomes in France and America and is dogged by the troubled reputation of its leader, Julian Assange) has a different public reputation than the 2010 organization (which claimed more categorical anti-secrecy principles), she has avoided opinions there, too. \u201cI\u2019ve been in prison for seven years! I\u2019ve been completely disconnected from all of that,\u201d she tells me. Her plan is to live in New York until late summer, then move to suburban Maryland, not far from where she was before. \n \n By then, she hopes to be acclimated to a new life. For the moment, certain habits of this decade strike her as weird. Our phone fixation, for example. \u201cWe\u2019re sitting in the same room as each other but looking at our phones constantly,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore I was in prison, I was one of the only people on social media. I was a novelty. Now everybody\u2019s on social media all the time!\u201d It\u2019s too much. \u201cI think that\u2019s where a lot of this miscommunication, polarization, friction, and chaos is coming from.\u201d \n \n Thus, though she tweets and Instagrams, Manning has tried to focus on more in-the-moment pursuits. She still loves video games, though she has forsworn the violent ones. Soon after leaving prison, she began teaching herself the programming language Rust. (\u201cIt has a lot of features that weren\u2019t available seven years ago,\u201d she says.) She hopes to begin dating\u2014\u201cI\u2019m not planning to be single!\u201d\u2014but intends to wait until her life settles, in Maryland. \n \n She is also at work on a memoir. \u201cI\u2019m trying to tell the story as if it was happening now and you\u2019re with me,\u201d she explains. Hawkins, the documentarian, says he plans to stop shooting soon, as Manning\u2019s personal narrative finds its own way in the world: \u201cShe\u2019s too young for this film to attempt to be the definitive story of her life.\u201d \n \n Manning does not know what her career will be. While living as Bradley Manning, she expressed an interest in running for political office. I ask whether that\u2019s still on her mind. \u201cI\u2019m certainly not going to say no, and I\u2019m certainly not going to say yes,\u201d she says. \u201cMy goal is to use these next six months to figure out where I want to go. \n \n \u201cI have these values that I can connect with: responsibility, compassion,\u201d she goes on. \u201cThose are really foundational for me. Do and say and be who you are because, no matter what happens, you are loved unconditionally.\u201d It\u2019s the lesson, she says, that she wishes she learned earlier. \u201cUnconditional love,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is OK to be who I am.\u201d \n \n In front of an apartment building in the East Seventies, near Central Park, Manning meets up with Strangio to pay a visit to a hero of New York\u2019s LGBTQ past. It\u2019s 90 degrees, clear, and sticky. Manning arrives late, looking addled and a little faint. She had a subway snafu, she explains, and then a long walk. Strangio takes her shoulders and gives them a shake. \u201cOh, my God\u2014hi!\u201d he says with get-ahold-of-yourself astringency. Inside, they board a tiny elevator that seems as old as the building. \n \n \u201cEverybody in!\u201d Strangio says merrily as it begins groaning upward. \u201cWe\u2019ll just get stuck in here a few days.\u201d \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve got a flashlight,\u201d Manning deadpans. \n \n At a time when drag queens were widely shunned, Jack Doroshow, better known as Flawless Sabrina, blazed a trail across Philadelphia and New York with her high-profile drag pageants, forcing the cities to acknowledge and accept their androgyne and transgender communities. Bobby Kennedy helped her book a venue. Andy Warhol helped secure funding for a film on the pageants, The Queen (1968), which went to Cannes. Flawless posed for Diane Arbus, acted for John Waters, and dated William S. Burroughs. Along the way, she was arrested several times and came to be known as a \u201cmother\u201d figure in the queer community. Now in her late 70s, she suffers from various age-related ailments. There are good days and bad days, but today is good. \n \n The long wall of Flawless\u2019s sitting room is mirrored, floor to ceiling. A desk near the window supports pineapple-esque lamps and on the far wall is a framed canvas that looks like\u2014is assumed to be\u2014a late-period Picasso. Scattered through the room are heads: mannequin heads, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 heads, other heads, one sporting a costume-ball mask and feather headpiece, another wearing a wig and sunglasses, a third stabbed at the scalp with hypodermic syringes. \n \n Just then, Flawless enters the room. \u201cGorgeous!\u201d she says, looking at Manning. \u201cGirl, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d \n \n She is sitting in a wheelchair pushed by Curtis Carman, an artist who is Flawless\u2019s partner. She looks old, alert, and not unlike Picasso herself: bald, with a striped shirt and a big, knitted navy cardigan. Carman helps her climb into a thronelike chair behind the desk. \u201cNow, how\u2019s your family?\u201d she asks Manning. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re all right,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re laying low a little bit.\u201d She hasn\u2019t seen her mother yet, Manning explains. She lives in the care of her family and cannot travel. \n \n \u201cBut you\u2019ll do that,\u201d Flawless says. It\u2019s not a question. \u201cYou\u2019re young, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \n \n \u201cTwenty-nine. I hope that\u2019s young.\u201d \n \n \u201cYou bet.\u201d Flawless allows herself a smile. \u201cI mean, as I look at it, everybody\u2019s pretty new.\u201d \n \n Flawless brings her palms together. \u201cAll I see is a very natural, very beautiful little girl,\u201d she says. \u201cThe only jarring thing is that there\u2019s so much power. This is somebody who has changed history.\u201d \n \n Manning thanks her and keeps talking\u2014about her move to Maryland, and then about her writing. Flawless starts shaking her head. \u201cI can\u2019t get over how beautiful you are,\u201d she says. \n \n Through the next half-hour, they discuss the military, the Tonys, the past. Before Manning leaves, Flawless is keen to pass on some wisdom. \u201cThink about your story,\u201d she says. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m not done yet!\u201d Manning protests. \n \n \u201cNo,\u201d Flawless says slowly. \n \n Strangio says they should let Flawless rest. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to change the world,\u201d Flawless chirps. She draws Strangio close. \u201cI am so proud of you,\u201d she says, and gives him a tight hug. \n \n Manning comes next. Flawless wraps her aged arms around her small frame. \u201cThank you so much,\u201d she whispers, so softly that Manning may not hear. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d When Manning stands, she moves briskly toward the door. Flawless\u2019s eyes are wet with tears. \n \n In this story: Fashion Editor: Phyllis Posnick. Hair: Jimmy Paul for Bumble and Bumble; Makeup: Alice Lane.

Given the magnitude of his crimes, I dare say that he\u2019d be in prison today if he still identified as a man. Then he\u2019d be nothing but what he actually is, a garden-variety traitor \u2014 a faithless soldier who should count himself fortunate not to face capital punishment. \n \n It\u2019s worth remembering what he did. He disclosed, in a gigantic document dump, more than a million pages of classified information, including information about American military operations, American diplomacy, and American allies. The Obama administration was forced to rush to safety foreign friends whom Manning had outed as helping Americans. He broke faith with every relevant provision of the Army\u2019s warrior ethos \u2014 he abandoned his mission, he actively aided the enemy, and he acted with stunning disregard for the lives of his comrades. He did so because, acting on his own authority, he decided he wanted to stimulate \u201cworldwide discussion, debate, and reforms.\u201d \n \n To be clear, this wasn\u2019t whistleblowing. He didn\u2019t identify a specific wrong and expose it responsibly while taking care to minimize the harm of disclosure. He just disclosed documents without regard for their contents. He didn\u2019t know if anyone would die because of his actions. He didn\u2019t know to what extent vital missions or programs would be compromised. He just did what he wanted to do. There was no honor in his action. None. \n \n And now look at him.

Disturbingly, that celebration leaks even into organizations that are billed as \u201cmeanstream.\u201d Recall, it was just last month the Women\u2019s March tweeted its appreciation for convicted cop-killer and FBI most-wanted terrorist Assata Shakur: \n \n Earlier this summer, New York\u2019s Puerto Rican Day Parade sought to honor convicted terrorist Oscar Lopez Rivera as a \u201cNational Freedom Hero.\u201d Under pressure, he decided to \u201cforgo\u201d that honor, but he was featured in a float anyway \u2014 and parts of the crowd gave him a \u201chero\u2019s welcome.\u201d \n \n This is what radical identity politics does. \n \n These kinds of celebrations are not just morally abhorrent; they\u2019re deeply polarizing. They represent the idea that the rule of law \u2014 even when the subject is murder or treason \u2014 is contingent upon the politics and racial or gender identity of the lawbreaker. Americans on opposing sides of the ideological divide are given a signal \u2014 that when it comes to advancing the radical cause, not even human life or national security can stand in the way. There are no lines that can\u2019t be crossed. \n \n This is what radical identity politics does. It twists and distorts normal moral analysis. It declares that the ends justify the means, and then goes even farther to say, \u201cBy any means necessary.\u201d This is an unacceptable ethic not just for a constitutional republic but for any form of civil society.

Elias, a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, retained Fusion GPS, a Washington firm, to conduct the research. \n \n After that, Fusion GPS hired dossier author Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer with ties to the FBI and the U.S. intelligence community, according to those people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \n \n Elias and his law firm, Perkins Coie, retained the company in April 2016 on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the DNC. Before that agreement, Fusion GPS's research into Trump was funded by an unknown Republican client during the GOP primary. \n \n The Clinton campaign and the DNC, through the law firm, continued to fund Fusion GPS's research through the end of October 2016, days before Election Day. \n \n Fusion GPS gave Steele's reports and other research documents to Elias, the people familiar with the matter said. It is unclear how or how much of that information was shared with the campaign and the DNC and who in those organizations was aware of the roles of Fusion GPS and Steele.

Some congressional Republican leaders have spent months trying to discredit Fusion GPS and Steele and tried to determine the identity of the Democrat or organization that paid for the dossier. \n \n Trump tweeted as recently as Saturday that the Justice Department and FBI should \"immediately release who paid for it.\" \n \n Elias and Fusion GPS declined to comment on the arrangement. \n \n A DNC spokeswoman said \"[Chairman] Tom Perez and the new leadership of the DNC were not involved in any decision-making regarding Fusion GPS, nor were they aware that Perkins Coie was working with the organization. But let's be clear, there is a serious federal investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, and the American public deserves to know what happened.\" \n \n Brian Fallon, a former spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said he wasn't aware of the hiring during the campaign. \n \n \n \n Marc E. Elias of Perkins Coie represented the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) \n \n \"The first I learned of Christopher Steele or saw any dossier was after the election,\" Fallon said. \"But if I had gotten handed it last fall, I would have had no problem passing it along and urging reporters to look into it. Opposition research happens on every campaign, and here you had probably the most shadowy guy ever running for president, and the FBI certainly has seen fit to look into it. I probably would have volunteered to go to Europe myself to try and verify if it would have helped get more of this out there before the election.\" \n \n Some of the details are included in a Tuesday letter sent by Perkins Coie to a lawyer representing Fusion GPS, telling the research firm that it was released from a \u00adclient-confidentiality obligation. The letter was prompted by a legal fight over a subpoena for Fusion GPS's bank records. \n \n People involved in the matter said that they would not disclose the dollar amounts paid to Fusion GPS but that the campaign and the DNC shared the cost. \n \n Steele previously worked in Russia for British intelligence. The dossier is a compilation of reports he prepared for Fusion GPS. The dossier alleged that the Russian government collected compromising information about Trump and that the Kremlin was engaged in an effort to assist his campaign for president. \n \n U.S. intelligence agencies later released a public assessment asserting that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to aid Trump. The FBI has been investigating whether Trump associates helped the Russians in that effort. \n \n [FBI once planned to pay former British spy who authored controversial Trump dossier] \n \n Trump has adamantly denied the allegations in the dossier and has dismissed the FBI probe as a witch hunt. \n \n Officials have said that the FBI has confirmed some of the information in the dossier. Other details, including the most sensational accusations, have not been verified and may never be. \n \n Fusion GPS's work researching Trump began during the Republican presidential primaries, when the GOP donor paid for the firm to investigate the real estate magnate's background. \n \n Fusion GPS did not start off looking at Trump's Russia ties but quickly realized that those relationships were extensive, according to the people familiar with the matter. \n \n When the Republican donor stopped paying for the research, Elias, acting on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the DNC, agreed to pay for the work to continue. The Democrats paid for research, including by Fusion GPS, because of concerns that little was known about Trump and his business interests, according to the people familiar with the matter. \n \n Those people said that it is standard practice for political campaigns to use law firms to hire outside researchers to ensure their work is protected by attorney-client and work-product privileges. \n \n The Clinton campaign paid Perkins Coie $5.6 million in legal fees from June 2015 to December 2016, according to campaign finance records, and the DNC paid the firm $3.6 million in \"legal and compliance consulting'' since November 2015 \u2014 though it's impossible to tell from the filings how much of that work was for other legal matters and how much of it related to Fusion GPS. \n \n At no point, the people said, did the Clinton campaign or the DNC direct Steele's activities. They described him as a Fusion GPS subcontractor. \n \n Some of Steele's allegations began circulating in Washington in the summer of 2016 as the FBI launched its counterintelligence investigation into possible connections between Trump associates and the Kremlin. Around that time, Steele shared some of his findings with the FBI. \n \n After the election, the FBI agreed to pay Steele to continue gathering intelligence about Trump and Russia, but the bureau pulled out of the arrangement after Steele was publicly identified in news reports. \n \n The dossier was published by BuzzFeed News in January. Fusion GPS has said in court filings that it did not give BuzzFeed the documents. \n \n Current and former U.S. intelligence officials said that Steele was respected by the FBI and the State Department for earlier work he performed on a global corruption probe. \n \n In early January, then-FBI Director James B. Comey presented a two-page summary of Steele's dossier to President Barack Obama and President-elect Trump. In May, Trump fired Comey, which led to the appointment of Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel investigating the Trump-Russia matter. \n \n Congressional Republicans have tried to force Fusion GPS to identify the Democrat or group behind Steele's work, but the firm has said that it will not do so, citing confidentiality agreements with its clients. \n \n Last week, Fusion GPS executives invoked their constitutional right not to answer questions from the House Intelligence Committee. The firm's founder, Glenn Simpson, had previously given a 10-hour interview to the Senate Judiciary Committee. \n \n Over objections from Democrats, the Republican leader of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), subpoenaed Fusion GPS's bank records to try to identify the mystery client. \n \n Fusion GPS has been fighting the release of its bank records. A judge on Tuesday extended a deadline for Fusion GPS's bank to respond to the subpoena until Friday while the company attempts to negotiate a resolution with Nunes. \n \n Julie Tate contributed to this report. \n \n Read more: \n \n What the Trump dossier says \u2014 and what it doesn\u2019t \n \n Hillary Clinton\u2019s disingenuous dossier outrage \n \n Trump suggests FBI may have \u2018paid for\u2019 dossier alleging Russia ties", "FILE - In this March 21, 2016, file photo, attorney Marc Elias, one of several lawyers who appeared in the in the case of Wittman v.

Personhuballah, stands on the plaza of the Supreme Court in Washington.... (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee helped fund political research into President Donald Trump that ultimately produced a dossier of allegations about his ties to Russia, a person familiar with the matter said Tuesday night. \n \n The revelation is likely to fuel complaints by Trump that the dossier, which the president has derided as \"phony stuff,\" is a politically motivated collection of salacious claims. Yet the FBI has worked to corroborate the document, and in a sign of its ongoing relevance to investigators, special counsel Robert Mueller's team \u2014 which is probing potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign \u2014 weeks ago questioned the former British spy, Christopher Steele, who helped compile the claims in the dossier. \n \n The dossier, which circulated in Washington last year and was turned over to the FBI for its review, contends that Russia was engaged in a longstanding effort to aid Trump and had amassed compromising information about him. Trump has repeatedly dismissed the document as false and in recent days has questioned on Twitter whether Democrats or the FBI had helped fund it. \n \n Trump has also attacked the findings of the FBI, NSA and CIA that Russia waged a large-scale influence campaign to interfere in the election. The FBI and the CIA have said with high confidence that the effort was aimed at hurting Clinton's candidacy and helping Trump. The NSA found the same with \"moderate\" confidence. \n \n The person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential client matters, said the arrangement was brokered by Marc Elias, a lawyer for the campaign and the DNC, and his law firm of Perkins Coie. \n \n The deal began in the spring of 2016, when the firm was approached by Fusion GPS, the political research firm behind the dossier, and lasted until right before Election Day, according to the person. When Fusion approached Elias, it had already been doing research work on Trump for a client during the GOP primary. The identity of the original client has not been revealed. \n \n It's unclear what Fusion GPS had dug up by the time law firm hired them in April 2016. According to a copy of the dossier published by BuzzFeed this year, the earliest report from Steele dates to June 2016, two months later. It was not immediately known how much money Fusion received or how many others in the Clinton campaign or DNC were aware that the firm had been retained. \n \n Elias did not immediately return an email seeking comment, and representatives of Fusion GPS declined to comment. The Washington Post first reported the arrangement. \n \n Clinton campaign officials did not immediately comment, but in a statement, a DNC spokeswoman said chairman Tom Perez was not part of the decision-making and was unaware that Perkins Coie was working with Fusion GPS. \n \n \"But let's be clear, there is a serious federal investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, and the American public deserves to know what happened,\" the statement said. \n \n Former Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said on Twitter that he regretted not knowing about Steele's hiring before the election, and that had he known, \"I would have volunteered to go to Europe and try to help him.\" \n \n \"I have no idea what Fusion or Steele were paid,\" he wrote in another tweet, \"but if even a shred of that dossier ends up helping Mueller, it will prove money well spent.\" \n \n According to a letter obtained by the AP Tuesday night, representatives of Fusion GPS reached out to the firm in early March 2016 to express interest in continuing research on Trump it had begun \"for one or more other clients during the Republican primary contest.\" \n \n At that time, the Clinton campaign was looking toward the general election and was pivoting attention to Trump, the emerging Republican front-runner. The person said Trump, by virtue of his extensive international business dealings, was seen as a natural target for complicated opposition research abroad. \n \n Perkins Coie then engaged Fusion GPS in April 2016 \"to perform a variety of research services during the 2016 election cycle,\" according to the letter. \n \n The dossier created a political firestorm in January when it was revealed that then-FBI Director James Comey had alerted Trump to the existence of allegations about him and Russia. Since then, Trump has repeatedly attacked the document and Republicans in Congress have worked to discredit it, even issuing a subpoena that seeks to force the disclosure of Fusion GPS's bank records. \n \n The letter, sent Tuesday by the general counsel of Perkins Coie to a lawyer for Fusion GPS, was intended to release the research firm from its obligation to keep confidential the identity of the law firm client. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Chad Day and Ken Thomas contributed to this report. \n \n ___ \n \n Read the letter: http://apne.ws/UK0Ojir"], "summary": "\u2013 Funding for research included in the explosive dossier on President Trump's Russia connections came from none other than the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, per reports in the Washington Post and the New York Times. A letter filed in court Tuesday details how research firm Fusion GPS began working in April 2016 for a law firm employed by the Clinton campaign and the DNC to gather damaging information on Trump. According to the letter, Fusion GPS had already been doing research on Trump on behalf of one of the Republican's primary opponents before it was hired by Perkins Coie, the firm of Clinton campaign lawyer Mark Elias. Trump has long slammed the dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele as politically motivated \"fake news.\" In a tweet last week, Trump wondered whether the FBI, the Democrats, Russia, or all three had funded it. He's now expected to repeat conspiracy allegations, though sources tell the Post and the Times that Clinton and DNC officials were unaware of the role of Fusion GPS. The AP reports the FBI has corroborated parts of the dossier, which alleges Russia worked to help the Trump campaign and amassed compromising information on him. Former Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted that if he'd known about Steele's role, he would \"have volunteered to go to Europe and try to help him.\" He added that if the information compiled by Steele helps Robert Mueller's investigation, anything paid to him and Fusion GPS would be \"money well spent.\"", "ranking": [3, 2, 4, 1, 0]}

It turns out that a curious two-spotted octopus had disassembled a water recycling valve and directed a tube to spew out of the tank for about 10 hours, according to the Los Angeles Times. \n \n \n \n \"It found something loose and just pulled on it,\" the aquarium's education manager Tara Treiber told the Times. \"They are very smart creatures.\" \n \n \n \n Octopuses, some 300 species of which inhabit tropical waters around the world, can change colors, squirt out poison, and exert a force greater than their own body weight. But calling the eight-armed cousin of your garden snail \"smart\" seems a bit of a stretch. In fact, the animals are part of an elite group of slimy mollusks known as cephalopods that range from giant squid to the shelled nautilus and all have remarkably large \"brains\"\u2014at least for creatures sans backbones. \n \n Scientists have found that octopuses can navigate their way through mazes, solve problems quickly and remember those solutions, at least for the short term. \n \n \n \n To find out more about octopus intelligence, we spoke to Jennifer Mather, a comparative psychologist at the University of Lethbridge in Alberta, Canada. Mather has been studying octopuses for 35 years in an effort to gain insight into the evolution of intelligence. While most scientists hold octopuses in high regard, it's worth noting that not everyone shares Mather's lofty assessment of their intellectual abilities and personalities. \n \n \n \n [An edited transcript of the interview follows.] \n \n \n \n Are octopuses smart? \n \n Yes, but of course one has to ask what that means. I would say intelligence means learning information and using the information that you've learned. \n \n \n \n So, how do you know they are smart? \n \n We observed how octopuses figure out how to open clams and what sort of flexibility and variety they have. We give them clams and mussels in order to figure out which they like best. They are very strong, but we found they prefer mussels because mussels are easier to open. They switched to clams when we put the clams on a half shell. They clearly made a decision to go with what was easiest. We noticed along the way that yanking them open wasn't the only thing the octopuses could do to open them. They have a cartilaginous beak, which looks a lot like a parrot's beak, and they could chip at the edge of the clamshell and then they could inject poison and weaken the clam. Or they actually have a salivary papilla, and they can drill a hole to inject the toxin that way in the stronger clams. They were selective about what technique they would use with what species. We decided we would cheat on them: We took one of the easier ones and wired them shut. They switched techniques according to what would work best. Of course, this doesn't sound hard to you because you're a human, but most simple animals keep trying the same technique. \n \n \n \n What other indications are there that octopuses are intelligent? \n \n Octopuses play, and play is something that intelligent animals do. At the Seattle Aquarium, my colleague Roland Anderson and I figured out a situation in which they might play: a boring situation. We gave them an empty tank and a floating pill bottle and waited to see what would happen. Nothing happened the first time, but, after the fourth time, a couple animals did something we call \"play.\" The octopus blew a jet of water at the pill bottle and that caused it to go over a water jet in the tank and come back to the octopus. These two individual animals did it in a sequence over 20 times. That's just exactly the kind of thing we do when we bounce a ball. When you bounce a ball, you are not trying to get rid of the ball, you are trying to figure out what you can do with the ball. \n \n \n \n Octopuses also have personalities. We used the same kind of setup people use when they want to study human personalities. You just ask what do the animals commonly encounter during the day in different situations and look at the variability. We put them in three common situations: alerting (opening the top of the tank), threatening (touching the octopus with a test tube brush) and feeding (the octopus was given a crab to munch). This takes awhile because we tested 33 animals, each for two weeks. We found there are three dimensions and we settled for names: activity, reactivity and avoidance. Avoidance is how shy you are. Activity is if you are very active or passive. And reactivity indicates whether you are very emotional or more blas\u00e9. Octopuses can have any mix of those traits. We didn't take it any further, but there's a former graduate student in Australia looking at the extent to which personality affects ecology. \n \n \n \n Do octopuses have brains? \n \n The molluscan nervous system has a bunch of paired ganglia (a cluster of nerve cells), which in an animal like a clam or a snail are not very big and are widely distributed through the body. They control different functions and are located in different areas. Well, the cephalopods\u2014that's the octopuses, squids and cuttlefish\u2014they are unique in that all these ganglias have condensed so they form a centralized brain. The other thing that is unique amongst the mollusks is there are two areas of this brain that have developed that are specialized for memory storage. It's not just that the brain is larger and condensed, but they have areas of the brain dedicated to learning. That's the kind of thing we humans have, but it\u2019s a completely different brain. \n \n \n \n By invertebrate standards it\u2019s a huge brain, but by vertebrate standards, it\u2019s a small brain. What's interesting about the octopus is about one third of the neurons (nerve cells) are in the brain. They have a huge neural representation in the arms, and there's a ganglion controlling every sucker, so there's quite a bit of local control. As humans, we're very proud of having a pincer grasp\u2014the thumb and forefinger\u2014and we say that's responsible for our ability to manipulate the environment so well. The octopus can fold the two sides of its sucker together to form a pincer grasp and it can do that with every single one. It has a hundred pincer grasps. \n \n \n \n Why do you think octopuses evolved such big brains? \n \n Probably because the tropical coral reef is the most complex environment in the world. There's such a huge variety of situations, lots of kinds of prey, lots of predators, and if you are not armored, you'd better be smart. The octopus has gone the smart route. Also, we talk about mammalian intelligence evolving in social situations, but clearly the octopus, a solitary organism, has evolved intelligence to solve ecological problems. \n \n \n \n Do octopuses often cause trouble in aquariums? \n \n They are very strong, and it is practically impossible to keep an octopus in a tank unless you are very lucky. One of the early researchers said if you leave a floating thermometer in a tank, it will last about five minutes. Octopuses simply take things apart. I recall reading about someone who had built a robot submarine to putter around in a large aquarium tank. The octopus got a hold of it and took it apart piece by piece. There's a famous story from the Brighton Aquarium in England 100 years ago that an octopus there got out of its tank at night when no one was watching, went to the tank next door and ate one of the lumpfish and went back to his own tank and was sitting there the next morning. The aquarium lost several lumpfish before they figured out who was responsible."], "summary": "\u2013 A California fish-market owner bought an octopus and set it free because he feels a certain affinity with cephalopods, the San Francisco Chronicle reports.

The bottle was claimed to be the last unopened bottle of the 1878 vintage malt in the world. \n \n Shortly afterwards, however, an investigation was launched after a number of whisky enthusiasts raised concerns about the authenticity of the bottle. Macallan owner Edrington has also promised to help with the inquiry. \n \n \"On Thursday I got some information from a whisky expert that this bottle could be a fake,\" said hotel manager Sandro Bernasconi said. \"I've done some research and talked to different people. [Then] I called the Chinese guest to tell him that it could be a fake and said we would give the money back [if it is]. It's very important to us to find out if it's a real bottle or if it's a fake.\" \n \n \n \n The label on the bottle claims that the whisky was distilled in 1878, and was matured for 27 years. A \"rare Speyside malt\u2019\", it claims to be \"guaranteed absolutely pure by Roderick Kemp, proprietor, Macallan and Talisker Distilleries Ltd\". \n \n Serge Valentin, experienced collector and founder of the Whiskyfun website, raised a number of issues related to the bottle, including the condition of the cork and label paper, which he said was \"too new\", and the accuracy of some details on the label. \n \n \"This is the same kind of bottle that Macallan had bought themselves around 2002 \u2013 around 100 of them,\" he said. \"What's dodgy with these bottles is that, apparently, Kemp never owned Macallan and Talisker at the same time, and that nobody ever found traces of a company called 'Macallan and Talisker Distilleries Ltd', not even Diageo in their archives.\" \n \n Emmanuel Dron, owner of The Auld Alliance bar in Singapore, said that the St Moritz bottle had come from the same source \u2013 believed to be in Italy \u2013 as a rash of fake Macallans of the early 2000s. \n \n \"Most of them are kept and never opened,\" he added. \"All the fakes have those corks that are artificially aged to make them look old, but they don't have what all the real ones have, a natural maturation of the cork that makes them shrink after decades.

For us it would be very bad, but if it's a fake we have to tell everybody in the world that it's a fake, and of course we have to give the money back.\" \n \n The whisky was now on its way to a testing laboratory in Scotland. He said it had initially been estimated that the testing process would take up to six months, but it was now hoped that it could be done more quickly.

After the news got out, however, whisky experts from around the world said the bottle was almost certainly fake. \n \n On July 29, a tourist convinced Sandro Bernasconi, proprietor of the Devil\u2019s Place Whiskey Bar, to open the bar\u2019s prize possession: An ultra-rare bottle of Macallan whisky from 1878. The bottle was from Bernasconi\u2019s father\u2019s collection, and the bar never intended to actually open it. When the customer was serious about tasting it, however, Bernasconi was convinced. \n \n Bernasconi said at the time that he was petrified when opening it, because he thought the cork would have fallen apart or the whisky would be bad. The bottle opened nicely, though, and the customer was happy with the .67-ounce beverage he paid $10,000 for. \n \n According to Shanghaiist, the customer was fantasy novelist Zhang Wei, China\u2019s richest and most prolific online writer. He\u2019s written more than 150 novels in 12 years, and according to the New York Times he made $16.8 million in 2015. So that\u2019s how he can afford to spend $10,000 for a single whisky. \n \n \u201cI was in Switzerland and saw a 100-year-old whisky. I didn\u2019t spend long weighing up whether to get it,\u201d Zhang posted on social media after the experience. \u201cIn a nutshell, it tasted good. I was drinking not so much the whisky but a lot of history.\u201d \n \n After the news of the open bottle and the $10,000 Macallan came out, however, a number of whisky experts contacted Bernasconi to say the bottle was probably fake. \n \n According to Wine Searcher, the label on the bottle claims that the whisky was distilled in 1878, and was matured for 27 years. The label also says the whisky is \"guaranteed absolutely pure by Roderick Kemp, proprietor, Macallan and Talisker Distilleries Ltd.\" \n \n The thing is, though, that Roderick Kemp never owned Macallan and Talisker at the same time, and there\u2019s no record of a \u201cMacallan and Talisker Distilleries Ltc.\u201d ever existing. \n \n The bottle most likely came from a store of fake Macallans that came out of Italy in the early 2000s. They\u2019re very convincing fakes, though. Back in 2002, Macallan itself bought 100 bottles that were later proved to be fake. Bernasconi\u2019s is likely from the same batch of fakes. \n \n Bernasconi says he contacted Zhang to tell him about the possibility that the whisky was fake. He says he\u2019s having the bottle tested by experts in Scotland, who will analyze the whisky, the glass bottle, the label, the glue, and the cork. If they confirm it is fake, he says he will refund Zhang\u2019s $10,000. \n \n If he gets his money back, Zhang should consider checking out these 16 bottles of liquor that cost more than a diamond."], "summary": "\u2013 To say that it was an indulgent purchase would be an understatement: A Chinese millionaire paid a record $10,050 for a shot of 1878 Macallan single malt scotch in July\u2014except it turns out the alcohol was all of 40 years old. Eyebrows were raised about the veracity of Zhang Wei's purchase after photos were posted online of Zhang posing with the bottle and the manager of the Waldhaus Am See hotel; the Swiss hotel's Devil's Place whisky bar has a 2,500-bottle collection. The prime condition of the vintage bottle, and the wording on the label didn't add up, said doubters. They were right. The BBC reports a series of lab tests were performed and returned all-around negative results. University of Oxford researchers carbon dated the sample and say there's a 95% probability it was produced between 1970 and 1972. And it's not even a single malt, as testing by alcohol analysts Tatlock and Thomson found it was a blend of 60% malt and 40% grain. Manager Sandro Bernasconi tells the Scotsman, \"The result has been a big shock to the system, and we are delighted to have repaid our customer in full as a gesture of goodwill.\" The repayment was done in what's likely the most expensive way possible: SwissInfo.ch reports Bernasconi flew to Beijing to apologize and reimburse Zhang. The Daily Meal suspects the bottle is one of a batch of fakes that were so convincing Macallan actually purchased 100 such bottles in 2002. As for the story behind the man who felt comfortable paying so much for a nip of Scotch, he's a 36-year-old writer of online fantasy novels who reportedly made $16.8 million in 2015.

You can find it online.\u201d \n \n Conway\u2019s remark appears to violate the executive branch\u2019s ban on staff endorsing products or companies. The regulation, from the Office of Government Ethics, also prohibits using public office for private gain of oneself or friends or relatives. \n \n Under the regulation, OGE\u2019s director can notify the employee of the violation and ask the agency to investigate. The director can recommend discipline, including suspension, loss of pay or termination, but would probably just issue a warning for a first offense. \n \n Conway said Thursday night on Fox News that she had spoken with the president about the controversy and said it was a \u201cvery heartening moment.\u201d \n \n \u201cI am just really happy that I spent an awful lot of time of the president of the United States this afternoon and that he supports me 100 percent,\u201d she said. \n \n At his daily briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Conway had \"been counseled on that subject, and that's it,\" declining to further elaborate on whether the White House believed the counselor to the president had crossed a line. \n \n But lawmakers suggested that it did. Reps. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman and ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, respectively, wrote in a letter to OGE Director Walter Shaub that Conway\u2019s interview \u201craised extremely serious concerns.\u201d \n \n \u201cAs the director of OGE, you have authority to review potential ethics violations and notify the employee\u2019s agency, which in this case is the White House,\u201d they said. \u201cIn this case, there is an additional challenge, which is that the President, as the ultimate disciplinary authority for White House employees, has an inherent conflict of interest since Conway\u2019s statements relate to his daughter\u2019s private business.\u201d \n \n They asked that OGE \u201creview Conway\u2019s statement and act promptly on the basis of your findings,\u201d as well as report back to the House panel with a recommendation for disciplinary action, if necessary. \n \n Cummings earlier Thursday had said in a letter to Chaffetz, \u201cThis appears to be a textbook violation of government ethics laws and regulations enacted to prevent the abuse of an employee\u2019s government position,\u201d and asked for a committee \u201creview and potential disciplinary action.\u201d \n \n Chaffetz seemed to agree, telling The Associated Press that Conway\u2019s remark was \u201cwrong, wrong, wrong, clearly over the line, unacceptable.\u201d \n \n \"It needs to be dealt with,\" Chaffetz had said. \"There's no ifs, ands or buts about it.\" \n \n A host of liberal, progressive and nonpartisan advocacy groups filed complaints against Conway, including the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which filed its complaint with both OGE and the White House Counsel\u2019s Office. \n \n \u201cMs. Conway appears to have violated both the letter and the spirit of these rules when she used her position to endorse the accessories and clothing line of Ms. Trump, the daughter of the president,\u201d the CREW complaint says. \u201cFurthermore, we are concerned about what appears to be a pattern developing of the use of official offices, particularly the White House and the Executive Office of the President, to benefit business interests of relatives and supporters of the president; Ms. Conway\u2019s comments appear to be just the latest example of this trend.\u201d \n \n Ordinarily, a violation in the White House would be dealt with by the White House counsel. But it\u2019s not clear how the regulation will be enforced under a president who, based on his own statement Wednesday, seems likely to approve of what Conway said. (The president himself is technically exempt from the regulation, but White House policy has long applied it to him.) \n \n Likely sparked by Conway's remark, web traffic to the OGE's website surged Thursday to the point that it became inaccessible for much of the day. On Twitter, the office wrote that \"OGE\u2019s website, phone system and email system are receiving an extraordinary volume of contacts from citizens about recent events.\u201d The office later added that it \"does not have investigative or enforcement authority.\u201d \n \n An OGE spokesman said the agency was \"looking at ways to redirect traffic and add capacity\" to make its website accessible again. \n \n Citing declining sales for Ivanka Trump\u2019s label, Nordstrom announced earlier this month that it would no longer carry her line, a move that sparked anger from Donald Trump, who tweeted Wednesday that his daughter had \u201cbeen treated so unfairly\u201d by the department store. \n \n Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, have been highly visible members of the administration since Donald Trump took office just under three weeks ago. The president\u2019s daughter accompanied him to Dover Air Force Base last week for the return of the remains of a Navy SEAL killed during a raid in Yemen and has advised him on policy issues, including the environment and parental leave. \n \n Conway told Fox News she found it \u201cironic that you\u2019ve got some executives all over the internet bragging about what they\u2019ve done to [Ivanka] and her line.\u201d \n \n \u201cYet, they\u2019re using the most prominent woman in Donald Trump\u2019s \u2014 you know, most prominent \u2014 she\u2019s his daughter, and they\u2019re using her, who has been a champion for women empowerment, women in the workplace, to get to him,\u201d she continued. \u201cI think people could see through that. Go buy Ivanka's stuff is what I would tell you. I hate shopping. I\u2019m going to go get some myself today.\u201d \n \n While Nordstrom claimed that the decision to drop Ivanka Trump\u2019s line of clothing and shoes was based solely on business, at least some of the decline in sales of her products could be attributed to the #GrabYourWallet campaign urging consumers to boycott Trump products. \n \n Nordstrom also hasn\u2019t shied away from voicing opposition to Trump\u2019s policies, releasing a statement in support of immigrants in the wake of the president\u2019s executive order temporarily banning individuals from certain Muslim-majority nations from entering the U.S. in the name of national security. The retailer announced its decision to drop Ivanka Trump\u2019s line three days after releasing that statement. \n \n On Fox News, Conway called Ivanka Trump a \u201cvery successful businesswoman\u201d and an \u201cincredibly confident, creative, talented woman\u201d and indicated that should be welcomed into a role at the White House to work on women's empowerment issues, if she so chooses. \n \n \u201cObviously, she\u2019s stepped away from it now, but in the past she\u2019s helped to run her family\u2019s real estate empire, and on the side she developed another fully, unbelievably, entrepreneurial, wildly successful business that bears her name,\u201d Conway added. \u201cAnd I think she\u2019s gone from 800 stores to 1,000 stores or 1,000 places where you can buy \u2014 you can certainly buy her goods online. She\u2019s just at a very good place.\u201d \n \n Kyle Cheney contributed to this report.", "Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

The White House reaction was a rare acknowledgment of an ethical misstep. \n \n Conway\u2019s remarks drew a sharp and unusual rebuke from a top Republican lawmaker, House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who said that Conway\u2019s comments were \u201cabsolutely wrong, wrong, wrong\u201d and \u201cclearly over the line.\u201d \n \n Chaffetz, who has resisted calls by Democrats to investigate potential conflicts related to President Trump\u2019s businesses, joined with the Oversight Committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, Rep.

The tensions underscore the difficulty Trump faces in carrying through on his vow to separate his presidency from his businesses \u2014 particularly given that he and his daughter have refused to divest their ownership stakes. \n \n The president has faced criticism from ethics experts and Democratic lawmakers who have warned that his public power could be misused to enrich him and his family. Trump has turned over the management of his businesses to his two adult sons and a longtime executive. \n \n Although Trump has said that most ethics laws and rules do not apply to the president, Conway\u2019s stumble Thursday served as a reminder that staffers are nonetheless subject to those provisions. \n \n The Conway episode followed other instances in which Trump\u2019s political rise and his presidency have provided a promotional platform for the family businesses. \n \n 1 of 10 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Controversial comments from Kellyanne Conway that made headlines View Photos Conway, counselor to President Trump, coined the term \u201calternative facts\u201d and referred to a \u201cBowling Green massacre\u201d that never happened.

The lawsuit said that the August 2016 article, which falsely suggested that Melania Trump had once worked for an escort service, damaged her ability to build \u201cmultimillion dollar business relationships for a multi-year term\u201d and damaged her brand during a time when Trump \u201cis one of the most photographed women in the world.\u201d \n \n A day later, after ethics experts criticized the notion of Melania Trump attempting to make money from her public role, her attorney and a spokeswoman issued statements saying that the first lady \u201chas no intention\u201d of using her position for profit. \n \n The first family has struggled to cleanse its public appearances of private entanglements. \n \n In his official biography on the White House website, Donald Trump boasts of the success of the business he still owns and cites his book \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d which remains for sale. \n \n Melania Trump\u2019s initial online biography referenced her jewelry line, once sold on the cable television channel QVC, and noted its trademark, a registration now overseen by a federal office led by her husband. \n \n Ivanka Trump, whose brand includes dresses, shoes, skirts, handbags, jewelry and accessories, much of which is sold online and at dozens of the United States\u2019 largest retailers and department-store chains, mixed her business and newly elevated political profile shortly after the election. \n \n Hours after she was interviewed by CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d about her father\u2019s victory, her jewelry line alerted journalists to the fact that she was wearing an \u00adIvanka-brand diamond bracelet, which viewers could buy for $10,800. \n \n Conway\u2019s endorsement of Ivanka Trump\u2019s brand followed a tweet Wednesday by President Trump complaining that his daughter had \u201cbeen treated so unfairly\u201d by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line, citing slow sales. \n \n Conway touted Ivanka Trump\u2019s \u201cwonderful line\u201d of clothing and shoes during an interview Thursday morning with \u201cFox & Friends\u201d from the White House briefing room. \n \n Responding to national boycotts of Ivanka Trump merchandise, Conway said, \u201cGo buy Ivanka\u2019s stuff is what I would tell you.\u201d \n \n \u201cI\u2019m going to give a free commercial here,\u201d she added. \u201cGo buy it today, everybody. You can find it online.\u201d \n \n Experts quickly seized on Conway\u2019s remarks as a direct violation of Office of Government Ethics rules. Don W. Fox, a former OGE acting director and general counsel, said Conway\u2019s statements were \u201cjaw-dropping\u201d and \u201ca clear violation of rules prohibiting misuse of public office for anyone\u2019s private gain.\u201d \n \n Peter Schweizer, who has worked closely with Trump chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and wrote a book, \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d that was critical of donations to the Clinton Foundation, said, \u201cThey\u2019ve crossed a very, very important, bright line, and it\u2019s not good.\u201d \n \n \u201cTo encourage Americans to buy goods from companies owned by the first family is totally out of bounds and needs to stop,\u201d \u00adSchweizer added. \u201cClearly, the Trumps feel some of this is related to politics. But whether that\u2019s true or not, these marketing battles need to be fought by Ivanka and her company. They cannot and should not be fought by government employees and the White House.\u201d \n \n Schweizer said that it was time for Trump \u201cto move beyond the mind-set and the role of a businessman and assume the mantle of commander in chief.\u201d \n \n Federal law states that the director of the Office of Government Ethics can advise the White House and Conway of the violation and recommend disciplinary action. But the OGE\u2019s recommendations are nonbinding, and the ultimate decision resides with the White House. \n \n OGE officials did not respond to requests for comment. By midmorning, the agency\u2019s website had crashed, and the OGE\u2019s official Twitter account said that the office\u2019s phone and email systems were receiving \u201can extraordinary volume\u201d of citizen input about \u201crecent events.\u201d \n \n The office tweeted that its role is to help prevent ethics violations but not to investigate allegations that rules have been broken \u2014 a job reserved for the FBI, inspectors general and other watchdogs. Still, the OGE notifies agencies of possible ethics violations and asks for reports on any action taken, a process the office indicated it is \u201cactively following,\u201d according to the OGE\u2019s tweets. \n \n Experts said that a typical \u00adexecutive-branch employee who violated the endorsement rule could face significant disciplinary action, including a multi-day suspension and loss of pay. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service employees, for instance, face a five-day suspension or termination for using public office for private gain. \n \n But enforcement measures are largely left to the head of the federal agency \u2014 in Conway\u2019s case, the White House. Conway\u2019s counseling, independent lawyers said, could have included a meeting with members of the White House counsel\u2019s office, but it remained unclear what disciplinary steps would be taken. \n \n Independent ethics groups and Trump critics targeted the endorsement as a make-or-break moment for how the White House will address future ethical concerns. \n \n Noah Bookbinder, director of the liberal Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which filed an official ethics complaint, called Conway\u2019s comments \u201cjust another example of what looks like a disturbing pattern of this administration acting to benefit the businesses of the president\u2019s family and supporters.\u201d \n \n Conway\u2019s endorsement of Ivanka Trump\u2019s business also highlighted an awkward reality for a White House threatening U.S. companies seeking to move jobs or operations overseas. Nearly all Ivanka-brand merchandise is manufactured in low-cost-labor countries, including China, Indonesia and Vietnam. \n \n The president and his daughter have taken steps to put distance between their private companies and public ambitions. Both resigned their official leadership roles in the Trump Organization. \n \n Ivanka Trump retains a financial interest in her separate business. The Trump company says the president does not have a financial interest or ownership stake in the Ivanka brand. \n \n [Fact Checker: Trump\u2019s claim Ivanka is being \u2018treated so unfairly\u2019 by Nordstrom]"], "summary": "\u2013 \"Go buy Ivanka's stuff.\" That was Kellyanne Conway's message to viewers during an interview with Fox & Friends on Thursday after Nordstrom pulled Ivanka Trump's clothing line from its stores. The problem? She might have violated federal ethics rules with the plug. Government workers aren't supposed to endorse products, and Conway not only did so, she wasn't shy about it: \"I'm going to give a free commercial here,\" she said. \"Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online.\u201d Per the Hill, this is the rule from the Office of Government Ethics she appears to have run afoul of: \"An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service, or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives.\" It's not clear whether the OGE will investigate, but someone who violates this rule can be suspended or even fired, though the person is likely to receive only a warning for a first offense, reports Politico. \"This is jaw-dropping to me,\" a former acting director of the office tells the Washington Post. It \"would seem to be a clear violation.\" President Trump, of course, has also addressed Nordstrom's move, tweeting, \"Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom.\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer says Trump's tweet \"was less about his family's business and an attack on his daughter,\" per CNNMoney. Nordstrom has said the decision was about declining sales, not politics.", "ranking": [2, 4, 1, 0, 3]}
{"document": ["DAMASCUS, Syria \u2014 Rifa was growing frantic. Her husband had called to say that he and her brother were stuck on their way home from work outside the Syrian capital, normally a 25-minute drive. There was fighting in a northern suburb, he said, and traffic was frozen. \n \n Tensions rose as the hours passed. It is never good to be out after dark in Damascus now, especially trapped in a traffic jam, unable to flee. Finally, Rifa\u2019s husband called again. They had escaped and returned to their workplace to pass the night, another concession to their changing world. \n \n War has come to Damascus. Not on the scale of Aleppo or Homs, at least not yet. But the difference from just a few months ago is unmistakable. With sandbagged checkpoints every half-mile and soldiers methodically searching vehicles for weapons, simple movement is becoming impossible. \n \n \u201cWhere is Damascus headed? Are we the next Aleppo?\u201d Rifa asked a few days later. \u201cHow soon before our city, our markets, are destroyed?\u201d \n \n This is the center of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s power, the stronghold he tried for months to shield from a popular uprising that has inexorably been transformed into a bloody civil war. As his troops battled insurgents all around the country, Mr. Assad was determined that here, at least, he would preserve an air of normalcy, of routine, of certainty that life would go on, as it had before. \n \n Such illusions are no longer possible. The reality of war has crept into daily life, and there is a sense of inevitability. Even supporters of the government talk about what comes next, and rebels speak of tightening the noose around this city, their ultimate goal. \n \n Damascus was once known for its all-night party scene. Now, few people venture out after dark, and kidnappings are rampant. Gasoline is increasingly scarce, and as winter approaches, people are worried about shortages of food and heating oil. Streets are closed at a moment\u2019s notice, traffic diverted, bridges shut down. Even longtime residents and taxi drivers get lost and have to weave in and out of parking lots to avoid barriers and dead-end streets. Shelling and machine-gun fire are so commonplace, children no longer react. \n \n As recently as summer, while war raged in various neighborhoods surrounding the city, Damascus existed in a bubble of denial. War, people seemed to feel, was happening elsewhere \u2014 and the residents of Mr. Assad\u2019s stronghold were determined to live their lives as if nothing had changed. There were garden parties and fashion shoots, and the Opera House hosted Italian tenors. There were elegant dinners at embassies \u2014 before the ambassadors fled, that is. \n \n But as summer faded, the strangulation of Damascus began. More checkpoints appeared. The shabiha \u2014 Arabic for ghosts \u2014 progovernment paramilitary forces who are often held responsible for the most violent crimes, were defiantly visible in foreign hotels. \n \n Now, suicide bombings are more frequent, and the rebels of the Free Syrian Army say they are slowly establishing control of the suburbs that ring the city, with the aim of slowly strangling the government. Some families say they are taking their children out of school and teaching them at home, because the drive to school is too dangerous. \n \n Discussions among friends are no longer \u201cof the real world,\u201d as one writer put it. Talk turns more naturally to the fate of the homeless in the city\u2019s parks, or the traumatization of the children. \n \n \u201cPeople,\u201d one woman said, \u201ctalk of death.\u201d \n \n To a reporter based in Paris who has been granted three visas in recent months to report freely in the country, Damascus seems now like a city under siege, where for most people danger is a wearying companion \u2014 so much so that the last names of those interviewed for this article are being withheld for their protection. \n \n Kidnapping of wealthy Syrians is on the rise, sowing fear in the city\u2019s finest precincts. In Mezze, a politically and ethnically mixed neighborhood once known as the Beverly Hills of Damascus, people talk of the daughter of a local businessman who was kidnapped three weeks ago and ransomed for about $395,000. She was returned to her family, according to local residents, sexually abused, tortured and traumatized. \n \n Residents say the kidnappers are from either the Free Syrian Army or renegade offshoots of radical groups or are, in the government\u2019s catchall phrase, \u201cforeign terrorists.\u201d \n \n One man, an Armenian Christian \u2014 \u201ca minority within a minority,\u201d he joked \u2014 said he was wary of laying blame on any one group.", "Dow Jones Reprints: This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

A shootout between members of the extended Assad family in the president\u2019s ancestral home town of Qardaha late last month and the detention of a prominent Alawite activist by the regime offer hints of unease within the one segment of the population whose unwavering support for Assad has hitherto not been in question. \n \n There is no indication that Alawites are on the verge of switching sides to join the fragmented and leaderless opposition, which has made little effort to welcome them. Indeed, many Alawites who initially welcomed demands for political reform fell silent long ago or lined up behind the Assad regime once the revolutionaries took up arms and Sunni extremists began to play a more prominent role, according to Alawite activists and residents of the Latakia region, where the minority community is concentrated. \n \n As members of an obscure and little-understood offshoot of Shiite Islam, the Alawites endured centuries of persecution under Sunni rule before Assad\u2019s father, Hafez, seized power in 1970 and propelled them into the ranks of the elite. Many fear being relegated again to second-class status or, worse, being killed by Sunnis exacting revenge for the months of bloodshed inflicted by the \u00adAlawite-dominated security forces, Alawites say. \n \n The signs of tension within the community suggest at a minimum, however, that the pressures of the 19-month-old revolt are taking a toll on the cohesion of the Alawites. \n \n \u201cThe Alawites are critical for Assad\u2019s survival. He wouldn\u2019t survive a day without their complete support, so the fact that we are seeing tensions is significant,\u201d said Hilal Khashan, a professor of political science at the American University of Beirut. \u201cMost Alawites are upset with the regime, and they feel Assad is dragging their sect into a conflict they can\u2019t eventually win.\u201d \n \n Shootout in Qardaha \n \n Exactly what happened in Qardaha over the last weekend of September is unclear, and accounts differ over whether the dispute was rooted in political or personal rivalries. But all agree that there was an exchange of fire between two members of the Assad family in a cafe in the mountainous town where Hafez al- \n \n Assad was born and where his body is buried in a vast marble tomb. \n \n One of the men, local strongman Mohammed al-Assad, pulled his gun after being insulted by another Assad relative, Sakher Osman, the accounts say. Both men were injured in the ensuing shootout, along with as many as six others. \n \n Syria scholar Joshua Landis, who maintains close contact with the community through his Alawite wife, says the gun battle occurred only because Osman insulted Mohammed al-Assad, known locally as the \u201cSheik of the Mountain\u201d for his role as the Assad family\u2019s premier enforcer in the town. An e-mail from a relative in the area described how Bashar al-Assad intervened in the dispute, calmed tempers and restored order, said Landis, a professor of political science at the University of Oklahoma. \n \n Mohammed al-Saleh, an Alawite activist in Syria, said the fight was over the lucrative smuggling trade in cigarettes, weapons and other contraband that has thrived among the coastal Alawite clans under the Assad family rule. Attempts to read more into the incident are \u201cnonsense,\u201d he said. \n \n But suspicions that the quarrel reflected deeper political differences within the community were fueled by the fact that the shootout took place in a cafe owned by the prominent al-Khayer family, a longtime rival of the Assads; that one of those injured was a Khayer; and that the fight came days after the arrest of a prominent member of the family and a veteran dissident, Abdul Aziz al-Khayer. \n \n Khayer was detained in Damascus upon his return from a trip to Russia and then China as a representative of the opposition National Coordination Board, the Damascus-based grouping that is tolerated by the regime for its relatively moderate stance. \n \n The arrest came amid widespread speculation in the capital that Khayer was being groomed by Moscow for a potential role in a future government, according to a Damascus analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he fears for his safety. Activists who believe the gunfight signaled the emergence of a political split within the ruling Alawite clans say Osman was meeting with representatives of the Khayer family to mull a response to the arrest when Mohammed al-Assad strode into the cafe to break them up. \n \n The specter of a full-blooded Alawite feud seems remote, if only because the challenges to their survival are so immense that most Alawite clans understand they have to stick together, Landis said. A split within the ruling family would \u201cbe totally new, a paradigm shift\u201d in the narrative of Syria\u2019s revolt, he said. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s happening,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a dynamic in Qardaha that is not in favor of Assad. There\u2019s just so many tensions.\u201d \n \n Exploiting fears \n \n Indeed, assumptions of Alawite loyalty to the regime mask a far more complex reality in which traditional clan rivalries are becoming tangled in deep frustrations among the many members of the community who have misgivings about the direction in which Assad is leading them, according to Alawite residents of the coastal region and exiled activists. \n \n A steady stream of coffins arrives daily in Alawite loyalist villages, containing the bodies of Alawite men killed in the fight against the rebels. Women wearing black are a common sight on streets festooned with Assad\u2019s portraits. The government has not released casualty figures for its security forces, but if the widely touted number of at least 10,000 Alawite deaths is true, it would mean that Alawite loyalists are dying at a greater rate than Sunnis. \n \n A story, perhaps apocryphal but told often enough to lend it an air of authenticity, goes that a mother, upon being presented with the body of her third and last son to die fighting the rebels, asked the officer: \u201cAre you going to kill every one of us just so that one man may survive?\u201d \n \n Complaints that Alawite fears are being exploited by the regime to protect Assad and his family are growing steadily louder as the death toll mounts, according to an Alawite doctor from Latakia, who spoke on the condition of anonymity while on a trip to Beirut because he fears for his safety. \n \n \u201cAssad is not representing the Alawites; he is using them,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Alawites are prepared to die for Assad, it is because they fear for themselves, not because they love him.\u201d \n \n Most impoverished Alawite communities benefited little from the ascent of the Assads, and they have historically formed an important component of the opposition to Assad\u2019s rule, said an Alawite activist in Latakia who spent a decade in jail in the 1990s and did not want to be identified. \n \n But they were heavily recruited into the security services, and they have since been propelled onto the front lines as the accelerating defections of Sunni soldiers call into question the reliability of Sunni units, military experts say. The army is also increasingly relying on groups of armed irregulars known as the shabiha, drawn mostly from the Alawite community, and has been organizing them into local militias. \n \n Sunnis also serve in the shabiha in predominantly Sunni parts of the country such as Aleppo, Daraa and Deir al-Zour, confounding simple interpretations of the conflict as sectarian, Alawite and Sunni activists note. \n \n Many of the large-scale massacres of civilians known to have taken place, such as those in the villages of Houla and Qubair this summer, were blamed on Alawite shabiha, however. And though there have not been any recorded retaliatory massacres of Alawite civilians by the rebels, \u201cthe danger of widespread sectarian reprisals . . . is frighteningly real,\u201d the International Crisis Group said in a recent report. \n \n Those fears, above all, are likely to continue to bind Alawites to Assad in what they have come to see as a fight for their survival, said Khashan, the professor. \n \n \u201cHe has left them with no option but to stay with him,\u201d Khashan said. \u201cHe has succeeded in linking the fate of the Alawites to the fate of the regime.\u201d", "In this Wednesday, Oct. 17, 2012 photo, citizen journalism image provided by Edlib News Network, ENN, which has been authenticated based on its contents and other AP reporting, the dead body of Syrian...

(Associated Press) \n \n Syria's wealthy, long cultivated by President Bashar Assad as a support for his regime, are seeing their businesses pummeled by the bloody civil war. Factories have been burned down or damaged in fighting. International sanctions restrict their finances. Some warn that their companies are in danger of going under, worsening the country's buckling economy. \n \n Assad may not have lost the backing of Syria's business elite, but some are losing faith. Many of those who can have fled abroad, hoping to ride out the turmoil, which is now in its 19th month and is only getting worse as rebels and regime forces tear apart the country in their fight for power. \n \n Several businessmen interviewed by The Associated Press say resentment is growing against Assad over the crisis _ but they also aren't throwing their lot in with the rebellion. They are hunkering down, trying to salvage their companies. \n \n One young businessman said his family factory in the suburbs of Damascus was damaged Wednesday, with windows blown out and part of the ceiling was destroyed when warplanes hit rebels in a neighboring building. Its several hundred employees had to hide in the basement until fighting eased enough that they could be bused out to safety. \n \n \"I feel that they are both just as bad as each other,\" he said of the rebels and the government. \"I could have died today because they (the rebels) were across the street from us and they (the planes) could have bombed us.\" \n \n Syria's economy has been heavily hurt by the conflict, which activists say has left more than 30,000 dead. Inflation has risen to at least 36 percent. The currency has dropped around 50 percent, now trading at 75 pounds to the dollar on the black market, according to the factory owner. The government estimates economic losses at $34 billion _ almost half the gross domestic product _ though the opposition puts the losses at nearly three times that amount. Fuel shortages have become widespread as the regime burns through hard currency to import diesel and oil at the same time that it finances the war effort. \n \n Though the economic blow has been hard, \"we are not at the stage that the rug has been pulled from under the regime,\" said Anthony Skinner, head of Middle East and North African division at Maplecroft political risk consultancy. \n \n Assad has so far been able to keep his head above water with financial support from top ally Iran, he noted. \n \n \"The question is whether this is sustainable in the longer term and I don't think it is,\" Skinner said. \"What Assad is counting on at present is a bare-bones economy that is able to fuel his armed forces.\" \n \n The businessmen interviewed by AP spoke on condition they remain anonymous and that some identifying details of their industries not be specified for fear of repercussions for talking about the situation in Syria. \n \n They all come from the country's Sunni Muslim elite, which Assad ensured prospered as he carried out free market reforms over the past decade. The reforms transformed the long isolated nation, bringing in foreign businesses and chains and greater consumer goods, though it also sharply increased the gap between rich and poor. While the rebellion has largely been fueled by the Sunni majority, the elite have stuck by Assad for most of the conflict. \n \n The businessmen say they are caught in the middle _ both of the fighting and of Western sanctions they say hurt them more than the regime itself. The civil war has made it difficult to distribute goods since roads are cut off, warehouses have been shut down and 24-hour operations have been slashed to eight hours in places where it is too risky for employees to travel at night. Numerous factories have had to close or reduce production. A pharmaceutical company in Aleppo was also recently burned down in the city's fighting, said a businessman with close ties to the owners. \n \n The owner of a plastics factory said his wife and children fled to London three months ago when the worst fighting yet hit the capital Damascus. Initially, he stayed behind but eventually followed them to London. \n \n He knows others who have left and now have little access to their local accounts and are unable to operate their businesses. That has fueled resentment of Assad, he said. Still, there is also a fear of what may happen to Syria if his regime collapses. \n \n \"We feel this is a war by proxy,\" he said, referring to the influence of Shiite Iran, Russia and China backing Assad and Sunni Gulf states, France and the United States behind the opposition. \n \n If businesses fail, he warned, the new unemployed could further fuel the conflict. Already, 12 of his employees quit to work as \"security\" for the government. \n \n \"I know what that means. They are Shabiha,\" he said, referring to the pro-Assad gunmen used in fighting against rebels and accused of killings of civilians. He said he paid the employees $200 a month, but the government pays Shabiha at least $300. \"If I stop paying salaries to 400 people they will make a choice,\" he said. \n \n A physician who is among 14 owners of a hospital in Syria said only seven of his partners remain in the country. He is now in London while his wife and child are in California. He says most of his friends have also gone abroad. \n \n \"Nobody is happy. I am seeking opportunities around the world. I'm homeless now with no hospital, no income,\" he said. \n \n The civil war means patients do not have the money to pay for needed surgeries and those traveling from outside Damascus are unable to reach the capital because roads are unsafe. Locally-made drugs are difficult to find due to shortages or distribution problems. Importing high-end machines and spare parts is difficult because even if selling the technology is not necessarily banned by sanctions, banks are reluctant to finance the purchases. He also cannot wire his money in Syria to the U.S., he said. \n \n He makes clear his unhappiness with Assad. \"By the first speech of his excellency I knew he was an idiot,\" he said, referring to an Assad speech to parliament after protests broke out last year in which he took a tough line against the dissent. \"If this is his way of thinking, I knew things would get worse.\" \n \n The United States and its European partners have stepped up sanctions already in place before the uprising began in March 2011. \n \n Among the most damaging is the European Union's halt on importing Syrian crude oil, which has cost the country billions of dollars. The EU has also banned its member-states from exporting to Syria weapons, dual-use equipment, luxury goods such as vehicles and jewelry. It froze the assets of the Syrian central bank within the EU, as well as those of more than 50 other Syrian entities and more than 150 people. \n \n It also bars EU banks from establishing new joint ventures or correspondent banking relationships with Syrian banks, and while \"legitimate trade\" can continue, it is under \"strict conditions.\" \n \n The U.S. has also frozen assets of the Syrian government and a list of people and entities linked to the regime. It has banned Syrian oil imports and bars U.S. citizens from investing in Syria and exporting any services or supplies to Syria. Arab nations, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia also have separate sets of restrictions for doing business with Syria. \n \n The sanctions also have an indirect effect. European and other banks are reluctant to deal with Syrian businesses for fear of running afoul of sanctions. Transfers from Syrian banks _ particularly in dollars _ are difficult and sometimes impossible. \n \n \"Most of the banks we deal with say we do not want to do business in Syria,\" said the plastics factory owner.

A customer in Italy, for example, could not send him a payment because the European bank banned the transfer. \n \n The businessman whose factory was damaged Wednesday said a European bank also refused to back his purchase of spare parts from China. So he had to pull cash from his accounts in Lebanon and Turkey.

Despite the fact that this could be good news for the rebels, it's bad news for the US, which worries such weapons could end up with anti-Western militias. More from Syria: The rebels today blew up one oil pipeline and one gas pipeline near Deir al-Zour, the AP reports, citing state media. Meanwhile, at least 20 people were killed in government airstrikes on rebel areas last night and this morning, activists say. Though Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has tried to shield Damascus, war has now reached the capital, the New York Times reports. The fighting isn't as intense as in other cities like Aleppo or Homs, but it's drastically increased since a few months ago: Checkpoints abound, kidnappings are common, bombings are increasing, and it's not safe to go out after dark. \"How soon before our city, our markets, are destroyed?\" wonders one resident. Similarly, Syria's wealthy\u2014many of whom back the president\u2014are now seeing their businesses hurt by the war, and some are losing faith in Assad, the AP reports. Many have seen factories burned or otherwise affected by fighting, and others have had their money restricted by sanctions. Yet more trouble for Assad: Even his own sect, the Alawite minority, is growing discontent, the Washington Post reports. Alawites had been strong backers of Assad, as the Sunni majority backed the rebellion, because they feared losing power to Sunni Islamists.

These rates were combined to calculate an estimate of the appropriate annual rate of antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 population. \n \n Results Of the 184 032 sampled visits, 12.6% of visits (95% CI, 12.0%-13.3%) resulted in antibiotic prescriptions. Sinusitis was the single diagnosis associated with the most antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 population (56 antibiotic prescriptions [95% CI, 48-64]), followed by suppurative otitis media (47 antibiotic prescriptions [95% CI, 41-54]), and pharyngitis (43 antibiotic prescriptions [95% CI, 38-49]). Collectively, acute respiratory conditions per 1000 population led to 221 antibiotic prescriptions (95% CI, 198-245) annually, but only 111 antibiotic prescriptions were estimated to be appropriate for these conditions. Per 1000 population, among all conditions and ages combined in 2010-2011, an estimated 506 antibiotic prescriptions (95% CI, 458-554) were written annually, and, of these, 353 antibiotic prescriptions were estimated to be appropriate antibiotic prescriptions. \n \n Conclusions and Relevance In the United States in 2010-2011, there was an estimated annual antibiotic prescription rate per 1000 population of 506, but only an estimated 353 antibiotic prescriptions were likely appropriate, supporting the need for establishing a goal for outpatient antibiotic stewardship.", "MAY 02, 2016 \n \n Allison Gilchrist, Associate Editor \n \n About 30% of all outpatient oral antibiotic prescriptions written in the United States are inappropriate, a new CDC study suggests.CDC researchers used data from the 2010-2011 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey to determine the rates of outpatient oral antibiotic prescribing by patient age and diagnosis, as well as the estimated amount of antibiotic use that could be considered inappropriate.Of the 184,032 outpatient visits included in the data, 12.6% resulted in an antibiotic prescription. The researchers estimated that 353 of the 506 antibiotic prescriptions written annually per 1000 population were appropriate.Broken down further, the data revealed that sinusitis diagnoses resulted in the most antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 population (56), followed by ear infections (47), and pharyngitis (43).\u201cHalf of antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory conditions may have been unnecessary, representing 34 million antibiotic prescriptions annually,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cCollectively across all conditions, an estimated 30% of outpatient oral antibiotic prescriptions may have been inappropriate.\u201dLast fall, the President signed an Executive Order on \u201cdetecting, preventing, and controlling antibiotic-resistant microbes\u201d as part of the White House\u2019s 5-year National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, which aims to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by 50% by 2020. Based on the current study results, a 15% reduction in overall antibiotic use would be necessary in order to meet that goal, the researchers noted.Because antibiotic overprescribing contributes to drug resistance, curbing the practice is a major public health care priority. Failure to do so could have grim consequences, as the CDC already estimates that 2 million individuals are infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria each year in the United States, and 23,000 of them die from these infections annually.In one of the more notorious examples , UCLA Health indicated that 179 patients might have been infected with \u201c superbug \u201d carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center during \u201ccomplex endoscopic procedures that took place between October 2014 and January 2015.\u201d\u201cHealth professionals generally know when antibiotics are and are not needed,\u201d lead study author Katherine Fleming-Dutra, MD, a medical epidemiologist with the CDC\u2019s Office of Antibiotic Stewardship, explained to Pharmacy Times. \u201cOften, clinicians are worried about patient satisfaction. They think that a patient wants antibiotics\u2026sometimes leading them to prescribe when they shouldn\u2019t.\u201dPharmacists can help prevent this by providing patients with information about the potential consequences of unnecessary antibiotic use.\u201cPharmacists are the last health professional to see a patient when an antibiotic is prescribed,\u201d Dr. Fleming-Dutra said. \u201cWhen dispensing antibiotics, pharmacists can educate patients about properly taking antibiotics and about potential harms from antibiotics such as allergies, adverse events, and antibiotic resistance.\u201dBeyond treating infections, other studies have found that as many as 1 in 10 health care providers prescribe antibiotics for almost every patient they see with a cold or bronchitis, despite the fact that antibiotics aren\u2019t effective against viral infections.\u201cIt is important for all health professionals in all regions seeing patients of all ages to only prescribe antibiotics when they are needed, and if needed, select the right antibiotic at the right dose for the right duration,\u201d Dr. Fleming-Dutra advised.The current study results appeared in the May 3, 2016, edition of JAMA.", "WASHINGTON\u2014The Pew Charitable Trusts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released today a first-of-its kind analysis of antibiotic use in doctors\u2019 offices, emergency rooms, and hospital-based clinics in the United States. The analysis, conducted in partnership with a panel of leading antibiotic use experts, identifies acute respiratory conditions as key drivers of antibiotic overuse in human health care and establishes data-driven targets for eliminating the approximately 47 million unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions issued in outpatient facilities across the country every year. \n \n The findings are outlined in two documents released today: Pew\u2019s report \u201cAntibiotic Use in Outpatient Settings\u201d and \u201cPrevalence of Inappropriate Antibiotic Prescriptions Among U.S. Ambulatory Care Visits, 2010-2011,\u201d an article authored by experts from Pew, CDC, and members of the panel, appearing in the current issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. They outline the baseline analysis and condition-specific targets, as well as practical strategies to improve prescribing. \n \n \u201cThis report provides the most in-depth picture to date of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the U.S. and will serve as a benchmark in measuring progress moving forward,\u201d said David Hyun, M.D., a senior officer with Pew\u2019s antibiotic resistance project, who focuses on research and policy development pertaining to the stewardship of antibiotics in health care settings. \u201cWhile our estimates of unnecessary antibiotic use are conservative, it is clear that a small number of health conditions constitute the lion\u2019s share of unwarranted antibiotic prescriptions in this country. These detailed data will help health care providers target stewardship efforts where they can do the most good.\u201d \n \n At least 30 percent of antibiotics prescribed in outpatient settings in the United States are unnecessary, according to the report. The majority are prescribed for acute respiratory conditions such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other viral illnesses that do not respond to antibiotics. \n \n \u201cThe more antibiotics are used, the less effective they become. Reducing the needless use of antibiotics will slow the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microbes, so-called superbugs, which are among the most urgent public health threats of our time,\u201d said Kathy Talkington, director of Pew\u2019s antibiotic resistance project. \u201cPatients and health care providers must work together to understand when antibiotics will help and when they won\u2019t, and help preserve these lifesaving drugs for patients who really need them.\u201d \n \n Antibiotic use in outpatient settings represents the majority of dollars spent on antibiotics for human health care in the United States, and outpatient providers are often the first place patients go for health care when suffering from a cold, flu, sore throat, or other common condition for which antibiotics are often unnecessarily prescribed. \n \n The analysis concludes that: \n \n Approximately 13 percent of all outpatient office visits in the United States, or about 154 million visits annually, result in an antibiotic prescription; about 30 percent of these prescriptions are unnecessary. \n \n Forty-four percent of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions are written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions, such as sinus infections, middle ear infections, pharyngitis, viral upper respiratory infections (i.e., the common cold), bronchitis, bronchiolitis, asthma, allergies, influenza, and pneumonia. Half of these prescriptions are unnecessary. \n \n In 2015, the White House released a national action plan for combating antibiotic resistance, which included the goal of reducing inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use by 50 percent by 2020. Based on the panel\u2019s estimate of unnecessary prescribing, this goal would be reached by reducing outpatient antibiotic use by 15 percent overall, which would result in approximately 23 million fewer antibiotics prescribed annually by 2020. \n \n The panel outlined actions that health care providers, patients, and the health care industry as a whole can take to reach the targets, including: \n \n Individual outpatient health care providers can evaluate their own prescribing habits as well as implement stewardship activities in their practices. \n \n Health systems can provide expertise and resources to offices within their network to aid in stewardship implementation. \n \n Health plans can assist in data collection and analysis\u2014evaluating the antibiotic prescribing habits of their providers and providing feedback that highlights potential areas for improvement. \n \n State and local health agencies can help provide outpatient facilities with information on best practices for implementing antibiotic stewardship programs, and help develop regional partnerships between various health care stakeholders, such as providers, health plans, and health systems, in order to better coordinate stewardship activities. \n \n Federal agencies can track antibiotic prescribing at the national level, identifying areas for further improvement and providing technical assistance to stakeholders interested in implementing stewardship efforts of their own. \n \n Organizations such as the National Committee for Quality Assurance that develop standards to assess the quality of health care services can establish metrics to assess the antibiotic prescribing habits of health care providers. \n \n Health care professional societies can provide expert guidance to their members on appropriate antibiotic prescribing and incorporating diagnostics to aid in prescribing decision-making. \n \n \u201cPrescribing unnecessary antibiotics is just one element of inappropriate use of antibiotics,\u201d said Lauri Hicks, D.O., director of the CDC\u2019s Office of Antibiotic Stewardship in the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. \u201cHealth care providers can also prescribe antibiotics at the wrong dose or for the wrong duration, amplifying the extent of inappropriate use.

The report sounded the alarm to the danger of antibiotic resistance, stating that each year in the U.S., at least 2 million people get an antibiotic-resistant infection, and at least 23,000 people die. \n \n The report ranked the 18 threats (bacteria and fungi) into three categories based on level of concern to human health\u2014urgent, serious, and concerning\u2014and identified: \n \n Minimum estimates of morbidity and mortality from antibiotic-resistant infections \n \n People at especially high risk \n \n Gaps in knowledge about antibiotic resistance \n \n Core actions to prevent infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and slow spread of resistance \n \n What CDC was doing at that time to combat the threat of antibiotic resistance \n \n The data below is pulled from the 2013 Threats Report.

Most of these are for conditions that don't respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu and other viral illnesses. \n \n Although health officials have been warning for decades about the overuse of antibiotics and its contribution to the development of drug-resistant bacteria, the research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Pew Charitable Trust is the first to quantify the depth of the problem. \n \n \"We've all been hearing, 'This is a problem, this is problem,' and we all understood the general concept that there is a lot of antibiotic use,\" said David Hyun, a senior officer with Pew's antibiotic resistance project and one of the authors of the report published Tuesday in JAMA.

But the majority of individuals do trust their doctors to make the right diagnosis, and better communication by doctors about the dangers of antibiotic overuse can lead to more appropriate prescribing, she said. \n \n An accompanying editorial in JAMA noted that the numbers provided in the report likely are an undercount because they don't include the times antibiotics are given when patients talk to doctors' offices over the telephone, or when patients seek medical care at urgent care clinics, retail pharmacies and dentists' offices. \n \n Also not included are prescriptions written by nurse practitioners and physician assistants. \n \n But even relatively simple steps, such as displaying a poster in patient waiting rooms can cut down on antibiotic prescribing, the editorial said. \n \n The overuse of antibiotics has led to the frightening rise of drug-resistant superbugs in recent years.

{"document": ["Kisspeptin The molecule of puberty \n \n and sexual fertility Paul May \n \n University of Bristol Molecule of the Month September 2010 \n \n Also available: JSMol version. \n \n Surely nothing to do with Gene Simmons and Co.? \n \n No, not the rock band Kiss, although it has similarities it that it also sends teenagers wild. Kisspeptin is a protein that when released from the brain triggers the cascade of biochemical changes that leads to puberty, turning children into adults. Puberty is still one of the great unsolved mysteries in biology. Scientists have known for years that puberty begins when a child's brain releases hormones that cascade through the body leading to the maturing of testes in boys and ovaries in girls. However, the exact nature of the hormones wasn't fully understood until a few years ago, when kisspeptin was discovered. Adolescents who lack a functioning kisspeptin system fail to achieve puberty. We now know that, almost literally, \u2018puberty begins with a kiss\u2019! \n \n It started with a kiss... \n \n Kisspeptins are actually a group of proteins with similar structure, and are products of the KiSS-1 gene. This gene was discovered in 1996 [Lee et al., 2006] when scientists were searching for a gene that prevents cancer from spreading. This groundbreaking work took place in research labs in the town of Hershey, Pennsylvania, the location also famous for the Hershey's chocolate factory. Since Hershey's most popular product is a chocolate confectionary called a Hershey's Kiss (photo, right), the discoverers' of the gene named it KiSS-1 after this chocolate. However, the nomenclature also has a scientific grounding as the inclusion of SS in the name also indicates that the gene is a suppressor sequence, i.e. it prevents some biological process from occurring (such as cancer spreading). Kisspeptin was first given the name metastin, because it was thought to play a role in tumor metastasis, but later named kisspeptin after its gene pecursor. The receptor for kisspeptin in the brain was identified only recently and was given the rather less whimsical name GPR54 (G-Protein Coupled Receptor 54). \n \n The KiSS-1 gene is found on the long-arm of chromosome 1. The protein it makes is a peptide containing 145 amino-acids, which are then cleaved into smaller, 54-amino-acid chunks. These may also be further truncated down to 14, 13 or even 10 amino-acids fragments with carboxylic acid terminations. These N-terminally truncated peptides are known as the family of kisspeptins. Kisspeptin-10 is shown below. \n \n ...never thought it would come to this \n \n A single injection of kisspeptin in animals has been found to stimulate a huge increase in the secretion of gonadotropins (hormones that stimulate the production of testosterone in men and estradiol in women). Repeated injections into immature rats has been shown to advance the age of puberty. \n \n Very recently, a group of Japanese scientists delivered an antibody directed against kisspeptin into the brain of female rats. This stopped the rats' reproductive cycle demonstrating that inhibiting the effect of kisspeptin, even after puberty, still blocks reproductive function. Therefore, as well as being vital to initiate puberty, kisspeptin is necessary for reproductive function to continue later in life. Later, Spanish scientists discovered that administering kisspeptin in food-restricted rats still stimulated the release of gonadotropins. This is a remarkable discovery, since normally when a mammal is facing starvation its reproductive system becomes dormant to conserve the body's stored food supply. Kisspeptin injections over-ride this defence mechanism, and can kick-start normally dormant reproductive systems. \n \n It has also been discovered that kisspeptin plays a role in seasonal-breeding animals. Many mammals only become fertile during the annual breeding season, and this is controlled by the duration of daylight per day. During short winter days, these anmials have a reduced amount of kisspeptin in certain parts of the brain, and sexual activity is switched off (or greatly reduced). But in the long summer days, kisspeptin amounts increase, stimulating the animals to breed. Artificially injecting animals (such as ewes) with kisspeptin during the winter months causes ovulation even in the non-breeding season [Dhilo 2008]. This has implications for farmers, who may soon be able to choose when their livestock reproduce rather than be restricted by the natural annual cycle. \n \n The kiss of life? \n \n Because of its link with the KiSS-1 gene, kisspeptin has been suggested as a possible treatment for some forms of cancer. In particular, when breast and prostate cancers develop, they are nurtured by the sex hormones oestrogen and testosterone. If the production of these hormones could be switched off the tumours should shrivel and die. One way to do this might be to block the kisspeptin-receptor in the brain. Scientists are now actively looking for molecules that can block this receptor. \n \n Kisspeptin's role in switching-on sexual hormones could be vital in controlling the timing of puberty when this goes wrong. There are a number of conditions where children that reach puberty much too early (five or six years old) could possibly be treated by simply taking pills containing kispeptin derivatives. Conversely, for young people in which puberty does not begin as normal in their teenage years, it may be possible to administer kisspeptin to kick-start the process. \n \n It has recently been found that kisspeptin can restart the female reproductive system in women who have stopped ovulating due to an imbalance in their sex hormones. Kisspeptin is therefore a potential basis for a new infertility treatment. \n \n References \n \n W.S. Dhillo, J. Neuroendocrin . 20 (2008) 963 - a good review paper. \n \n .

The work was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council. \n \n Kisspeptin is a naturally occurring hormone that stimulates the release of other reproductive hormones inside the body. The study involved a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 29 healthy heterosexual young men were given either an injection of kisspeptin or placebo. In an MRI scanner the men were shown a variety of images, including sexual and non-sexual romantic pictures of couples, whilst researchers scanned their brains to see how kisspeptin affected the brain's responses. \n \n Ultimately, we are keen to look into whether kisspeptin could be an effective treatment for psychosexual disorders, and potentially help countless couples who struggle to conceive. \u2013 Professor Waljit Dhillo Department of Medicine \n \n The researchers found that after the injection of kisspeptin, when the volunteers were shown sexual or romantic images of couples, there was enhanced activity in structures in the brain typically activated by sexual arousal and romance. \n \n The team believe this shows kisspeptin boosts behavioural circuits associated with sex and love. They are particularly interested in how kisspeptin might be able to help people with psychosexual disorders and related problems with conceiving a baby. \n \n NIHR Research Professor Waljit Dhillo, the lead author of the research from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London, said: \"Most of the research and treatment methods for infertility to date have focussed on the biological factors that may make it difficult for a couple to conceive naturally. These of course play a huge part in reproduction, but the role that the brain and emotional processing play in this process is also very important, and only partially understood.\" \n \n As the research is at an early stage, the team of researchers now want to do a follow on study to analyse the effects of kisspeptin in a larger group, including women as well as men. \n \n Professor Dhillo added: \"Our initial findings are novel and exciting as they indicate that kisspeptin plays a role in stimulating some of the emotions and responses that lead to sex and reproduction. Ultimately, we are keen to look into whether kisspeptin could be an effective treatment for psychosexual disorders, and potentially help countless couples who struggle to conceive.\" \n \n Volunteers in the study underwent MRI scans at the Imanova Centre for Imaging Sciences and were shown sexual and non-sexual romantic, negative, and neutral-themed images, and images of happy, fearful and neutral emotional faces. Kisspeptin did not appear to alter emotional brain activity in response to neutral, happy or fearful-themed images. However, when volunteers were shown negative images, kisspeptin did enhance activity in brain structures important in regulating negative moods, and study participants reported a reduction in negative mood in a post-scan questionnaires. As a result, the team are also interested in investigating the possibility that kisspeptin might be used for treating depression. \n \n Left image: Orange highlights illustrate the enhanced activity in the brain when the subjects had the kisspeptin injection and looked at sexual images. These areas of the brain have often been associated with processing of sexual, emotional and rewarding stimuli. \n \n Right image: Orange highlights show areas of the brain that were more responsive to couple-bonding images when the subjects had the kisspeptin injection.These areas of the brain have often been associated with memory and processing of romantic, emotional and rewarding stimuli. \n \n Dr Alexander Comninos, first author of the study from the Department of Medicine at Imperial, said \"'Our study shows that kisspeptin boosts sexual and romantic brain activity as well as decreasing negative mood. This raises the interesting possibility that kisspeptin may have uses in treating psychosexual disorders and depression which are major health problems which often occur together, but further studies would be needed to investigate this.\" \n \n \"Kisspeptin Modulates Sexual and Emotional Brain Processing in Humans\" by Waljit S Dhillo et al is published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. \n \n See the press release of this article", "In this study, we demonstrate that the reproductive hormone kisspeptin enhances limbic brain activity specifically in response to sexual and bonding stimuli and that these responses correlate with psychometric measures of sexual and emotional processing. Sexual and emotional responses are fundamental drivers of human behavior, and the links among sex, bonding, and reproduction ultimately ensure the survival of most mammalian species (20). However, the pathways involved are multiple, complex, relatively poorly understood, and involve reproductive and metabolic hormones, pheromones, neuronal networks, peripheral organs, and various sensory signals, among others. Our data suggest a potential role for kisspeptin as an important neuromodulator, linking sexual and emotional brain processing with the reproductive axis. \n \n Visually evoked sexual arousal is a frequent occurrence in men, and brain activity associated with visual sexual stimuli have been explored in several previous studies. These studies have examined a wide range of brain structures in response to sexual-themed images and revealed a processing network involving structures including the hypothalamus, amygdala, thalamus, cingulate, insula, precentral gyrus, and occipital cortex (13\u201315, 21\u201328). Furthermore, activations in structures including the thalamus and cingulate correlate with physiological sexual arousal (as assessed by penile tumescence) (13). The involvement of these structures therefore suggests cognitive (cingulate, thalamus), emotional (amygdala, insula), motivational (precentral gyrus), and physiological (thalamus) components to sexual arousal from the appraisal of a stimulus as sexual through to the autonomic activation in readiness for sexual behavior (13, 27, 28). \n \n Kisspeptin sits at the apex of the reproductive axis, above gonadal hormones such as testosterone that are known to be involved in sexual and emotional processing (29). Kisspeptin signaling is also essential in the \u201ctiming\u201d of reproduction, from regulating gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulsatility, oestrous cyclicity, and sexual development to aging (30). In our study, kisspeptin enhanced activity in key limbic and paralimbic structures when heterosexual young men viewed sexual images. These included the anterior and posterior cingulate as well as the left amygdala, consistent with areas of activation observed in the above studies (13\u201315, 21\u201328) and with regions expressing kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptors (4\u201310). Therefore, we demonstrate that kisspeptin administration enhances activation in key established areas of the sexual-processing network. \n \n It is interesting that, although kisspeptin enhanced activity in both the right and left amygdala, this only reached statistical significance on the left. Although the right amygdala often shows greater enhancement during image-related emotion stimulation (31, 32), the left amygdala is more often engaged in sexual (14) and emotional processing in men (33), and so in this study, kisspeptin may be preferentially acting on the left amygdala in keeping with these studies. Future studies may seek to examine whether there is a lateralization of kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptor expression in the amygdala to address this further. \n \n We then proceeded to correlate modulations in brain activity with our psychometric data to provide functional relevance. Interestingly, kisspeptin\u2019s enhancement of several structures of the sexual-processing network (including the cingulate, putamen, and globus pallidus) correlated with reduced sexual aversion, suggesting a role for kisspeptin in sexual disinhibition. \n \n Drive and reward traits are primary components of BAS, which has key functions in bringing the individual together with biological rewards such as sex and food (34, 35). Furthermore, previous studies have shown that these traits predict fMRI responses to appetizing foods (36) and sexual images (37). The neural substrate of the BAS comprises structures belonging to the mesolimbic reward and fronto-striatal-amygdala-midbrain networks (36, 37). Intriguingly, in our study, kisspeptin activated key components related to these networks (including the hippocampus, amygdala, and cingulate) more in participants with lower baseline drive and reward traits in response to viewing sexual images. It is interesting to speculate as to a functional reason for this. Kisspeptin was able to enhance activity in components of this reward circuitry more in participants who were less reward responsive. This could serve as a functional mechanism for enhancing reward-system activity during sexual arousal (in those generally less responsive to reward), so as to drive a desire for reproduction in these individuals. \n \n Collectively, these data suggest that kisspeptin not only enhances activation in established structures of sexual arousal, but that this activation correlates with behavioral measures of reward, drive, and sexual aversion. Consistent with the expression pattern of kisspeptin and its cognate receptor in these regions (4\u201310), we provide evidence for kisspeptin as a neuroendocrine modulator of the human brain sexual-processing network. \n \n In addition to sexual stimulation, an important precursor to reproduction is the desire to bond with a partner. Studies of bonding have examined different types: romantic love, maternal love, and unconditional love. Studies of romantic love demonstrate activations in dopamine-rich and basal ganglia structures such as the putamen, thalamus, and globus pallidus (17, 38, 39), which are associated with reward (40), pair-bonding (41), and euphoria (16). In addition, activations are commonly seen in areas associated with mental associations (e.g., hippocampus and thalamus) and emotional areas also implicated in sexual processing (e.g., cingulate and amygdala) (17, 38, 39, 42). There is substantial overlap with the processing networks in maternal love, including the cingulate, globus pallidus, amygdala, and dopaminergic brain areas (43). Activations are also observed in reward and dopamine-rich areas (e.g., globus pallidus and cingulate) in unconditional love (44). Taken together, these studies suggest a common subcortical dopaminergic reward-related brain system as well as higher-order cortical cognitive centers driving love and bonding. \n \n In the current study, kisspeptin modulated the response to bonding images in regions similar to those seen with sexual images, including the anterior and posterior cingulate and amygdala, with the addition of activation in the thalamus and globus pallidus. These activations by kisspeptin match regions implicated in romantic love, maternal love, and even unconditional love in the aforementioned studies as well as being sites of kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptor expression (4\u201310). Furthermore, we observed that kisspeptin\u2019s enhanced activation of the amygdala in response to bonding images correlated with improvements in positive mood. Taken together, these data demonstrate that kisspeptin enhanced activity in key \u201cromance and bonding\u201d structures in response to viewing couple-bonding images and that this correlated with improved positive mood. We therefore provide evidence in humans of a role for kisspeptin in the processing of sexual and bonding stimuli, both of which are critical in driving reproduction at a behavioral level. \n \n Consistent with the correlation between kisspeptin\u2019s enhancement of amygdala activity and improvements in positive mood in humans above, recent rodent data suggest antidepressant-like effects for kisspeptin via the serotonergic system (45). In our study, kisspeptin enhanced prefrontal activity in response to negative images; a region expressing kisspeptin receptors (9). This is consistent with studies of negative-evoked stimuli, demonstrating predominant activation in prefrontal regions commonly implicated in response inhibition and self-control. Greater activity in these regions assists internalized representations of safety to minimize fear and anxiety to negative stimuli (19). In keeping with this, we observed that kisspeptin administration elicited a reduction in negative mood, providing human evidence of an antidepressant-like effect for kisspeptin, a finding with clear clinical implications. \n \n The hippocampus is heavily involved in producing emotions. In our study, sexual- and bonding-themed stimuli resulted in positive increases in activity in the hippocampus (i.e., increases in mean percentage of blood-oxygen-level\u2013dependent [BOLD] signal change) in line with previous studies (25, 46). In other words, the images were able to stimulate hippocampal activity. However, there was no significant difference in this increased activity between kisspeptin and vehicle administration. Overall, these data suggest that kisspeptin may have a greater effect on other limbic structures involved in emotional processing, such as the amygdala, cingulate, thalamus, and globus pallidus rather than the hippocampus. \n \n It is salient to note that the effects of kisspeptin on the limbic system were confined to sexual and couple-bonding images, with no limbic effects in response to negative-, neutral-, happy-, or fearful-themed images. In addition, kisspeptin had no effect on brain activity during a battery of nonlimbic tasks (visual, auditory, motor, language, calculation). These data highlight that kisspeptin acts specifically to enhance limbic activity only to sexual and couple-bonding stimulation in our study, which is particularly pertinent given its established role as a potent reproductive hormone (1\u20133). It is also noteworthy that kisspeptin administration had no effect in the current study on other relevant hormones that could affect limbic activity, including testosterone, oxytocin, and cortisol as well as attention and anxiety. Furthermore, previous studies demonstrate that kisspeptin administration has no effect on other endocrine hormones, including growth hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone in humans (47). \n \n It is important to consider the physiological implications of our findings using the experimental paradigm employed in this study. Physiologically, kisspeptin is predominantly synthesized and secreted from kisspeptin neurones in the infundibular nucleus of the hypothalamus in humans (48) and the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) in rodents (49). This kisspeptin then activates kisspeptin receptors on GnRH neurones, stimulating pulsatile GnRH release into the hypophyseal-portal circulation and downstream reproductive hormones. This secretion does appear to be pulsatile in rodents (49), and work in monkeys demonstrates pulsatile kisspeptin secretion (every 30 to 90 minutes) into the hypophyseal-pituitary circulation (50). In this study, kisspeptin was administered peripherally, as it is obviously not possible to administer it into the hypothalamus in humans, and we acknowledge that this differs from physiological kisspeptin release. However, the levels of kisspeptin achieved in this study are similar to those observed physiologically in normal pregnancy (51, 52). In addition, the kisspeptin levels observed in this study were similar to the kisspeptin levels achieved in previous studies in which peripheral kisspeptin administration stimulated oocyte maturation in in vitro fertilization protocols (53) and restored luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility in women with hypothalamic amenorrhoea (54). Furthermore, our study and others have demonstrated that peripheral kisspeptin administration does not result in downregulation of the reproductive axis in the time frame used in this study in healthy men (54\u201357). As such, while our protocol does not precisely mimic normal physiology, in the current study, we administered doses of kisspeptin that have previously been shown to have physiological and sustained reproductive effects. \n \n Another important point to consider is whether peripherally administered kisspeptin can get into the brain. Peripheral kisspeptin can access GnRH neurones via their dendritic terminals in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) outside the blood-brain barrier (58, 59). To examine other brain areas, we administered radiolabeled kisspeptin peripherally to male mice and demonstrated that it can access the brain, including limbic structures (Supplemental Figure 6). Although this study was performed in mice, it suggests that peripheral kisspeptin can cross the blood-brain barrier and directly access brain regions expressing kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptors (4\u201310). Future work will no doubt examine the neuronal pathways involved, expanding on established interactions among kisspeptin (6), GABA (60), and nitric oxide (61) pathways. \n \n In conclusion, we implicate kisspeptin as a modulator of reproductive hormones, limbic brain activity, and behavior. This is supported by the findings of kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptor expression in limbic and paralimbic structures (4\u201310). We demonstrate that kisspeptin administration enhances limbic responses to sexual and bonding stimuli and that this activity correlates with reward measures, improved positive mood, and reduced sexual aversion. In addition, kisspeptin attenuates negative mood. This suggests that kisspeptin, in addition to its established role in the reproductive hormonal cascade, can also influence related sexual and emotional brain processing, thereby providing integration among reproduction, sexual responses, and bonding. These findings have important ramifications for our understanding of reproductive biology. Delineation of the precise neuronal networks by which kisspeptin exerts these effects will be an exciting field of future study, and recent advances in the use of optogenetics to stimulate endogenous kisspeptin neurones may serve as useful tools (49). Furthermore, in rodents, the kisspeptin receptor is necessary for male olfactory partner preference (62), with limbic kisspeptin neurones integrating into olfactory and reproductive circuits (6). This suggests that in humans, kisspeptin-olfactory processing may provide another area of future study. \n \n We observed that kisspeptin\u2019s enhancement of brain activity correlated with improvements in positive mood and reduced sexual aversion while kisspeptin also reduced negative mood. Therefore, this raises interesting directions for the pharmacological use of kisspeptin in disorders of sexual and emotional processing. For example, studies of kisspeptin administration in patients with depression and psychosexual disorders may prove fruitful as well as informing current work to develop kisspeptin as a potential therapeutic for common reproductive disorders, including male hypogonadism (56), hypothalamic amenorrhoea (54), and hyperprolactinaemia (63), and as a trigger for ovulation in in vitro fertilization (53). Therefore, our data also have important clinical relevance given the continued development of kisspeptin as a potential therapeutic.", "Mental Viagra\u2019 is on the horizon after scientists discovered that a hormone which surges during puberty can activate lust signals in the brain. \n \n The hormone kisspeptin essentially switches on the desire to reproduce and is linked to feeling sexy, romantic and turned on.

In 1580, politician William Lambarde drafted the first bill to ban \"licentious\" and \"hurtful... books, pamphlets, ditties, songs, and other works that promote the art of lascivious ungodly love\". Last week, the UK government decided to have another crack at censorship, formally announcing that age verification for all online pornographic content will be mandatory from April 2018. \n \n It is unclear at this point what this mandatory check will entail, but it's expected that you will need to submit your credit card details to a site before being allowed to access adult content (credit cards can\u2019t be issued to under-18s). \n \n The appointed regulator will almost certainly be the British Board of Film Classification who will have the authority to levy fines of up to \u00a3250,000 or shut down sites that do not comply. These measures are being directly linked to research conducted by the NSPCC, the Children\u2019s Commissioner and the University of Middlesex in 2016, which surveyed more than 1,000 11 to 16-year-olds about viewing online pornography and found over half had accessed it. \n \n Digital minister Matt Hancock said age verification \"means that while we can enjoy the freedom of the web, the UK will have the most robust internet child protection measures of any country in the world\". And who can argue with that? No sane adult would think that it\u2019s a good idea for children to watch hardcore pornography. And because we all agree kids should be watching Peppa Pig rather than The Poonies, the act has been waved through virtually unchallenged. \n \n So, let\u2019s put the issue of hardcore pornography to one side, because surely we are all in agreement. I\u2019m asking you to look at the bigger picture. It\u2019s not just children who will be censored and it\u2019s not just Pornhub and Redtube which will be forced to age check UK viewers. This act will potentially censor any UK site that carries adult content, which is broadly defined by the BBFC as \"that it was produced solely or principally for the purposes of sexual arousal\". \n \n I am a UK academic and research the history of sexuality. I curate the online research project www.thewhoresofyore.com, where academics, activists, artists and sex workers contribute articles on all aspects of sexuality in the hope of joining up conversations around sex that affect everyone. The site also archives many historical images; from the erotic brothel frescoes of Pompeii to early Victorian daguerreotypes of couples having sex. And yet, I do not consider myself to be a porn baron. These are fascinating and important historical documents that can teach us a great deal about our own attitudes to sex and beauty. \n \n The site clearly signposts the content and asks viewers to click to confirm they are over 18, but under the Digital Economy Act this will not be enough. Although the site is not for profit and educational in purpose, some of the historical artefacts fit the definition of \"pornographic\u2019\" and are thereby liable to fall foul of the new laws. \n \n Thank you for your work in disproving that human, namely female sexuality is just some modern moral shortcoming. \u2014 Tiffany (@duafe) July 21, 2016 \n \n And I\u2019m not the only one; erotic artists, photographers, nude models, writers, sex shops, sex education sites, burlesque sites, BDSM sites, archivists of vintage erotica, and (of course) anyone in the adult industry who markets their business with a website, can all be termed pornographic and forced to buy expensive software to screen their users or risk being shut down or fined. I have contacted the BBFC to ask if my research will be criminalised and blocked, but was told \"work in this area has not yet begun and so we are not in a position to advice [sic] you on your website\". No one is able to tell me what software will need to be purchased if I am to collect viewers' credit card details, how I would keep them safe, or how much this would all cost. The BBFC suggested I contact my MP for further details.

Will blocking research projects like mine make children any safer? Well, no. The laws will have no power over social media sites such as Twitter, Snapchat and Periscope which allow users to share pornographic images. Messenger apps will still allow users to sext, as well as stream, send and receiving pornographic images and videos. Any tech savvy teenager knows that Virtual Private Network (VPN) software will circumvent UK age verification restrictions, and the less tech savvy can always steal their parents' credit card details. \n \n The proposed censorship is unworkable and many sites containing nudity will be caught in the crossfire. If we want to keep our children \"safe\" from online pornography, we need to do something we British aren\u2019t very good at doing; we need to talk openly and honestly about sex and porn. This is a conversation I hope projects like mine can help facilitate. Last year, Pornhub (the biggest porn site in the world) revealed ten years of user data. In 2016, Brits visited Pornhub over 111 million times and 20 per cent of those UK viewers are women. We are watching porn and we need to be open about this. We need to talk to each other and we need to talk to our kids. If you\u2019re relying on government censorship to get you out of that tricky conversation, you are letting your children down. \n \n The NSPCC report into children watching online pornography directly asked the participants about the effectiveness of age verification, and said the children \"pointed out its limitations\". When asked what intervention would most benefit them, this was the overwhelming response: \"Whether provided in the classroom, or digitally, young people wanted to be able to find out about sex and relationships and about pornography in ways that were safe, private and credible.\" I suggest we listen to the very people we are trying to protect and educate, rather than eliminate. \n \n Dr Kate Lister researches the history of sexuality at Leeds Trinity University"], "summary": "\u2013 Kisspeptin, a naturally occurring hormone that kicks off puberty and is thought to fuel what the Telegraph describes as the \"voracious sexual appetites of young people,\" could well be a sort of \"mental Viagra\" for people with psychosexual disorders\u2014that is, disorders that are psychological as opposed to physical. And because these disorders can occur in patients who are infertile, researchers from Imperial College London report in the Journal of Clinical Investigation that kisspeptin could even play a role in helping couples struggling to conceive. The early-stage study began to lay the groundwork for that theory by testing how kisspeptin affects the brain's responses to sexual situations. To achieve this, researchers injected kisspeptin or a placebo into 29 healthy young men, explains a press release. When shown arousing images, MRI scans of the kisspeptin group revealed enhanced activity in brain regions associated with arousal compared to the placebo group. There was no such activity observed when non-sexual romantic images were shown. The lead author notes that most research and treatments for infertility focus on important biological factors, but that emotional processing is also key and \"only partially understood.\" Next up, they plan to expand the study's size and include women.

Shortly before 10 p.m., the fundraising page had met its $25,000 goal. \n \n In a neighborhood full of Muslim immigrant families, the Hassanens\u2019 modest Reston apartment was the one overflowing with friends and laughter most days, friends said Sunday. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a family where if you\u2019re feeling down and you need to laugh, this is where you go,\u201d said Samar Ali, 26, who grew up in the Hassanens\u2019 apartment complex. \n \n On Sunday night, that apartment normally filled with laughter was crammed with more than 30 women in traditional Muslim garb, sobbing and comforting one another. At the center of the crowded, dimly lit living room was Nabra\u2019s mother, Sawsan Gazzar. \n \n \u201cPlease pray for me, please pray for me,\u201d Gazzar sobbed in Arabic. Her phone rang constantly. To her brother and sister in her native Egypt, she said, \u201cPray for me that I can handle this . . . I lost my daughter, my first reason for happiness.\u201d \n \n The night before, Gazzar had cooked a feast for Nabra, the oldest of her four daughters, who wanted to host a big iftar break-the-fast dinner for all her friends from ADAMS and South Lakes High School, where she just finished 10th grade. \n \n The iftar was packed \u2014 Nabra was always popular and sociable. And when it ended, a friend\u2019s mom drove some of the teens to ADAMS for the midnight prayers that mark the last 10 days of Ramadan. Family members said she frequented the mosque during Ramadan. \n \n And during the holy month, the mosque was filled with teens like her. \n \n Gazzar said she thought Nabra and her friends would eat at the mosque after the prayers, and she would have forbidden her from walking to IHOP in the middle of the night. But she also wasn\u2019t surprised that the girl went out; she and other teens had done it safely last year. \n \n Other mothers in the apartment Sunday night echoed the same thought repeatedly \u2014 they and their children had always felt safe taking the sidewalk path to IHOP or McDonald\u2019s for a fun meal on those final Ramadan nights. \n \n Gazzar loaned her daughter an abaya to wear to the mosque Saturday night, since Nabra didn\u2019t typically wear traditional Muslim clothes. She heard from a detective that when the man in the car started shouting at the teens, Nabra tripped over the long garment and fell to the ground, just before she was struck. \n \n \u201cI think it had to do with the way she was dressed and the fact that she\u2019s Muslim,\u201d Gazzar said. \u201cWhy would you kill a kid? What did my daughter do to deserve this?\u201d \n \n Nabra was a diligent student, so much so that although she was extremely proud to get her first job ever at a McDonald\u2019s, she quit when her manager didn\u2019t understand that studying for a school exam took priority over a work shift. Family members were quick to note her interest in fashion and makeup, and her recently acquired nose ring. \n \n All four Hassanen girls were born in the United States \u2014 the younger ones are 11, 10 and 3. Ali described Nabra as a \u201cdaddy\u2019s girl\u201d who was close with her father, a bus-and-limo driver. Her father spent Sunday at the mosque, Ali said, beside himself with worry all day. \n \n Gazzar\u2019s phone rang yet again, and this time she didn\u2019t answer. She turned instead to the hundreds of photos stored on it, scrolling through them until she landed on one of Nabra visiting her parents\u2019 homeland in Egypt, laughing as she embraced two of the teen\u2019s little sisters. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019d all be laughing. They used to be really happy.\u201d \n \n She gazed into the girls\u2019 eyes, and cried harder. \n \n Correction: An earlier version of this report incorrectly stated the number of Muslim girls who were being harassed in Portland.

We\u2019re going to fight for real solutions to make a difference in people\u2019s lives.\u201d \n \n But the New Hampshire results were so convincing that the race was called as soon as the last polls in the state closed, and Sanders supporters were still making their way into Concord High School for his watch party. Cheers erupted and music blared when TVs showed him as the winner. \n \n \"Nine months ago, if you told somebody that we would win the New Hampshire primary, they would not have believed you,\" Sanders wrote in a fundraising appeal to supporters asking for $3 a pop. \"Not at all. Too bold, they would have said. Not enough money to compete against the billionaires. You showed them tonight.\" \n \n In her own message to supporters, Clinton wrote that she \"[wished] tonight had gone differently.\" \n \n \n \n \"But I know what it's like to be knocked down -- and I've learned from long experience that it's not whether you get knocked down that matters. It's about whether you get back up,\" she wrote. \n \n The Clinton campaign released a separate memo Tuesday evening mapping out the candidate's way forward. \n \n \"The nomination will very likely be won in March, not February, and we believe that Hillary Clinton is well positioned to build a strong \u2013 potentially insurmountable \u2013 delegate lead next month,\" campaign manager Robby Mook wrote in the memo, which touted the importance of next month and Super Tuesday in particular. \n \n The campaign also emphasized Clinton's strength among Hispanic and African American voters, as well as her broader appeal beyond Iowa and New Hampshire. \n \n \"Additionally, as the campaign moves to states with a heavier presence of military personnel and veterans, Sen. Sanders should expect renewed questions about his foreign policy proposals and preparedness to be Commander-in-Chief,\" Mook wrote, also pointing to the campaign's \"data-driven operation\" to get out the vote in the months to come. \n \n \"We believe that Hillary\u2019s unique level of strength among African Americans, Hispanics, women and working families of all backgrounds \u2013 combined with the most data-driven and targeted campaign ever waged \u2013 will net the delegates in March needed to put her on a clear path to the nomination,\" he wrote in the memo. \n \n Exit poll data from NBC News suggested that 55 percent of primary voters had made up their mind before last month, while just 23 percent said they had waited until the last few days. CNN's exit poll data showed similar results. \n \n Earlier Tuesday, Devine told MSNBC's \"MTP Daily\" that the margin of victory was important. \n \n \u201cYes, I mean I think if we have a substantial victory, that will help us even more,\" he said, noting the importance of bringing in younger and independent voters.\"I think that\u2019s an important case that we\u2019d want to prove,\" he added. \n \n Moments earlier, Mook told Chuck Todd that their operation is prepared for an \"uphill climb\" after Tuesday's primary. \n \n Eight years ago, after a humbling third-place Iowa finish, Clinton staged a come-from-behind win in New Hampshire that rescued her campaign. This time, Clinton eked out a win in Iowa, but New Hampshire never looked nearly as kind to her. \n \n For his part, Sanders achieved a bit of history with his victory, becoming the first Jewish candidate to win a primary, something that previous contenders such as Joe Lieberman, Arlen Specter and Milton Shapp were unable to achieve. \n \n The high stakes for both sides in the first-in-the-nation primary have been on glaring display all week long. \n \n In their first head-to-head debate last Thursday in Durham, New Hampshire, the two candidates dropped the comity of the first four debates for a bruising, two-hour rumble. In one memorable clash, Sanders attacked Clinton over her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs; Clinton responded that her rival was leveling a \"very artful smear\" of corruption against her: \"Enough is enough,\" she admonished. \"If you've got something to say, say it.\" \n \n Since then, though, Clinton has been on the defensive. After being asked at the debate whether she would release transcripts of her paid speeches, at first she said that she would \"look into\" it, but then struck a less amenable tone. \u201cLet everybody who\u2019s ever given a speech to any private group under any circumstances release them,\u201d Clinton told ABC. \u201cWe\u2019ll all release them at the same time.\u201d \n \n Generational and gender tensions between the two candidates' supporters grew more pronounced over the weekend. Feminist icon Gloria Steinem declared to Bill Maher that young women are only supporting Sanders because \"the boys are with Bernie,\" then later apologized. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, a Clinton surrogate, trotted out her maxim, \"There\u2019s a special place in hell for women who don\u2019t help each other.\" Sanders disavowed a group of supporters calling themselves \"Berniebros,\" saying, \"Anybody who is supporting me and doing sexist things, we don't want them.\" \n \n Former President Bill Clinton got into the act, too, denouncing Sanders (without mentioning him by name) as \"the champion of all things small and the enemy of all things big.\u201d \n \n Clinton had tried to tamp down expectations, saying some pundits have argued she would have been better off skipping the state. On Saturday, both candidates took brief detours from campaigning in the state: Clinton went to Flint, Michigan, to address the water crisis; Sanders traveled to New York City for a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit with his spot-on impersonator, Larry David. \n \n Gabriel Debenedetti contributed reporting from Concord, New Hampshire.", "AP Photo Trump: 'We are going to win so much' \n \n Donald Trump was magnanimous in declaring victory Tuesday night \u2014 but all signs of his immediate post-Iowa humility were gone. \n \n Instead, he was back to boasting about \"winning\" and pledging to make American great again, while taking slams at Democratic winner Bernie Sanders and totally ignoring Hillary Clinton. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n \u201cWe are going to start winning again and we are going to win so much,\" Trump said at his victory party in Manchester, two hours after news outlets declared him the victor in the New Hampshire GOP primary. \"You are going to be so happy.\u201d \n \n He immediately blasted Sanders, who had given his own victory speech just before him. \n \n \u201cI heard parts of Bernie\u2019s speech,\" Trump said. \"He wants to give away our country, folks.\u201d \n \n But Trump also struck populist notes similar to those Sanders had sounded, trumpeting what he called his self-funded campaign and his independence from lobbyists and special interests. \u201cI think one of the things that really caught on \u2014 self-funding my campaign,\u201d Trump said. \n \n \u201cWe are now going to make [deals] for your benefit,\" he added. \"We are going to make the deals for the American people.\u201d \n \n Trump never mentioned Clinton, who trailed Sanders by more than 20 points with more than three-quarters of the results in. \n \n He nodded only obliquely to his second-place finish in Iowa behind Ted Cruz. \n \n \"You know, we learned a lot about ground games in one week, I have to tell you,\u201d he said. \n \n Trump acted the part of the GOP front-runner at the start of his speech, thanking Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and congratulating the Republicans who had finished far behind him \u2014 though he quickly moved on. \u201cNow that I got that over with...,\u201d he said. \n \n Trump reiterated many of the campaign pledges he's been making for months: rebuilding the military, taking care of veterans, protecting the Second Amendment and building a wall on the Mexican border. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re going to build a wall,\" he said. \"It\u2019s going to be built. Believe it or not, it\u2019s not even a difficult thing to do.\u201d \n \n He pledged to be \"the greatest jobs president that God ever created\" and cast doubt on the official unemployment rate of 4.9 percent, suggested that the real unemployment rate could be as high as 42 percent. \n \n Trump thanked his parents, his siblings, his wife and his children, as well as his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks. \n \n He said his wife, Melania, \"said right from the beginning, 'You know, if you run you know you\u2019re going to win.'\u201d \n \n With 76 percent of the vote counted in the GOP primary, Trump was leading with 34 percent of the vote.

{"document": ["Mark Cuban found himself on the sidelines of controversy last month, when the NBA banned Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling for life over racist comments. Now in a video interview with Inc., Cuban weighs in on what he does to combat the bigotry and racism he comes across as a manager and an owner. \n \n That\u2019s an internal battle as well, he acknowledges: \"If I see a black kid in a hoodie and it\u2019s late at night, I\u2019m walking to the other side of the street. And if on that side of the street, there\u2019s a guy that has tattoos all over his face--white guy, bald head, tattoos everywhere--I\u2019m walking back to the other side of the street,\" he says. \n \n \u201cI know that I\u2019m not perfect,\u201d he adds. \u201cWhile we all have our prejudices and bigotries, we have to learn that it\u2019s an issue that we have to control, that it\u2019s part of my responsibility as an entrepreneur to try to solve it, not just to kick the problem down the road.\u201d \n \n Last month, the often-outspoken Cuban condemned Sterling's comments as \"abhorrent\" and \"obviously racist.\" He initially opposed calls to ban Sterling from the NBA, saying it would be a \"very slippery slope\" if the league forced an owner to sell the team.", "It's not the first time and probably won't be the last. \n \n Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is not shy about voicing his opinion - even when it comes to sensitive subjects. His comments about having his own prejudices and being a bigot in some ways, made during Inc. Magazine\u2019s GROWCO 2014 conference, sparked a lot of national reaction on social media Thursday. \n \n Here's a sampling: \n \n The Daily Beast: But here\u2019s what I know: the only way to address Cuban\u2019s biases, and the views of millions of others who think like him, is to create a space where those views can be heard. Conversely, the way we get the Donald Sterlings of tomorrow is by shutting up the Mark Cubans of today. If the misguided views that each of us hold about other groups are allowed to fester in the dark, they will become more caustic, bitter. \n \n The Smoking Section: I can\u2019t help but think this is just a well thought out attempt to push NBA Commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s buttons. This is strictly hypothesis but Cuban is too smart so just get caught up in the middle of an interview saying something semi-racist. I bet Cuban is sitting back and enjoying how uncomfortable he\u2019s probably made Silver today. \n \n Washington Post: Is Cuban right? Is everyone a little bit racist? Anthony G. Greenwald, professor of psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle: \"He\u2019s not alone. People who regard themselves as fair and unbiased nevertheless can engage in judgments and actions that are biased in ways that they don\u2019t even recognize. What\u2019s unusual about Mark Cuban in this case is that he recognizes it.\" \n \n Mediaite: Don Lemon and Marc Lamont Hill had very different reactions to Cuban. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the controversy really,\u201d Lemon said. \u201cI think he was very honest. And I think we cannot have it both ways where we say we have to talk about race, we have to talk about race. And the moment someone like Mark Cuban, who is known not to be a racist, who doesn\u2019t have racist history, is honest about race, we want to shut him up.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll still call him racist, though,\u201d Hill chimed in. \n \n Orlando Sentinel: What\u2019s the world coming to when you can\u2019t even be honest and forthright about societal issues without being barbecued by the racial riot patrol? Because Cuban had the gall to state the truth \u2014 that he is sometimes fearful of tatted-up white skinheads and young black men wearing gangsta hoodies \u2014 he has ludicrously been labeled a racist by some. I wonder if the people who call Cuban a racist would say Jesse Jackson is also a racist? \n \n Fox News Radio: He (Cuban) has tried to defend himself, but it is of little use. Once you admit to expressing fear of a black kid in a hoodie, you are George Zimmerman, the kid is Trayvon Martin, and the case is closed. Who wants to suffer the consequences now facing Mark Cuban because he thought an honest conversation on race was what the country wanted and needed. \n \n Atlanta Falcons defensive end Osi Umenyiora on Twitter: Guess what Mark Cuban? If i see a black man wearing a hoodie in the middle of the night, I'm crossing the street also! We all have prejudices. That's just being honest. It's how we address them that seperates us. \n \n Boston.com: Taken out of context, the quote about Cuban crossing the street would seem to put him at risk of suffering the same backlash Sterling did. Watch the entire interview, however, and it becomes clear Cuban is trying to articulate the internal battle with bigotry we all face. By admitting his feelings, albeit in a slightly awkward way, Cuban is trying to start a conversation on the issues at play here. It's jarring, yes, but probably also necessary. \n \n Sports.yahoo.com: By calling out his own misguided thoughts though, Cuban offered an example that others, undoubtedly, have also engaged. Perhaps it allows them to see the mistake the way he has. Either way, this is a far better country when people are capable of acknowledging the areas they need to grow and try to speak openly and honestly about it, than one in which they are absurdly too afraid to say even innocent, descriptive words, even in private conversations about positive topics. \n \n Bill Plaschke of the Los Angeles Times: Cuban\u2019s words drift far too close to Donald Sterling for comfort. By acknowledging a fear of a \u201cblack kid in a hoodie \u2026 late at night,\u201d Cuban is admitting he would be wary of many of his own players and fans simply because of their skin color and wardrobe. He is essentially saying he would be fearful of honor students walking to their cars on a chilly Dallas night if they were black and wearing sweat shirts. \n \n Foxsports.com: God love Mark Cuban for being an NBA owner who didn't see the ongoing Donald Sterling mushroom cloud and think, \"You know what, maybe I'll avoid talking about race today in a business interview. Maybe it's not the right time to talk about who I cross the street to avoid. Maybe it's not the right time to admit that I sometimes judge people based on what they look like.\" Nope, Mark Cuban saw all this controversy and thought, \"Now's the perfect time for me to talk about race in America today.\" \n \n Former NFL punter Chris Kluwe in a video on foxsports.com: \"To Mark Cuban I say, thank you for saying what we all know. But use a little bit more context next time. Hopefully people will understand that this is a quote that has to be taken in context because we know Mark Cuban isn't a bigot. We know Mark Cuban isn't prejudiced and the point he's making is a good one: We all have that little voice. We all need to understand that acting on that little voice is what defines us as people. So remember, don't act on that little voice. It leads to bad things.\" \n \n ESPN host Stephen A. Smith: \"I took no issue whatsoever with what Mark Cuban said ... not only because he was forthright, very candid and honest ... but also he happens to be correct.\" \n \n \n \n Businessinsider.com: Mark Cuban's controversial interview during Inc.'s GrowCo conference has led to a lot of intense debate on race and prejudice and whether Cuban's remarks went too far. But the comments also suggest the NBA may have a bigger problem than just dealing with Cuban's remarks. Cuban's comments may be an indication that NBA owners are not unified behind commissioner Adam Silver's efforts to oust Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling. \n \n NewYorker.com: Most of the attention has been paid to Cuban\u2019s candid discussion of his own prejudices\u2014and of his examples of people he crosses the street to avoid. But it is worth considering what Cuban says, a moment earlier in the interview, about the progress that has been made by minority communities in America: \"We\u2019ve come a long way, and with that progress comes a price.\" The word that stands out here is \u201cprice,\u201d as if by working toward a more inclusive and tolerant society we have lost something important. But just what might that be? The right for people to lean on archaic religious arguments to excuse modern injustices toward gay people? Or for Donald Sterling to reserve the right to go on living in some combination of the eighteen-fifties and the nineteen-fifties?

More than an hour later, after Cuban had touched on everything from what the Sharks of Shark Tank are really like off camera and why he thinks of himself as a bigot, it's clear no such agreement was necessary. \n \n In case you missed the streamed interview live with the outspoken uber-entrepreneur, here are some of the highlights. \n \n On whether he was destined to be a billionaire \n \n \"Oh, hell no. I make sure I don't pinch myself so I don't wake up. All the time I say to myself, why me? Some things are random.\" \n \n On his first entrepreneurial venture \n \n Cuban is best known for his tech companies, but his first business was decidedly low tech. As a junior in college--and at the age of 20--he took his student loan money and bought a nearby campus bar. It quickly became the hottest spot in the area because it was notorious for not really checking IDs. Everything went swimmingly until the bar held a wet T-shirt contest. When the local newspapers covered the event, they eventually ID'd one of the contestants as a 16-year-old girl. \"But she was on probation for prostitution! That got us closed down,\" Cuban said. \n \n On how he made his billions \n \n Cuban's first big startup success was an early software company called Micro Solutions, which he started for $500 and sold seven years later for $6 million. \"I learned to party like a rock star,\" Cuban says. (That's when he traded his lifetime airline pass and bought a private plane for $41 million--still the record for the largest purchase ever online.) \n \n But Cuban hit it even bigger with Audio Net, a startup that figured out how to stream audio online before the internet really even had audio or video. It involved encoding an eight-hour VCR tape and streaming replays of radio casts to see if anyone really cared. It turns out people did care--a lot. \"It was like the YouTube of the start of the internet. Soon they had deals with radio stations and sports teams. In 1999, at the height of the internet bubble, Cuban sold the company to Yahoo for $5.7 billion. \n \n On why bought the Mavericks when it was a losing franchise \n \n When Cuban picked up the Dallas Mavericks, they had been voted the worst team in the league. But Cuban, a self-professed \"basketball junkie,\" was a season ticket holder. He went to the first game of the 1999-2000 season and it didn't sell out. \"We were undefeated--it was the first game of the season. That's the time to be excited.\" But fans were not. \n \n So Cuban bought the team and immediately set out to change the culture. \"I had to explain to the team and to the NBA what business we were in,\" he says. \"It's not the basketball business. It's the business of creating experiences and memories.\" \n \n On whether the NBA was right to ban Clippers owner Donald Sterling for his racist remarks \n \n \"I think [NBA commissioner] Adam [Silver] had to do it. There's a lot at stake for the NBA--it has to be a leader in the culture... but it's a slippery slope. \n \n \n \n \"You can't keep that ugliness out of the league. There's no law against stupid--I learned that a long time ago,\" Cuban said. \n \n Cuban also admitted that prejudice is something everyone has to fight. \"I know I'm bigoted in a lot of different ways. If I see a black kid in a hoodie and it's late at night, I'm walking to the other side of the street. And if on that side of the street, there's a guy that has tattoos all over his face--white guy, bald head, tattoos everywhere--I'm walking back to the other side of the street,\" he says. \"No one has pure thoughts... but it's about recognizing when you have thoughts that aren't right.\" (For an exclusive interview where Cuban elaborates, check out this Inc. video.) \n \n On what he would do about patent laws \n \n \"I'd get rid of software patents altogether.\" \n \n On what he's like as a boss \n \n \"I'm a dick. Ha. Not really... I micromanage you until I trust you. It a back and forth continually... If I send you 30 emails I expect quick responses and direct action. Then we'll go to weekly reports. And I want the bad news first. I want to read, 'God dammit, we lost this sale.' I want to know the setbacks so that I can help you.\" \n \n On what the Sharks are really like off camera \n \n \"People expect them to be the same off camera. Kevin is a jerk on camera, but he's an even bigger jerk off camera. He has his own way of doing business... There's a lot of tension on air... After 10 hour days and 10 days of shooting, you really feel like you want to knock this motherf*cker out.\" \n \n On his weaknesses"], "summary": "\u2013 Here's a sign that your disquisition on race didn't go very well: You wind up apologizing to Trayvon Martin's family. That's the position Mark Cuban found himself in yesterday, after a perhaps-too-candid talk at Inc. magazine's GrowCo conference the day prior. Asked about the Donald Sterling controversy, the Dallas Mavericks owner said he was worried about being a hypocrite. The money quote, which he said in roughly these terms at the conference and reiterated in this video interview with Inc.: \"I know I'm bigoted in a lot of different ways.

Critics and supporters have been vigorously decrying and defending Cuban's remarks (there's a good sample at the Dallas Morning News). Many, including ESPN commentator Bomani Jones and CNN commentator LZ Granderson, jumped on Cuban for making a false equivalency between black men in hoodies and white men with tattoos. \"One has history and the other doesn't, or the same sort of emotional response,\" Granderson said. Later Cuban conceded that point at least, in a series of tweets: \"In hindsight I should have used different examples. I didn't consider the Trayvon Martin family, and I apologize to them for that.

{"document": ["House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., left, accompanied by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nev., speaks to reporters outside the West Wing of the White House in Washington, Thursday, Sept.... (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Seeking to avert a government shutdown, Republican leaders drove a bill blocking Planned Parenthood's federal funds through the House on Friday, hoping to contain conservatives' demands for a politically risky showdown with President Barack Obama by striking a quick blow against abortion. \n \n The nearly party-line 241-187 vote followed a no-holds-barred debate that included a graphic, poster-sized photo of a scarred, aborted fetus and underscored how abortion has resurfaced as a white-hot political issue. The battle has been rejoined just in time for the 2016 election campaign and next week's historic address to Congress by Pope Francis. \n \n The issue's re-emergence followed the release of secretly recorded videos of Planned Parenthood officials offhandedly discussing how they sometimes procure tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research. \n \n \"What does it say about this Congress that today we're here on the House floor debating the killing and harvesting of aborted babies?\" said Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind. \"How can there possibly be two sides to this?\" \n \n But Democrats said the true GOP goal was to whip up conservative voters with legislation that would make it harder for women to get health care. Planned Parenthood, whose clinics provide sexual disease tests, contraception and abortion, says it's done nothing illegal and is being victimized by misleadingly edited videos. \n \n \"Enough is enough,\" said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who chairs the Democratic National Committee. \"Some of their members are willing to risk women's lives just to score political points.\" \n \n Planned Parenthood gets around $450 million yearly in federal payments, mostly Medicaid reimbursements for handling low-income patients. That's around one-third of the organization's $1.3 billion annual budget. Practically none of the federal money can be used for abortions. \n \n Beyond Friday's bill, some conservatives want to attach language halting Planned Parenthood's payments to broader legislation financing government agencies, which otherwise run out of money next Thursday. Those Republicans say a government shutdown fight would at least produce a veto battle that would show voters where Republicans stand. \n \n House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, a long-time abortion foe, and virtually all House Republicans favor halting the flow of federal dollars to Planned Parenthood. But Boehner and other GOP leaders say a shutdown battle would be fruitless because they lack enough votes to prevail in the Senate or overcome an Obama veto. They also say voters oppose a shutdown and would punish the GOP in next year's elections if one occurred. \n \n Long unhappy with Boehner and other GOP leaders for not being confrontational enough, some in his party have threatened to force a House vote on removing him from his post if he backs down on this or other upcoming fights over federal borrowing and spending. \n \n The legislation that was voted on Friday, proposed by Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., would end federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year, diverting the money to thousands of community health centers. Republicans say those clinics could handle the displaced Planned Parenthood patients, but Democrats say the centers are overburdened and sometimes distant. \n \n Pressure from conservatives may ultimately force leaders to let Congress vote anyway on a bill that would avert a shutdown only if Planned Parenthood's federal dollars were stopped, a measure certain to die in the Senate. Once defeated, that would likely be followed by a measure temporarily financing government, perhaps into December, that would include Planned Parenthood funds and buy time to resolve disputes over spending, abortion and other issues. \n \n For now, Republican leaders are hoping that investigations by four congressional committees and other anti-abortion bills will relieve some of the pressure. \n \n Along those lines, the House voted 248-177 Friday for another measure, this one by Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., that would impose penalties of up to five years in prison plus fines on doctors who don't try to save infants born alive during abortions. \n \n And the Senate set a vote for Tuesday on a measure banning most late-term abortions, a bill that Democrats were poised to scuttle. Both of those bills also would face likely Senate defeat and an Obama veto threat. \n \n In Friday's House debate, both sides showed they had plenty of steam on the issue. \n \n Franks, who brought the fetus poster to the floor, said Congress' response to the Planned Parenthood videos \"is vital to everything those lying out in Arlington Cemetery died to save.\" \n \n And House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., asked, \"In the face of these videos, with all the alternatives women have for health, why would you want to force your constituents to pay for something so evil?\" \n \n Firing back, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., said Republicans' were relying on deceptively edited videos and had \"manufactured a witch hunt.\" Added Rep. Sam Farr, D-Calif., \"Stop being so mean. Solve problems, do not create them.\"", "The same Republicans who campaigned on doing away with legislative crises are careening toward government shutdown in less than two weeks with still no concrete plan to stop it. \n \n It\u2019s not that Speaker John Boehner\u2019s (R-Ohio) leadership team is hiding their best hand. They have no trick up their sleeve, no ace in the hole \u2014 pick your clich\u00e9. Nearly everyone in House and Senate leadership recognizes a simple reality: At some point in the next two weeks, they will move on a bill free of provisions to strip Planned Parenthood of its government funding. It just depends how long it takes, how painful it is and whether Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s (R-Ky.) team stumbles into their second government shutdown in three years. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Twelve days remain until the government runs out of money, but the House and Senate are scheduled to be in session for just a fraction of that time. The showdown over Planned Parenthood is the epitome of crisis-fueled legislating. Senior Republican lawmakers and aides increasingly believe that the funding fight will come down to three-day dash \u2013 Sept. 28 through Sept. 30, the final day of the fiscal year. \n \n Asked Wednesday when his colleagues would get a glimpse at his bill to fund the government, Boehner said, \u201cAt some point.\u201d \n \n Several House Republicans lawmakers said they don't expect to vote before the week of Sept. 30. The House is only scheduled to be in session three days that week before the government runs out of money. \n \n To top it off, the endgame will almost certainly result in a referendum on Boehner\u2019s speakership. He's favored, but not guaranteed, to survive. But if he does it will be in a further weakened state. \n \n The path the funding fight will take is not yet clear to either Boehner or McConnell, according to senior aides to both men. But it\u2019s shaping up to be extraordinarily messy. \n \n Top aides to McConnell and Boehner have been in close contact, discussing who will move first to pass a funding bill in their chamber. But the House has been paralyzed with indecision. A pack of House Republicans \u2013 mostly on Steve Scalise\u2019s (R-La.) whip team \u2013 are worried about the expectations that will be set by passing a funding bill that strips funding from Planned Parenthood, only to relent in the end. Yet other forces in the conference want a vote on such a continuing resolution \u2013 and it\u2019s possible, yet hardly certain, that GOP leadership will set one up for next week. \n \n House Republicans want to be first to move a funding bill, but McConnell is setting up his own process \u2013 a sign of how slow the House has been to take action. \n \n McConnell is nearly certain to bring up a so-called CR to fund the government next week that includes the language to defund Planned Parenthood, but Democrats will block its consideration. McConnell will then move a funding bill free of legislative riders. Republican leaders believe conservatives, like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) will block it, but McConnell will be able to send it to the House by Sept. 29 at the latest. The Senate's plan could be put on hold if the House gets its act togther, aides caution. \n \n The House is also trying to send other anti-abortion measures to Obama\u2019s desk and are considering standalone bills, including one to defund Planned Parenthood that would ride alongside the government funding bill, but not impede its passage in the Senate. If the House hasn\u2019t passed a \"clean\" bill by Sept. 29, it will have one day to avoid a government shutdown by passing the Senate\u2019s bill, or a comparable measure. \n \n \u201cAt some point in time you have to face reality,\u201d said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), a member of the Appropriations Committee who is close to Boehner, speaking about the need to pass a clean bill. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh, you didn't even try to do x.\u2019 There are some things you can't do. We tried to repeal Obamacare 50-some odd times in the House and guess what? It didn't work. We probably should have figured that out after two or three.\u201d \n \n House Republican leaders, meanwhile, are working behind the scenes to try to calm the troops. McCarthy and Scalise have privately told Republicans that they will try to use the majority-vote reconciliation process to deny funding to the women\u2019s health group \u2014 they say that is the best way to get a bill to President Barack Obama's desk. GOP leaders have urged anti-abortion groups to speak out against a shutdown. \n \n At a closed party-wide meeting at the Capitol Hill Club on Thursday morning, GOP leaders presented lawmakers with an internal National Republican Congressional Committee poll showing overwhelming public opposition to shutting down the government to stop funding Planned Parenthood. The poll, conducted in 18 swing districts by the GOP firm The Tarrance Group, showed 64 percent of respondents would not favor a shutdown to try to stop the organization\u2019s federal funding, compared to 30 percent who favor shutting the government. Among those who had seen videos allegedly showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing fetal tissue sales, 55 percent did not favor a shutdown, while 37 percent thought it was the right move. \n \n \u201cWe want to be more strategic because I think we are on more solid ground right now than we have before in raising these issues,\u201d Rep. John Shimkus said (R-Ill.), who has a long record opposing abortion rights. \u201cBut there are some that say, 'Not a penny.' So, leadership is trying to work it out.\u201d \n \n While much of this fight is about the government\u2019s purported support of abortion, there\u2019s a hefty anti-Boehner sentiment that\u2019s spurring the opposition to the leadership\u2019s plans. After Congress clears a clean government-funding bill, Boehner and McCarthy aides expect a hard-line conservative to put forward a motion that would, if successful, force the Ohio Republican from the speaker\u2019s chair. \n \n Republican leaders do not expect the so-called motion to vacate, first filed by North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, to succeed. They say they would handily defeat it if it came to the floor. \"Team Boehner,\" as it is called internally, is not actively preparing for the vote by whipping support in the GOP conference. \n \n But some of his allies privately say they have informally secured assurances from Democrats that they would support keeping Boehner as speaker, or vote present, which would lower the vote threshold. If all Democrats voted present, Boehner could win with as few as 124 Republicans. Recently, Boehner has even told some Republicans privately he would like to run for another term as speaker. \n \n Those looking to oust Boehner have not put forward an alternative to serve as speaker, and senior GOP leadership aides say the hardliners have no alternative for when the Senate and president reject their plan to defund Planned Parenthood. For example, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said Florida Rep. Daniel Webster could be the next speaker because he got \u201c12 times as many votes as Kevin McCarthy.\u201d McCarthy did not campaign for the job earlier this year. Webster garnered 12 votes total. \n \n \u201cThe Sept. 30 crisis is a crisis of our leadership's making,\u201d Massie said. \u201cThey refuse to pass appropriations bills. Even the CR is not the way the government is supposed to be run. The American public knows that. What we need to do is get back to regular order.\u201d \n \n --John Bresnahan contributed to this report \n \n \n \n Authors:", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republicans pushed bills targeting Planned Parenthood and curbing some abortion procedures toward House passage Friday, with party leaders hoping the legislation will help mollify fractious conservatives demanding a face-off with President Barack Obama that could trigger a federal shutdown. \n \n Republican presidential candidate, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, speaks during the CNN Republican presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum on Wednesday, Sept. 16, 2015, in Simi... (Associated Press) \n \n House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., left, accompanied by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nev., speaks to reporters outside the West Wing of the White House in Washington, Thursday, Sept.... (Associated Press) \n \n Neither measure has much chance of becoming law, since Democrats have the votes to block them in the Senate and the White House has threatened vetoes. But Republicans pushed ahead anyway, citing secretly recorded videos showing Planned Parenthood officials casually describing how they provide researchers with tissue from aborted fetuses. \n \n One of the measures would block Planned Parenthood's federal funds for a year, while the other would inflict criminal penalties on doctors who don't try saving infants born alive during abortions. As Friday's debate raged, it underscored how the fight over abortion could affect next year's elections. It's an emotional hotspot among each side's most loyal partisans and could be pivotal as each party seeks female voters. \n \n Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., sponsor of the bill imposing criminal penalties on doctors, defended his legislation as he stood beside a poster-sized photo of a scarred, aborted fetus that survived. \n \n \"Our response as a people and a nation to these horrors shown in these videos is vital to everything those lying out in Arlington Cemetery died to save,\" Franks said. \n \n Democrats said Franks' measure was unneeded because clinicians allowing born-alive babies to die would face murder charges. They said the GOP legislation had other goals. \n \n \"It's real intent is to further undermine a woman's right to choose,\" said Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif. \n \n The anti-abortion activists who secretly recorded the videos say they show that Planned Parenthood is illegally profiting from organ sales. The organization says it's broken no laws and is being maligned by deceitfully edited recordings. \n \n The White House, in a statement released Thursday evening, said Obama called the shutdown threat \"a game of chicken with our economy that we cannot accept.\" \n \n It was unclear if House approval of the two bills would help House Speaker John Boehner solve a political Rubik's Cube. The Ohio Republican's twin goals: avoiding a shutdown fight that GOP leaders warn would set voters against the party, while simultaneously appeasing conservatives who might try to oust him as leader for not adequately confronting Obama. \n \n \"Our leaders wave the white flag every time there's a confrontation,\" said Rep. Mark Salmon, R-Ariz. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., said Boehner wants to \"implement what the lobbyists want, not what the constituents of our district want.\" \n \n At a closed meeting Thursday among House Republicans, leaders unveiled internal polling that attendees said showed most people would oppose a government shutdown \u2014 even those who have seen the videos and oppose financing Planned Parenthood. \n \n Many Republicans argued that the polling showed a shutdown fight would be damaging and unwinnable, especially since Senate Democrats already derailed a bill erasing Planned Parenthood's federal funds. \n \n \"Pounding on the table doesn't turn 54 into 60 in the Senate,\" said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., referring to the number of GOP senators and the number it would take to end Democratic filibusters. \n \n The bill by Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., would transfer Planned Parenthood's federal money to thousands of government-backed community health centers. Supporters say that would keep women's health care intact, but opponents say those centers are overwhelmed and often far from women who need them. \n \n Planned Parenthood gets around $450 million yearly in federal payments, mostly Medicaid reimbursements for handling low-income patients, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. That's around one-third of the $1.3 billion yearly budget for the organization, which has nearly 700 clinics and provides sexual disease testing, contraceptives and abortions. \n \n Conservatives' determination to block Planned Parenthood's money has been partly fueled by the race for the GOP's presidential nomination. Several candidates used their Wednesday night debate to urge lawmakers to turn off that funding spigot. \n \n But spotlighting GOP divisions, Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., wrote Thursday to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, one of the presidential hopefuls. Cruz wants Republicans to oppose financing the government unless Planned Parenthood's money is cut off, defending his effort during the debate by saying, \"I'm proud to stand for life.\" \n \n Ayotte, who faces her own tough re-election fight next year, wrote that she opposed risking a shutdown \"given the challenges and threats we face at home and abroad\" and asked, \"What is your strategy to succeed in actually defunding Planned Parenthood?\"", "President Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress want to pass a clean, stopgap bill to avert a government shutdown and allow negotiators more time to reach a long-term budget deal. \n \n Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) made the announcement after meeting at the White House with Obama and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to plot their strategy on the spending talks. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n Congress faces a Sept. 30 deadline to pass a spending bill before government funding runs out. \n \n The biggest hurdle? Demands from House conservatives that even a short-term continuing resolution (CR) funding the government block money for Planned Parenthood. \n \n \u201cThe three of us agree that we want a short-term CR,\u201d Reid told reporters after the 90-minute huddle in the Oval Office. \u201cWe want to make sure the riders are off that, we want to make sure the government will be running.\u201d \n \n The top Democrats sought to present a united front in the contentious budget battle, even as Reid and Pelosi extended an olive branch to their Republican counterparts, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Speaker John Boehner (Ohio), to sit down and hammer out a comprehensive budget agreement. \n \n Reid said that he is prepared \u201cto do something meaningful with spending\u201d on a broader funding deal after the short-term measure is passed. But he would not reveal how much additional spending he wants. \n \n Pelosi stressed that she wants spending talks to proceed in a \u201ctimely fashion\u201d so Congress can tackle other pressing issues, such as highway funding and a reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s important for us \u2026 to have not a very long CR, but one that enables us to have the time for the appropriators to write an omnibus bill,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sooner we can agree on a number under which we can write the appropriations bill, the sooner we can get this job done and address some of the other issues.\u201d \n \n Boehner and Pelosi met on Thursday to discuss a government funding bill, aides said. The meeting, which was first reported by Politico, lasted for about 20 minutes. \n \n Pelosi's lieutenant, Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), on Wednesday said Democrats had \"no idea\" how Republicans were going to avoid a shutdown because they hadn't been included in the discussions. \n \n Democrats have been demanding negotiations on next year\u2019s spending levels with Republicans, who are dealing with an internal rift over Planned Parenthood. \n \n After the release of a series of undercover videos that showed Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal tissue, conservative Republicans have insisted federal money for the organization must be turned off. \n \n McConnell has warned against a standoff over the issue, arguing it would hurt the GOP brand just as the 2013 shutdown over ObamaCare damaged the party. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re going to fund the government,\u201d McConnell told reporters Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to shut the government down and we will do that hopefully into late fall.\u201d \n \n But the Senate\u2019s No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn (Texas), said Thursday the Senate will at least vote on a defunding measure in relation to a government funding measure. \n \n In the House, Republican leaders are trying to convince the rank and file it would be unwise to risk a shutdown over defunding the organization. \n \n During a closed-door meeting Thursday, leaders showed members polling data indicating Republicans would be blamed if the government shuts down. \n \n Reid agreed that Republicans would bare the brunt of the damage. The Democratic leader said the GOP took control of the Senate last year in spite of, and not because of, the shutdown in 2013. \n \n \u201cThey know what happened last time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know they got a gift.\u201d \n \n If a short-term deal can be worked out, Congress will still have to work out the terms for a longer funding plan that would last through the next fiscal year. \n \n Democrats are demanding that any final deal lifts spending ceilings on defense and non-defense spending. Some Republicans are open to increasing the ceilings for defense, but most want to avoid any hike to non-defense spending. \n \n Peter Sullivan contributed. This story was last updated at 6:29 p.m.", "The U.S. House of Representatives voted Friday, Sept.18 to defund Planned Parenthood for a one-year period. The vote was 241-187, with nearly all Republicans and two Democrats supporting the legislation. (Reuters) \n \n This story has been updated. \n \n The House passed two abortion-related bills Friday, including one that would strip federal health-care funding from Planned Parenthood for one year, but it remains unclear whether the votes would appease conservatives who have threatened a government shutdown over the organization. \n \n The votes followed months of intense focus on Planned Parenthood prompted by undercover videos released by an activist group claiming they show violations of federal laws prohibiting the sales of fetal tissue for profit and restricting certain abortion procedures. Planned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing and claimed the videos have been unfairly manipulated as it has fought off attempts to end its federal support. \n \n But neither bill is likely to become law as Senate Democrats have filibustered similar measures, and President Obama has indicated he would veto both bills. \n \n That\u2019s why the move is unlikely to stave off growing fears of a government shutdown on Oct. 1. Since House conservatives know the bill to defund Planned Parenthood is unlikely to be enacted, they\u2019re unlikely to back off their desire to attach it to a must-pass government spending measure to keep the government open. But again, neither Senate Democrats nor Obama will accept such language, triggering the standoff. \n \n Nonetheless, House Republicans hoped to appease conservatives with the abortion-related votes. \n \n One bill passed Friday, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, would impose criminal penalties on medical personnel who fail to aid an infant born after an attempted abortion. The other, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act, imposes a one-year moratorium on federal funding for the group, which Republicans say will allow for a thorough investigation of its practices. Any funding, supporters said, would be redirected to clinics that do not offer abortions. \n \n Congress must pass a budget before Sept. 30, or it faces partially shutting down the government for the second time in two years. Here's how we got to another potential shutdown. (Jayne W. Orenstein/The Washington Post) \n \n [Wary of shutdown, GOP leaders try to refocus abortion debate] \n \n \u201cMost people think that is common sense,\u201d said Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.), sponsor of the defunding bill. \u201cIf there is reason to investigate, then there is reason to withhold taxpayer dollars during that period of time. The American taxpayer has been clear for a very long time that they do not want federal funds spent on abortion.\u201d \n \n Democrats pointed out that Planned Parenthood has long been prohibited from spending federal money on abortions, thanks to appropriations riders dating back to the 1970s. And in a floor debate Friday, they called the bill an attack on women\u2019s health care and noted that other health-care providers would be unable to absorb all of Planned Parenthood\u2019s hundreds of thousands of patients. \n \n \u201cThis bill is dumb, it\u2019s foolish, and it\u2019s mean-spirited,\u201d said Rep. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.). \u201cThe bill is based upon lies and exaggerations. If you want to have a truthful debate, then let\u2019s talk about the 400,000 Pap smears, the 500,000 breast exams, the 4.5 million STD and HIV tests that Planned Parenthood does each year.\u201d \n \n [Sign up for The Daily 202, The Washington Post\u2019s new political tipsheet] \n \n Planned Parenthood\u2019s affiliated clinics are together the country\u2019s largest provider of abortions. But they also perform other women\u2019s health and family planning services, which are funded through Medicaid and Title X federal grants totaling about $450 million a year. \n \n The organization decried the vote Friday. \u201cThese bills are a callous attempt to insert politics into women\u2019s health, and we\u2019re grateful that the Senate and the president will stop them from becoming law,\u201d said Eric Ferrero, a spokesman for the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. \n \n Republicans and Democrats sparred over the undercover videos, which have been released by the Center for Medical Progress over the course of the summer. Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) called them part of a \u201ccoordinated, broad-based smear campaign full of distortions and misinformation.\u201d Key context was edited out of the videos, she said, including footage of exculpatory comments from Planned Parenthood executives. \n \n During the second round of GOP debates, Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina said \"shame on us\" if lawmakers don't stop a bill from passing that funds Planned Parenthood. (CNN) \n \n But Republicans said the videos spoke for themselves and lambasted Democrats for trying to undermine their content: \u201cIf they want to send one taxpayer dime to Planned Parenthood after watching them, shame on them,\u201d said Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Tex.). \n \n The votes broke down mostly along party lines, with the Planned Parenthood bill passing 241 to 187 and the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act passing 248 to 177. \n \n While public attention has been focused on the Planned Parenthood bill, anti-abortion activists believe the vote on the survivor protection bill, sponsored by Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), could be even more politically significant in the long run. \n \n Democrats say current law is already sufficient to prevent the abuses that activists fear, and they pointed to objections from medical groups, such as the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which said the bill represents \u201cgross legislative interference into the practice of medicine.\u201d But activists believe those opponents have assumed an extreme position that could become a liability in future campaigns. \n \n \u201cThe votes this afternoon are evidence of just how wedded to the idea of abortion on-demand, at any time, for any reason, that the Democratic Party has become,\u201d said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, noting only five of 188 Democrats voted in favor. \u201cWhere is the compassion and concern for \u2018the little guy,\u2019 the abortion survivor, whose heart is beating and alive?\u201d \n \n The bills were brought to the House floor amid in order to create leverage with President Obama and congressional Democrats given the nearing deadline to fund the government. But neither have indicated a shutdown would force them to blink. \n \n The Senate took an August test vote on a Planned Parenthood defunding bill, which fell well short of the 60 votes necessary to advance controversial legislation. Senators are expected to take a procedural vote Tuesday on a bill banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy in a related effort to demonstrate the political hurdles facing any bill restricting abortion rights. \n \n On the House side, GOP leaders have sought to tamp down demands to link Planned Parenthood funding to the spending deadline. They have made both political and practical arguments: In a Thursday morning meeting at Republican National Committee headquarters, party leaders presented polling numbers showing Republicans would be blamed for a shutdown in key battleground districts. And they told members that due to the vagaries of federal appropriations and funding cycles, the kind of short-term funding bill that is likely to pass ahead of the Sept. 30 deadline would do little to affect Planned Parenthood. \n \n \u201cIn the short term, you might feel better, but the money\u2019s already out the door,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), an Appropriations Committee member and leadership ally. \u201cLet\u2019s do the hearings. Let\u2019s find out what the case is. Let\u2019s try to craft something that\u2019s a little more nuanced and precise than just, \u2018if you don\u2019t do what we want, we\u2019ll shut down the government.\u2019 \u201c"], "summary": "\u2013 Twelve days remain in the fiscal year, and the threat of a second government shutdown in three years remains very much in play. The big problem remains a showdown over funding for Planned Parenthood, with conservative Republicans who are upset about recent undercover videos demanding that the group lose all federal funds. With the clock ticking, party leaders still have \"no concrete plan\" to avoid the shutdown, reports Politico. One possibility is to pass a temporary measure before the end of the month to allow more time for negotiations in the fall, but that's not a slam dunk\u2014because House conservatives demand that even such a continuing resolution block Planned Parenthood funding, reports the Hill. They're also threatening to try to oust John Boehner\u2014who opposes abortion and Planned Parenthood but doesn't want to hand Democrats a potential gift in the form of a shutdown\u2014as speaker if he backs down. The AP sees a possible way out of what it calls this \"political Rubik's Cube.\" House leaders are pushing through a number of abortion-related measures, including one that passed today to defund Planned Parenthood for a year. The measures stand virtually no chance of becoming law, but leaders hope they will be enough to mollify the conservative rank-and-file. It \"remains unclear\" whether that will be the case, however, notes the Washington Post.

It was needed, former Mayor Ed Murray once said, for a host of noble reasons: to reduce sugar consumption; to raise revenue for important projects like a year of \u201cfree\u201d community college for all graduating public high school students; and, to subsidize purchases of healthy foods by low-income families. \n \n Before he resigned in disgrace over multiple allegations of personal misconduct, Murray considered the soda tax one of his greatest accomplishments, a \u201ccutting edge piece of legislation,\u201d with Seattle setting an example for the whole nation. \n \n Seattle policymakers should have paid more attention to what happened in Cook County, Ill., which repealed its soda tax last year within two months after a tremendous public outcry.

They don\u2019t help ease inequality\u2014they make the poor poorer. Soda taxes don\u2019t unite the city around some vague sense that everyone will be healthier\u2014they unite diverse coalitions in opposition to them: Bernie Sanders and libertarians, labor unions, and businesses all come together to express strong opposition to these regressive, job-killing taxes. \n \n Seattle\u2019s soda tax is particularly burdensome. A case of Gatorade that cost $15.99 on December 31, 2017 now costs $26.33, an increase of more than 64 percent. \n \n Fortunately, business managers and customers are not stupid; retailers like Costco have posted signs directing customers to locations outside city limits where shoppers can buy the product without paying the massive tax. Already, there is evidence that people are voting with their feet and buying drinks in the suburbs, depriving Seattle of the revenue it claims to need. The same thing happened to Philadelphia when it implemented a soda tax. \n \n Seattle\u2019s tax does not apply to sugary drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient, such as many flavored coffee beverages. To their credit, Starbucks rejected their hometown tax. \n \n The west coast is often ground zero for politicians who pride themselves on social engineering. In fact, a study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University released on January 3, 2018 revealed that three of the top five states with the most paternalistic laws are California, Oregon, and Washington.

Others think the tax is regressive, meaning it disproportionately affects low-income families. And still others question why the tax leaves out sugar-heavy beverages like many of those sold at Starbucks. \n \n \u201cMake it consistent. Apply it to every sugary drink. Apply it to fast food,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIf you want to actually start talking about health effects, let\u2019s actually have a conversation about that.

But Cook County retailers and restaurants, many of whom joined forces with Big Soda in opposition, also celebrated the win after seeing sales dwindle and customers stray across county lines since the tax was implemented Aug. 2. \n \n \u201cObviously, our members are very pleased,\u201d said Rob Karr, president and CEO of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association. \u201cNow the hard work for retailers begins \u2014 to win back shoppers who took their business elsewhere across county lines.\u201d \n \n The short-term impact of the tax was felt by stores both big and small. \n \n Costco\u2019s nine Cook County locations saw a 34 percent decline in sales of beverages affected by the tax, said John McKay, chief operating officer of Costco\u2019s northern division. \n \n The chain saw a corresponding increase of 38 percent in sales of sweetened beverages in its nine stores just outside Cook County, McKay said. \n \n \u201cYou\u2019re displacing shopping from one area, you\u2019re creating congestion in another and it\u2019s just counterproductive,\u201d McKay said. \n \n At Fairplay Foods in suburban Worth, sweetened beverage sales were down about 47 percent, said Rosie Regas, co-owner of the independent chain. Fairplay\u2019s three Chicago stores saw a smaller but still significant drop in sweetened drink sales of around 27 percent. \n \n Regas said she didn\u2019t blame customers for shopping elsewhere; she did the same, driving from her home in Orland Park into Will County to avoid the tax. \n \n \u201cThis was a nightmare. I get it \u2014 the county needs money. But find another way,\u201d Regas said. \n \n And the hospitality industry already has been feeling the cumulative burden of various taxes, said Sam Toia, CEO of the Illinois Restaurant Association. The sweetened beverage tax did nothing but further diminish already thin profit margins, he said. \n \n There are similar sweetened beverage taxes in other jurisdictions in the U.S. \u2014 such as Philadelphia and Berkeley, Calif. \u2014 but Cook County\u2019s tax was unique in how mired in controversy it was leading up to and during its implementation, said John Cawley, professor of policy analysis and management at Cornell University. \n \n At one point, the county said the the tax would apply to purchases made with federal food stamp benefits, then reversed course after receiving further guidance from the state, Cawley noted. Such administrative gaffes created genuine confusion and the well-funded opposition benefited, he said. \n \n \u201cThere were constant challenges that may have contributed to this fatigue. It\u2019s not just on the county government. Millions were spent by the beverage industry and the Can the Tax Coalition to engineer this result,\u201d Cawley said. \n \n The sweetened beverage tax also triggered numerous lawsuits, some of which are still playing out in court. The Illinois Retail Merchants Association sued the county to get the tax thrown out days before it was to take effect. The court granted a restraining order to keep the tax from being imposed. Later, however, the court allowed the tax to move forward. The merchants appealed that decision. \n \n \u201cThe appeal of the circuit court judge\u2019s dismissal is still pending,\u201d said lawyer David Ruskin, who is representing the merchants. \n \n Several retailers have been sued for allegedly misapplying the tax. A Schaumburg man is suing Walgreens for allegedly wrongly charging the tax on unsweetened sparkling water. The case, which seeks class-action status, is still pending, said Elizabeth Fegan, the lawyer for Vincent De Leon. \n \n \u201cWalgreens has filed a motion to dismiss, which we plan to oppose,\u201d Fegan said. \n \n Cawley, the Cornell professor, said there is a legitimate policy argument for taxing sugary food and beverages linked to obesity and diabetes because those conditions drive up health care costs for all. \n \n Groups like the American Heart Association, the Illinois Public Health Institute, the World Health Organization and the Center for Science in the Public Interest have touted the public health benefit of taxing sugar-sweetened beverages. \n \n But that argument was watered down in Cook County, where the tax also included artificially sweetened beverages and also didn\u2019t apply to food stamp purchases. \n \n \"(Taxpayers) will continue to cover the rising costs of treating the chronic diseases caused by drinking too many sugary beverages while also seeing cuts to health care services for our most vulnerable communities,\" Elissa Bassler, CEO of the Illinois Public Health Institute, said in a statement. \n \n gtrotter@chicagotribune.com \n \n byerak@chicagotribune.com \n \n Twitter @GregTrotterTrib \n \n Twitter @beckyyerak \n \n \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b", "SPOKANE, Wash. - Seattle is trying to discourage people from sipping on soda through a sugary drink tax, and now a bill is being re-introduced to bring that tax statewide. \n \n The tax adds nearly two cents to every ounce of a sugary drink sold. The bill was first read in February of last year and re-introduced Monday. \n \n Local representative Marcus Riccelli co-sponsored the bill originally, and said he doesn't believe the bill will go anywhere this year or be brought up for a committee vote. \n \n But after seeing the effects of the tax in Seattle, some are worried about the tax coming to Spokane. \n \n Pictures from a Seattle-area Costco have sparked outrage and controversy online. The images show a case of Coke costing an extra nearly $8, and a case of Gatorade going from $16 to more than $26. \n \n Some are worried that if that tax were to come to the rest of the state, it would be bad for local businesses. \n \n \"I understand the reasoning behind it. It just seems like for a business like us, it's just another cost that we're trying to overcome,\" said Heather Baldwin, the lead bartender at King's Bar & Grill. \n \n Baldwin says their business relies heavily on soda. \"The majority of our drinks are made with soda mix. And then we do have a lot of non-alcoholic drinking people and that's what they choose to drink.\" \n \n If the tax were passed statewide, it would also include a tax on syrups and powders which restaurants use to make the soda in their machines. \n \n \"It's going to be sent downhill to us, via the retailers upping their prices and then we're going to have to up our prices,\" Baldwin said. \n \n Seattle leaders say the tax is a good way to discourage people from drinking soda, which can lead to an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and hypertension. Some here in Spokane agree that's a good thing. \n \n \"It's a great idea, honestly. Sugar is actually one of the worst things that we can put in our body. And so, I think it's a great idea, incorporating the same tax as alcohol,\" said Spokane resident Jason Prettyman. \n \n Seattle is expected to make $15 million this year from the tax. It will be using part of the money to help fund a program that provides healthy meals for low-income families.", "Men of the West! The day may come when state or municipal governments impose a tax on sweetened beverages which functions perfectly as intended. But it is not this day! \n \n Another year, another soda tax. This one was shoved through in the city of Seattle by the municipal government. As usual, its purported intent was to improve the health and lives of residents by \u201cmodifying their behavior\u201d and having them drink fewer sugary beverages. And it\u2019s definitely a muscular incentive for new behavior to be sure. The price of soda has nearly doubled overnight. Seattle residents must be feeling healthier already! (CW33) \n \n Soda lovers are crying carbonated tears! Turns out, a soda tax went into affect in Seattle and people are not drinking the Kool-Aid on this one. Mega-chain Costco isn\u2019t feeling the surge either and put in big black numbers how much the new tax is costing their customers. Not only that, they\u2019re putting signs next to the price display that tells shoppers where they can get their fizz fix outside the city! \n \n As noted in the article, in one of the more creative and admirable moves by a retail chain in recent memory, Costco took to changing their price signs, showing how much the beverages should cost, and then tacking on the new tax as a separate line item. \n \n The city government appears to have been caught totally off guard by the visceral response from consumers. The majority opinion out on the streets seems to be that shoppers will be heading outside the city to shop. And considering the fact that a case of soda has now increased in price by enough to more than pay for the gas, perhaps they\u2019ll just do all of their shopping there. Talk about behavioral modification! \n \n CATO highlighted a Twitter thread from Scott Drenkard of the Tax Foundation, calling on these anti-sugar warriors to at least make some effort to get their story straight. \n \n \u201cFirst they interview people at the Costco who are rightfully shocked at how high prices on soda and sports drinks are now (they are almost doubled).\u201d \n \n \u201cThen they interview a public health advocate who says \u2018that\u2019s right! We want these prices to change people\u2019s behavior and slow sales!\u2019\u201d \n \n \u201cThen they talk to the consumer, \u2018think you\u2019ll change your behavior, maybe even shop somewhere else?\u2019 And she\u2019s like, \u2018ya the Tukwila store is close enough.\u2019 Then they ask a city council member if this will hurt local biz, who says \u2018there is no data\u2019 suggesting that.\u201d \n \n \u201cThen the SAME public health advocate says that people won\u2019t respond to price increases, shopping elsewhere because it isn\u2019t \u2018worth their while.\u2019\u201d \n \n \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways people! The tax is either big enough to elicit behavior change, which would slow sales and hurt local biz and potentially reduce calories, or it isn\u2019t. Get your stories straight!\u201d \n \n This is yet another example of the theory of the frog in a boiling pot of water. People are used to having their taxes increased if they live in cities run by Democrats. It\u2019s just a fact of life. And if you increase the tax slowly over time, let\u2019s say by twenty cents per year, many of them will adapt to it. (That\u2019s how they did it with tobacco in most places.) But if you literally double the price overnight, that horse is going to buck. \n \n Seattle hasn\u2019t run into the same constitutional issues that the Chicago soda tax was brought down by, but the level of failure here is just as massive. The original, stated goal was to have people drink less soda, thereby improving their health. But your average consumer doesn\u2019t enjoy being treated like a mouse in a laboratory experiment. Provide them with enough information to make an informed choice and you might achieve the desired result. But raising the price of something they want to the point where only the wealthy can afford it isn\u2019t going to elicit any cooperation. \n \n Of course, the underlying reason for the tax is to raise more money for the city\u2019s coffers. Now, with shoppers heading out of town to buy soda (and probably a lot of other groceries as well), Seattle is seeing what Chicago experienced in the early days of their short-lived soda tax. People are still drinking soda, so there\u2019s no health improvement. But they\u2019re not buying it in the city so the hoped-for revenue surge doesn\u2019t happen. Plus, grocery stores begin losing business, so their tax revenue contribution goes down and some of them may even have to begin laying off workers. \n \n It\u2019s a win-win for liberalism! But sadly, not so much for everyone else."], "summary": "\u2013 \"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles\u2014$15.99\u2014and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let\u2019s be clear. Soda taxes don\u2019t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue\u2014they drive it outside city limits. They don\u2019t help ease inequality\u2014they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide. (Speaking of Seattle and beverages, the world's largest Starbucks is no longer located there.)", "ranking": [4, 0, 3, 1, 2]}

Learn more about us here , and find out how to submit your work here ! \n \n \u201cWhoa, impressive taste for a teen-girl mag!\u201d \n \n This comment, in one form or another, often gets directed at us on Twitter, especially on Friday nights, right after we post our weekly playlists. It\u2019s also something I hear a lot in real life when I tell people\u2014especially grown men\u2014who I write for. \u201cWow!\u201d they\u2019ll say. \u201cGood work, ladies!\u201d Their surprise might be based on our staff\u2019s working knowledge of punk rock history (yes, we know who the Wipers are) or on the fact that Rookie\u2019s articles are actually thoughtful and well written, but it\u2019s always condescending and insulting, and never itself much of a surprise. \n \n I know I\u2019m coming dangerously close to generalizing about ALL men in the exact same way I\u2019m complaining that SOME men generalize about young women. There are, of course, many male critics who celebrate teen-girl fandom and our voices as cultural consumers and analysts and don\u2019t roll their eyes when we gush about 1D or whatever. Thank you for that, dudes. But because men have more power across the board than women in our culture, they get the message, from birth, that their opinions about things are the Most Important Opinions. Whether they choose to believe this is up to them, but rejecting it is a lot harder than sitting back and enjoying it. \n \n So I can hardly blame the many, many adult males who seem to have this cute assumption that all girls are dying for their approval of our cultural tastes, though we never actually asked for it. And I guess it\u2019s kind of understandable that they might assume we have shitty taste\u2014but I still don\u2019t totally understand their need to vocally criticize us for liking the things we like. When Tavi posted a link to an excerpt of her Taylor Swift piece for The Believer, a highly detailed and laborious work of pure love for Swift\u2019s music, a male cartoonist called her out for liking what sounded to him like \u201cthe soundtrack to getting a froyo and then stopping at Target for a new pair of Crocs.\u201d Not that she asked him! \n \n When I wrote a long piece for Buzzfeed about discovering Animal Collective and falling in love with them as a 12-year-old girl, dudes in the comments section made fun of my musical taste! Apparently my enthusiasm and knowledge meant nothing, because this band\u2019s music wasn\u2019t on the sacred list of Music Men Approve Of. And that\u2019s just one example in a long history of criticisms lobbed against me and my apparent TEEN TASTES! Once, I was talking to an older male friend about the brilliance of Mean Girls, and he kept dismissing it as an airheaded comedy \u201cfor teens.\u201d Obviously, he hadn\u2019t seen it, because I think we all know that Mean Girls is a classic for people of any age. It wasn\u2019t until I told him that the movie was written by Tina Fey that he seemed willing to reconsider his first reaction. Because 30 Rock is cool, but young women are NOT. \n \n When you applaud or critique a young girl\u2019s taste based on how well or badly it aligns with yours, you are suggesting that your taste = THE RIGHT TASTE, because you are the one IN THE KNOW. I sometimes rate movies on the website Mubi, and I can\u2019t count the number of times an older male cinephile has urged me to rewatch a film I\u2019ve given a low score to, because obviously I \u201cdidn\u2019t understand it\u201d the first time around. \u201cHow do you even know about this?\u201d they sometimes ask. \u201cYou weren\u2019t even born when this movie came out.\u201d Dude: I have the internet. \n \n This kind of cultural superiority complex extends to the makers of culture as well. For evidence, look at almost any piece written by a grown man about a young female artist. Here\u2019s one: When Jody Rosen wrote about T. Swift for New York magazine, rather than ask this funny, smart, world-famous young pop star anything interesting about her work or her views on the world, he pitted her G-rated pop against Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s and Rihanna\u2019s more risqu\u00e9 work and let us know that Swift has never \u201cwrithed across a stage wearing a negligee, or less.\u201d Rosen found Swift \u201cwitty,\u201d \u201cdespite her public persona.\u201d Because, what, cute girls can\u2019t be funny? He marveled at the mostly female crowd at her concert for a full paragraph, but was careful to point out that there were \u201ccreepy dudes from Oklahoma\u201d among the screaming young females, to illustrate\u2026what? That Swift is so versatile that she appeals to both (a) females and (b) male creeps? The whole piece came across as the work of someone deeply out of their element. I mean, he described the male gaze as an \u201cold feminist bugbear.\u201d Why is this the person who was assigned to the Taylor Swift story? \n \n Following the U.S. premiere of Chris Lilley\u2019s television show Ja\u2019mie: Private School Girl, which has Lilley playing a highly exaggerated mean-girl archetype, several think pieces popped up to criticize not the show itself (even though there was plenty to legitimately criticize, as a few smart writers did), but rather\u2026the sorry state of REAL YOUNG WOMEN in the world. In one such article on The Atlantic\u2019s website, Jake Flanagin took a look at a work of over-the-top campy fiction and posed, in all apparent sincerity, this question (about real people!): \u201cWhy are young women turning into monsters?\u201d I repeat: monsters. Ooh, scary! I\u2019m sure we\u2019re a big threat to straight white men who write for magazines like The Atlantic, what with all our dangerous selfies and Snapchats and sexts. Flanagin went on to wonder whether the average viewer was smart enough to tell that the show is satire: \u201cPresumably, Lilley poses this array of amusing insecurities and prejudices as a critical device, not face-value comedy,\u201d he sniffed. \u201cBut it\u2019s difficult to say whether the audience can discern the difference.\u201d \n \n As a member of that audience and a teenage girl (aka future monster), I\u2019d like to ease his fears, at least on that last point: Teenage girls know that Ja\u2019mie: Private School Girl is satire; it\u2019s by Chris Lilley, for god\u2019s sake. Have you ever met a teenage girl, Jake? We don\u2019t act like Ja\u2019mie. Just like how you, a guy in his 20s, don\u2019t act like Van Wilder. Or so I assume (insert a thousand winks here). \n \n I know I have a vested interest in this whole thing because I\u2019m an aspiring cultural critic and a current young woman, but I think I speak for all girls and women between the ages of 13 and 19 when I say that grown-up male journalists are probably not the best choice to assign stories about teen-girl culture to (keeping in mind those aforementioned exceptions). What they come up with, too much of the time, is a lot of off-base and frankly clueless speculation about what girls think, what we do, what we want, and what we need. \n \n It\u2019s not these dudes\u2019 fault that they believe they know everything. They were raised that way. But they really don\u2019t know much about us at all. Here\u2019s a tip for them: Next time you\u2019re musing as to what girls are all about, try to shut up and listen. \u2666", "High schooler and creator of online magazine Rookie, Tavi Gevinson is busy fashioning a DIY media empire that speaks to teens. \n \n Column One Tavi Gevinson rockets from Rookie to teen pop-culture heights High schooler and creator of online magazine Rookie, Tavi Gevinson is busy fashioning a DIY media empire that speaks to teens. \n \n In her Beatlemania schoolgirl outfit \u2014 gray miniskirt, knee-highs and electric-blue suede shoes \u2014 Tavi Gevinson looks like any other fashion-obsessed teen as she wanders the crowded aisles of Los Angeles' American Rag Cie. \n \n \"I can't afford, like, anything here on my allowance,\" the 17-year-old says, scanning the store's horizon for any gems she might have missed. \n \n She pulls out her iPhone and responds to a text. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \"My dad, he'll be here in about half an hour to pick me up,\" she says, heading toward a carousel rack of vintage-image postcards \u2014 \"the one thing I actually can afford!\" \n \n Gevinson is decisive as she plucks out certain moody postcards and quickly discards others. When the wobbly rack catches on the carpet and fails to turn, the petite Gevinson lifts the metal display and firmly plants it a few inches away, where it swirls freely. \n \n \"There\" she says sweetly. \"I'll take these four.\" After paying, Gevinson tucks the cards away in her floral backpack. \"Now, what were we talking about again?\" \n \n One can forgive the high school senior for being a bit distracted. After flying in from Chicago, she was up late the night before finishing an essay. But the assignment wasn't for school. It was the editor's letter for Rookie, the online pop-culture magazine she started when she was 15; now she oversees a staff of about 80. There was also a photo shoot this morning, followed by a meeting with her agent and then another whirlwind shopping trip in Hollywood. \n \n She will appear at Skylight Books later to sign copies of \"Rookie Yearbook Two,\" an annual print anthology of Rookie's best online writing paired with original content from the likes of Lena Dunham, Mindy Kaling, Judy Blume and singer-songwriter Grimes. The store expects an adoring mob of teenage fans for Gevinson, called \"the future of journalism\" by no less than Lady Gaga. \n \n Part Tina Brown, part Dorothy Parker, the quick-witted Gevinson has the ear \u2014 and Tumblr accounts \u2014 of a new generation of young women. Not to mention the eye of the media, the fashion world and, lately, Hollywood filmmakers. \n \n She was just 11 when she started the Style Rookie fashion blog out of her Oak Park, Ill., bedroom. Soon she was sitting on the front lines of New York's Fashion Week. Fast-forward to 2013: appearances on \"Late Night With Jimmy Fallon\" and \"The Colbert Report,\" international speaking engagements and a role in the film \"Enough Said\" opposite Julia Louis-Dreyfus. \n \n With more than 4 million page views a month, Rookie is emerging as a DIY multiplatform media empire of sorts for Girl America. \n \n The goal has become to make people feel included, that they're cool enough or smart enough.\u201d \u2014 Tavi Gevinson Share this quote \n \n \"I'd felt like there wasn't a publication for teenagers that was respected. Or that I, myself, or my friends could really relate to,\" Gevinson says, settling into a booth at the cafe next door to American Rag, her creamy skin, crimson lipstick and blond bob giving her something of a \"Ghost World\"-era Scarlett Johansson quality. She slurps her lemonade. \n \n \"One thing I'm very proud of is that Rookie has a lot of legitimacy in publishing and music journalism and fashion. As it's grown, the goal has become more to make people feel included, that they're cool enough or smart enough.\" \n \n Rookie beginnings \n \n The original Style Rookie blog impressed journalist Anaheed Alani so much she offered unsolicited help. \n \n \"She emailed me and said: 'I work at the New York Times, and I will quit my job to help you,'\" Gevinson says. \"It was clear we were on the same wavelength. She's now second in command and my partner in a lot of ways.\" \n \n Alani, 43, now Rookie's editorial director, has no issues working for a teenage boss. \n \n \"Tavi's one of the best bosses I've had,\" Alani says. \"My rule for bosses and therapists is they have to be smarter than I am \u2014 and Tavi completely fits that bill.\" \n \n An instant success when it launched in late 2011, Rookie now boasts jewelry and makeup ads and hosts in-person Rookie events in cities across the country, such as an Urban Outfitters-sponsored road trip last year that included crown-making workshops \u2014 Gevinson feels her now-signature floral crowns show \"a pride in one's girliness.\" \n \n In addition to material from the site, the Rookie yearbooks feature exclusive interviews with major pop cultural figures such as Morrissey, Chris Ware and Emma Watson; they're juxtaposed against personal essays by teens on universal issues such as sex, racism, friendship and feminism. \n \n Boiled down, Gevinson's message might be \"embrace yourself\" \u2014 and it seems to be resonating. \n \n \"She's really, really popular with L.A. girls,\" says 16-year-old Xulani Akel, a sophomore at Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies. \"It's so amazing that she's so young and so successful. I'm worried about getting, like, one B, and she has this whole company thing that she's doing and that she really enjoys. That sets the bar really high!\" \n \n Fans at a bookstore \n \n Skylight Books is filling up. The teen girls filter in, some wearing brightly colored floral headbands, others in swingy skirts and glittering prom crowns. Most carry a certain dog-eared book tucked under their arms as they swing between intensely focused and bubbling over with excitement. \n \n Like a religious pilgrimage, many come bearing gifts cradled in their arms for Gevinson, who at the moment sits in the store's office loft, overlooking the main floor. Chitchatting with the two Rookie contributors who will be reading with her tonight, Gevinson looks very much her age. \n \n \"This'll be fun. Who wants to go first?\" she asks them, as if the event were an impromptu school talent show. \n \n Moments later, however, when Gevinson takes the podium before a now settled-in crowd of about 150 rapt girls, she is preternaturally poised as she faces the crowd. She holds her iPhone out in front of her with two hands, as if it were stiff essay paper, and reads off the screen in an adult, measured tone. \n \n How is she able to ingest so much pop culture daily, interview her heroes, blog prolifically, write essays for Rookie and oversee her staff \u2014 all while attending high school? It's simple time management, she says earlier in the day, at the cafe on La Brea Avenue. \n \n Gevinson spends nearly every sliver of downtime listening to podcasts or music \u2014 most recently Lorde, Taylor Swift and Kanye West \u2014 while walking to school, for example, or watching old episodes of \"Freaks and Geeks\" and \"My So-Called Life\" at night. Study hall, she says, is a perfect time to read other books she finds more relevant in the long run, like \"Girl Power\" by Marisa Meltzer. \n \n Such efficiency, however, is not without sacrifice. \n \n \"There are compromises,\" Gevinson says. \"Like there have been times when my grades have suffered or I can't visit my boyfriend when I'd like to because I have a number of interviews that day. But it's worth it.\" \n \n Still, Gevinson's parents have made sure to keep her life \"full of normal teenage stuff,\" says her father, Steve. She attends the local public high school and recently got an allowance increase. She doesn't yet earn a salary from Rookie \u2014 though that may change soon, he says, as the site becomes more profitable \u2014 and speaking engagement fees go into her savings. The total sum of her liquid assets from day to day is her allowance: $25 a week. \n \n She left the room and I said, 'I want her.'\u201d \u2014 \"Enough Said\" director Nicole Holofcener Share this quote \n \n \"It's a nice little fiction that we're living out because she has this bank account,\" he says. \"But she likes living that way. We like her living that way.\" \n \n Like many proud \"pop culture nerds,\" Gevinson has a not-so-subtle obsessive streak. She might get up at 3 a.m. to rearrange all her books, she says, and not only journals her life's every happening, from monumental to mundane, but also \"curates\" her peripheral pop culture experiences to match her moods. \n \n \"Sophomore year I had my heart broken by a boy. I loved the feeling of heartbreak with dressing in nightgowns from the '70s, lighting candles and listening to Heart and Carole King,\" she says. \"I documented it all. It's like making a bunch of little movies. It makes me feel like I'm in control and everything has a place in the world.\" \n \n These days, Gevinson's mood is often a mix of excitement and trepidation. She's awaiting graduation in May and has applied to New York University, Barnard, Brown and Wesleyan \u2014 though she'd like to take a year off first to live in New York and focus on Rookie as well as other creative ventures, such as acting. \n \n \"Enough Said\" director Nicole Holofcener has no trouble envisioning Gevinson as a movie star. \n \n \"Tavi walked in [to auditions], this little lovely thing, an angel with red lips and pink cheeks,\" Holofcener says. \"She was maybe more nervous than someone who's been in a million films, but that nervousness was so natural and vulnerable and sweet. She left the room and I said, 'I want her.'\" \n \n How does all this high-profile success translate in the halls, on an everyday basis, at school in suburban Illinois? \n \n Stirring the straw in her lemonade, Gevinson plays down her success, insisting that most kids at her school are either unaware of her growing fame or they don't particularly care. \n \n Suddenly, three eager heads poke out of a nearby booth, their hands waving furiously at Gevinson. \"Hi, Tavi!\" they squeal in unison. \"We love you.\" \n \n Gevinson shrugs and breaks into a little-girl smile herself, giggling at the absurdity. \"Oh, I guess they recognize me,\" she says. \n \n On her way out of the cafe, Gevinson pauses at the door. \n \n \"I just hate 'voice of a generation' stuff,\" she says, balking at the suggestion. \"You put someone on a pedestal and of course they can't represent all of feminism or all people their age or whatever.\" \n \n And with that, Gevinson scurries out to the parking lot to meet her dad, her books and notes for the evening's reading bundled in her arms. \n \n Contact the reporter \n \n Follow Deborah Vankin(@debvankin) on Twitter \n \n Follow @latgreatreads on Twitter", "Rookie is an online magazine and book series for teenagers.

Why I, 11 years old in a baggy T-shirt and squeezed into my cinema seat, wanted to hide, while everyone around me guffawed at the onscreen hijinks. But now I know: That was the first time I looked at a movie screen and saw an image that looked like me. And that image fucking sucked. \n \n For those of you who haven\u2019t seen it, let me save you the pain: Shallow Hal is about a guy called Hal who falls in love with Rosemary, a fat woman played by Gwyneth Paltrow in a fat suit. The \u201cjoke\u201d is that Hal has been hypnotized to see Rosemary as thin, but everyone else knows her true size. She breaks every chair she sits on and her cannonballs empty a swimming pool (LOLOLOL fat people, amirite? Why do they even bother leaving the house!), but he thinks she\u2019s hot. When Hal finally sees her as she really is, he becomes a better man and learns not to judge people on appearances\u2014because he fell in love with a fat girl he thought was thin and therefore learned that fat people actually have brains and hearts and feelings and personalities! What a hero! \n \n The reactions Gwyneth\u2019s character got from people (aside from Hal) were very familiar to me. I\u2019ve gotten the same reactions all my life: at the pool or at the food court or in the school gym or on a plane when I, too, had the gall to be FIP (fat in public). This movie, though not deep or heartfelt, also touches on something that is very real for a lot of fat girls: the idea that a thin, pretty version of yourself exists underneath your fat, and if you only bothered to excavate her, you might be happy/loved/successful. I call this the \u201cbut you\u2019ve got such a pretty face\u201d syndrome, based on comments I\u2019ve heard my entire life\u2014from relatives, from movies, from TV\u2014that say in no uncertain terms, \u201cYou\u2019re not good enough now, but with a little work, you could be.\u201d \n \n We (people, women, Rookie) talk a lot about media representations of women and how they affect the lives of real, nonfamous women and girls. We celebrate Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s power and her unapologetic, take-no-prisoners attitude (in her life and her art) and the messages these things send to young girls. We talk about the pressure that unrealistic beauty ideals in magazines and other mass media puts on girls, and how that affects their self-esteem. But it\u2019s harder to talk about the way fat women are represented on TV and in film, and how these representations affect fat women (like me) IRL, because there are so few examples of our being seen as anything besides walking, talking truffle-shuffle jokes. It\u2019s hard to work out how to do something properly when it\u2019s so rarely been done at all. And it\u2019s really, really hard to be OK with your body when you\u2019re constantly being reminded that it\u2019s something for other people to laugh at. \n \n The \u201cpretty face\u201d message was stunningly, heartbreakingly brought to the screen in episode two of the British TV series My Mad Fat Diary, one of very few shows on the air ever that have featured an authentic and multidimensional fat female character. In this episode, that character, Rae Earl, a 16-year-old girl, has just been released from a psychiatric hospital following a suicide attempt. We see her get into an argument with her best friend Chloe (who is thin, conventionally beautiful, and outgoing), then we see her weigh herself and hear bits from her diary in voiceover: \u201cI am a body dysmorphic, without the dysmorphic. I am bulimic without the sick. I am fat.\u201d What follows is a dream sequence in which Rae lowers a zipper that runs down her back and sheds her \u201cfat self,\u201d revealing a curvy lingerie model underneath. She drags her flabby shell down the stairs, takes it into the backyard, and sets it on fire. \n \n I followed Rae\u2019s story obsessively throughout the show\u2019s first season, because I saw so many memories in it of my own teenage years. When Rae lies down on the grass near the boy she likes, tugs at her T-shirt, and positions her hands across her stomach in a subtle attempt to hide its size, I replay in my mind scenes of myself doing those exact same things. When Rae struggles to find a swimsuit to wear to a pool party, I\u2019m transported back to tear-filled changing rooms, where I relive my terror at the thought of anyone from school seeing me without my clothes on. \n \n But Rae is more than her insecurities and issues. She loves music and tells jokes. She\u2019s a supportive friend and occasionally acts out as a bratty teenager. To me, Rae is a wonderful fat female character because her weight is important to her back story, but it\u2019s never more important than her obsessive love of Madchester bands or her kind, sensitive personality. She makes us laugh by telling jokes, not by eating, struggling to walk, falling over, breaking chairs, or doing other Fat Person Things. She is Rae first, fat later. \n \n In this, Rae is kind of the inverse of the roles Rebel Wilson has been playing lately. After appearing briefly (but memorably) in Bridesmaids (more on that movie later), Wilson went on to star in the a cappella comedy Pitch Perfect, in the dark comedy Bachelorette, and on her own TV series, Super Fun Night, which is on the air now. In those three roles, Wilson\u2019s weight informs her character. Pitch Perfect\u2019s Fat Amy hates exercise and, in the movie\u2019s uplifting climax, tells the thin girls on her singing team that she loves them because they have \u201cfat hearts.\u201d Becky, Wilson\u2019s character in Bachelorette, is a mope whose friends tread all over her and tear her wedding dress in half when two of them get inside it and express their jealous disbelief that she\u2019s about to marry a handsome guy. Kimmie Boubier, Wilson\u2019s character in Super Fun Night, is the butt of almost every joke (many of them about Spanx\u2014I counted five in the first episode alone). \n \n I wanted to love this show, just like I wanted to love Pitch Perfect (I did love Bachelorette, despite its characters\u2019 awful treatment of Becky, because I find Adam Scott singing \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles)\u201d irresistible, and I love seeing Kirsten Dunst being a hot mess), but they both just left me feeling shortchanged\u2014especially Super Fun Night. After all the years of crappy role models, I was so psyched to see an actress\u2014who, like me, is a fat Australian girl obsessed with Salt-N-Pepa and improv comedy\u2014make it to the top of the comedy world, where she could\u2019ve pitched any show she wanted to. Imagine my disappointment when I saw her, Super Fun Night\u2019s star and one of its writers and executive producers, telling the world to keep laughing at the miserable fat girl who loses the handsome love interest to her skinny rival.", "Rookie is an online magazine and book series for teenagers.

Thank you for seven very special years! \u2734 \n \n Although she had no music out at this time last year, by now Lorde requires no introduction. Seventeen years old, from New Zealand, with a richly hushed voice that she lays over minimal beats\u2014you\u2019ve heard all this. You\u2019ve probably also heard her portrayed as some kind of alpha-Daria. According to one YouTube commenter (I SWEAR I WASN\u2019T READING YOUTUBE COMMENTS, THIS ONE WAS ALREADY AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE), \u201cShe\u2019s like that awkward-ass girl in the back of your class lol.\u201d According to many of the writers who have profiled her, she\u2019s the patron saint of Weird Girls Everywhere. \n \n What these people don\u2019t realize is that her reach goes far beyond a very hip sect on Tumblr. In fact, Lorde\u2019s song \u201cRoyals\u201d was #1 on the radio for nine weeks straight. Her debut album, Pure Heroine, got her four Grammy nominations. She is not niche. She is huge. But despite the commercial and critical success of her music, and the fact that she was signed to Universal at the age of 13, Lorde is continually portrayed as an underdog. Adult journalists tend to see only \u201cedgy\u201d-looking outsiders in the backs of classrooms identifying with her music, and totally miss the fact that hordes of snapchatting normies understand her, too, and vice versa. This is not only because they tend to underestimate Lorde\u2019s ability to appeal to the masses. They also underestimate the capacity of \u201cnormal\u201d teenagers to appreciate thoughtful, unflashy music. \n \n Sure, Lorde dresses like a witch and drips with sarcasm in interviews. Her best-known song denounces the materialism that other artists show off, and other ones say things like, \u201cI\u2019ll let you in on something big: I\u2019m not a white-teeth teen.\u201d But they also declare, \u201cI\u2019m little, but I\u2019m coming for the crown. I\u2019m little, but I\u2019m coming for the title held by everyone who\u2019s up.\u201d And \u201cWe\u2019re bigger than we ever dreamed, and I\u2019m in love with being queen.\u201d And \u201cI\u2019m doing this for the thrill of it, killing it, never not chasing the million things I want. And I am only as young as the minute is, full of it, getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought.\u201d Do not for one second mistake her stoicism for self-deprecation, or think it\u2019s only goth girls who relate. \n \n The album is a delightful cluster of such contradictions: Lorde is content with the world she\u2019s created for herself but eager to make waves in the one outside. Bored by the suburbs but endlessly in love with them. Critical of the other songs on the radio but wondering if she\u2019s any better (follow up a listen to \u201cRoyals\u201d with \u201cStill Sane\u201d: \u201cOnly bad people live to see their likeness set in stone\u2014what does that make me?\u201d). \n \n It\u2019s also insanely beautiful. A thorough listen feels like driving with shadows shifting across your face, quiet and thoughtful, in a car full of rowdier friends. Lorde elevates her suburban experiences to the level of mythology, becoming an empress surrounded by hounds, marking underpasses as her territory. She fixates on blood and veins as well as on the simple wonder of connecting with someone and wanting to experience everything with them. You can tell by the sound of her haunting voice that she means every word, and that she knows she\u2019s on the edge of erupting, as if to say: I\u2019ve been taking notes and keeping secrets, and I want to share them with you now. \n \n I met Ella (her given name) in October, after we\u2019d both discovered via online interviews and social media that we shared a mutual admiration (she\u2019s a Rookie!), so this interview got pretty conversational, but I liked that we could talk to each other as peers. We gave it a try on the night we met, but we were on a noisy restaurant rooftop and my recorder wasn\u2019t working. (I was also nervous about meeting her and embarrassed when she called me out for humming \u201cRoyals\u201d under my breath subconsciously.) (She was nice about it.) (It is a really catchy song.) She was generous enough to agree to a do-over last month, and we talked for over two hours on Skype. She addressed, among other things, the pervasive line that journalists dole out about her: \u201cWhile I dress and talk somewhat differently from other people whose songs are in the Top 40, I feel like more people dress like me than the media makes out.\u201d Instead of letting a few random sartorial choices narrow our expectations of music and music listeners, let us appreciate what Lorde\u2019s popularity says about all sorts of people, which is the only way to describe her demographic. And let us see what she has to say for herself, right here. \n \n TAVI: How does it feel to be home right now? \n \n LORDE: It feels really good. I\u2019m definitely not on holiday yet\u2014I\u2019ve been writing outlines for what I want to happen onstage for the tour and the next music video and this, like, big TV performance I\u2019ve got coming up. It\u2019s not work, per se, but\u2014yeah, work. \n \n I\u2019m curious, because I love what I do, but it is also a job, and everyone at times doesn\u2019t like their job. What do you do when it starts to feel too much like work? \n \n Often I\u2019m able to work on my own timeline\u2014I\u2019ll give myself enough time that if I don\u2019t feel like doing something, I can wait and do it a few days later or whatever. \n \n That\u2019s good. I want to start out by saying that what I want to do with this is\u2026I\u2019m in a unique position in interviewing you because we\u2019re the same age\u2013 \n \n Holla. \n \n And I feel like everything I read about you is like grown men writing\u2014 \n \n Oh my god, that tweet you made where you were like, \u201cShe laces her Converse\u2026\u201d I was like, \u201cThis is so accurate!\u201d There\u2019s a definite viewpoint of the think piece by an adult writing about kids. \n \n \"She giggles, lacing her Chuck Taylors. She may be famous, but she's still just a kid.\" -end of every profile of a well-known young person \u2014 Tavi Gevinson (@tavitulle) November 4, 2013 \n \n It\u2019s true! The end is always like, \u201cShe does [this childlike thing] but she also does [this adultlike thing]. Whoa!\u201d \n \n Mine is \u201cShe squeals\u2026\u201d \n \n Yeah! That\u2019s what I\u2019d just read when I wrote that! Or, no, it was a profile of Saoirse Ronan where they were like, \u201cThen she\u2019s just a kid in her Keds\u2026\u201d \n \n [Laughs] Yeah, so terrible. \n \n So I just want this to be, like\u2026a lot of our readers really relate to you, and I want this to be for them. Not music-journalism-y or about \u201cthe pop music landscape.\u201d \n \n Aw, yeah, yuck. Well, this is fun!", "The Wonder Years (1988\u20131993, ABC) \n \n This series was set in the 1960s and aired in the 1980s, but I first watched it as reruns in the late \u201990s, which I think proves that it is truly timeless. It follows Kevin Arnold, played by Fred Savage, as he navigates the transition from sixth grade to high school. Unlike shows that actually aired in the 1960s, The Wonder Years shows growing up in the suburbs for what it really is: underwhelming, haunting, and hilarious all at the same time. Kevin is obsessed with this girl named Winnie Cooper, who is the ultimate girl-next-door (and is played by the real-life math whiz Danica McKellar). Winnie is friendly and beautiful, yet smart and kinda elusive. Honestly, I wish this the show would have been about Winnie. She is my ultimate style icon (you can catch her sporting short bangs, cat-eye glasses, and overalls in the pilot episode alone). My parents both grew up in the \u201960s and would always say really nostalgic stuff when we\u2019d watch this together, and I\u2019d be all, \u201cUgh, guys, shut up!\u201d But now just thinking about the opening credits to this show makes me want to cry wistful tears. \u2014Gabby \n \n Seven Minutes in Heaven (1985) \n \n In my experience, a lot of the movies you adored as a kid don\u2019t really hold up when you revisit them five or 10 years later. But having recently watched this for the first time since the \u201990s, I can say with utmost confidence that Seven Minutes in Heaven is ONE OF THE BEST TEEN MOVIES EVER. It\u2019s a quiet, realistic depiction of the murky entanglements between best friends and first loves. A 15-year-old Jennifer Connelly plays the quiet, studious Natalie, who is smart but is still trying to figure people out. When her dad goes away to a conference, she immediately allows her best male friend, Jeff, to crash at her parentless place after he fights with his own stepdad. Their cohabitation is terribly innocent, though it\u2019s clear that Jeff is hopelessly in love with Natalie. Many mortifying things happen\u2014like when she accidentally walks in on him in the bathroom and realizes what shacking up truly means. Meanwhile, Natalie\u2019s best friend Polly (played by the awesome Maddie Corman) is less interested in love and devotion than good old-fashioned s-e-x, especially after a random encounter with a pro baseball player (and underwear model). The dialogue is so sweet and realistic, with Jennifer Connelly constantly dropping jewels like, \u201cParents and kids always fight. It\u2019s the way of the world.\u201d I could live inside this movie. \u2014Julianne \n \n This Christmas (2007) \n \n Named after Donny Hathaway\u2019s classic song, This Christmas follows the Whitfield family as they reunite for the holidays for the first time in four years. Ma\u2019Dere\u2019s children return to her quiet home with a whole lot of skeletons jingling noisily in their closets\u2014with the exception of Baby (played by a still sweet-faced Chris Brown). Quentin\u2019s on the run, Claude has two major secrets, Melanie\u2019s got a new boo, and there\u2019s some turbulence between career-driven, single Kelli and married Lisa, whose husband, Malcolm, is rather shady. The Whitfield kids work through the difficulties within and among themselves, and the warm-fuzzies-inducing moral of the story is that the bonds of family, trust, and love are the most important things of all. A part of me watches this movie every year for the epic baby-oil, belt, and shower scene (it\u2019s not what you think!) with Lisa and Malcolm. Another part of me watches for all the eye candy, including Lauren London, who plays Melanie. But mostly, each year I look forward to watching Baby\u2019s golden rendition of Otis Redding\u2019s \u201cTry A Little Tenderness,\u201d which is easily one of the most memorable moments in the film. \u2014Nova \n \n Angel (1999\u20132004, the WB) \n \n Angel was born out of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Buffy fans know Angel as the vampire with a soul, which was the result of a gypsy curse. He feels crushing guilt for his days as Angelus, one of the most ruthless vampires in Europe, and to help alleviate it, he works with Buffy to fight the big BAD. They also fall in love, and when that relationship ends somewhat disastrously, he heads to demon-filled L.A. and opens Angel Investigations to continue fighting evil. I came to both Buffy and Angel late, checking them both out for the first time just last year. On the advice of my brother, I watched them in tandem, and while you\u2019d probably get the most out of Angel that way because of the character crossover, it totally stands on its own. Two of my favorite characters are wholly original to Angel: Lorne, the demon lounge singer, and Fred, a physicist who was trapped in a demon dimension for five years (played by Amy Acker, one of my favorite actresses ever). All of the characters are multi-faceted\u2014they\u2019re dark and dramatic, as well as comedic. And that\u2019s what I love most about Angel: Its premise, about finding redemption, is serious, but there are a lot of downright hilarious moments. It\u2019s Joss Whedon doing what he does best! I really wish this show could have lasted forever, but at least it has eternal life on Netflix. \u2014Stephanie \n \n Jeux d\u2019enfants (2003) \n \n Jeux d\u2019enfants aka Love Me If You Dare tells the tale of Julien (Guillaume Canet) and Sophie (Marion Cotillard), friends who begin a mischievous game of dares as children (Julien pees in the principal\u2019s office!) that follows them into high school (Sophie wears a bra over a T-shirt during a class presentation!). As they become adults, it finally escalates into a sadistic competition that also is an excuse for them to stay connected to each other\u2014possibly forever. If you\u2019re a fan of unconventional love stories and the whimsy of movies like Am\u00e9lie, put Jeux d\u2019enfants in your queue immediately! You will either be charmed, irritated, or, hopefully, a little bit of both. Fun fact: Canet and Cotillard actually fell in love while making this movie and are still together today. \u2014Marie \n \n A Christmas Story (1983) \n \n A Christmas Story will always be synonymous with the holidays for me because it\u2019s been a favorite of my parents since they were young. I\u2019ve watched it almost every winter for as far back as I can remember, and because its protagonist, a grade-schooler named Ralphie, is so hilarious, it never gets old. I\u2019d watch as he groans about his father\u2019s questionable taste in home decor (e.g. the iconic fishnet-clad lamp leg that is the center of one the movie\u2019s plot lines), grimly dons a bunny suit gifted to him by a relative that thinks it\u2019s just soooo cute, and, most crucially, pines for a BB gun (the gift he most wishes will appear beneath the tree) regardless of the season\u2014although, of course, it\u2019s best around this time of year. This movie is a perfect portrait of exactly what\u2019s most exasperating AND most wonderful about being part of a family, which is why I love to watch it with my folks so much. See it with someone close to you, and \u201cYou\u2019ll shoot your eye out!\u201d will become a phrase that\u2019s much warmer-feeling than it sounds. \u2014Amy Rose \n \n Torchwood (2006\u20132011, BBC; 2011, Starz) \n \n I first found out about Torchwood while listening to a discussion panel about the show at San Diego Comic-Con. I had never seen an episode of this Doctor Who spin-off (Torchwood is an anagram of Doctor Who), so I didn\u2019t understand what the hell anyone was talking about as storylines and character motives were being dissected by diehard fans and the show\u2019s crew. All I knew was that John Barrowman, the only actor from the cast on the panel, was the most charismatic person I\u2019d ever been in the same room with. Based entirely on this guy\u2019s candor and amazing smile, I bought the two seasons of the show that were available at the time. The gamble paid off because Barrowman\u2019s charm comes across in every scene he\u2019s in. But it\u2019s not just him: This whole sci-fi drama, about a group of people tracking down aliens on Earth, is just incredible. The Torchwood team, including the immortal Captain Jack Harkness (Barrowman) and new recruit Gwen (Eve Myles\u2014who is just as captivating as Barrowman), deal with things like underground alien fight clubs, otherworldly technology that resurrects the dead, and cannibals. You get all of the mystery and adventure that make this genre so much fun, but the show is just as much about humanity and mortality as it is about extraterrestrials and the supernatural. In Torchwood: Miracle Day, the show\u2019s fourth season, human death in the world stops, which causes all kinds of practical and philosophical problems. It\u2019s pretty common these days for sci-fi shows and movies to have some sort of existential theme (you know, like using aliens to make a point about what it means to be human). But when characters on Torchwood confront things like death, which of course can be dramatic and entertaining, it\u2019s done in a way that inspires genuine sympathy and introspection. \u2014Amber \n \n The NeverEnding Story (1984) \n \n Sorry, I can\u2019t see. My eyes are filling with tears\u2026like every time I even think about this goddamn movie! The NeverEnding Story starts with a little boy, Bastian, who is being bullied at school. One day, he\u2019s drawn to a mysterious book in a dark little shop; he swipes it behind the owner\u2019s back, and then his adventure BEGINS. Squirrelled away in his school\u2019s attic, he spends the day reading about a world called Fantasia where the borders are disappearing into a malevolent force called The Nothing. Fantasia\u2019s ruler, the Childlike Empress, is ill because of The Nothing, and she summons the child warrior Atreyu to discover and banish the source of this danger. From the scenes of Bastian skipping school to read a book (MY FANTASY) to the wondrous characters\u2014the beautiful and wise Childlike Empress, Falkor the flying dragon, and a giant bat that continually falls asleep\u2014this film entranced me as a child. Throw in a magical amulet, the idea that every child (and their imagination) is important, and an amazing theme song (Limahl\u2019s \u201980s classic \u201cThe Neverending Story\u201d), and you\u2019ve got a film that will stick with me for life. \u2014Estelle \n \n Nirvana: MTV Unplugged in New York (1993, MTV; 2007, DVD release) \n \n Most bands in the \u201990s that went on MTV\u2019s acoustic performance series, MTV Unplugged, did versions of their greatest hits, but not Nirvana. Aside from \u201cCome As You Are\u201d and \u201cAll Apologies,\u201d the band went with their lesser known-material (they opened with \u201cAbout a Girl,\u201d which Kurt introduced by saying, \u201cThis is off our first record, most people don\u2019t own it\u201d) and an incredible selection of largely unknown cover songs (like the Meat Puppets\u2019 \u201cLake of Fire\u201d). The episode initially aired right around this time of year, and to me, a 14-year-old Nirvana fan, it was like a Christmas present from the band. It proved they could be just as powerful with all the distortion stripped away\u2014and Krist Novoselic playing an accordion! Four months later, when Kurt Cobain committed suicide, MTV played the episode nonstop, and it became the performance that immortalized him. It feels strangely prescient, and the song choices (\u201cJesus Doesn\u2019t Want Me for a Sunbeam\u201d by the Vaselines, \u201cThe Man Who Sold the World\u201d by David Bowie) and white stargazer lilies and black candles decorating the set are all eerie to take in now. But there are so many moments that are pure, beautiful Kurt, like when he forces a smile, chastises himself for screwing up a song, and jokes with his bandmates (\u201cWhat are they tuning back there? A harp?\u201d). My favorite songs are his solo version of the band\u2019s \u201cPennyroyal Tea\u201d and the cover of Lead Belly\u2019s \u201cWhere Did You Sleep Last Night.\u201d The moment during the last chorus, around 4:46 in this video, when he takes a deep breath and opens his eyes wide is EVERYTHING to me. \u2014Stephanie \n \n Home for the Holidays (1995) \n \n Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday, so it makes sense that my favorite holiday movie is a Thanksgiving movie\u2014one of a genre that clearly needs more love. Home for the Holidays, directed by Jodie Foster, stars Holly Hunter as a big-city art restorer who, yep, goes home to her parents\u2019 house to eat some turkey just as her own life is falling apart: She gets fired from her job, her love life is nonexistent, and her teenage daughter (Claire Danes in full-on My So-Called Life mode) is planning to lose her virginity. Anne Bancroft, one of modern cinema\u2019s sexiest women, plays Hunter\u2019s mother in a chain-smoking, wig-wearing, decidedly unglamorous part. Robert Downey, Jr. is Hunter\u2019s brother, and even though RDJ has said he barely remembers making the movie because he was so high during its filming, I still find his goofiness totally charming. The reason this movie is so good is because it feels wonderfully true to life. Are any of us ever really adults when we\u2019re at our parents\u2019 house? I don\u2019t think so. There\u2019s a romance in there, too, but that part doesn\u2019t even matter\u2014it\u2019s all about being in the kitchen with your siblings at midnight, talking about how crazy your parents are, and gorging on leftovers. \u2014Emma S \n \n The Family Stone (2005) \n \n This is one of my favorite holiday movies and maybe one of my favorite movies, period. It\u2019s Christmas, and the grown Stone children are converging on their parents\u2019 cozily decorated New England home, which you\u2019ll probably wish you could live in or at least snoop around. Some of my favorite actors play the Stones: Diane Keaton is the matriarch, Craig T. Nelson is the dad, Luke Wilson is the slacker brother, Rachel McAdams is the cynical sis, and Dermot Mulroney is Everett, the Good-Looking One. Everett brings his new fianc\u00e9e Meredith (played by Sarah Jessica Parker) home for the holidays, and let\u2019s just say the Stones aren\u2019t warming up to her. What follows is a story of awkward encounters, clashing \u2018tudes, and general mayhem. The Family Stone is better than other films about crazy, family-oriented Christmas antics, though, because of the performances. The snark-levels are high with Wilson, McAdams, and Keaton\u2019s characters, and they make great foils to Parker\u2019s uptight Meredith. Not to mention the family dynamics in the movie are just straight-up real. Those weird political conversations that happen at every fucking holiday gathering? This movie hits that nail right on the head in a particularly cringe-worthy scene in which Meredith explains her feelings regarding homosexuality and what\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d to the family\u2019s gay son Thad and his partner, Patrick. In The Family Stone, Christmas isn\u2019t sugarplums and fairies: it\u2019s children getting older and the strain of family politics.

{"document": ["The day before he went missing Breckenridge resident Jack McAtee crashed his car into Dillon Reservoir at around 6:40 p.m. on Sept. 18. \n \n His black sedan veered onto the paved bicycle path, cutting through a 10-foot opening between a steel guardrail and a concrete highway barrier, according to a Colorado State Patrol report. The car left the path, rolling for about 135 feet across dirt and gravel along the reservoir. It went airborne for 110 feet, turning end over end, before it crashed into the water. \n \n His car was almost entirely submerged. Miraculously, he swam to the surface, with only a laceration above his left eye. \n \n McAtee claimed he had fallen asleep at the wheel. A state trooper interviewing McAtee said he did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In fact, McAtee had recently stopped taking his medication for bipolar disorder, according to family members. \n \n The state trooper did not know that as he took McAtee to St. Anthony Summit Medical Center for medical clearance and then to the Summit County jail for a mental evaluation. The trooper just knew that McAtee was acting erratically, his moods swinging from irritated to chatty. \n \n At one point, McAtee asked the trooper if hitchhiking was legal in Colorado. Within certain guidelines, it can be, the trooper explained. McAtee then asked him where he would hitchhike if heading west on Interstate 70. Just making conversation, the trooper said, \u201cMoab.\u201d The trooper left McAtee in a holding cell at the jail. At first, McAtee was in high spirits. Then he cried in his cell. Then, before the trooper departed, McAtee seemed to be in a good mood again. \n \n The next day McAtee met with a psychologist. He was released at around 11 a.m. on Sept. 19. He was wearing a red hoodie and a tan hat. He had $67 in his pocket. \n \n His friends and family haven\u2019t seen him or heard from him since. \n \n McAtee, a gregarious and adventuresome 27-year-old who had lived in Breckenridge for about 5 years, had gone missing three times after going off his medication, but never for this long. \n \n Picking up on the hitchhiking theme in the troopers report, his family quickly assembled a team of volunteers, getting the word out to truck stops stretching from Salt Lake to St. Louis, where the McAtee family is from. \n \n The Moab Times-Independent published a story on McAtee\u2019s disappearance just in case he followed up on the trooper\u2019s suggestion. The story generated more than 10,000 clicks, but no one there has yet to report a sighting. \n \n However, a trucker in the Wheat Ridge area near Denver was convinced he saw McAtee. \n \n Because of that tip, and the fact McAtee has made no bank transactions since his disappearance, the family is now focusing efforts closer to home. They now believe it\u2019s possible he is still in the Summit County area. Posters have been put up all over town and along trailheads. \n \n McAtee\u2019s father, Steve McAtee, is currently leading search efforts from Breckenridge. \n \n \u201cIn case you are reading this, Jack, your mother and I and your four sisters Megan, Maddy, Katherine, and Ali love you with all our hearts,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cAnd we want to be with you now, more than ever. We love you. Come home.\u201d \n \n Summit County sheriff\u2019s spokeswoman Taneil Ilano told the Moab Times-Independent that McAtee\u2019s disappearance is being investigated as a missing-person case. \n \n Anyone who has seen McAtee \u2014 who is 5 feet, 10 inches tall, weighs 170 pounds and has green eyes \u2014 or who has information concerning his whereabouts is asked to call the Summit County Sheriff\u2019s Office at (970) 668-8600.", "Today March 25th, Easter 2016, marks 598 days since Jack\u2019s disappearance into the Colorado wilderness from Frisco, Colorado on September 19, 2014 \u2013 171 days since Jack\u2019s skull was found on Peak One on the Ten Mile Range stretching south from Frisco. \n \n \n \n Our hearts brim with gratitude for the love from so many, the throngs of you that joined hands with our family during this entire time. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Nearly 75,000 people from around the world connected to this site and followed our family\u2019s search for a son and brother we all cherish. Continual readership at this site is as a result of the multiple digital news articles published around the world that lead peple here. (If this is your first visit, see the \u201cAbout\u201d tab above-read the story, then come back.) \n \n \n \n Though at times there are dark shrouds of sadness that periodically descend upon us, we also see a bright light of joy \u2013 experiencing first hand how God is bringing beauty out of the ashes with Jack\u2019s Life and his story because of hundreds that came forward to donate to Living Water International in Memory of Jack - this heals our hearts. Thank you. We have now exceeded our initial goal of $50,000 and the donations continue to come in at www.water.cc/jack-mcatees-well-of-love. With an increased goal now to raise $100,000, We will continue to build additional wells in Jack's name thru Living Water International in Kenya for as long as the donations continue to flow in. Of vital importance in order to accomplish this, we are humbly asking each of you to share this on your Facebook page and ask your friends to do the same to extend this message of hope to a hurting world. Our loving God has brought beauty out of the ashes. \n \n", "Update number 14 - July 8, 2015 \n \n \n \n Today, July 8th, marks 293 days since Jack's disappearance from Frisco, Colorado on September 19, 2014. Jack's status remains unchanged, missing. The website \u2013www.findjackmcatee.com has almost 40,000 hits. \n \n \n \n It was a long cold winter for our Family as we waited to hear some word of Jack. Winter turned to spring, spring to summer, and still no solid leads. I do not know how we possibly could've gotten this far without all of the great friends we have.Thank you for all of the prayers that have been lifted up and are continually being lifted up for Jack and our entire family. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Even in light of the fact that Jack has now been missing for such a long time,we remain vigilant, hopeful, and thankful for you - even in the face of despair. All we want to do is find Jack and bring him back to good mental health. And if that's not possible, we desire closure. \n \n \n \n After eight months of careful review of all the evidence, Jack's personal profile and everything that has been done using social media and an incredibly talented group of people on the ground here in Summit County - expert consensus is that there is a 50-50 chance that Jack is still alive. There is a 50% chance that Jack wandered off into the wilderness and attempted to survive. There is a 50% chance that Jack successfully left the area either hitchhiking or on his mountain bike and resumed Life with a new identity- a new life in another part of the country, living under the grid most probably in the western United States. We are covering both aspects. Both locally here in Summit County and now again stretching out west, we are going to extend our search considerably at this time using social media. And this is where I will ask for your help later in this message to help, once again in spreading the information about Jack. \n \n \n \n First - Summit County, Colorado. \n \n \n \n Colorado experienced record snowfalls this spring with some 89 inches fallen between April 16th and May 31st. This delayed any kind of restarting of the search locally in Summit County until such time that the snows were sufficiently melted. \n \n \n \n Our family deeply appreciates the thousands of man hours that Is continually being spent and will be by the Summit County Sheriff's Department, it's coordination with the internationally acclaimed Summit County Rescue Group (SCRG) including 65 active members and seven mission coordinators and the Summit County Flight-For-Life team. After months of careful analysis of all the evidence that has been collected about Jack, the Summit County Sheriff department and (SCRG) has developed an extremely comprehensive and accurate profile of Jack utilizing the statistics of thousands of cases in order to narrow a search plan locally this summer for Jack in Summit County based on his profile as it pertains to a missing person's behavior, to narrow the geographic focus of the search in the area. We have identified a specific geographic area immediately adjacent to the hospital where Jack was last seen as a renewed focus. Also, the entire 10 Mile Range which stretches from Frisco to Copper Mountain, Colorado. Jack loved this area, knew it well, and it contains some very high spires of rock which Jack loved to climb. This range has 14,000 foot peaks. We are specifically interested in the upper terrain and interested in searching the bottom of the bowls. This area takes a technical person to actually navigate and is far from the area that is populated by recreational tourists.This is an area that through Jack's profile, we understand would be attractive to him. \n \n \n \n TO EVERYONE living in Breckenridge, Frisco, and Dillon, CO. \n \n \n \n One of the things that remains a great mystery to all of us- The location of Jack's bike. Jack had a very good mountain bike \u2013 a blue TREK, with a split seat. This particular bike is the bike of choice for very serious mountain bikers, and Jack was never without it, having explored endless trails throughout the mountain ranges within Summit County. We have been unable to locate the bike, having searched every bike repair store in Breckenridge, Frisco, Silverthorne, and Dillon. The bike is missing and remains a key piece of evidence. If he had had his bike, he could've made it very far into the mountains. This would be good to know. If he sold his bike, he could've easily quickly sold it for from $800-$1200 and avoid using his bank account, which has several thousand dollars in it with no withdrawals. This is a key point because this would've allowed to Jack to assume a new identity and not be traced through electronic transactions. So therefore, I'm asking everyone in Breckenridge and the entire area to post this on their Facebook page and start a conversation about the blue TREK. Has anyone seen it? Does anyone know of anyone who purchased a bike like this in August or September, 2014?Any information about this bike would be very much appreciated now. Please report any information about the bike to the Summit County Sheriff. Thank you in advance. \n \n \n \n Second - Everywhere Else \n \n \n \n I am continually amazed the more that I find out about the forgotten tens of thousands of people in this country that live under the grid, intentionally. \n \n I've learned a lot about the migration habits of these individuals to places seasonally which provide them the opportunity decent amount cash in a short period of time. \n \n \n \n ALASKA - Fishing season is in high gear right now in Alaska. And the Alaskan fishing industry offers individuals under the grid the opportunity to make a large amount of cash in a short period of time. The labor for many of the thousands of boats that participate in the fishing season right now, is provided by individuals such as Jack who have migrated up from the lower 48. And Jack knows Alaska, having spent several weeks flying throughout the state in a private airplane. He could easily get to Alaska and around Alaska by hitching rides from private airports, Jack knows the aviation world. I am asking all of my personal friends in Alaska to post this on their Facebook page and ask their friends to do the same, notifying anyone they know who is in the fishing industry of www.findjackmcatee.com. And I am asking everyone else to creatively approach The many Alaskan fishing websites, advertising for jobs to be filled, with an Embed of the link quickly providing penetration of the Alaskan fishing industry via the web with a notification to go to: www.findjackmcatee.com \n \n \n \n \n \n SLAB CITY - Slab City or The Slabs, is a campsite in the Sonoran Desert 156 miles northeast of San Diego, California. Several thousand campers use the site during the winter months. These people stay for only the winter before migrating north in the spring to cooler climates. This was noted as a destination for Chris McCandless in the book \"Into The Wild\". This was Jack's favorite book and therefore we suspect that he may have had it on his radar heading west. Please send this update to everyone that you know that lives in Southern California or the Southwest, ask them to post it on their Facebook page. Ask them to think of individuals they may know that would have some sort of connection to slab city. The website is: www.slabcity.org to discern creative ways to provide the link to www.findjackmcatee.com \n \n \n \n BURNING MAN FEST - August 30 - September 7,2015. \n \n \n \n Burning Man is a weeklong festival that is held in the Black Rock Desert in northern Nevada. The event begins on the last Monday in August and ends the first Monday in September. This particular event is a magnet for people that are living off the grid and each year attracts approximately 50,000 people. It's website is: burningman.org. Take a creative approach to post on \"off the grid \"blogs or websites and embed a link to Jack's website: www.findJackmcatee.com. \n \n \n \n NORTHERN CALIFORNIA \n \n \n \n Once again, Of particular Geographic interest in the state of California is Mendocino County. Such small towns that we are asking you to direct a link to the website in Northern California include the following: Ukiah, Willits, Boonville, Point Arena, Mendocino, Ferndale, Fortuna, Eureka, and Arkata. Essentially, the targeted area are all the small towns on US Highway 101 stretching north from Santa Rosa, California. Also, Placerville, California is of particular interest which is located just to the east of Sacramento. If you know anyone living in Northern California including any area in San Francisco to the north, please send instructions and respectfully request them to post the link to the website www.findjackmcatee.com on their Facebook pages and request that anyone actually living in those towns mentioned please print out the poster from the website and physically post it somewhere on the edge of town. Again, we are focusing in an area where there is a significant subculture of people that wish to remain off the grid. By the way, a great way to do this efficiently is to call the library and each of these towns, speak with the librarian, and ask Kylie if you could forward to her the link to Jack's website and ask her or him to post it on their Facebook page there. \n \n \n \n Finally, Jack, if you happen to be following all of this, just know that all we want is knowledge of your well-being. Please give us a call, we love you more than you would ever imagine. I will be leaving the mountains today and journeying back to St. Louis. When I arrived here some 10 days ago, I looked at my inspirational journal and couldn't believe what it said, \"You have journeyed up a steep, rocky path in recent days. The way ahead of you is shrouded in uncertainty. Look neither behind you nor before you. Instead, focus your attention on me, your constant companion. Trust that I will equip you for life whatever awaits you on your journey. \" \n \n \n \n I have been holding onto those words for the past 10 days. God is in control. I'm not. No matter what happens, our family knows beyond the shadow of a doubt that God has Jack in the palm of His hands, wherever he is. \n \n \n \n If just one person in the world, as a result of all of this,would come to the Lord, it would all be worth it. We want to express our love to all of you as we wait to see how God will end the story. \n \n \n \n Love, \n \n \n \n The McAtee Family \n \n \n \n Update number 13 - December 19th, 2014 \n \n \n \n \n \n \u200bToday, December 19th marks 101 days since Jack's disappearance from Frisco, Colorado on September 19th. Jack's status remains unchanged, missing. The website \u2013 www.findjackmcatee.com now approaching 31,000 hits due to the gracious help of our core friends and colleagues who have helped by drilling down the information on their Facebook pages or sharing the link via email to their friends and directing traffic as instructed by periodic updates. Our efforts to make sure we unturn each stone in our search for Jack remain in full force and unabated. States of Colorado, Utah and California have been absolutely saturated by the efforts of this website. We feel adequately covered in all places there and beyond. Our optimism remains vitally strong that Jack is still alive. We have one more assignment for you listed below as we request you to re-post a link to the website www.findjackmcatee.com. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The other night after dinner, my oldest brother Jack for whom I have great respect and after whom our son is named, said son Jack would be calling us on Christmas day. Brother Jack went on to conclude not surprisingly with a smile on his face that he was never wrong. We thanked him for the hopeful thought as it was exactly what we needed. As Ellen and I drove off, in my heart I said to God, \"In my darkest night you brighten up the sky.\" You see we have the hope and knowledge that God is up to something and the best is yet to come. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n I love my son's heart! I recently came across an incredible picture of him streaking across the Alaskan skies as co-pilot in formation with a group of fighter pilots passing closely by the mid section of Mount McKinley at approximately 11,000 feet on a perfectly clear day in a Diamond formation of high-speed experimental aircraft. This has been a biannual Sport Aviation expedition lead by my brother Tucker accompanied by a storied group of ex-fighter pilots for the past eight years. Passing right in front of Mount McKinley on a perfectly clear day, staring at that picture, I realized how much I love the heart of my son Jack, known for his quest for adventure and fearless expedition. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n There's no one I have ever met in my life that has a more tender heart for God than our Jack. A couple of years ago during this Christmas season in December, Jack was in the midst of a 30 day stint volunteering at a homeless shelter downtown.Living there 24 /7.He loved being there, helping and encouraging the homeless, making them feel better about themselves. Giving them a feeling of self worth and light at the end of the tunnel. Hope. That is the kind of heart he has. Always holding out hope for others. Perhaps at times so much so to the negation of his own hope. Gregarious, lovable, brilliant: all words commonly used to describe Jack by those who have known him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n So here is the assignment and our humble request to our friends and colleagues if history repeats itself as is so often does, it is quite possible that Jack was drawn back into a shelter for this very experience once again during this Christmas season.. A homeless shelter is a great place to remain anonymous. Accordingly, we are asking that you post links to the website on your Facebook page and/or just share this email with as many people as you know in the following cities with the instructions to repost the link on their Facebook page as well as to any and all institutions which happen to either be related to or are shelters for the homeless. The cities include Denver, Salt Lake, Houston, Dallas, Santa Fe, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Reno, Phoenix, Portland, Seattle, San Diego, Kansas City, and St. Louis. We are targeting all homeless shelters in the cities. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n And Jack, if you're reading this, we want you to know that your story has had such a huge impact on thousands of people in the past 100 days. You are loved beyond what words can describe. I ask myself, \"How long must I wrestle with my thoughts?\" Day after day, with sorrow in my heart, wondering where you are. Wondering if you're even alive. Longing for that call, as we remember the incredibly relished times we have spent together over the last several decades, your family is reaching out to you with an indescribable love with full appreciation of just how valuable you are to us. We long for the moment to gather and remember what God has done. Worshiping Him in the middle of this storm same as we worship Him on a cloudless day. He is up to something and His timing is perfect. Looking at this through the eyes of infinity, this Christmas we celebrate with eager expectation the advent of Christ. And we anticipate that whatever is broken within you will be repaired and that God has made a way back. For Jesus was born as a light into a backdrop of darkness. Christmas is God lighting a candle and the darkness cannot overcome the light. God can't stop thinking about the day you're going to come home. Nor can we. Give us a call on Christmas Day and keep Uncle Jack's track record 100%. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n To all of you our friends and colleagues: Love from our family goes out to each and everyone of you at this incredibly special time of the year. We cannot adequately express how grateful we are for all of you uniting behind us in this effort to find Jack. And WHATEVER HAPPENS,we know that God will bring beauty out of the ashes. \n \n \n \n \n \n Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah. \n \n \n \n \u200bWith much love, The McAtee Family \n \n \n \n \n \n \u200bUpdate Number 12 \n \n \u200b \n \n \n \n Today, Thanksgiving 2014, marks the 69th day since Jack's disappearance from Frisco, Colorado on September 19th. Jack's status remains unchanged, missing. The website \u2013 www.findjackmcatee.com now exceeds 27,000 hits due to the gracious help of our core friends and colleagues who have helped by drilling down the information on their Facebook pages and directing traffic as instructed by periodic updates. \n \n \n \n \n \n \u200bBecause of your protection, your trust, your hopes and perseverance, we feel your love. Whatever happens, we are still patiently awaiting an answer to our search for Jack. Colorado has been and continues to be searched very thoroughly. As illustrated in detail on previous updates, The search has been and continues to be a full-court press. We have put the word out even to the smallest of towns, posting the picture of Jack everywhere. Still, no solid leads. Our search using this website in Colorado has been exhaustive and even according to the authorities with whom we have been working very closely, it's effectiveness in getting the word out is unprecedented in any other case that they've ever worked on. \n \n \n \n \n \n \u200bWhile the search in Colorado continues, we want to intensify our search in the State of California. Through our investigation, we have discovered several things that give us an indication that Jack may very well have headed in that direction. Although his bank account has not been touched, he did have enough money in his pocket to hitchhike to the coast. We are hoping that he may have gotten a job there and perhaps decided to change his identity. Jack could have utilized the name _John Pearson _for his new identity. Of particular Geographic interest in the state of California is Mendocino County. Such small towns that we are asking you to direct a link to the website in Northern California include the following: Ukiah, Willits, Boonville, Point Arena, Mendocino, Ferndale, Fortuna, Eureka, and Arkata. Essentially, the targeted area are all the small towns on US Highway 101 stretching north from Santa Rosa, California. Also, Placerville, California is of particular interest which is located just to the east of Sacramento. If you know anyone living in Northern California including any area in San Francisco to the north, please send instructions and respectfully request them to post the link to the website www.findjackmcatee.com on their Facebook pages and request that anyone actually living in those towns mentioned please print out the poster from the website and physically post it somewhere on the edge of town. Again, we are focusing in an area where there is a significant subculture of people that wish to remain off the grid. Thanks so much for your help here. \n \n \n \n \n \n \u200bAt times, it's a bit like being in the wilderness ourselves, at times the lack of hope and feelings that it may be all over, that Jack may be dead and never found. And yes, we all understand that very well could be the case, however, WHATEVER HAPPENS, we profess our love for you and what that love has done for our family. For love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, It keeps no records of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. \n \n \n \n \n \n \u200bOur family has felt this love from you, and we continually thank God for it. It helps us persevere and so thoroughly illustrates our ache for relationship during this time and all the time for that matter. Our ache for our son Jack who we love so very very much. On this day of Thanksgiving, as you sit at the table, look around at each other and realize that each and every person sitting at the table today are so very precious to your life. Tell them that you love them. Take the opportunity to hold hands in a circle and pray for each other as you give thanks. And if you're so inclined, please include Jack and our family in your prayers today. We love you all, God bless you. Happy Thanksgiving 2014! \n \n \n \n \n \n The McAtee Family \n \n \n \n Update Number 11 - November 8th \n \n Today marks the 50th day since Jack's disappeared from Frisco, Colorado on September 19th. Jack's status remains unchanged, missing. The website \u2013 www.findjackmcatee.com now exceeds 20,000 hits and between 2000 and 3000 Facebook shares just from the site alone. \n \n Honestly, there have been days in recent weeks during which it seems all hope is vanishing. However, just when it gets dark internally, someone from among you sends us a letter, a note, an email that lifts us up and keeps us proactive with hope. While there have been a myriad of notes from personal friends, much of this communication comes from people whom we have never met. For this, the McAtee family is eternally grateful because it keeps us moving forward, putting one foot in front of the other, looking under every stone, not stopping and remaining ever hopeful. \n \n \n \n During the past 50 days, each and every member of our immediate family-my wife Ellen and our daughters Megan, Maddy, Katherine, and Ali has traveled to Colorado and spent significant time and effort working in conjunction with the local authorities who have spent thousands of man hours searching for Jack. We have also spent approximately 10 days in Moab, Utah mountain biking, hiking the various places that Jack loved in this area. We also spent a couple of days flying low and slow over the coordinates of places Jack loved to hike there in Moab to get a Birdseye view of the off - trail sites that Jack was known to frequent. We have traveled the highways and the byways. We have searched the urban shelters.The mountains which are continuing to be searched by hunters. We have mountain biked trail after trail stopping people located at the edge of the wilderness areas giving them a poster showing Jack, and telling them the story. As mentioned in the prior update, there is a network of people that call themselves \"travelers\"that migrate from place to place within the state of Colorado. These individuals do not appear evident to tourists who visit Colorado, but are rather very much under the radar. One specific example of this type includes the \"Rainbow People\".The rainbow people are a band of what most people would call hippies which have decided to live off the grid. And as you can imagine because of the recent change in drug laws in Colorado, many additional like minded souls are streaming into the state. \n \n The temperature in the mountains now falls to about 15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 each night and has been doing so for at least the past four weeks-far too cold to make any hopeful assumptions that Jack may still be alive if he is in the wilderness area high elevations. However, there are a host of cities that are lower in altitude down on the plateau that are still warm enough as well as some small mountain towns ideal for \"Travelers\" this time of the year. This, for now, continues to be our target. \n \n \n \n So therefore, I am asking once again for each of you who has any connections in Colorado to forward a link to the website \u2013 www.findJackMcAtee.com asking them to post it on their Facebook and likewise forward the link to anybody that they know who lives in a small town in Colorado. I have personally visited many small towns in Colorado but by no means have exhausted the search there. We can use the website for this purpose. The Colorado towns I'm specifically interested in drilling down on the include the following: Alma, Fairplay, Leadville, Buena Vista, Crested Butte, Creed, Del Norte, Pagosa Springs, Durango, Bayfield, Silverton, Ouray, Ophir, Telluride, Ridge Way, Montrose, Cortez, Dove Creek, Fruita, Grand Junction, Parachute, Rifle, Silt, New Castle, Glenwood Springs, Gypsum, Eagle, Avon, Fraser, Granby, Gunnison, Pueblo, and also Fort Collins. \n \n \n \n Since the vast majority of these \"Travelers\" have neither a cell phone nor access to the Internet, please request anyone in these towns to post on their Facebook page and, if possible, to kindly print out the \"Missing\" poster from the website and take it out to someone they may know who is living on the fringes or simply physically post it somewhere on the edge of town where the migratory individuals may walk by. This is the only way we're going to get the word out effectively to this community of \"travelers\". \n \n \n \n The leaves on the Aspen trees comprising the vast Aspen stands across Colorado and Eastern Utah have now fallen. However, each and everyone of the trees is still connected to the overall system of roots which Will continue to keep each tree alive until the new spring leaves begin to sprout. This is the story of our family and this mission because of you. You are our root system. You have been our strength, we have felt the hand of God through you. We are eternally grateful. Thank you. And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him. \n \n \u200b \n \n We simply cannot express in words our love for our son Jack whose heart for God is Immense. We wanted to make sure that there was something on the website that if Jack were to go into a library somewhere and access the Internet, that he would see letters from each of us. This is our prayer. There is a new section in the \"About\" tab on the website entitled \" Message to Jack from the Family\". And Jack, in case you happen to be reading this instead of pushing the link on the \"About\" page, following are those letters: \n \n \n \n \n \n Dear Jack, \n \n This is Katherine. I think about you every day wondering where you are, and what you are doing. Sometimes I pick up my phone and try to call you, and then remember that I can not talk to you. We are all really hurting without knowing where you are, and hoping that you are okay. Each night before I go to bed, I pray that we find you soon. There are days that go by when I wish I could just hear your voice, and laugh about things with you. The Lugos and I were talking about so many funny childhood stories growing up with you, and how you are such an incredible person. Jack, you have no idea how many people love you, and miss you. So many people ask me about you, and how our family is. My heart doesn\u2019t feel full with you being gone. You are our only brother out of the five of us. I really could not of asked for a truer, smarter, wiser, or loving brother. You are such a good person Jack. When I say that, I think it\u2019s really rare to be a genuinely good person. You have such a kind heart that cares for people. There are a lot of people that you will meet along your path in life that come and go, but family is always there. We want you back with us! We want to spend Thanksgiving and Christmas and the rest of the year with you! We miss you. Things are truly not the same and never will be without you. You complete our family. I love you so much! There are so many incredible stories about you, which makes you such a unique and interesting person.

I love you Jack sooo much more than words can ever express. I just want to give you a hug, and laugh with you. I want to hear about the stories from the adventure you are on right now. I miss you! \n \n Sincerely, \n \n \n \n Katherine \n \n \n \n \n \n Jack, \n \n I miss you so much and have tried SO hard to find you. I even loaded up my 8 week old Augie and brought him to Colorado with me to look for you. I am so baffled as to where you are and what could have possibly happened. There is not one hour that goes by that I don't think of you. I am heartbroken not knowing where you are. I call your phone and FB message you often hoping to get in touch with you. If you are traveling on your own adventure, there is nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed about...please just let us know where you are. I have felt like I have been so close to finding you so many different times just to feel you slip through my grasp. Please come home and tell me about your adventures and where you have been. There are no words to describe the agony of having a missing sibling. \n \n I LOVE YOU. \n \n \n \n Maddy \n \n \n \n \n \n Dearest Jack, \n \n We miss you more than you will ever know. Your absence has left a huge hole in the family that can never be repaired until you come home. I want you to know that I love you so very much. God gave us the most amazing brother, I can\u2019t imagine a life without you. You make us laugh, your fill our hearts with joy, you have so much to give. The boys are ready to start skiing lessons from you, we need you home! Ali has her season pass, ready to ski with you every day. Katherine needs her friend to talk to and Maddy and I need to hear your amazing story of this adventure you have been on. I\u2019m sure you will make us laugh, cry and shout with joy that you are back. We all wake up every morning with a prayer that today will be the day you come home to us. Mom and Dad are desperate to find you. Come home buddy, come home for the Holidays.I love you from the bottom of my heart. \n \n \n \n Love, Meg \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Hey buddy, \n \n \"Not sure where you went man but it's not the same town when your not around. I miss you so much, and moved out here to be with you. I hope you didn't think I was mad at you, this summer with you was a blast. Every single person I see around town \"even people I've never meet\" ask about you. This town loves you man. But it's not the same without you and I don't think I'm going to stick around if your not coming back. \n \n \" I'm sorry I didn't have time to help you set up your fish tank with you a few days before you left. I really hope you didn't think I was mad at you because I love you so much and you mean the world to me. Your the best brother anyone could ask for. Love you so much, hope your ok somewhere. If you want to stay off then grid we'll all respect that but just a phone call to let us know your ok somewhere.Your are the smartest, most genuinely kind hearted person I know. And I know I'm not alone when I say I love you, I miss you, come home. \n \n \n \n Love you so much, \n \n \n \n Ali \n \n \n \n \n \n Dear Jack, \n \n \n \n Please watch the attached message from your crash site at Lake Dillon: http://vimeo.com/108730089 \n \n Love, \n \n \n \n Mom & Dad \n \n \n \n \n \n Thank you. All of you. And may God bless you greatly and hold you in the palm of His hand. The McAtee Family \n \n \n \n \n \n Update Number 10 - Oct 21st \n \n \n \n First, our family wants to reiterate our appreciation for the incredible care and love that you have shown us during this difficult time. Without you, we would've fallen flat on her face weeks ago. With you, we continue the search and we remain hopeful that Jack is going to eventually emerge and come back onto the grid. \n \n \n \n Today marks the 32nd day since Jack's disappearance from Frisco, Colorado on September 19th. His missing status remains unchanged. \n \n \n \n In my journeys throughout Colorado and Utah, I reread jack's favorite book \"Into the Wild\" wanting to rediscover the thought process of Christopher McCandless , the central character in the book, when he decided to vanish into the wilderness. Truth is, Jack and McCandless share many similar character traits. The difference being that Jack comes from an exceptionally close family and has always remained very tight with all of us. \n \n The myriad of stories as result of this investigation of Jack's many friends who knew Jack well in Breckenridge, substantiates something that we've always known, an incredible character and similarity that Jack shares with McCandless. One key difference is that Jack has a very confident view of life through the eyes of Christ. Only this can explain the incredible antic adventures Jack embarked while living in Breckenridge. Things like climbing Mount Baldy near Breckenridge in the middle of a horrific snowstorm at midnight on skis with \"Skins\"with another adventurous friend and then skiing down in the darkness through the deep powder. Things like swinging through the Corona Arch in Moab on a bungee cord that Jack himself tied to the top of the arch. I will never forget standing on the runway and Spirit of St. Louis airport watching Jack solo at age 16. Later that year, Jack joined a group of a pilots including my brother Tucker and he spent 18 days flying throughout Alaska in formation with a group of military pilots. Having done this myself numerous times, I can only express that the wonder of flying low and fast over the glaciers in and around mountains as spectacular as Mount McKinley, was fuel for Jack's soul. But beyond that, Jack's fearlessness stems I think in large part from what he knows about his destiny in terms of heaven. With each unspeakable adventure, it's almost as if he was giving God an open invitation to invite him there sooner than later. Jack's landlord called me to tell me that whenever it was extremely cold and Jack would find someone on the streets there that was really down on their luck, he would bring them back to the apartment and let them sleep in the loft. Jack, at times on his days off, would sometimes go down to Denver with several close friends from his church and serve food in shelters there. This is Jack's heart. \n \n \n \n So why am I telling you all of this? Well quite frankly because many of you have reached out to me and have wanted to know more about Jack. If you have followed the story, you know that we have been very purposeful in our search for Jack utilizing the website www.findJackmcatee.com. The website has had almost 15,000 hits and is approaching 2000 Facebook shares. People are very aware of this. However, Jack, If still alive, is off the grid here. What I would like to do now is to ask you to direct a link to this website to anyone you know who lives in a small town in Colorado. Truth is, there are many places where one can just go off the grid here in the state. And I pray that is what the case is now with Jack. And there is a subculture of people here that just lives out in the wilderness area. There are many shelters, for example, in areas that are very far away from the major cities. Shelters that just open themselves up to people who are wanting to vanish into anonymity. So this is our hope, and even though Jack left Frisco Colorado on that day with $64 in his pocket, that he managed to find a place where people will be willing to protect him from outside contact. These circles of people are very difficult to reach since indeed they are off the grid. In many cases, no telephone no Internet no TV no outside communication with the world. I have become very proficient at sizing up small towns and who is the right person to speak with in a short period of time. I have found that the local libraries are an excellent source of people who are willing to make the link available on their webpage and ask others to do the same. But if we can get this link onto Facebook pages in small towns across Colorado and Eastern Utah, asking each person that you may know there to post it on their Facebook page and request that their friends posted on their Facebook page, etc. this could be very helpful at this point in time. \n \n \n \n Hunting season here in Colorado remains in effect until approximately December 1. We feel relatively confident that most hunters by now are aware of Jack. So far we have had no leads from hunters. In any event, this is good news because it leads us to think that he is in Colorado off the grid protected perhaps in a shelter somewhere. \n \n \n \n So Jack, this is for you should you be reading this. We, all of us, want you to know how much you mean to each of us. We love you. We admire your faith. And we want you to know that you should not feel bad about giving us a call. It's time now to come home. We can start over. You are an incredible human being with incredible talents with an incredible heart for God. Your story and life is a light too many. As you may have forgotten, God has a great plan for you. Love, Dad. \n \n \n \n And to our dear friends, the countless miles of shockingly bright yellow Aspen stands are so evident in my mind. As I drive through them, I think of all the wonderful people that have been so helpful during this time. Thank you. In the not-too-distant future I will be returning to St. Louis to resume my responsibilities at work. We will continue to use the website creatively to help us in our search for Jack. Many friends have been made along the way and many remain vigilant. All we can say is thank you from the bottom of our hearts for Your prayers, love, and support. \n \n And even though at times it's easy to look at life through shrouds of darkness while going through this, in the end, the reality is that we know that Jack's fate is sealed. This is the peace that we speak of that we know and that we feel because of you and because of Him. And quite frankly because of what happened at Calvary. \n \n \n \n With much love, \n \n \n \n \n \n The McAtee Family \n \n \n \n \n \n Update number eight - Oct 3rd \n \n \n \n Fortunately the weather is still relatively warm up here in the mountains with a prediction that it should be good for the next five or six days. High temperatures will be around 75\u00b0Day and night around 40\u00b0 and although the wind is blowing rather briskly there still a good chance that Jack has been able to survive in the wilderness because he's has good skills in this area. He is very familiar with the area. He has camped many times on the Gore range which stretches about 40 miles north from Frisco, Co. Hunters are now coming up from Denver in droves. \n \n The tactic of getting this information into the hands of Colorado hunters is working very well. With your help by getting this information out to as many Colorado hunters as possible, all I can say is that I feel God's hand. The Colorado wildlife and game commission has been extremely cooperative in getting the word out to all of their on ground personnel with the instructions to tell any hunters they see about Jack and forward to their phone a link to the website. As of last night, we are certain that 100% of the trailhead's leading into the Gore range and the various trailheads around Dillon, Frisco, and Breckenridge as well have all been posted with Jack's missing poster. This is a massive area, again, all we are searching for is a clue and we have teams of dogs ready to roll. \n \n Please note that there is now a $10,000 reward to anyone responsible for Jack's safe return to his family. This has been updated on the www.findJackmcatee.com website. \n \n \n \n May God bless you for continuing to send the above link out to as many hunters that you may know in Colorado, again asking them to forward it to their network of Colorado Hunter friends using Facebook. I cannot begin to express the gratitude that our family has for your prayers, love, and support. We thank you and we love you for all of your prayers. We are holding up and vow to continue the search tirelessly to find our son Jack, whom we love and who is loved by so many others. Thank you. \n \n May God bless you and may He be glorified through all of this. \n \n Steve McAtee \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Update number seven- Oct 1st \n \n First let me thank all of you who have been such a continuing source of encouragement to our family. I am holding onto the faith that God will have a good ending to the story. We are holding firm in our search and request your help \u2013 The effort of getting The link below to as many Colorado hunters right now. The rifle season has just begun and thousands of hunters are coming up from Denver and entering into this area through various trailheads. . We now feel there is a high likelihood that Jack just wandered off into the wilderness near Frisco,Colorado. If this were not hunting season, there would be far less possibility that we would find Jack. We are proactively targeting COLORADO HUNTERS cell phones. All we are searching for is a clue and we have a several teams of dogs which are already on the ground ready to roll. We need the eyes and ears of the hunters to give us the tip. \n \n If you know anyone living in Colorado whom you suspect may have a network including hunters, please forward them this link for the Summit County Sherrifs Office Press Release to Colorado hunters.... \n \n www.findjackmcatee.com. \n \n Send it to their email first And ask them if they could, would they please text it onto their hunting friends asking their hunting friends to forward it onto their hunting friends as well. and so on. All via text since that is the more likely way of receiving the message up here in the mountains. \n \n Thank you for your love and attention at this hour. Our family feels your love and thanks you for it. May God bless you. Steve McAtee \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Update number six- Sept 29th \n \n Good morning. \n \n Weather is reasonably good up here in the mountains where we will focus our search today. The temperature is about 65\u00b0 during the day and gets down to as low as about 40\u00b0 at night. The media has extensively covered Jack's situation. Everyone here knows of the situation. The Moab Times Independent article published Wednesday has now between 14,000 and 15,000 hits. The Denver Post carried a front page story in yesterday, Sunday's paper on Jack. We were successful in getting CBS Channell 4 in Denver to air about Jack right after the NFL football game ended yesterday at 5 PM locally. CBSis continuing to air this piece now. With the help of some churches with boots on the ground in Denver, a continual search is being made for Jack throughout the shelters the roadways along Highway interstate 70 truckstops is being made. His posters being posted throughout the city of Denver. \n \n On the roads nationally, due to the efforts of Prime trucking, Werner Enterprises, and Dot foods, as well as many independent drivers, there are well over 10,000 sets of eyes right now on the road watching for Jack along the highways of America with the missing poster posted on their cell phones. We have posters at virtually every truck stop on interstate 70 between Salt Lake and St. Louis. \n \n This morning will be concentrating our search near the area immediately south of Summit County medical center where Jack was last seen. We are organizing a foot search with search dogs along the Minors Creek Trail which extends six or 7 miles out into the wilderness and begins at the back door basically of the Summit County medical center. We are hopeful today to get the Civil Air Patrol based in Grand Junction Colorado to give us some air surveillance along the 10 mile trail between Frisco and Vail. Jack is very familiar with this trail as he is hiked it several times before. It is essentially a trail along the mountain peaks from Frisco to Vail. Weather is relatively clear and the flying should be good today for the most part. \n \n This is the big picture \u2013 Jack is either going to be reunited with me his earthly father or he's going to be reunited with God, his heavenly Father. Either way he's coming home. I want to thank everyone for your continued fervent prayer for the situation. As we continue through all this now, I feel a certain peace knowing that Jack is beyond a shadow of a doubt a son of the one true living God and right now God is holding him in the palms of his hands either in heaven or here in the mountains. \n \n I love you all and appreciate everything that is being done by so many wonderful people around the country to help find Jack. We are holding up well and our spirits remain strong and our outlook hopeful. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Below is a list of articles published to date: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Most Recent 10/04/14:Summit Daily \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Other articles: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1) Summit Daily 9/27 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2) Moab Times 9/27 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4) Saint Louis Post Dispatch 10/2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5) Fox 31 Denver 10/3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6) Summit Daily 08/11/2015 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "\n \n The Tenmile Range in Colorado, where a skull belonging to Jack McAtee was found. ( rjones0856 via Flickr) \n \n It had been weeks since Jack McAtee was last heard of, and his father was feeling desperate. \n \n He reached out to local police, printed fliers featuring pictures of his son \u2014 brown hair, green eyes, toothy grin \u2014 delved into hiking books and traveling blogs to figure out where the outdoors-loving 27-year-old might have gone next. \n \n And over and over again, Steve McAtee read his son\u2019s favorite book: \u201cInto the Wild,\u201d Jon Krakauer\u2019s grim chronicle of another young man who vanished into the wilderness and then died there. Hoping for an answer. Hoping that story wouldn\u2019t soon become Jack\u2019s. \n \n Jack McAtee, a St. Louis native living in the ski town of Breckenridge, had been driving amid the mountains of Colorado when his car swerved off the road and tumbled more than 100 feet into a river below, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The car was totaled, but, miraculously, McAtee swam to the surface and escaped with only a scratch above his left eye. He had fallen asleep at the wheel, he told a state trooper that Thursday evening last September. \n \n But the trooper\u2019s suspicions were roused by the young man\u2019s odd behavior \u2014 he seemed carefree one moment, erratic the next \u2014 so he took McAtee to the hospital, then to protective custody at the local jail, then to a mental health facility at Summit Safe Haven in Frisco, Colo., a mountain town at the northern end of Colorado\u2019s Tenmile Range. \n \n The next morning, according to Colorado newspaper the Summit Daily News, McAtee walked out of Safe Haven with just $67 and the clothes on his back. And that was the last anyone saw of him. There were no more phone calls, no bank withdrawals, no run-ins with the police. Nothing. \n \n Until this August, when a pair of French hikers bushwhacking down a mountain near Frisco came across a skull on the rugged, steep slopes. \n \n The skull, DNA tests revealed, was Jack\u2019s. \n \n \u201cOur search has come to fruition,\u201d Steve McAtee wrote on a Web site set up to find his son. \u201cOur closure is at hand.\u201d \n \n His son was gone, he continued, \u201cThere\u2019s nobody now who saw just what Jack saw, knows what he knew, remembers what he remembered, loves what he loved.\u201d \n \n But the McAtees tried. During the year they spent wondering what had become of Jack, the McAtee family tracked him across the country in an attempt to see what he saw, to know what he knew, convinced that being in the mountains he loved would tell them something about why he had vanished. \n \n Friends,Please go to: www.findjackmcatee.comThis is an update we would like to get out to all the wonderful people\u2026 Posted by Steve McAtee on Friday, October 9, 2015 \n \n They began in the spot where he was last seen: the gravel cliff above the Dillon Reservoir. Standing before the mountain-ringed reservoir, Steve McAtee recorded a short video for his son, panning the camera across the pristine landscape. At the end, he turned the lens toward himself. \n \n \u201cI love you Jack,\u201d McAtee said. \u201cWherever you are.\u201d \n \n He left no physical evidence behind, but the family had a few leads. According to the Summit Daily News, McAtee had asked the state trooper who responded to his crash if hitchhiking was allowed in Colorado. \n \n Within certain guidelines, the trooper explained. \n \n Then McAtee asked the trooper the best destination to hitchhike to using nearby Interstate 70. \n \n \u201cMoab,\u201d the man responded. \n \n Moab, Utah. Lead No. 1. Steve McAtee and one of his four daughters traveled to the desert city and got the local newspaper to run an article on Jack. They flew low over peaks he used to rave about, eyes straining for some kind of sign of where he\u2019d been. \n \n Then there were the leads from Jack\u2019s own history, which Steve McAtee hashed out endlessly on the FindJackMcAtee Web site. His sense of adventure \u2014 he used to fly planes in Alaska. His commitment to service \u2014 he once spent a month living and working at a homeless shelter. His admiration for Chris McCandless, the focus of \u201cInto the Wild,\u201d who, like McAtee, grew up in the suburbs but then fled into the wilderness, where he lived for a time on the strength of his survival skills and a Thoreauvian desire to disconnect. Perhaps he was piloting flights for fishermen in Alaska, or volunteering at a shelter in a big city like San Francisco or Houston. Perhaps he\u2019d just gone deep into the wild around Frisco, where 10- and 12- and 14-thousand-foot mountains and endless acres of trees would shield him from the outside world. \n \n Alaska, shelter, mountains. Leads 2, 3 and 4. Steve McAtee reached out to his contacts in Alaska. He posted Jack\u2019s missing poster on the Facebook pages of homeless shelters in cities across the West and Midwest. All six of the McAtees flew out to Summit County and ensured that signs about their brother and son were posted at every trailhead. Riding a mountain bike up and down the steep slopes, the family stopped every hiker they came across and held up Jack\u2019s photo. Have you seen this man? \n \n During the winter months, when it was impossible to stay in Colorado and scour the mountains, Steve McAtee devoted himself to reading about lives lived off the grid. \u201cTravelers,\u201d or \u201cRainbow people,\u201d as he called them, migrated from town to town without cell phones, jobs, permanent housing or bank accounts. He studied these drifters ceaselessly, trying to figure out what might have appealed to Jack \u2014 the creative chaos of Burning Man? the California winter campsite \u201cSlab City,\u201d where McCandless had once stayed? \n \n Then there was the other lead, the one the McAtees didn\u2019t want to think about. Jack had stopped taking medicine for bipolar disorder just before the crash, the family told the Summit Daily News. It had happened before, and on three of those occasions he\u2019d gone missing for a short while. Usually he popped back up again. \n \n But the state trooper who met Jack McAtee wrote in his report on the incident that he believed the crash might have been intentional, according to the Summit Daily News. Maybe he was trying to die. \n \n Maybe he was already dead. \n \n \u201cAt times, it\u2019s a bit like being in the wilderness ourselves,\u201d Steve McAtee wrote on Thanksgiving, 2014. \u201cAt times the lack of hope and feelings that it may be all over, that Jack may be dead and never found. And yes, we all understand that very well could be the case.\u201d \n \n His updates from this summer are more optimistic. \u201cIt was a long cold winter,\u201d McAtee wrote during a visit to Colorado in July, \u201c\u2026 Even in light of the fact that Jack has now been missing for such a long time,we remain vigilant, hopeful and thankful for [friends and family] \u2014 even in the face of despair.\u201d \n \n When the Summit County Sheriff\u2019s Office called Steve McAtee in August to alert him about the skull, he tried not to assume the worst. \n \n \u201cWe don\u2019t have any information yet,\u201d he told the Summit Daily News. \u201cI would call it inconsequential at this stage.\u201d \n \n Two months later, the information came: Jack had died. \n \n What\u2019s still not clear is when, or how. Taniel Ilano, spokeswoman for the sheriff\u2019s office, told the Denver Post the investigation into McAtee\u2019s death is ongoing. \n \n But in his message on his Web site, Steve McAtee doesn\u2019t ask those questions. The biggest one, the one that\u2019s dogged him for the past year, already has an answer: \u201cA person, an irreplaceable person, is gone.\u201d \n \n Correction: A previous version of this post incorrectly identified Jack McAtee\u2019s father. His name is Steve McAtee. \n \n More from Morning Mix \n \n Great white shark devours a seal on camera as Alcatraz tourists watch in awe", "Jack McAtee's skull was found on Peak 1 in August by hikers \n \n Breckenridge resident Jack McAtee, 27, went missing in Frisco on Sept. 19, 2014. A skull found near the summit of Peak 1 matched his identity according to recent DNA test results. (Summit County Daily) \n \n Summit County authorities said Monday a skull found by hikers in August is that of a 27-year-old Breckenridge man who went missing in September 2014. \n \n Jack McAtee's skull was the only of his remains located on Peak 1, according to officials. The county sheriff's office said the positive identification was done using DNA. \n \n McAtee, whose family said he was bipolar, disappeared a day after he drove his car into Dillon Reservoir and swam to safety with only minor injuries. \n \n A Colorado State Patrol report said his black sedan veered onto the paved bicycle path, cutting through a 10-foot opening between a steel guardrail and a concrete highway barrier, according to a Colorado State Patrol report. The car left the path, rolling for about 135 feet across dirt and gravel along the reservoir. It went airborne for 110 feet, turning end over end, before it crashed into the water. \n \n The car was almost entirely submerged, the report said. \n \n McAtee was taken to a hospital by authorities and then evaluated by a psychologist because he was acting erratically. He was then released and never heard from again. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \"Our search has come to fruition,\" McAtee's family said in a statement posted on a website aimed at finding the missing man. \"Our closure is at hand, albeit we acknowledge it will be a lifelong process.\" \n \n There was an expansive search for McAtee after he went missing, which included the Breckenridge Search and Rescue Team who \"dedicated thousands of man hours,\" the statement on findjackmcatee.com said. \n \n Family members initially believed McAtee possibly had been hitchhiking. Searchers sought the help of truckers and truck stops throughout the state and beyond, widely circulating McAtee's picture. \n \n Taniel Ilano, spokeswoman for the Summit County Sheriff's Office, said an investigating into McAtee's death remains active and ongoing. \n \n \"There's been no determination on manner or cause of death,\" she said. \n \n Jesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or @JesseAPaul \n \n The Associated Press contributed to this report."], "summary": "\u2013 Jack McAtee crashed his car into a reservoir in the mountains of Colorado on Sept. 18, 2014. He survived with only a scratch and told a police officer he'd fallen asleep at the wheel. The officer suspected the crash might've been intentional and the 27-year-old spent a night at a mental health facility in Frisco. A day later, the Breckenridge man was released and disappeared, reports the Washington Post. His family told the Summit Daily News McAtee had 10 days earlier stopped taking his medication for bipolar disorder, just as he had done a few times before when he dropped out of sight, but he always resurfaced. Over the next year, they scoured the country in search of him, thinking perhaps he'd gone off the grid like Chris McCandless, the subject of his favorite book, Into the Wild. They reached out to contacts in Alaska, where McAtee had flown planes, and homeless shelters, where they thought he might volunteer, but found no sign of him. In July, McAtee's father wrote online that \"there is a 50% chance that Jack wandered off into the wilderness and attempted to survive.\" But a month later, two hikers found a skull near the top of the Peak One, immediately south of Frisco; DNA confirmation that the skull was McAtee's came earlier this month. \"Our search has come to fruition,\" McAtee's family wrote. \"Our closure is at hand, albeit we acknowledge it will be a lifelong process.\" It's still not clear how or when McAtee died.

The United States blasted... (Associated Press) \n \n BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 World leaders rallied around the United States after it launched a missile strike early Friday on a Syrian air base in response to this week's chemical attack, while Russia condemned the move as \"aggression\" and suspended crucial coordination with Washington in Syria's congested skies. \n \n The overnight missile attack, which marked the first time the U.S. has directly targeted Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces, was condemned by his allies in Russia and Iran but welcomed by the Syrian opposition and its supporters, who expressed hope it signaled a turning point in the devastating six-year-old civil war. \n \n The bombing represents Trump's most dramatic military order since taking office and thrusts the U.S. administration deeper into the complex Syrian conflict. The Obama administration threatened to attack Assad's forces after previous chemical attacks, but never followed through. Trump called on \"all civilized nations\" to join the U.S. in seeking an end to the carnage in Syria. \n \n About 60 U.S. Tomahawk missiles hit the Shayrat air base, southeast of Homs, a small installation with two runways, where aircraft often take off to bomb targets in northern and central Syria. The U.S. missiles hit at 3:45 a.m. (0045 GMT) Friday morning and targeted the base's airstrips, hangars, control tower and ammunition areas, U.S. officials said. \n \n They were fired from two warships in the Mediterranean Sea, in retaliation for Tuesday's deadly chemical attack, which officials said used chlorine mixed with a nerve agent, possibly sarin. \n \n The Syrian military said at least seven people were killed and nine wounded in the missile strike. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition monitor, also put the death toll at seven, including a general and three soldiers. \n \n The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin believes the U.S. strike is an \"aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law.\" Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin believes the U.S. launched the strikes under a \"far-fetched pretext.\" \n \n \"Washington's move deals a significant blow to the Russia-U.S. relations, which are already in a deplorable shape,\" Peskov said. He added that the attack creates a \"serious obstacle\" for creating an international coalition against terrorism. \n \n Russia's Foreign Ministry said it is suspending a memorandum with Washington \u2014 signed after Russia began an air campaign in support of Assad in September 2015 \u2014 under which the two countries exchange information about sorties over Syria. \n \n The Kremlin later moved to diminish the attack, saying that just 23 of 59 cruise missiles reached the air base, destroying six Syrian jets but leaving the runway intact. Moscow also confirmed it had been informed of the attack in advance. \n \n A U.S.-led coalition has been bombing Islamic State targets in Syria since 2014, while Russia's air force has been striking both extremist groups and Syrian rebels in order to aid Assad's forces. \n \n Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which support the Syrian opposition, welcomed the missile strike, with Riyadh calling it a \"courageous decision\" by Trump. Iran called it a \"dangerous\" unilateral action that would \"strengthen terrorists\" and further complicate the conflict. \n \n Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Assad's government \"must be removed from leading Syria as soon as possible, and the best way to do that is by starting the transitional process.\" \n \n The British government says it was informed in advance about the strike and firmly supports the American action. \n \n Prime Minister Theresa May's office says the action was \"an appropriate response to the barbaric chemical weapons attack launched by the Syrian regime, and is intended to deter further attacks.\" France, Italy and Israel also welcomed the strikes. \n \n A Syrian opposition group, the Syrian Coalition, said the U.S. attack puts an end to an age of \"impunity\" and should herald the start of a larger campaign against Damascus. \n \n Maj. Jamil al-Saleh, a U.S-backed rebel commander based in the area where the U.S. attack took place, told The Associated Press he hoped the strike would be a \"turning point\" in the six-year-old war, which has killed an estimated 400,000 people. \n \n Assad's government had been under mounting international pressure after the chemical attack, which killed 87 people, including 31 children. Even Russia has said its support is not unconditional. \n \n Syria rejected the accusations, and blames opposition fighters for stockpiling the chemicals. Russia has said the toxic agents were released when a Syrian airstrike hit a rebel chemical weapons arsenal on the eastern outskirts of Khan Sheikhoun, and that blame should not be apportioned until a full investigation has been carried out. \n \n Russia's intervention in Syria since September 2015 has turned the balance of power in Assad's favor, and Moscow has used its veto power at the Security Council on several occasions to prevent sanctions against Damascus. \n \n Trump had said the chemical attack crossed \"many, many lines,\" and put the blame squarely on Assad's forces. Speaking Thursday on Air Force One, Trump said the attack \"shouldn't have happened, and it shouldn't be allowed to happen.\" \n \n A survivor of the chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun told the AP he hopes the U.S. missile attack puts an end to government airstrikes, creating a safe area for civilians. \n \n Alaa Alyousef, a 27-year old resident of Khan Sheikhoun, said the U.S. missile attack \"alleviates a small part of our suffering,\" but he said he worried it would be an \"anesthetic\" that numbs their pain and saves face for the international community. \n \n \"What good is a strike on Shayrat air base alone while we have more than 15 other air bases,\" he said. Alyousef lost at least 25 relatives in the chemical attack. \n \n The U.S. had initially focused on diplomatic efforts after the chemical attack, and had pressed the U.N. Security Council to adopt a resolution drafted with Britain and France that would have condemned Syria's suspected use of chemical weapons. But the vote was canceled because of differences among the 15 members. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Albert Aji in Damascus, Syria, Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow contributed to this report.", "During last year\u2019s campaign, Mr. Trump argued strenuously that Mr. Obama\u2019s decision at the time was a symbol of American weakness that should never be repeated. In that respect, the attack on Thursday night was almost preordained. \n \n But there are also considerable risks for Mr. Trump in the next few weeks, once the immediate satisfaction of making Mr. Assad pay a price for acts of barbarism wears off. \n \n The first risk is that his gambit with Mr. Putin fails. The Russian leader may have strongly preferred Mr. Trump to his rival, Hillary Clinton, in the election. But Mr. Putin is not likely to enter into an agreement that threatens his influence over Syria, and thus his main foothold in the Middle East. Syria is home to Russia\u2019s main military base outside its own borders. \n \n A second risk is that Mr. Trump, in taking a shot at Mr. Assad, undercuts his own main goal in the region: defeating the Islamic State. \n \n If Syria collapses, it could become a haven for Islamic terrorists, the exact situation that Mr. Trump is trying to prevent. \n \n It is unclear whether Islamic State fighters, already put on the run months before Mr. Trump took office, are in any condition to exploit an even more splintered Syria. But as David H. Petraeus, the retired Army general who designed the Iraqi surge, often notes, one of the lessons of the past decade is that if a power vacuum is created in the region, some variety of Islamic extremists will exploit it. \n \n The third risk is that Mr. Trump has no real plan to bring peace to Syria. The American-led negotiations to create some kind of political accord \u2014 which was John Kerry\u2019s mission for his final 18 months as secretary of state \u2014 collapsed.", "Libertarian-minded Republicans like Sen.

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) called Trump\u2019s strikes \u201cappropriate and just\" and said he looks \"forward to the administration further engaging Congress in this effort.\" \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Top Democrats, like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) also offered their support, but both made clear they believed any escalation would require the approval of Congress. \n \n \u201cTonight\u2019s strike in Syria appears to be a proportional response to the regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons,\" Pelosi said, but added, \u201cThe crisis in Syria will not be resolved by one night of airstrikes.\" Durbin said \u201cany further action will require close scrutiny by Congress, and any escalation beyond airstrikes or missile strikes will require engaging the American people in that decision.\" \n \n Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said, \u201cMaking sure Assad knows that when he commits such despicable atrocities he will pay a price is the right thing to do.\u201d The New York Democrat added, though, that \u201cit is incumbent on the Trump administration to come up with a strategy and consult with Congress before implementing it.\u201d \n \n Meanwhile, libertarian-minded Republicans like Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky blasted Trump's decision to launch strikes without first getting approval by Congress. \n \n \u201cThe President needs congressional authorization for military action as required by the Constitution,\u201d Paul said in a Tweet. \n \n They were joined by liberal Democrats, including Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Rep. Ted Lieu of California, who also argued the use of force requires congressional approval under the Constitution. \n \n Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), who was the lone member of Congress to vote against the 2001 war authorization against Al Qaeda, called the strikes an \u201cact of war\u201d and said Congress needs to come back into session and debate the matter. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) called Trump's failure to seek congressional authorization \"unlawful.\" \n \n On the other side were Republican defense hawks, who offered full-throated praise for Trump\u2019s decision \u2014 including Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, two of Trump\u2019s fiercest GOP critics on other issues. \n \n \u201cUnlike the previous administration, President Trump confronted a pivotal moment in Syria and took action,\u201d McCain and Graham said in a joint statement. \u201cFor that, he deserves the support of the American people.\u201d \n \n Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, another GOP defense hawk who has sometimes been critical of Trump, also issued a statement of support. \n \n \u201cBy acting decisively against the very facility from which Assad launched his murderous chemical weapons attack, President Trump has made it clear to Assad and those who empower him that the days of committing war crimes with impunity are over,\u201d Rubio said. \n \n Congress and the White House have long been at odds over the president\u2019s constitutional war powers. \n \n Both the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were authorized by Congress.

Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), along with more than 100 colleagues, signed a 2013 letter that sharply warned Obama against a unilateral attack. \"Engaging our military in Syria when no direct threat to the United States exists and without prior congressional authorization would violate the separation of powers that is clearly delineated in the Constitution,\" they wrote. \n \n Other GOP signatories included Rep.

Rycroft told the 15-member council that \"without Russia's seven vetoes in the Security Council, defying the views of other members of this council, Assad would have faced sanctions and justice.\" \n \n 15:43 The UN Security Council has begun an emergency session to discuss the situation in Syria. The US, which currently holds the rotating presidency, decided not to acquiesce to a request from Bolivia to hold the talks behind closed doors. Bolivia initially called the session, but US envoy Nikki Haley said that the meeting should be public so that \"any country that chooses to defend the atrocities of the Syrian regime will have to do so in full public view, for all the world to hear.\" \n \n 15:20 After a noticeable silence, top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said he did not think President Trump needed congressional approval for the strike, because it was \"simply a message\" to Syrian President Assad \"not to use chemical weapons again.\" He said he did not interpret the airstrike as a \"first step\" towards further military intervention, and reaffirmed early US policy on Syria calling for Assad to step down. \n \n 15:08 German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said on a trip to Mali that while he agreed that a possible gas attack \"constituted a war crime,\" he was worried that \"we have lost sight of the political process,\" and called on Washington to let the United Nations continue its efforts to broker peace. \n \n 14:57 Hezbollah, the militant group from Lebanon that enjoys Iranian sympathy, called the US' actions \"foolish,\" and warned that it could be \"the beginning of a great and dangerous escalation in the region.\" \n \n 14:25 Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev called Thursday night's US airstrikes \"illegal\" and warned that they were just \"one step away from clashing with the Russian military.\" \n \n Satellite pictures suggested that the Shayrat air base that was struck also housed Russian special forces and military helicopters.

He added that only 23 Tomahawk missiles struck the base out of 59 launched, making the US action \"extremely ineffective.\" \n \n 09:53 US Senator and one-time US presidential candidate John McCain says Donald Trump's strikes send an \"important message.\" \n \n 09:45 Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen praised the attack on Twitter. \n \n \"Good that cowardly assaults on women, men and children have consequences. The United States has clearly indicated that (Syrian President Bashar) Assad's atrocities do not go unpunished.\" \n \n 09:35 The key rival of Chancellor Merkel in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Germany, SPD chief Martin Schulz, urged Europe to put more effort into resolving the Syrian crisis. \n \n \"For far too long, we the Europeans have only looked at the US and Russia,\" he said. The EU needs to take more \"political, not military\" responsibility, he added. \n \n 09:25 EU Council President Donald Tusk tweeted that the strike showed US \"resolve.\" \n \n 09:13 The US says that the targeted army compound served as a base to launch the chemical weapons attack that killed at least 80 people. \n \n US missile attack on Syrian airbase 59 Tomahawk Missiles In April, US forces attacked a Syrian air base with cruise missiles in retaliation for a deadly chemical weapons attack on Syrian civilians. The US attack killed several Syrian soldiers and almost completely destroyed the base. \n \n US missile attack on Syrian airbase Syrian air base The air base Al-Shairat looked like this before 59 Tomahawk rockets were fired at the site. US President Donald Trump said this was the base from which the poison gas attack was flown out of on Tuesday.

It was the first time US forces had directly attacked government forces in the six-year civil war. Previous attacks in Syria targeted the so-called \"Islamic State.\" \n \n US missile attack on Syrian airbase Turning point for Trump For Trump, the use of chemical weapons was a turning point in his attitude towards the Syrian conflict.

DW has an overview of the many factions and world powers engaged in the long and complicated war. \n \n Who's fighting in the Syria conflict? Armed factions in Syria Syria has been engulfed in a devastating civil war since 2011 after Syrian President Bashar Assad lost control over large parts of the country to multiple revolutionary groups. The conflict has since drawn in foreign powers and brought misery and death to many civilians. \n \n Who's fighting in the Syria conflict? The dictator Syria's army, officially known as the Syrian Arab Army (SAA), is loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and is fighting to restore the president's rule over the entire country. The SAA has been fighting alongside a number of pro-Assad militias such as the National Defense Force and has cooperated with military advisors from Russia and Iran, which back Assad. \n \n Who's fighting in the Syria conflict? The northern watchman Turkey, which is also part of the US-led coalition against IS, has actively supported rebels opposed to Assad. It has a tense relationship with its American allies over US cooperation with Kurdish fighters, who Ankara says are linked to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) fighting in Turkey. The Turkish military has intervened alongside rebels in northern Aleppo, Afrin and Idlib province. \n \n Who's fighting in the Syria conflict? The eastern guardian The Kremlin has proven to be a powerful friend to Assad. Russian air power and ground troops officially joined the fight in September 2015 after years of supplying the Syrian army. Moscow has come under fire from the international community for the high number of civilian casualties during its airstrikes. However, Russia's intervention turned the tide in war in favor of Assad. \n \n Who's fighting in the Syria conflict? The western allies A US-led coalition of more than 50 countries, including Germany, began targeting IS and other terrorist targets with airstrikes in late 2014. The anti-IS coalition has dealt major setbacks for the militant group. The US has more than a thousand special forces in the country backing the Syrian Democratic Forces. \n \n Who's fighting in the Syria conflict? The rebels The Free Syrian Army grew out of protests against the Assad regime that eventually turned violent. Along with other non-jihadist rebel groups, it seeks the ouster of President Assad and democratic elections. After suffering a number of defeats, many of its members defected to hardline militant groups. It garnered some support from the US and Turkey, but its strength has been greatly diminished. \n \n Who's fighting in the Syria conflict? The resistance Fighting between Syrian Kurds and Islamists has become its own conflict. The US-led coalition against the \"Islamic State\" has backed the Syrian Democratic Forces, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias. The Kurdish YPG militia is the main component of the SDF. The Kurds have had a tacit understanding with Assad. \n \n Who's fighting in the Syria conflict? The new jihadists \"Islamic State\" (IS) took advantage of regional chaos to capture vast swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria in 2014. Seeking to establish its own \"caliphate,\" IS has become infamous for its fundamentalist brand of Islam and its mass atrocities. IS is facing defeat in both countries after the US and Russia led separate military campaigns against the militant group. \n \n Who's fighting in the Syria conflict? The old jihadists IS is not the only terrorist group that has ravaged Syria. A number of jihadist militant groups are fighting in the conflict, warring against various rebel factions and the Assad regime. One of the main jihadist factions is Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, which controls most of Idlib province and has ties with al-Qaeda. \n \n Who's fighting in the Syria conflict? The Persian shadow Iran had supported Syrian President Bashar Assad before the conflict emerged in 2011. Eager to maintain its influence in the Middle East, Tehran has provided Damascus with strategic assistance, military training and ground troops. The Iran-backed Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah also supports the Assad regime, fighting alongside Iranian forces and paramilitary groups in the country.

House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sens. John McCain and Marco Rubio were joined by Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, in voicing their support for what they called an \"appropriate\" and \"proportional\" strike, though the Democrats added that Congress will have to approve any further escalation, Politico reports. Republicans including Sens. Rand Paul and Mike Lee, meanwhile, were joined by Democrats such as Sen. Tim Kaine in slamming Trump for launching the strikes without congressional approval. In other developments: Syria says the strike, which involved around 60 Tomahawk missiles launched from US destroyers in the Mediterranean, killed six people, wounded several others, and caused \"significant\" damage, the Los Angeles Times reports. A statement from the Syrian military denounced the strike as \"blatant aggression\" that will be a setback to its \"counterterrorist\" activity. Deutsche Welle reports that the attack was endorsed by European countries, including the UK, France, and Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Bashar al-Assad bears \"sole responsibility\" for the strike against his regime's forces. Russia's military says only 23 out of the 59 American missiles reached the Shayrat airbase in Homs province, the AP reports. The military says the attack destroyed six Syrian planes, but left the runway intact. Vladimir Putin has denounced the strike as American aggression, a spokesman says. The New York Times looks at the risks and opportunities the strike has opened up for Trump. There's now an opportunity for the US to demand that Russia help get rid of Assad\u2014but there's the risk Putin might reject any such deal, that the strike could hurt the fight against ISIS, and that Trump's team has no real plan for peace in Syria. Syrian opposition groups welcomed the attack and said they hoped it marked the beginning of a wider campaign against Assad. \"For Syrians, any military intervention that will neutralize Assad\u2019s ability to continue his genocide will fall on our hearts like music,\" a civil defense volunteer in northern Syria tells the Los Angeles Times. The Guardian reports that a monitoring group says that despite the US strike, a warplane believed to be Russian or Syrian carried out an airstrike near Khan Sheikhoun, the town hit by the chemical attack, on Friday.", "ranking": [4, 2, 1, 3, 0]}

I had just introduced two guests, former ESPN Senior Editor Keith Reed and Fox Sports Radio's Clay Travis, who had agreed to come on to discuss the White House call for ESPN to dismiss anchor Jemele Hill after she called the President a \"white supremacist\" on Twitter. \n \n These were two men with opposing opinions.

There's no WAY he just came on my show and said what I think he said. ... DID HE?\" And I let it hang. \n \n My executive producer Eric (who has worked with me for years) knows me, read my face and quickly got in my ear from the control room and asked: \"Did he say 'booze'?\" Apparently, my producers behind the scenes were all scrambling, trying to figure out the same thing. \"What did he just say?\" \n \n I just couldn't let this go. \n \n So I jumped back in and spelled it out like a fourth-grade boy: \"b-double-o-b-s?!\" \n \n Yes. \"Boobs.\" He eventually confirmed: \"boobs.\" Almost proud, smirking. \n \n I quickly felt myself turning red -- getting irritated and angry. My mind was racing. My face, I could tell, was incredulous. In the thick of it all, I could see my other guest, Keith Reed, was equally aghast. \n \n The newsroom around me fell silent. I was staring into the camera trying to make sense of what was unfolding on live television. I even caught my cameraman Jay's eyes in disbelief. I thought again: \"It is 2017, and this grown man is on my show talking with me -- a female host -- about boobs.

I told the control room to kill his mic and said \"bye.\" I invite a variety people on my show with wide-ranging opinions -- sometimes even my jaw hits the floor, too -- but I let them speak. Whether it's left, right or center -- I want to expose my viewers to other perspectives.

Roger Freeman \u2014 one of two black representatives in the state legislature \u2014 died at the end of October at the age of 48. Around 15 percent of the district's voters had already mailed in their ballots, and at the end of Election night he had a six-point-lead over his Republican opponent, Jack Dovey. \n \n The death was so recent that most voters were simply unaware that it had happened, and voted for the incumbent or on a party line. Local news station KVAL spoke to one such person on Tuesday night. \n \n Voter Steven Hinz cast a ballot for Freeman because he didn't know the candidate had died. \"I did not know that,\" he said. \"When did he pass away?\" \n \n Since Freeman would not be able to effectively serve his terms, the two counties that make up the 30th district will select a temporary legislator from three possibilities offered by local Democrats. A special election would then be held next year. \n \n Voters elect people whose hearts no longer thump to the beat of democracy more than you'd think. Last year, Oregon voters elected a man to the Aberdeen City Council five months after he died. Missouri elected a dead man who was running unopposed to serve as county commissioner in 2010. Three weeks before the 2000 election, Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan died in a plane crash. When he won a Senate race against John Ashcroft, his widow was appointed to take his place. \n \n Hackensack High School Principal Joseph DeFalco died after the polls had opened in 2005, and was elected to the city council for a four-year term he could not complete, or even start.

And voters in central Washington will see a first for the state - two members of the same party on the fall ballot in a congressional race. \n \n \n \n Here's a look at 5 things to know about the general election: \n \n \n \n GUN MEASURES: Voters will decide the fate of two competing gun background check initiatives. One, Initiative 594, seeks universal background checks on all sales and transfers, including private transactions and many loans and gifts. The other, Initiative 591, would prevent the state from expanding checks beyond the national standard. Like federal law, Washington law currently requires checks for sales or transfers by licensed dealers but not for purchases from private sellers, like those who sell at gun shows or to friends. No other state has a gun-related measure on the ballot this year, and millions of dollars have been pouring into the state, mostly in support of expanding background checks. I-591 also would prohibit the confiscation of firearms without due process. \n \n \n \n REPUBLICAN VERSUS REPUBLICAN: The most interesting congressional race in the state is also the one where one party is guaranteed to have the winner. Washington's 4th Congressional District features two Republicans on the fall ballot - the first time that's happened in a federal race under the state's 'Top 2' primary system. Tea party favorite Clint Didier is in a tight contest against Dan Newhouse, backed by the Republican mainstream. Newhouse has said he would focus on central Washington priorities such as water conservation and cleaning up the giant Hanford Nuclear Reservation, while Didier ran largely against the political establishment in the nation's capital, including some fellow Republicans, who he terms \"RINOs,\" Republicans in name only. \n \n \n \n SENATE CONTROL: For the last two legislative sessions, Republicans have controlled state Senate with the help of two Democrats who left their party to caucus with the GOP. Republicans hope to gain outright control of the upper chamber following Tuesday's election. Currently, the state Senate is split 26-23, technically with the majority lying with Democrats. But in 2012, two Democrats joined the Republicans to form a mostly GOP-controlled coalition, sending Democrats to the minority. The Democrats need to win two or more seats to regain control of the Senate, but Republicans had strong showings in the primary. Unlike the Senate, the House has not changed majority in more than a decade. This election is not expected to be different. The Democrats in that chamber currently hold a 55-43 majority. \n \n \n \n CLASS SIZE: Voters in Washington state will vote yet again on class sizes. Education advocates are pushing a measure limiting class sizes, but opponents say Initiative 1351 could make a bad budget situation worse as lawmakers scramble to pay for court-ordered reforms. State financial experts believe the initiative would eventually cost the state about $2 billion a year to pay for thousands more teachers and other school staff. Washington voters overwhelmingly approved another class size reduction initiative in 2000, and 14 years later, lawmakers are just starting to pay that bill. This initiative is different, in both its scope and the way it was written. Initiative 1351 would set lower class sizes at every grade level. The previous initiative focused on the youngest grades. \n \n \n \n VOTE BY MAIL: Washington, like Oregon, is an all vote-by-mail state. But unlike Oregon - where ballots have to be received by Election Day - in Washington, ballots just have to be postmarked no later than Election Day or placed in an official ballot drop box by 8 p.m. Tuesday. That means that in some of the more competitive races, results may not be known for days as most counties will update vote counts only once a day.", "SEATTLE \u2014 An incumbent Democratic state representative in Washington was headed for a decisive re-election victory on Wednesday even though he died last week, results indicate. \n \n Roger Freeman, a first-term representative from Federal Way, a city between Seattle and Tacoma, had about 53 percent of the vote, compared to about 47 percent for his Republican challenger, Jack Dovey. Freeman, 48, died last week after a battle with cancer. His death came after ballots were mailed to Washington voters, where all voting is done by mail. \n \n \"This is extremely rare,\" said Brian Zylstra, a spokesman for the secretary of state's office. \"But there are protocols in place.\" Once all ballots are finalized in coming weeks, if Freeman wins the vote, Democrats still will hold on to his seat in the state House of Representatives, Zylstra said. \n \n Democrats in Freeman's district, which spans two counties, will select three names for a temporary replacement and the King and Pierce County councils will vote to appoint one of those candidates to the seat for one year, according to state election rules. The seat would be on the ballot in 2015 to fill out the remainder of the two-year term, the rules say. \n \n Should the Republican candidate win, he will take the seat in Olympia at the start of the next legislative session. \n \n Roger Freeman a Democratic state representative in Washington, is seen in an undated photo from the U.S. House of Representatives.

Roger Freeman of Federal Way a second term with about 53% of the vote, NBC News notes. There's just one problem: The 48-year-old Freeman died last week after a long battle with colon cancer, the Seattle Times reports. Many voters either didn't know Freeman had died or had already sent in their ballots, the Washington Post reports. \"I did not know that. When did he pass away?\" one voter told KVAL. \"This is extremely rare,\" a spokesman for Washington's secretary of state tells NBC. \"But there are protocols in place.\" Those protocols would be much simpler if voters had simply elected the very much alive Republican candidate, Jack Dovey. However, since Freeman is apparently the victor, Democrats in the district will pick three names to serve as his temporary replacement; the county councils will then vote one of those candidates in to serve for one year, with a special election next year to pick someone for the final year of the two-year term, NBC notes.

Listening behind the pope are Vice President Joe... (Associated Press) \n \n 11:20 a.m. \n \n From the balcony of the U.S. Capitol, Pope Francis asked a crowd of tens of thousands to pray for him. \n \n It's a plea he traditionally makes. But this time, speaking in Spanish, he added a line to acknowledge that not everyone in the crowd was Christian, much less a believer. \n \n Through a translator, the pontiff said: \"If among you there are some who don't believe or who cannot pray, I ask that you send good wishes my way.\" \n \n After his speech to Congress, the pope walked onto a balcony of the Capitol and greeted the throngs with \"Buenos Dias.\" \n \n He expressed gratitude for their presence and asked God to bless \"the most important ones here \u2014 children.\" \n \n Francis ended his remarks in English, saying \"Thank you very much and God bless America.\" The crowd cheered boisterously. \n \n ___ \n \n 11:10 a.m. \n \n Pope Francis has taken his call for action on climate change to Congress. In his address to lawmakers, Francis urged a \"courageous and responsible effort\" to avert the most serious effects of what he called the \"environmental deterioration caused by human activity.\" \n \n Francis says he's convinced that working together, nations can make a difference to slow global warming. He says the U.S. and \"this Congress\" have an important role to play. Now, he says, is the time for a \"culture of care.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 11 a.m. \n \n Pope Francis is lamenting that the very basis of marriage and family life today is being put into question \u2014 an allusion to gay marriage in a country that recently legalized same-sex marriage across the land. \n \n Speaking before Congress in the first-ever papal address, Francis said the family today is \"threatened, perhaps as never before, from within and without.\" \n \n While Francis has shown great openness to gays as individuals, he has staunchly upheld the church teaching that marriage is a union between man and woman. \n \n Sitting in front of Francis for his speech was John Roberts, chief justice of the Supreme Court, which legalized gay marriage across the country. \n \n Francis is expected to speak in greater depth about the threats to families at a big church rally in Philadelphia later this week. \n \n ___ \n \n 11 a.m. \n \n Pope Francis is demanding an end to the arms trade, delivering a tough message to a country that is the world's largest exporter of weapons. \n \n Speaking before Congress, the pope asked why weapons are being sold to people who intend only to inflict suffering on innocents. He said: \"Sadly, the answer as we all know, is simply for money: money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood.\" \n \n Francis has in the past denounced weapons makers and dealers as \"the root of evil\" and questioned how weapons manufacturers can call themselves Christian. \n \n Francis has, however, said that it is legitimate to use military force against an \"unjust aggression,\" such as the attacks by Islamic extremists against Christian and other religious minorities in Syria and Iraq. \n \n ___ \n \n 10:50 a.m. \n \n Pope Francis has used his speech to Congress to express sympathy for American Indians for their \"turbulent and violent\" early contacts with arriving Europeans. But he says it is hard to judge past actions by today's standards. \n \n Francis did not specifically use the term American Indians. He said the rights of \"those who were here long before us\" were not always respected. \n \n He says that \"for those people and their nations,\" he wants to express his highest esteem and appreciation. \n \n Francis has been criticized by some Native Americans for his decision to canonize an 18th century missionary, Junipero Serra, on Wednesday. Indigenous groups say Serra was part of the violent colonizing machine that wiped out indigenous populations. Francis has defended Serra as a great evengelizer who protected indigenous peoples from the abuses of colonizers. \n \n ___ \n \n 10:35 a.m. \n \n Speaking to Congress, Pope Francis is calling for an end to the death penalty in the U.S. and across the world. \n \n Francis says that every life is sacred and society can only benefit from rehabilitating those convicted of crimes. \n \n The pope noted that U.S. bishops have renewed their call to abolish capital punishment. That idea is unpopular, however, with many American politicians. \n \n The pontiff did not specifically mention abortion \u2014 a particularly contentious issue in Congress at the moment that threatens to force the shutdown of the U.S. government next week. \n \n Still, his remarks referred to the Catholic church's opposition to abortion. He urged lawmakers and all Americans to \"protect and defend human life at every stage of its development.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 10:30 a.m. \n \n Pope Francis is urging Congress members \u2014 and the United States as a whole \u2014 not to be afraid of immigrants but to welcome them as fellow human beings. \n \n He says people are not things that can be discarded just because they are troublesome. \n \n The pontiff's admonition comes as the presidential race is roiled by questions about immigration from Mexico and Latin America, and the nation is weighing how many migrants to accept from wars in the Middle East. \n \n The son of Italian immigrants to Argentina himself, Francis noted that the United States was founded by immigrants, that many lawmakers are descended from foreigners, and that this generation must not \"turn their back on our neighbors.\" \n \n His plea: \"Let us treat others with the same passion and compassion with which we want to be treated.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 10:15 a.m. \n \n Pope Francis is calling for a \"delicate balance\" in fighting religious extremism to ensure that fundamental freedoms aren't trampled at the same time. \n \n He says in his speech to Congress that \"no religion is immune from forms of individual delusion or ideological extremism.\" \n \n He says religious, intellectual and individual freedoms must be safeguarded, while combatting violence perpetrated in the name of religion. \n \n The pope cautions against simplistically breaking the world into camps of good and evil. \n \n Francis has expressed deep concern about the slaughter of Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East at the hands of Islamic extremists, fearing that the Christian presence in the region is risk. He's dispatched envoys to Iraq with money and other forms of assistance to help refugees. \n \n ___ \n \n 10:05 a.m. \n \n Pope Francis has opened his historic speech to Congress by describing himself as a \"son of this great continent\" joined in a common purpose with America. \n \n The Argentine-born pope is the first from the Americas. And his speech to Congress is the first by any pontiff. \n \n A bipartisan group of congressional leaders escorted him up the aisle for his speech in the House chamber, as tens of thousands waited outside. \n \n ___ \n \n 10:05 a.m. \n \n Pope Francis has arrived in the House chamber for his speech to Congress. \n \n The pontiff walked up the aisle to thunderous applause from standing lawmakers, and paused to shake the hand of Secretary of State John Kerry. \n \n House Speaker John Boehner told lawmakers he had the \"high privilege and distinct honor\" of presenting the pope. \n \n ___ \n \n 9:30 a.m. \n \n With a handshake and a smile, House Speaker John Boehner has welcomed Pope Francis to his ornate ceremonial office in the Capitol prior to the first papal address to Congress in history. \n \n The Ohio Republican told Francis, \"Your Holiness, welcome, really glad that you're here.\" \n \n Boehner's eyes moistened as the pope told him he was glad to be there, too. \n \n The two men then sat next to each other, accompanied by Vatican and church officials and Boehner aides. \n \n Boehner told the pontiff that his staff had urged him to wear the green tie he was sporting. That drew a compliment from Francis, delivered through an interpreter. \n \n The interpreter told Boehner, \"He says it's a tie with the color of hope.\" \n \n Before the pope's arrival, Boehner told those waiting with him that the pope's visit was \"a big deal\" for him, as a Catholic. \n \n ___ \n \n 9:20 a.m. \n \n Pope Francis met briefly with House Speaker John Boehner in an opening act of his historic visit to Congress. \n \n Awaiting the pope's arrival, Boehner repeatedly straightened his tie and shifted from foot to foot, and joked and chatted with reporters about the history of the House furnishings. Their visit lasted only a few minutes. Tens of thousands wait outside, with lawmakers and guests seated in the House chamber for the first speech by a pope to Congress. \n \n ___ \n \n 8:50 a.m. \n \n The pope greeted well-wishers outside the Vatican's diplomatic mission on his way to his historic visit to Congress. \n \n As he did Wednesday, Francis lingered with the excited crowd outside the mission, on another sunny day. Tens of thousands await him on Capitol Hill. \n \n The pope shook hands and touched the faces of schoolchildren, dressed up in ties or Sunday dresses. As the pope moved past, one young boy shouted, \"Oh yeah! I got a selfie.\" \n \n After his speech to Congress, Francis is expected to go to the Hall of Statues, where there is a statue of America's newest saint, Junipero Serra, whom Francis canonized on Wednesday. \n \n Joined by House Speaker John Boehner, he'll then offer to the Library of Congress a special edition of the Bible. Then he's to go to a balcony to greet and offer a benediction to the throngs below. \n \n ___ \n \n 8:30 a.m. \n \n The Federal Aviation Administration is reminding people that Washington, New York and Philadelphia are no-drone zones during the pope's visit to the U.S. \n \n The FAA has put in flight restrictions through Sunday. That means flying a drone or unmanned aircraft anywhere in those cities is against the law and may result in criminal or civil charges. \n \n Pope Francis leaves Washington on Thursday for New York and goes to Philadelphia on Saturday. \n \n ___ \n \n 8:20 a.m. \n \n House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is bringing Tom Steyer, who's a California-based environmentalist and top Democratic donor, and Marc Benioff, a business software CEO, to the House gallery for the pope's speech. \n \n Among other guests, she's also invited Mary Kay Henry, international president of the Service Employees International Union, and Matilda Cuomo, mother of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and widow of former Gov. Mario Cuomo. \n \n ___ \n \n 8:15 a.m. \n \n Security is tight at the Capitol as crowds gather for Pope Francis' arrival. \n \n Streets are closed within a three-block radius of the Capitol and police advise visitors to avoid driving to the scene. The city's subway was packed with riders hours before his speech to Congress but few delays were reported. \n \n Police are visible throughout the Capitol complex and visitors are encountering a series of security checkpoints. \n \n ___ \n \n 8:10 a.m. \n \n \"Mr. Speaker, the pope of the Holy See!\" \n \n Those booming words will announce Pope Francis as he arrives for his historic speech as the first pontiff to address a joint session of Congress. \n \n The man who will perform the ceremonial call is more accustomed to protecting famous people than introducing them. \n \n Paul Irving spent his career in the Secret Service. He was a special agent for 25 years and the service's assistant director from 2001 to 2008. \n \n Speaker John Boehner chose him as House sergeant-at-arms in 2012. \n \n When he's not introducing dignitaries before Congress, his main duty is to oversee security in the House side of the Capitol. \n \n ___ \n \n 8:05 a.m. \n \n Tens of thousands already are gathering on the front lawn of the Capitol to watch the pope's speech on Jumbotron screens and maybe catch a glimpse of Francis. He is expected to wave from a balcony a few hundred yards away. \n \n Libby Miller of Frederick, Maryland, says her friends all told her she was crazy for schlepping to Capitol Hill with her 4-year-old son, Camden, and 2-year-old daughter, Avery. \n \n She left the house before 5 a.m. and settled into a spot on the lawn by 7:30 a.m., about two hours before the pope's scheduled arrival. And she was prepared to keep her kids occupied \u2014 iPad loaded with games, toy trucks, snacks and a sippy cup. \n \n Miller says she wants her kids to be there for an important moment in history. They won't understand it now, but she says \"they'll get it eventually.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 7:45 a.m. \n \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is marking Pope Francis' visit to the Capitol in the modern way: on YouTube. \n \n The Kentucky Republican says in a video Thursday morning that Francis' elevation to pope \"heralded a new beginning for Catholics in Kentucky, across America and from every corner of the world.\" \n \n McConnell praises the pope's \"unique and engaging style\" and says Americans have watched the pope reach new and different audiences, \"both from within his flock and far beyond it.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 7:30 a.m. \n \n Joint gatherings of Congress for dignitaries' speeches are usually a recipe for competing partisan ovations and chummy backslaps and handshakes. \n \n This time, House and Senate leaders have asked lawmakers: Please, not when the pope is here. \n \n The leaders sent an appeal to lawmakers in advance of Pope Francis' speech Thursday morning, asking them to act with decorum in his presence. Among the no-no's \u2014 reaching out for handshakes or conversation with the pope and those accompanying him as they walk down the center aisle of the grand House chamber. \n \n To drum the lesson in, the leaders' letter reminded legislators that the historic event will be seen on television \"around the whole world and by many of our constituents.\" \n \n Leaders have made similar appeals for State of the Union addresses, with little luck. \n \n ___ \n \n 7 a.m. \n \n With his speech Thursday morning, Francis will become the first pope to address Congress. But the list of foreign leaders and dignitaries who've done so is long. \n \n The House historian's office says it's happened 117 previous times. \n \n Francis won't be the first religious leader to address the House and Senate. Technically that was Britain's Queen Elizabeth II in 1991, since the British monarch heads the Anglican Church. \n \n The most addresses to Congress? Three, by both British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \n \n The historian's office lists the first such speech in 1874. That's when Congress heard King Kalakaua of Hawaii, still an independent kingdom then. \n \n The first speech by a foreign leader to lawmakers was in 1824 by the Marquis de Lafayette, the French general who helped the colonies win independence. But he addressed only the House. \n \n ___ \n \n 6:45 a.m. \n \n Francis' speech to Congress is a personal and political coup for House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican and Catholic. \n \n Boehner unsuccessfully invited the two previous popes, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, to speak. He began trying in 1994 during his second House term, organizing a petition by lawmakers saying John Paul II was a \"world leader, ambassador of peace and an important catalyst in the fall of the Iron Curtain.\" \n \n Francis is the fourth pope to meet with a president in the U.S., including presidential visits on six separate trips by John Paul II. \n \n The first was Paul VI's 1965 New York meeting with President Lyndon Johnson. Benedict XVI met President George W. Bush in 2008. \n \n Francis' coming speech at the United Nations will be the fifth by a pope. \n \n ___", "Justice Pope Francis Tells Congress To Abolish The Death Penalty CREDIT: AP Photo/Alex Brandon \n \n In his first ever visit to the U.S. and first speech ever to Congress, Pope Francis called on the nation\u2019s hundreds of representatives to make the death penalty a thing of the past. \n \n \u201cEvery life is sacred, every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes,\u201d he said. \u201cRecently my brother bishops here in the United States renewed their call for the abolition of the death penalty. Not only do I support them, but I also offer encouragement to all those who are convinced that a just and necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension of hope and the goal of rehabilitation.\u201d \n \n Pope Francis said his stance on the issue stems from belief in the Golden Rule, continuing: \u201cIf we want security, let us give security; if we want life, let us give life; if we want opportunities, let us provide opportunities. The yardstick we use for others will be the yardstick which time will use for us. The Golden Rule also reminds us of our responsibility to protect and defend human life at every stage of its development.\u201d \n \n Sitting in the House chambers listening to the speech were several members of the U.S. Supreme Court, which earlier this year issued an opinion upholding the use of a controversial lethal injection drug used in several drawn out, painful, botched executions. The decision went beyond allowing the continued use of a method some consider torture, but defended the entire concept of the death penalty as immune to legal challenge. \n \n Yet one of the Court\u2019s most devout Catholic members, Justice Antonin Scalia, recently suggested they could soon reconsider. Speaking to students at Rhodes College, Scalia said at least four of his colleagues believe the death penalty to be unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment, which bans cruel and unusual punishment. \n \n The Holy See\u2019s call for death penalty abolition is also likely to energize the millions of American church-goers who agree with him, and who have been pushing across the country for a more humane criminal justice system. Faith-based activism, particularly from Catholics, played a major role in Nebraska passing a bill to end the death penalty earlier this year.", "Pope Francis on Thursday exhorted the United States to summon a \u201cspirit of cooperation\u201d to help the poor, save the climate and address the \u201cunjust structures\u201d that he said are afflicting the globe. \n \n Delivering the first-ever papal address to a joint session of Congress, Francis lived up to his reputation as a provocative figure, at one point denouncing the global arms industry as being fueled by \u201cmoney that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood.\u201d \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n Invoking Martin Luther King Jr. and his famous \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech, Francis made an impassioned plea for the refugees fleeing Syria, saying the crisis is \u201cof a magnitude not seen since the Second World War.\u201d \n \n Noting his own status as \u201cthe son of immigrants,\u201d the pope pivoted to a more sensitive subject: The flow of illegal immigrants across the United States's southern border. \n \n He urged compassion for immigrants, warning not to repeat \u201cthe sins and the errors of the past\u201d by turning them away. \n \n \u201cOn this continent, too, thousands of persons are led to travel north in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones, in search of greater opportunities. Is this not what we want for our own children? We must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation,\u201d Francis said, according to his prepared remarks. \n \n \u201cLet us remember the golden rule: \u2018Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,\u2019 \u201d he added. \n \n \u201cThis rule points us in a clear direction. Let us treat others with the same passion and compassion with which we want to be treated. Let us seek for others the same possibilities which we seek for ourselves. Let us help others to grow, as we would like to be helped ourselves.\u201d \n \n Several Democrats applauded as Francis declared, \"We, the people of this continent, are not fearful of foreigners, because most of us were once foreigners.\" \n \n \n \n Most Republicans did not join in the applause, with GOP presidential candidate Sen.

Now is the time for courageous actions and strategies.\u201d \n \n The climate remarks drew a moment of partisanship into the chamber, with many Democrats jumping to their feet to applaud and most Republicans staying in their seats, silent. \n \n Francis\u2019s decision to only briefly mention climate change may have fallen short of some lawmakers\u2019 expectations.

The complex was buzzing with activity well before sunrise as security personnel, staffers, reporters and guests gathered well ahead of the pope\u2019s arrival at 9:15 a.m. \n \n Before the speech, Francis met privately with Speaker John Boehner John Andrew BoehnerThe original Tea Partier exits, stage right A tyranny of the minority is raising your health care costs Rivalry on right emerges between \u2018the two Marks\u2019 MORE (R-Ohio), a Catholic and the person who had extended the invitation to address Congress. \n \n \u201cYour holiness, welcome, really glad that you\u2019re here,\u201d John Boehner John Andrew BoehnerThe original Tea Partier exits, stage right A tyranny of the minority is raising your health care costs Rivalry on right emerges between \u2018the two Marks\u2019 MORE told Francis, eyes welling up as the pope returned the sentiment. \n \n The Speaker told Francis he wore a green tie for the event at the urging of his staff.

Lawmakers had been advised before the speech that the pope must initiate all handshakes. \n \n The Vatican kept a remarkably tight lid on the contents of Francis\u2019s address despite the anticipation leading up to the event. Some Republican lawmakers had hoped Francis would mention abortion as Congress debates defunding Planned Parenthood while trying to avoid a government shutdown next week. \n \n Before arriving in the United States, Francis told reporters it is a mistake to view him as \u201cleftish.\u201d Yet two issues where the Republican Party is in step with the Vatican \u2014 opposition to abortion rights and same-sex marriage \u2014 received only a passing mention from Francis. \n \n \u201cThe golden rule also reminds us of our responsibility to protect and defend human life at every stage of its development,\u201d Francis said, reiterating the Catholic Church\u2019s opposition to the death penalty. \n \n Referring obliquely to same-sex marriage, the pope also said he cannot \u201chide my concern for the family, which is threatened, perhaps as never before, from within and without. \n \n \u201cFundamental relationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of marriage and the family. I can only reiterate the importance and, above all, the richness and the beauty of family life.\u201d \n \n Francis, who played an important role in reestablishing ties between the U.S. and Cuba, made no direct reference to the normalized relations between the two countries. His address came two days after he visited Cuba, before his trip to the U.S., which includes stops in New York City and Philadelphia. \n \n And while the Vatican had offered an endorsement of the Iran nuclear deal earlier this month, Francis did not make a pointed reference to that controversial accord. \n \n \u201cI would like to recognize the efforts made in recent months to help overcome historic differences linked to painful episodes of the past. It is my duty to build bridges and to help all men and women, in any way possible, to do the same,\u201d he said. \n \n The pope's sharpest rhetoric was aimed at military-industrial complexes across the world that he argued are using war for profit. \n \n \u201cHere we have to ask ourselves: Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society? \n \n \u201cIn the face of this shameful and culpable silence, it is our duty to confront the problem and to stop the arms trade,\u201d he said. \n \n Francis did not use one particularly sharp line in his prepared remarks, which had warned politics cannot be a \"slave to the economy and finance.\u201d \n \n Throughout his address Francis referred back to the \u201cfundamental values which will endure forever in the spirit of the American people.\u201d \n \n \u201cPolitics is ... an expression of our compelling need to live as one, in order to build as one the greatest common good: That of a community which sacrifices particular interests in order to share, in justice and peace, its goods, its interests, its social life. \n \n \u201cI do not underestimate the difficulty that this involves,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I encourage you in this effort.\u201d \n \n After the speech, Francis ascended a platform to address the crowd gathered on the Capitol's West lawn, with Boehner and Vice President Biden at his side. \n \n \"I'm so grateful for your presence here. ... And I ask you all please, to pray for me, and if there are among you any who do not believe, or cannot pray, I ask you please to send good wishes my way.\" \n \n \n \n \"Thank you very much, and God bless America.\" \n \n As he turned to depart, Biden was heard on a microphone telling Francis: \"They love you, and we love you.\" \n \n \u2014 This story was last updated at 5:20 p.m. Jordain Carney contributed. \n \n", "Pope Francis: Congress needs to help nation grow Thursday, 24 Sep 2015 | 10:04 AM ET | 04:31 \n \n In a historic presentation to Congress, Pope Francis urged lawmakers on Thursday to take \"courageous actions\" on global warming, poverty and the refugee crisis. \n \n \"I am convinced that we can make a difference and I have no doubt that the United States\u2014and this Congress\u2014have an important role to play,\" the pope said in his prepared speech to a joint meeting of Congress. \n \n \n \n The speech was the first time a pope had addressed Congress. \n \n \"Now is the time for courageous actions and strategies, aimed at implementing a culture of care and an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature,\" the pope said in his prepared remarks.", "Toward the end of Pope Francis\u2019 speech to Congress, the pontiff mentions his desire that \u201cthe family should be a recurrent theme\u201d through his visit to the United States.

(Associated Press) \n \n Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, a leading contender to be Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's pick for vice president, waves to the crowd before attending a private fundraiser event in Newport,... (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Delegates to the Democratic National Convention gave mostly positive reviews to Hillary Clinton's choice for vice president Friday, saying he will appeal to moderates but also do little to soothe disenchanted Bernie Sanders supporters. \n \n Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine received praise for his wide-ranging experience, even as many delegates acknowledged that he would not generate the level of enthusiasm or party unity as a progressive or first-ever Latino pick. Sanders delegates in particular hoped for the selection of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who aligns more closely with Sanders on positions such as regulating Wall Street. \n \n \"People are going to discount Tim Kaine, and have in the past, and it's going to be a lot more exciting than maybe what Bernie Sanders delegates will think,\" said Katie Naranjo, a Clinton superdelegate from Austin, Texas. She said that while Kaine may seem like a \"conventional choice,\" he will balance the ticket well for the general election. \n \n Delegates were heading to Philadelphia for the convention starting Monday, with those who support Sanders indicating uncertainty about embracing a Clinton ticket. Sanders endorsed Clinton last week. \n \n It \"was a horrible pick,\" said Angie Morelli, a Sanders delegate from Nevada. \"In a time when she is trying to cater to Sanders supporters, it was more catering to conservative voters and she's not going to get any wave from it.\" She said she's bothered by Kaine's association with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a global trade pact that Sanders and Clinton oppose. \n \n Dwight Bullard, a Florida state senator, said not one of the 70-plus Sanders delegates in his state including himself is happy with Kaine's selection. He worried that the centrist choice could magnify progressives' view that Clinton will backtrack on issues important to them, such as climate change and tuition aid for college students. \n \n \"If you bring in someone with great credentials, that's fine, but inclusivity of the progressive agenda can be a more important message,\" Bullard said. \n \n Sanders delegates were mulling ways to show support for Sanders during the convention, such as a walkout after the roll call of states Tuesday, according to excerpts of a Slack thread Friday obtained by The Associated Press. But many others also said they wanted to get direction from Sanders, who was scheduled to meet privately with his delegates Monday. \n \n \"Delegates are intensely discussing and considering options,\" said Norman Solomon, a San Francisco delegate who called Kaine's selection \"unacceptable.\" Solomon leads the Bernie Delegates Network, a loose organization of more than 1,200 delegates. \n \n Clinton settled on Kaine after vetting a diverse group of candidates that included Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro and Labor Secretary Tom Perez. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, one of two black senators, was also considered. \n \n Clinton delegate Roger Salazar of California said he was rooting for Clinton to select Rep. Xavier Becerra, a Hispanic and one of the most powerful Democrats in the House. But Salazar, a longtime party strategist, called Kaine \"a pretty solid choice.\" \n \n Jocelyn Bucaro, an Ohio superdelegate and Clinton supporter, praised Kaine as someone who will appeal to a broad range of voters in swing states, even Republicans uncomfortable with Trump. \n \n \"The most important consideration is his ability to step in as president, and he clearly has the experience, knowledge, intelligence and temperament to do that,\" Bucaro said. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Will Weissert in Austin, Texas; Michelle Rindels in Las Vegas; Michael Blood in Los Angeles; and Dan Sewell in Cincinnati, Ohio, contributed to this report. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Hope Yen on Twitter at https://twitter.com/hopeyen1", "Tim Kaine's support of the TPP is not sitting well with some liberal groups. | Getty Kaine pick draws mixed reviews from liberals While Wall Street lobbyists rejoice, progressive groups are less than thrilled. \n \n Hillary Clinton\u2019s unveiling of Tim Kaine as her vice presidential pick was greeted by mixed reactions from liberal groups on Friday night. But one constituency breathed a sigh of relief: Wall Street. \n \n While some praised his consistent support of labor and women\u2019s rights, several progressive organizations were quick to criticize Clinton's newly minted running mate, urging the Democratic ticket to adopt a more \u201cpopulist\u201d stance on trade and financial regulation. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n \u201cThe mood of the country is a populist one,\u201d said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of Progressive Change Campaign Committee, in a statement emailed minutes after Kaine was announced. \u201cUnfortunately, since Tim Kaine voted to fast track the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Republicans now have a new opening to attack Democrats on this economic populist issue.\u201d \n \n Taylor said that Clinton, who supported the 11-country Pacific trade pact as secretary of state before reversing her stance last fall, has opened up a line of attack from Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has ripped such agreements as \"bad deals\" for the United States. \n \n \"As we saw in Donald Trump\u2019s speech last night, Republicans will run hard against Democrats on trade this year,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cClinton should push the White House to take TPP off the table in a lame duck Congress in order to avoid this vice presidential pick allowing Donald Trump to outflank her on this key issue.\" \n \n According to a report in the Huffington Post, Kaine has told Clinton he now opposes the TPP, though he praised the agreement as recently as Thursday. \n \n The PCCC's criticism comes after another progressive group, Democracy for America, denounced Kaine in a pre-emptive strike issued before Clinton even announced her pick. \n \n \u201cIt should be disqualifying for any potential Democratic vice presidential candidate to be part of a lobbyist-driven effort to help banks dodge consumer protection standards and regulations designed to prevent banks from destroying our economy,\u201d the group\u2019s executive director Charles Chamberlain said in a statement Thursday, referencing a letter Kaine signed urging the Federal Reserve to consider easing regulations on regional banks. \n \n Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, who backed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary, was among those on the left who expressed disappointment with the decision, tweeting: \u201cAtt\u2019n Hillary campaign: It\u2019s not Trump who\u2019ll beat u. It\u2019s the people who are going to stay home.\u201d \n \n While most mainstream groups seemed happy with the choice of Kaine, the risk, some Democratic operatives said, was that Clinton might have just re-opened a rift with the left wing of the party that Trump could exploit. \n \n \u201cThe risk with picking Kaine isn\u2019t about Clinton thumbing her nose to the Bernie Bros, it\u2019s about losing the Rust Belt (where anti-trade and anti-Wall St. sentiment is high),\u201d a Democratic strategist with ties to the region told POLITICO in an email. \u201cBetween the Ohio and PA polls and the Brexit vote, this seems like it could be a big risk.\u201d \n \n Prominent labor groups, however, met the Kaine announcement with open arms. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka praised Kaine\u2019s \u201cstrong record on workers\u2019 issues\u201d while the SEIU vouched for the senator\u2019s labor bona fides, saying in a statement: \u201cWe know what is in Tim Kaine\u2019s heart.\u201d \n \n Despite his personal opposition to abortion, Kaine also received strong approval from several women\u2019s rights groups, including the National Organization for Women (NOW), which hailed the senator as a \"proven leader\" who as vice president would \"work to break down the barriers that hold women and marginalized communities back.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe combination of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine stands in sharp contrast to the turn-back-the-clock, step up the war on women platform of Donald Trump and Mike Pence,\u201d NOW President Terry O'Neill said in a statement. \u201cWomen know this is the most important election in a generation, and we also know that we have a steadfast advocate in Tim Kaine.\u201d \n \n Stephanie Schriock, the influential head of Emily\u2019s List, tweeted, \u201cThe strongest ticket for women and families just got even stronger.\u201d \n \n As if to head off potential criticism, the Clinton campaign cast Kaine as a progressive in its statements on Friday. In an email to supporters explaining her decision, Clinton described Kaine as \u201ca lifelong fighter for progressive causes.\u201d \n \n And Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted out a list of Kaine\u2019s ratings from several progressive groups -- all of which have larger followings than either the PCCC or DFA. \n \n Kaine's ratings from key progressive groups: \n \n Brady Campaign 100% \n \n Human Rights Campaign 100% \n \n Planned Parenthood 100% \n \n AFL CIO 96% \n \n NAACP 96% \u2014 Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) July 23, 2016 \n \n Wall Street lobbyists, meanwhile, reacted with relief to the Kaine selection on Friday, not because the senator is particularly soft on financial reform but because his name is not Elizabeth Warren. \n \n \u201cHe has demonstrated some interest in banking issues as evidenced by last week\u2019s letter,\u201d one of the top Wall Street lobbyists in Washington emailed POLITICO, referring to the letter to the Fed that Kaine signed. \u201cHe's a sign of Hillary being Hippocratic in her pick -- he does no harm.

Here are six things to know: \n \n He\u2019s held a lot of public offices \n \n Kaine \u2014 who is now Virginia's junior senator \u2014 was previously the governor of the state. Prior to that, he served as lieutenant governor, mayor of Richmond and on the Richmond city council. \n \n He is one of just 20 people to have served as a mayor, governor and U.S. senator. He was also head of the Democratic National Committee from 2009 to 2011. \n \n His state is very important in November \n \n Kaine represents a crucial swing state that Clinton will need to win in November. It used to be solidly Republican, but President Obama won in 2008 and 2012. And Virginia's rapidly growing population is making the state more diverse. \n \n He\u2019s relatively boring, and he's totally OK with that \n \n Kaine has no problem with critics calling him boring. In fact, he\u2019s milking it for all it\u2019s worth. \u201cI am boring,\u201d he said in an interview with Meet the Press in June. \u201cBut boring is the fastest-growing demographic in this country.\u201d \n \n Fluent in Spanish \n \n Kaine is fluent in Spanish because he took a year off from Harvard to run a technical school in Honduras for a year. He got major points when he gave a 14-minute speech on immigration entirely in Spanish on the Senate floor in 2013. He was the \"first senator of the modern era to deliver a Senate floor speech entirely in Spanish,\u201d according to The Washington Post. \n \n The gifts \n \n While Kaine is generally described as scandal free, he does have a snafu on his record. During his time as governor and lieutenant governor, he accepted more than $160,000 worth of gifts, according to Politico. While that was all legal under Virginia law, some critics say the acceptance of a Caribbean vacation, $5,500 in clothes and a trip to watch George Mason University play in the Final Four, among other things, at the very least doesn't look great. \n \n He's been through this before \n \n Kaine was among Obama\u2019s top three choices for his running mate in 2008. Obama described it as a coin toss between then-senators Joe Biden and Evan Bayh but added \"Kaine is still a distinct possibility,\u201d according to campaign manager David Plouffe\u2019s book The Audacity to Win. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2a6O4dm"], "summary": "\u2013 Hillary Clinton has joined Donald Trump in selecting a white man from a swing state who describes himself as \"boring\" for a running mate\u2014and liberal Democrats, especially Bernie Sanders supporters, aren't exactly fired up about Sen.

(KOIN) \u2014 With the Oregon Legislature set to convene on February 1, Republicans and Democrats will gather in Salem to decide how best to deal with the state\u2019s $1.8 billion budget gap, whether to ditch the statewide ban on rent control and other pressing issues. \n \n Oregon\u2019s Budget \n \n A budget framework for the 2017-2019 biennium was released on January 19 by the Co-Chairs of the Joint Ways and Means Committee, and it detailed how Oregon\u2019s incoming revenue is 8% lower than what\u2019s needed at current levels. \n \n The framework listed a number of spending categories where cuts would need to take place, including education and health care. Needless to say, the cuts would have a large impact on several departments and would lead to layoffs in schools, declining health insurance coverage for Oregonians covered by the Oregon Health Plan, declining state funding for TANF and more. Furthermore, cuts to state funding could trigger a reduction in federal funding, creating a much greater loss to programs. \n \n After the framework was released, House Republican Caucus Budget Chair Greg Smith, R-Heppner, issued the following statement: \n \n \u201cLike many Oregonians, I am deeply frustrated by the financial situation our state finds itself in. It is difficult to comprehend that at the same time our state is taking in record tax revenues, we are being told we do not have enough money to pay our bills.\u201d \n \n Smith went on to say House Republicans \u201cstand ready\u201d to work with Democrats in order to deliver on a budget that\u2019ll acknowledge the need for spending reform. \n \n Gov. Kate Brown unveiled her budget in December 2016, focusing on education, health care and job growth. \n \n She proposed closing a loophole in so-called pass-through taxes, increasing a tobacco tax and discarding the customary increases in budgets for state universities and community colleges. Her budget will also look for inefficiencies, including keeping vacant state jobs open for 60 days and eliminating non-mandatory travel for state employees. Together, cuts and revenue increases are expected to address the current $1.8 billion gap. \n \n Statewide Ban on Rent Control \n \n With rent prices in Portland continuing to climb, many in the Rose City (like Commissioner Chloe Eudaly) are calling for quick action to protect renters. In November 2016, Eudaly called for a rent freeze and an end to no-cause evictions. A poll in September 2016 found 52% of Oregonians support repealing the statewide ban on rent control. \n \n In response to these calls for action, House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland, filed House Bill 2001 to repeal Oregon\u2019s ban on city and county ordinances regulating rents. Her bill also aims to allow cities and counties to adopt rent stabilization programs (with certain restrictions) and impose a temporary moratorium on rent increases greater than 5% for residential tenancies (with some exceptions). \n \n The House Speaker announced that she supported a state limit on rent increases and banning no-cause evictions at the state level back in September 2016. \n \n A similar bill, sponsored by multiple representatives, also seeks to allow cities and counties to create ordinances regulating rent. Like Kotek\u2019s legislation, House Bill 2003 would also repeal ORS 91.225 (the legislation prohibiting local rent control). House Bill 2003 differs, in that it doesn\u2019t contain a cap on rent increases. \n \n Both bills will face opposition from House Republicans. \n \n A spokesman for House Republicans told KOIN 6 News more government intrusion into the marketplace wasn\u2019t the answer to high rent prices. House Republicans said although rent control is potentially beneficial in the very short-term, it has proven to have negative impacts in the long-term. They cite a consensus among economists that rent control doesn\u2019t produce the results it aims to achieve. \n \n House Republicans believe that high rent prices are a result of a \u201cbasic breakdown in the laws of supply and demand\u201d and suggest relieving pressure by incentivizing the development and construction of affordable units, to increase supply and lower demand. \n \n Rural Communities \n \n House Republicans said they want to prioritize rural Oregon during this legislative session by \u201cforcing the majority party to be mindful of the impact of new laws on rural communities\u201d and \u201cadvocating for policies that will help incentivize economic growth in rural Oregon.\u201d \n \n Despite the Portland-metro area having recovered from the depths of the great recession, some rural communities have not yet bounced back. \n \n Rural Oregon still has a high unemployment rate, lower annual incomes for its workforce and downward demographic trends, according to the State of Oregon Employment Department. \n \n Kotek also mentioned rural communities in her opening day remarks, saying \u201cDespite these successes, we have more work to do to build an economy that creates equal opportunity for all. We cannot leave our rural communities behind as the state\u2019s economy grows.\u201d \n \n She went on to speak on equal pay for women and supporting working families through affordable child care and policies that\u2019ll allow workers to care for family members. \n \n Justice and Ethics \n \n In 2015, Oregon outlawed profiling by law enforcement based on race, ethnicity or other characteristics. \n \n Kotek said she wants to \u201ctake the next steps\u201d down that road, including setting up data collection, policies and training necessary to further cut down on profiling. \n \n She also wants the legislature to consider reforms to how people are charged for certain drug offenses, how grand juries operate and to adequately fund public defense and increase support for legal assistance in civil cases. \n \n Meanwhile, House Republicans are drafting legislation to limit the number of Salem employees that move from influential government positions to eventually turning into lobbyists that interact with the government, as well as the reverse. \n \n The legislature will also have a number of other important issues to tackle, and it all begins in just over a week.", "In Boston Harbor, a group of Massachusetts colonists disguised as Mohawk Indians board three British tea ships and dump 342 chests of tea into the harbor. \n \n The midnight raid, popularly known as the \u201cBoston Tea Party,\u201d was in protest of the British Parliament\u2019s Tea Act of 1773, a bill designed to save the faltering East India Company by greatly lowering its tea tax and granting it a virtual monopoly on the American tea trade. The low tax allowed the East India Company to undercut even tea smuggled into America by Dutch traders, and many colonists viewed the act as another example of taxation tyranny. \n \n When three tea ships, the Dartmouth, the Eleanor, and the Beaver, arrived in Boston Harbor, the colonists demanded that the tea be returned to England.

Credit: NASA As if 2016 has not been long enough, the year's dying minute will last an extra second to make up for time lost to Earth's slowing rotation, timekeepers say. \n \n Countries that use Coordinated Universal Time\u2014several West African nations, Britain, Ireland and Iceland\u2014will add the leap second during the midnight countdown to 2017\u2014making the year's final minute 61 seconds long. \n \n For others, the timing will be determined by the time zone they live in, relative to UTC. \n \n \"This extra second, or leap second, makes it possible to align astronomical time, which is irregular and determined by Earth's rotation, with UTC which is extremely stable and has been determined by atomic clocks since 1967,\" the Paris Observatory said in a statement. \n \n The observatory houses the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), responsible for synchronising time. \n \n \"The sequence of dates of the UTC second markers will be: 2016 December 31 23h 59m 59s, 2016 December 31 23h 59m 60s, 2017 January 1, 0h 0m 0s,\" the IERS website states. \n \n The adjustment is necessary because Earth's rotation is not regular\u2014it sometimes speeds up, sometimes slows down, but is gradually slowing overall. \n \n This is caused by factors including the Moon's gravitational Earth-braking forces, which give rise to the ocean tides. \n \n The result is that astronomical time\u2014based on the length of an Earth day\u2014 gradually falls out of sync with atomic time\u2014which is measured by nearly 400 super-accurate atomic clocks dotted around the world. \n \n Leap year, too \n \n Atomic time or TAI, in turn, is used to determine UTC, used for civil timekeeping globally. \n \n TAI is exactly 36 seconds ahead of UTC, a difference that keeps growing as leap seconds are added, and will reach 37 seconds on January 1. \n \n When leap seconds were introduced in 1972, 10 seconds had to be added to UTC, followed by another roughly every 18 months thereafter, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the US Department of Commerce. \n \n The last was added on June 30, 2015. \n \n \"Leap seconds are added in order to keep the difference between UTC and astronomical time (UT1) to less than 0.9 seconds,\" the NIST website explains. \n \n \"Usually leap seconds are added when UTC is ahead of UT1 by 0.4 seconds or more.\" \n \n The process, it added, can create problems for data logging applications and telecommunications systems. \n \n \"Special attention must be given to these systems each time there is a leap second.\" \n \n 2016 has also had a leap day\u2014February 29\u2014a four-yearly occurrence to keep the calendar synchronised with Earth's movement around the Sun. \n \n Explore further: 2016 will be one second longer", "Share this page! \n \n Time zone \n \n Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), UTC +0 \n \n The IANA time zone identifier for UTC is UTC.", "What leap seconds are, how they are implemented and their future. \n \n What is a leap second? \n \n A leap second is a second added to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) in order to keep it synchronized with astronomical time. UTC is an atomic time scale, based on the performance of atomic clocks that are more stable than the Earth's rotational rate. Astronomical time (UT1), or mean solar time, is based on the rotation of Earth, which is irregular. \n \n \n \n There are two main reasons that cause leap seconds to occur. The first is that the duration of the atomic second was measured and defined by comparing cesium clocks to the Ephemeris Time (ET) scale, an obsolete time scale that defined the second as a fraction of the tropical year. The duration of the ephemeris second was slightly shorter than the mean solar second and this characteristic was passed along to the atomic second. If the atomic second had been defined with respect to the mean solar second, it is likely that leap seconds would have been required much less frequently. The second reason for leap seconds is that the speed of the Earth's rotation is not constant. It sometimes speeds up, and sometimes slows down, but when averaged over long intervals the trend indicates that it is gradually slowing. This gradual decrease in the rotational rate is causing the duration of the mean solar second to gradually increase with respect to the atomic second. \n \n \n \n For information about past leap seconds and the measured differences between UTC and UT1, please see the NIST Time Scale Data Archive. \n \n How often do we have leap seconds? \n \n Leap seconds are added in order to keep the difference between UTC and astronomical time (UT1) to less than 0.9 seconds. The International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), measures Earth's rotation and publishes the difference between UT1 and UTC. Usually leap seconds are added when UTC is ahead of UT1 by 0.4 seconds or more. At the time the corrections started in 1972, a necessary correction of ten seconds was made to UTC, and there have been leap seconds about every year and a half (on average). The current difference between UTC and UT1 is shown in our leap second archive web page. \n \n When do leap seconds occur? \n \n Leap seconds have always occurred at the end of December or the end of June, on the last second of the UTC day. The designation of the sequence of seconds is: \n \n \n \n 23h 59m 59s \n \n 23h 59m 60s \n \n 00h 00m 00s \n \n \n \n Are there benefits and/or detriments to adding leap seconds? \n \n By keeping Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) within one second of astronomical time, scientists and astronomers observing celestial bodies can use UTC for most purposes. If there were no longer a correction to UTC for leap seconds, then adjustments would have to be made to time stamps and legacy equipment and software which synchronize to UTC for astronomical observations. However, adding a second to UTC can create problems for some systems, including data logging applications, telecommunication systems and time distribution services. Special attention must be given to these systems each time there is a leap second. \n \n What is the future of leap seconds? \n \n Some proposals have been made to implement larger corrections like leap hours, which would occur much less often than leap seconds. Also, it has been suggested to stop corrections to UTC and publish the growing difference between UTC and UT1. The relatively small community that needs UT1 could then use the published values as a correction. Discussions of the future of leap seconds are ongoing at meetings of the Radiocommunication Sector of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-R). \n \n How is a leap second related to a leap year? \n \n Leap seconds and leap years are both implemented to keep our time in accordance with the position of Earth. However, leap seconds are added when needed, based on measurements, and leap years are regularly occurring events based on set rules. During leap years, an extra day is added as February 29th to keep the calendar synchronized with the precession of the Earth around the Sun. Leap years are necessary because the actual length of the year is 365.2422 days and not 365. The extra day is added every four years to compensate for most of the partial day. However, this is a slight over-compensation, so some century years are not leap years. Only every fourth century year (those equally divisible by 400) is a leap year. For instance, 2000 was a leap year, but 1900, 1800 and 1700 were not. \n \n \n \n For additional information about leap years, please see the exhibit on calendars on our time exhibits page.", "If you can't wait for 2016 to be over, I have some bad news; it's going to be a little bit longer than expected. In July of this year, the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS)\u2014which regulates the international clock\u2014announced that 2016 will end in a leap second. An extra tick will be inserted into the year to make up for unpredictable variations to the Earth's rotation, and that means before we hop into 2017, the clock will strike an unusual 23:59:60. \n \n Leap seconds are not particularly strange. We had one back in the summer of 2015, and when everybody is ready for one, you hardly even notice that anything has happened. But these leap seconds do pose unique problems for timekeeping computers, which are unable to conceive of a 61st second by the very nature of their coding. In a way, it's a Y2K-esque problem. Simple math for a human, borderline brain-frying for a computer. \n \n This is a particular problem for companies like Google, which run Network Time Protocol servers, internet clocks your laptop sets its watch to. The immediately obvious solution is to add an extra second to these servers, bam. But as Google points out in a blog post, that's not as easy as it sounds because most computers and operating systems don't understand a 61st second. In order for that to work, literally every device involved has to understand that something weird is going on and that's only happening this one time. In the past, attempting this solution has caused a number of real problems. \n \n So Google came up with a different, extremely elegant plan. The weird part is that it will take 20 hours: \n \n Instead of adding a single extra second to the end of the day, we'll run the clocks 0.0014% slower across the ten hours before and ten hours after the leap second, and \"smear\" the extra second across these twenty hours. \n \n If you check the math you can see how this \"smeared time\" works: \n \n 20 hours = 1,200 minutes = 72,000 seconds \n \n 72,000 seconds x .000014 (.0014%) = 1.08 seconds \n \n Though given that extra .08 second on there, it seems like the .0014% number is probably rounded, or altered in some other way. \n \n This isn't a brand new idea. Google's first came up with it in 2008, and other companies in similar positions have tried variations, though the specifics vary. For the 2015 leap second, Amazon Web Services slowed its clocks by 1/86400 (.001157407%) for a day before the jump, smearing the extra second over the preceding 24 hours so its clocks would be one second slow at the time of the one-second jump. Another cloud company, Akamai, is doing the same thing this year, using a 24-hour smear. \n \n Google's 20-hour smear is an outlier, but not due to any illusions that this method is superior. As Google's developer page notes, the choice is to make things easy on Google's existing infrastructure, and the company proposes that everyone adopt a standard noon-to-noon, 24-hour smear, with the leap second dead center, instead of on the end. \n \n The end result? With any luck you won't notice a damn thing. But when you're watching the clock tick down to the first second of 2017, take a moment to appreciate all the math that's being put to work to give you that precious little quantifiable illusion we call time.", "Like a man eager to show off his new watch, Google is encouraging anyone running IT operations to ask it for the time. \n \n The company will let anyone use its NTP (Network Time Protocol) servers, a move to help IT shops cope with the next \u201cleap second,\u201d which will be tacked onto 2016 just after midnight on Dec. 31. \n \n Leap seconds help to keep clocks aligned with Earth\u2019s rotation, which can vary due to geologic and even weather conditions. But an extra second can wreak havoc with applications and services that depend on systems being tightly synchronized. \n \n Most Internet-connected devices get their time through NTP, an open-source technology that's used all over the world. NTP has its own problems, mainly around funding, but it's long been the standard. Google runs its own NTP servers and uses them to ease its systems through leap seconds, according to Michael Shields, technical lead on the company\u2019s Time Team, in a blog post on Wednesday. \n \n Time synchronization is critical for many things Google\u2019s systems do, such as keeping replicas up to date, determining which data-affecting operation happened last, and correctly reporting the order of searches and clicks, the company says. \n \n Ordinary operating systems can\u2019t accommodate a minute that\u2019s 61 seconds long, so some organizations have used special-case workarounds for the extra second. But sometimes these methods raise issues, like what happens to write operations that take place during that second. At times in the past, some Google systems have refused to work when faced with a leap second, though this didn\u2019t affect the company\u2019s services, a Google representative said. \n \n So Google will modify its NTP servers to run clocks 0.0014 percent slower for 10 hours before the leap second and for 10 hours afterward. When the leap second takes place, they will have accounted for it already. Google\u2019s been using this technique, called \u201csmeared time,\u201d since a leap second in 2008. \n \n Enterprises running virtual-machine instances on Google Compute Engine, and those using Google APIs, will want to keep their own systems synchronized with Google\u2019s slightly slower clocks during that 20-hour period. Client systems will also have to be set to that time in order to work with those servers. And it won\u2019t work to run some servers on smeared time and some on regular time, because then clients won\u2019t know which time to follow, Google says. \n \n So the company is making its NTP servers available free through the Google Public NTP service. Users can take advantage of the service by configuring their network settings to use time.google.com as their NTP server. The company laid out detailed instructions for synchronizing systems to its smeared time. \n \n Google won\u2019t be the only company smearing time on Dec. 31. Akamai plans to slow down its clocks over a 24-hour period around the leap second. Amazon and Microsoft have done the same thing in the past. \n \n In fact, the big cloud companies look ready to standardize on a 24-hour \u201cleap smear.\u201d Google plans to use the longer transition for the next leap second, partly to ease more slowly into extra second and partly to align itself with other companies. There\u2019s no date yet for the next leap second, but Google expects it to come in 2018. \n \n Leap seconds began in 1972 and are now administered by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS).

By this point, it had been 10 days since they'd sat on the Martinique beach. \n \n When doctors at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, England, examined the 52-year-old woman, they saw a wavy, red rash on her bottom. Her husband had a similar-looking rash on his backside, and doctors diagnosed both of them with \"cutaneous larva migrans,\" according to the case report. \n \n This is a skin condition caused by a hookworm infection. The most common culprit for the infection in the Caribbean is the hookworm Ancylostoma braziliense, according to the case report. \n \n People can pick up the parasite after encountering hookworm larvae; these can be excreted in the feces of an infected animal, typically a dog or cat, onto sandy beaches or moist soil, the report said. \n \n A high percentage of dogs and cats are infected with hookworm, especially strays, said Dr. Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who was not involved in the couple's case. When these animals defecate on the beach, hookworm larvae can easily migrate through the sand, he said. \n \n But Caribbean beaches aren't the only places you can find hookworms; some beaches along the Gulf Coast of the U. S. and the Atlantic seaboard may also be teaming with the parasites, Hotez told Live Science. [10 Ways the Beach Can Kill You] \n \n For a person to become infected with hookworm, there has to be direct contact between the skin and the larvae of the worm, Hotez said. That means that walking barefoot on contaminated beach may cause the infection. Hotez said he speculates that this couple may have sat bare-bottomed on the sand, or the sand may have gotten into their bathing suits. \n \n Once a hookworm larva penetrates a person's skin, it can burrow around, leaving a trail-like rash of inflamed skin known as a \"creeping eruption,\" Hotez said. Sometimes, the rash can have a winding appearance, as was the case for this couple, or sometimes it can look like lines on the skin, he noted. (The species of hookworm that is thought to have infected the couple can't reproduce in humans; as a result, when the worms infect humans, they typically burrow around in the skin until they die, Live Science previously reported.) \n \n Doctors prescribed anti-parasitic medication to the husband and wife, according to the report. But five days later, the woman went to the emergency room because she was experiencing shortness of breath, a dry cough and chest pain. Her husband also developed a dry cough. \n \n A small percentage of people with cutaneous larva migrans may get symptoms in their lungs, Hotez said. When this occurs, it means the larvae got into the bloodstream and were carried to the lungs, he said. \n \n A chest X-ray can show if the larvae have infiltrated the lungs, Hotez said. And indeed, there was evidence of this in both the man and the woman, according to the case report. \n \n Lung-related symptoms tend to happen when there is significant exposure to hookworm larvae, Hotez noted; in other words, a person would have to be infected with a large number of larvae. \n \n The couple was given a second dose of anti-parasitic medication, and the treatment quickly helped clear up their skin as well as their lungs, according to the case report. \n \n Originally published on Live Science.", "1/50 27 February 2018 Icicles hang from a frozen elephant fountain in Colchester.

Hookworm was once widespread in the United States, particularly in the southeastern region, but improvements in living conditions have greatly reduced hookworm infections. Hookworm, Ascaris, and whipworm are known as soil-transmitted helminths (parasitic worms). Together, they account for a major burden of disease worldwide. \n \n Hookworms live in the small intestine. Hookworm eggs are passed in the feces of an infected person. If the infected person defecates outside (near bushes, in a garden, or field) of if the feces of an infected person are used as fertilizer, eggs are deposited on soil. They can then mature and hatch, releasing larvae (immature worms). The larvae mature into a form that can penetrate the skin of humans. Hookworm infection is mainly acquired by walking barefoot on contaminated soil. One kind of hookworm can also be transmitted through the ingestion of larvae. \n \n Most people infected with hookworms have no symptoms. Some have gastrointestinal symptoms, especially persons who are infected for the first time. The most serious effects of hookworm infection are blood loss leading to anemia, in addition to protein loss. Hookworm infections are treatable with medication prescribed by your health care provider. \n \n Image: L: Filariform (L3) hookworm larva in a wet mount.

Credit: DPDx", "Medical and scientific journals withdraw or retract articles on a regular basis, usually because of errors discovered or questions raised about the research described. A few days ago, however, a highly unusual \u201ccorrection\u201d appeared in the prestigious British Medical Journal announcing the withdrawal of a case study titled \u201cCutaneous larva migrans with pulmonary involvement.\u201d \n \n The article, which was not retracted, contained no errors. The BMJ simply said in the undated note that \u201cwith no admission of liability, BMJ has removed this article voluntarily at the request of the patient concerned.\u201d \n \n Here\u2019s what happened. \n \n While sunbathing on a beach in Martinique, a British woman suddenly felt a burning sensation on her backside. The next day, she woke up to find a nasty rash of \u201cred pinprick marks\u201d on her bottom. \n \n Soon her husband broke out with the same rash in the same unfortunate place. \n \n While they received treatment in Martinique in the form of steroid cream, antibiotics and antifungal medication, the irritation did not subside. The voyage home, 10 days on a cruise ship, must have been uncomfortable. \n \n Nor was the rash gone when they got home. \n \n So they went for treatment at Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital in Cambridge, England. Doctors there found their backsides \u201cinfested by worms,\u201d as the Cambridge News reported. The couple found relief from a combination of medications. \n \n The doctors thought their case so interesting they wrote it up for the British Medical Journal. The journal did not use the name of the patients. But as journals often do in case studies, it accompanied the text with photos \u2014 in this case, of their backsides, from different angles, in full color. \n \n The couple gave their permission and were warned that journal articles were often read by journalists as well as medical professionals, the BMJ said in an email to The Washington Post. But the couple apparently had not anticipated the potential for tabloid interest. \n \n By mid-January, their buttocks were spread across Britain and, indeed the world, with headlines such as \u201cTil Rash Do Us Part\u201d in The Sun and \u201cCaribbean getaway leaves a nasty souvenir\u201d in the Daily Mail. \n \n These were not your typical titillating tabloid photos.

Because the article was being picked up in nonmedical publications, a request was made for it to be removed.\u201d \n \n In fairness to the tabloids, there was some news and public service value to the stories useful to people planning on visits to tropical or subtropical beaches. \n \n The diagnosis, as described by Livescience, quoting the no-longer-accessible case study, was \u201ccutaneous larva migrans,\u201d otherwise known as a hookworm infection. \n \n According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people pick up this nasty parasite from the feces of dogs and cats. If those dogs and cats leave their waste on a beach, sunbathers can contract the infection. \n \n In the case of the British couple, the infection found its way into their lungs, causing coughing, and in the woman, shortness of breath and pain. \n \n The advice from the CDC for those visiting such beaches: \u201cwear shoes and use protecting mats or other coverings to prevent direct skin contact with sand or soil.\u201d \n \n More from Morning Mix: \n \n Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf tipped off immigrants about ICE raid and isn\u2019t sorry she did \n \n Flawed drug tests used to remove scores of Canadian children from their parents, report finds"], "summary": "\u2013 After suffering painful red rashes on their backsides, a husband and wife were left red in the face\u2014so much so that a case study of their ordeal has now been pulled from the prestigious British Medical Journal.

In what the Post calls a \"highly unusual 'correction,'\" the journal then announced it was pulling the article despite standing by its content. As the Independent reports, the article was meant to helpful in combating a lack of familiarity in the medical community with hookworm infections.

But the Cameron government has made them feel less welcome in recent years. \n \n Indeed, the Conservatives campaigned on control immigration and capping welfare. \n \n Among its platforms, \"Introducing a new citizen test with British values at its heart.\" \n \n Conservatives have been pushed further to the right by another party, the UK Independence Party, or UKIP, which is anti-immigration and unfriendly towards Islam. \n \n UKIP picked up electoral gains, which will not make them a power in parliament but may get their voices heard more by Conservatives afraid of losing to them in the next election. \n \n \"Although people will portray this as as a great Conservative victory -- and against the expectations it is -- Cameron's problems now are only just beginning because, if he's only got a very small majority, he's going to be in hock to the extreme right wing of his party,\" said Professor Robert Hazell, of University College London. \n \n This right wing includes 10 to 20 \"repeat rebels\" who could cause Cameron major headaches, he said. \n \n It means diminishing influence globally \n \n There was a time when the United States had an influential ally in Britain.

They've left that to Merkel. Ditto when it comes to acting as the intermediary between Kiev and Moscow over Ukraine.

Returns show his Conservative Party close to winning a majority of parliament. (May 8) AP \n \n An exit poll that predicts the Conservative Party led by Prime Minister David Cameron will win 316 seats in Parliament is projected onto BBC Broadcasting House in London on May 7, 2015. (Photo: Jack Taylor, AFP/Getty Images) \n \n LONDON \u2014 Despite dire polls for the Conservative Party \u2014 Tories \u2014 throughout the campaign and even with a turn to favor opposition Labour in the last few days, Tory party insiders have maintained a steely optimism about Thursday night's parliamentary vote in Britain. \n \n The Tories would come out on top because the election was about the economy, and on that issue there was no doubt: Voters trusted them more than the Labour Party. And the polls, they felt, were wrong because, historically, the British don't like to admit that they might vote Tory, with its reputation as the \"mean\" party. \n \n But by 10 p.m., when the exit polls were released \u2014 with the nation quite literally on the edge of its seat, gathered at election parties everywhere \u2014 the Tories appeared to be proved right. Rather than the best-case predictions by many pollsters and observers of 276 seats for the Tories, they would likely get 316 of the 326 needed for an absolute majority. Not over the top, but in easy sight of putting together a governing coalition. \n \n Disbelief was, among all non-Tories, the singular immediate response. \n \n Spokespeople for the devastated Labour Party, which exit polls put at 239 seats, simply refused to accept the results, continuing to argue with flabbergasted expressions that somehow magically when the actual results came in, they would find the 50 seats they would need to block another Tory government. \n \n The other big losers were the Liberal Democrats, the current coalition partner in the Tory-led government. They were equally ravaged by a fall from 57 seats to a projected 10, looking wide-eyed and incredulous on live television. Such a large drop might mean that much of the party's leadership, possibly including Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, would be wiped away. \n \n Even the other big winner, according to the projections, the Scottish National Party (SNP), which looked like it might take all of Labour's seats in Scotland and advancing from 6 to 58 seats in all, said it was skeptical of such an overwhelming victory. \n \n But the numbers for both the Tory's and SNP were so large, and the numbers for Labour and the Lib Dems so bleak and depressing, that even a correction in the exit polls was unlikely to change the clear and extraordinary direction of the results. \n \n British Prime Minister and Conservative leader David Cameron, left, departs from a polling station after voting with his wife Samantha, at the village of Spelsbury in Oxfordshire on May 7, 2015. (Photo: Andy Rain, EPA) \n \n David Cameron's Tories were in a position not only to form a new coalition and working majority, but to do so with very little horse-trading. The centrist Lib Dems had hoped that even if they lost seats they would be king makers in what was expected to be a close split between Labour and the Tories. Now, practically speaking, they would have no place to go except to follow the Tories, and they would have no leverage with which to negotiate a favorable place in a new coalition. \n \n In fact, at 316 seats, the Tories could easily turn to the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), with its eight projected seats to reach the voting majority of 323 (Sinn F\u00e9in, another Irish party, has five seats, but, in protest, doesn't sit). \n \n It is not just the Tories unexpected strength that appears now to recast U.K. politics, but it is also Labour's weakness. If the election projections hold, Labour's leader, Ed Miliband, will likely resign or be forced out by the end of the week. \n \n It is also the rise of the SNP, likely more determined, more militant and far larger than anyone imagined it might ever be, that would become perhaps the central issue in British politics. Nothing more clearly represents the divide and enmity between England and Scotland than a strong Tory showing and an even more dramatic SNP sweep. \n \n It might be argued that the Cameron government's campaign last year to defeat the referendum for Scottish independence helped propel the popularity of the SNP, which in turn undermined the Labour Party's traditional strength in Scotland, thereby helping to insure the Tory victory. \n \n It was supposed to be Labour that would make a Devil's bargain with the SNP and, likely, face new calls for Scottish independence. \n \n But now it seems that, with his new governing majority expected to be in place soon, Cameron will be the one who is going to have to deal with an ever-greater empowered and recalcitrant Scotland. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Ri4WuS"], "summary": "\u2013 The Conservative Party swept to power today in Britain's Parliamentary elections, winning a wholly unexpected and resounding victory and bringing the election to a much-quicker-than-expected conclusion.

(CBS4) \u2013 There\u2019s a sad story in Elbert County after a wildlife sanctuary euthanized all of its animals \u2014 a total of 11 animals \u2014 lions, tigers, and bears. \n \n The Lion\u2019s Gate Sanctuary in Agate said killing the animals was the only option after county commissioners denied it\u2019s request to relocate. \n \n Jim Hansen has lived near the sanctuary for many years. He was sad to hear that that the animals, which went there for safekeeping and care, were euthanized. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s kind of disheartening,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time I don\u2019t know exactly what kind of problems they are facing down there.\u201d \n \n In a statement to CBS4, the sanctuary owners said ongoing flooding and damage prevented them from continuing their operations and caring for the animals at the present location. They wanted to move the sanctuary to another location, land also in Elbert County, and owned by them. \n \n Elbert County commissioners denied that request. Commissioner Danny Wilcox told CBS4\u2019s Jennifer Brice by phone it was denied it because of numerous safety concerns with the proposed move, and the sanctuary would go from a remote area to a more densely populated place. \n \n Dr. Joan Laub, a sanctuary owner, said she is devastated about the loss of the animals. She said they thought about relocating the animals. She added that the animals \u201cwould not have survived a move to a new facility\u201d because they were all seniors, some with disabilities. \n \n Laub added that they had a safety problem with a permanent solution for the animals. In an email she told Brice, \u201cMultiple governing bodies signed off on the relocation. They based their decision on the law. The three county commissioners denied the permit based upon emotions and their self-serving agenda, i.e., votes.\u201d \n \n In a statement emailed Wednesday evening, the Elbert County Commissioners described themselves as shocked and saddened by the news: \u201cThe decision by the operators of Lion\u2019s Gate to euthanize all their animals comes as a total surprise to the County for two reasons. Only two weeks earlier, the operators of the facility assured the County in a public forum that if the application was denied, they would continue to operate at their current location as they had for the previous 10 years. Additionally, the Keenesburg Wildlife Sanctuary publicly offered to care for the animals at their facility if Lion\u2019s Gate was unable to do so.\u201d \n \n Wilcox said he did not know the outcome of this would result in the animals being euthanized. He said he specifically asked the owners what their plan would be if the approval was denied. He said he was told that the sanctuary owners would continue operate as-is based on the ages of the animals. \n \n Additional Resources \n \n Click here to read the full statement from Lion\u2019s Gate Sanctuary and read the full statement from below from Elbert County commissioners on the matter: \n \n Elbert County Commissioners were saddened to learn of the decision made by the owners of Lion\u2019s Gate Sanctuary to euthanize their eleven animals. \n \n After a lengthy public hearing on April 12th, the County denied the special use application to relocate several lions, tigers and bears to a substantially more populated and developed area. This decision was based on concerns that the proposed plan for relocation of these animals was not adequately resourced, nor were exigency plans clearly defined which would ensure the safety of the animals and the surrounding residents. \n \n The decision by the operators of Lion\u2019s Gate to euthanize all their animals comes as a total surprise to the County for two reasons. Only two weeks earlier, the operators of the facility assured the County in a public forum that if the application was denied, they would continue to operate at their current location as they had for the previous 10 years. Additionally, the Keenesburg Wildlife Sanctuary publicly offered to care for the animals at their facility if Lion\u2019s Gate was unable to do so. Given these facts, the news that Lion\u2019s Gate euthanized all 11 animals at the same time and so shortly after the decision to deny the move comes as a shock. \n \n \u201cThe most important consideration in this land use issue was ensuring the safety of the many citizens residing in the vicinity of the proposed relocation site.

Turned away, Fishman instead exhibited the cat at the County Seat bar in Kiowa, according to state wildlife records. \n \n When authorities investigated eight days later, Winney and Fishman could not produce a license for two lions and two tigers they were keeping at another sanctuary. \n \n Winney said the cats were never his, and the district attorney\u2019s office dismissed the case. Fishman has since left the state and could not be located for comment. \n \n In November 2001, Winney fetched two sick lion cubs from a faltering sanctuary in South Dakota and brought them to a refuge near Colorado Springs for life-saving care. \n \n Winney said Monday that he thought he had obtained the clearances he needed from local and federal officials in South Dakota, and his conviction was the result of a poor legal defense. \n \n After exhausting his appeals, Winney lost his wildlife license. It was suspended for one year, until November. \n \n In May 2002, Winney and Fishman brought two tigers to a party at Laub\u2019s home in Parker. \n \n One tiger allegedly pinned down a 2-year-old child, and Winney was charged with failing to have a license for the tigers. State records are unclear about details of the incident, but Winney said no one was ever in danger. He was acquitted by a jury. \n \n \u201cOh well, I\u2019m sure I will have another opportunity in the future,\u201d district wildlife manager Gene Abram wrote in a 2003 e-mail to colleagues after Winney\u2019s acquittal. \n \n Holeman said Winney\u2019s record would not be a factor in any future application for the Elbert County sanctuary. \n \n \u201cWe consider each application on its merits,\u201d he said. \n \n Winney has touted his experience as an animal trainer in his qualifications to oversee the proposed sanctuary, including two years as \u201csole handler\u201d for Siegfried & Roy in Las Vegas. \n \n A spokeswoman for Siegfried & Roy characterized Winney\u2019s role with the showmen as in a \u201cjunior capacity.\u201d \n \n Winney is \u201cnot an expert, if that\u2019s the impression,\u201d said spokeswoman Kala Peterson. \n \n Winney said Peterson\u2019s characterization is inaccurate and just part of Siegfried & Roy\u2019s effort to present themselves as the sole experts in their act. \n \n \u201cIn the cat world when you join the family, you\u2019re in the family, but when you leave you\u2019re no longer part of the family,\u201d he said. \n \n Staff writer Joey Bunch can be reached at 303-820-1174 or jbunch@denverpost.com.", "A Colorado community is in shock after an animal sanctuary battling housing problems resorted to euthanizing all 11 of its exotic animals, despite the county planning commission claiming other facilities had offered to take them in. \n \n Lion\u2019s Gate Animal Sanctuary in Agate announced in a statement last week that it had euthanized five bears, three lions and three tigers.

Craig said they also recently received 27 animals from South Dakota. \n \n An attempt to reach the Lion\u2019s Gate owners for comment was not successful. \n \n A statement published to Lion\u2019s Gate\u2019s Facebook page on Thursday argued that the animals could not be moved because they were \u201ctoo old and many had disabilities and special needs.\u201d The sanctuary denied that they resorted to killing the animals because of the county commissioners, even though they had previously described the animals as the county\u2019s victims. \n \n Instead, they said they euthanized the animals because they were old and \u201cmany had disabilities and special needs\u201d that prevented them from being moved. It was no longer safe for the animals or for the public for them to be at their current location, they wrote. \n \n Cathy Bosier, who said she has volunteered at Lion\u2019s Gate Sanctuary for the last year and a half, said the owners are no longer talking to the media, but described them as devastated by the animals\u2019 deaths, which she called a \u201clast resort.\u201d \n \n \u201cThey felt their hands were forced. They were backed into a corner and their hands were forced,\u201d she told HuffPost on Wednesday. \u201cEverything else was tried and this was the last thing.\u201d \n \n Asked if the commissioners knew that euthanasia was their last resort, she answered: \u201cYeah, pretty much.\u201d \n \n Bosier said the facility reached out to a neighboring sanctuary for help but the animals\u2019 old age prevented their move. She described the animals as around 20 years of age. \n \n \u201cThe move to a larger sanctuary would have killed them,\u201d she said. \n \n David Mercado / Reuters This lion named Kiara was relocated to The Wild Animal Sanctuary park in 2011. She was one of 25 lions that were rescued from traveling circuses in Bolivia. \n \n Addressing Craig\u2019s facility, she said: \u201cThere\u2019s no way they\u2019re equipped to care for these animals with special needs.\u201d \n \n Craig denied this claim. \n \n \u201cWe locate older animals,\u201d he said. \u201cThe age has no factor.\u201d \n \n Craig suggested that the reasons behind the animals\u2019 euthanasia are deeper than they appear. \n \n A 2006 report by the Denver Post highlighted Winney\u2019s previous legal trouble involving wild animals, including \u201callegations of smuggling cats\u201d and other documentation and licensing issues.

Moscow, the other sponsor, has continued to sell weapons to the Syrian military but notes that there is no international arms embargo. \n \n It emerged on Monday that Congress had secretly given its backing to a CIA programme to arm and train \"moderate\", non-Islamist Syrian factions in Jordan, and provide a variety of small arms and anti-tank rockets. \n \n In a separate development on Wednesday, the UN welcomed the UK's decision to take in hundreds of the \"most vulnerable\" refugees from Syria. \n \n The British government had previously been reluctant to accept Syrian refugees, preferring to focus on humanitarian aid to the region, but it was facing a parliamentary defeat on the issue.", "BEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Islamist rebels and extremist groups have seized control of most of Syria\u2019s oil and gas resources, a rare generator of cash in the country\u2019s war-battered economy, and are now using the proceeds to underwrite their fights against one another as well as President Bashar al-Assad, American officials say. \n \n While the oil and gas fields are in serious decline, control of them has bolstered the fortunes of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and the Nusra Front, both of which are offshoots of Al Qaeda. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria is even selling fuel to the Assad government, lending weight to allegations by opposition leaders that it is secretly working with Damascus to weaken the other rebel groups and discourage international support for their cause. \n \n Related Coverage Syrian Talks Disrupted by Congress\u2019s Approval of Aid to Rebels \n \n Although there is no clear evidence of direct tactical coordination between the group and Mr. Assad, American officials say that his government has facilitated the group\u2019s rise not only by purchasing its oil but by exempting some of its headquarters from the airstrikes that have tormented other rebel groups. \n \n Crisis in Syria News, analysis and photos of the conflict that has left more than 100,000 dead and millions displaced. Full Coverage \u00bb \n \n The Nusra Front and other groups are providing fuel to the government, too, in exchange for electricity and relief from airstrikes, according to opposition activists in Syria\u2019s oil regions. \n \n The scramble for Syria\u2019s oil is described by analysts as a war within the broader civil war, one that is turning what was once an essential source of income for Syria into a driving force in a conflict that is tearing the country apart. \u201cSyria is an oil country and has resources, but in the past they were all stolen by the regime,\u201d said Abu Nizar, an antigovernment activist in Deir al-Zour. \u201cNow they are being stolen by those who are profiting from the revolution.\u201d \n \n He described the situation in his oil-rich province as \u201coverwhelming chaos.\u201d \n \n The Western-backed rebel groups do not appear to be involved in the oil trade, in large part because they have not taken over any oil fields. \n \n Syria was once an important supplier of oil to Europe, and attracted international oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell and Suncor to develop its fields. Declining even before the anti-Assad uprising began, the oil industry has taken a beating since, with production down to no more than 80,000 barrels a day at the end of 2013 from about 400,000 barrels a day in 2011. Violence has damaged pipelines and other infrastructure, aggravating energy shortages and leaving the country heavily dependent on imports from its allies. \n \n As the war has progressed, rebel groups have seized control of the oil and gas fields scattered across the country\u2019s north and east, while Kurdish militias have taken over areas near the border with Iraqi Kurdistan. \n \n Filling the void left by the government\u2019s withdrawal is a Wild West-like patchwork of local efforts to try to wring any possible profit from the remnants of the oil industry. In some areas, locals have used primitive methods to extract usable products from crude they drain from pipelines or storage tanks, often causing environmental and health problems in their communities. \n \n Elaborate trade networks have also evolved, with oil being smuggled across borders in plastic jugs and transported by trucks and on donkeys into Iraq and Turkey. \n \n \u201cThe government practically doesn\u2019t control anything anymore,\u201d said Dragan Vuckovic, president of Mediterranean International, an oil service company that operates across the Middle East and North Africa. \u201cThe oil is controlled by crooks and extremists. They sell it for a bargain wherever they can find a buyer.\u201d \n \n Oil has proved to be a boon for the extremists of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, who have seized control of most of the oil-rich northern province of Raqqa. The group typically sells crude to middlemen who resell it to the government but sometimes sells it directly to the government, said Omar Abu Laila, a spokesman for the rebels\u2019 Supreme Military Council. \n \n \u201cSelling the oil brings in more cash, so why not sell it to the regime, which offers higher prices?\u201d he asked. \n \n An American official said the United States had received multiple credible reports that the Syrian government had purchased crude from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria that was delivered in tanker trucks from areas the group controls to behind Syrian government lines. \n \n The official also said Mr. Assad\u2019s government had refrained from bombing the group\u2019s headquarters in Raqqa and elsewhere, although their locations are well known and clearly marked with black flags and banners. \n \n A second American official said that while Mr. Assad\u2019s government is growing ever more desperate for oil, the group is becoming increasingly independent of wealthy donors in the Persian Gulf and other funding sources. As the group has gained control of more territory, it has been able to sustain its operations through a combination of oil revenues, border tolls, extortion and granary sales, the official said. \n \n While other American officials discounted the possibility of tactical military cooperation between the group and Mr. Assad\u2019s government, they said that Syrian intelligence had almost certainly infiltrated opposition groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and the Nusra Front, to track their activities. \n \n \u201cThe Syrian regime is as Machiavellian as they come, and there is little it won\u2019t do to hold on to power,\u201d said an American counterterrorism official. \u201cIf the regime could strike a tactical accord with an enemy faction to achieve its larger strategic goals, it probably would.\u201d \n \n Denied access to Syria\u2019s oil regions, Mr. Assad\u2019s government has become increasingly dependent on its foreign allies and imports most of its fuel from Iran and Iraq, while Hezbollah smuggles diesel and gasoline over the border from Lebanon, according to regional oil experts. The opposition also accuses Syria\u2019s Kurds of providing the government with oil. \n \n While rebel oil revenues are small by world market standards, they can help groups exercise local power as well as finance their operations. \n \n \u201cEven sold at discounted prices, this oil could be generating significant revenue for rebels to arm themselves,\u201d said Badr H. Jafar, chairman of Crescent Petroleum, a regional oil and gas company based in the United Arab Emirates. \n \n The politics of the local oil trade can be complex, insiders say. When the Nusra Front and other rebel groups took over a natural gas facility in the northern province of Hasaka, they sought to cut the supply to a government facility, said Amer Abdy, a local activist. \n \n But local tribal leaders objected, saying that would simply invite government airstrikes to destroy the plant. So they brokered a deal to keep a limited amount of gas flowing so the area would not be bombed, Mr. Abdy said. \n \n When the government first withdrew from the oil fields of Deir al-Zour Province in the country\u2019s east, said Abu Nizar, an activist there, rebel brigades and local tribes took control of wells and sold or tried to refine whatever oil they could extract to buy arms. Recently, however, most of the area\u2019s rebel brigades have left the administration of the wells to an Islamic legal commission set up to run local affairs, he said. \n \n One facility the group controls is a natural gas plant that feeds a major power station near Homs that is still controlled by the government. \n \n \u201cWe can\u2019t cut off the gas because it would lead to a power cut in a large part of Syria,\u201d Abu Nizar said, adding that he hoped the new commission would effectively manage the area\u2019s resources. \n \n \u201cLet\u2019s be honest. Some of the wells were used to arm the rebels and to fund aid operations,\u201d he said, \u201cbut unfortunately the majority were robbed and exploited by thieves.\u201d", "One of two cargo ships intended to take part in a Danish-Norwegian mission to transport chemical agents out of Syria docks in Limassol, December 14, 2013. \n \n AMSTERDAM Syria has given up less than 5 percent of its chemical weapons arsenal and will miss next week's deadline to send all toxic agents abroad for destruction, sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. \n \n The deliveries, in two shipments this month to the northern Syrian port of Latakia, totaled 4.1 percent of the roughly 1,300 tonnes of toxic agents reported by Damascus to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \n \n \"It's not enough and there is no sign of more,\" one source briefed on the situation said. \n \n The internationally backed operation, overseen by a joint OPCW-United Nations mission, is now 6-8 weeks behind schedule. Damascus needs to show it is still serious about relinquishing its chemical weapons, the sources told Reuters. \n \n Failure to eliminate its chemical weapons could expose Syria to sanctions, although these would have to be supported in the U.N. Security Council by Russia and China, which have so far refused to back such measures against President Bashar al-Assad. \n \n The deal under which Syria undertook to eliminate its chemical arsenal stopped the United States and its allies from launching bombing raids to punish Assad for a chemical attack last August and made clear the limits to international action against him. \n \n U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon suggested in a report to the Security Council this week that shipments had been unnecessarily delayed and urged the Syrian government to speed up the process. \n \n MESSAGE TO SYRIA \n \n That is the message that will be given to Syria's representative to the OPCW during its executive council meeting on Thursday in The Hague, where the Nobel Peace Prize-winning organisation is located, the sources said. \n \n A senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the U.N. Security Council will be briefed on the issue by mission head Sigrid Kaag next week. \n \n \"All the indications are, and the secretary-general's report makes clear, that actually the regime has been sort of stalling on the implementation of the agreement,\" the diplomat said. \n \n \"It will be important what Sigrid Kaag says about whether she thinks these delays are deliberately politically motivated and why or whether there's any truth in the weather, the security and those more technical aspects,\" he said. \n \n Another senior Western diplomat said the Syrian government is \"teasing us\" by dragging its heels but doing enough to avoid being declared in non-compliance with its obligation to destroy its chemical weapons program. \n \n The second diplomat added that Russia would never permit the U.N. Security Council to declare Assad's government in non-compliance with its duty to eliminate its poison gas program. \n \n \"The Russians will never accept it,\" the second diplomat said, adding that Western powers were also reluctant to do anything that could be seen as undermining the Geneva peace talks between Assad's government and the opposition. \n \n \"Our impression is that they (Assad's government) are managing this issue in parallel with the Geneva discussion,\" he said. \"Everything is blocked so they are blocking on the chemical weapons to remind us\" of their power on this issue. \n \n Syria, where civil war has killed well over 100,000 people and forced millions to flee, has blamed delays on security obstacles. It said the mission could not be safely carried out unless it received armored vehicles and communications equipment. \n \n A source briefed on the situation said: \"Yes, it's true there is a war, but have you ever heard of a civil war without security issues? They have all the necessary means they need for transportation. Now they need to start shipping the chemicals out.\" \n \n Under a deal agreed by Russia and the United States after the August 21 sarin gas attack, Syria vowed to give up its entire stockpile by mid-2014. The rocket attacks in the outskirts of Damascus killed hundreds, including women and children. \n \n Eradicating Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, including sarin, mustard gas and VX, requires massive foreign funding and logistical support. \n \n The bulk of the most toxic substances are to be destroyed on the Cape Ray, a U.S. cargo ship now en route to the Mediterranean that will be loaded with the chemicals at an Italian port. The remainder will go to several commercial waste processing facilities, including in Britain and Germany. \n \n (Additional reporting by Michelle Nichols in New York; Editing by Giles Elgood and Eric

have broken up after the government's representatives set out a \"declaration of basic principles\" that did not mention a political transition as demanded by the 2012 Geneva Communique, the basis of the negotiations. \n \n Government spokeswoman Buthaina Shaaban said the principles included protecting Syria's sovereignty, preserving state institutions and stopping the threat from \"terrorist\" groups, the designation officials routinely use to describe Mr Assad's opponents. \n \n The government's proposal also included a condemnation of the US decision to \"resume arming terrorist groups in Syria\". \n \n \"We were surprised that this basic paper was rejected by the other side,\" Ms Shaaban said. \n \n Mr Jouejati said the discussions had ended on a \"sour note\" after the government

WASHINGTON Light arms supplied by the United States are flowing to \"moderate\" Syrian rebel factions in the south of the country and U.S. funding for months of further deliveries has been approved by Congress, according U.S. and European security officials. \n \n The weapons, most of which are moving to non-Islamist Syrian rebels via Jordan, include a variety of small arms, as well as some more powerful weapons, such as anti-tank rockets. \n \n The deliveries do not include weapons such as shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles, known as MANPADs, which could shoot down military or civilian aircraft, the officials said. \n \n The weapons deliveries have been funded by the U.S. Congress, in votes behind closed doors, through the end of government fiscal year 2014, which ends on September 30, two officials said. \n \n The apparently steady weapons flow contrasts with the situation last summer, when lethal U.S. aid to the Syrian rebels dried up for a time due to congressional reservations. \n \n Congressional committees held up weapons deliveries for months over fears that U.S. arms would not prove decisive in the rebels' efforts to oust President Bashar Assad and his government and could well end up in the hands of Islamist militants. \n \n A U.S. official familiar with recent developments said national security officials and members of Congress are more confident that weapons delivered to southern Syria are going to, and remaining in, the hands of moderate rebels rather than militant jihadist factions. \n \n Congress approved funding for weapons deliveries to the Syrian rebels in classified sections of defense appropriations legislation, two sources familiar with the matter said. It was not clear when the funding was approved, but unclassified defense funding passed Congress in late December. \n \n Some additional budget tweaks may be necessary to ensure that all the approved funding is fully available for disbursement during the current fiscal year. \n \n Yet, officials who support providing U.S. arms to the rebels acknowledge that this has not greatly increased U.S. expectations of victory by anti-Assad forces, whether moderate or militant. \n \n \"The Syrian war is a stalemate. The rebels lack the organization and weapons to defeat Assad; the regime lacks the loyal manpower to suppress the rebellion. Both sides' external allies... are ready to supply enough money and arms to fuel the stalemate for the foreseeable future,\" said Bruce Riedel, a former senior CIA analyst and sometime foreign policy adviser to President Barack Obama. \n \n Both U.S. and European officials said that \"moderate\" rebels had recently consolidated their positions in the Syrian south, where they are pushing out elements linked to al-Qaeda. More militant factions remain dominant in the north and east. \n \n Another recent development favorable to more moderate factions is that Kurdish groups that had been providing weapons and other aid financed by donors in the Gulf state of Qatar indiscriminately to both moderate and religious extremist rebel factions had greatly reduced their involvement in the arms traffic, one of the officials said. \n \n A White House spokeswoman had no comment. Other U.S. agencies did not respond to requests for comment. \n \n As for \"non-lethal\" aid like communications and transportation equipment, the United States hopes to resume deliveries to moderate groups in Syria soon, a U.S. official said on Monday. \n \n The United States and Britain suspended non-lethal aid to northern Syria in December after reports that Islamist fighters seized Western-backed rebel weapons warehouses, highlighting fears that supplies could end up in hostile hands. \n \n \"We hope to be able to resume assistance to the SMC shortly, pending security and logistics considerations,\" said the official, referring to the Supreme Military Council moderate rebel group. \"But we have no announcements at this time,\" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \n \n Non-lethal aid was resumed to civilian groups in that region in late December. \n \n (Additional reporting by Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Dan Grebler)"], "summary": "\u2013 Geneva talks on Syria's future have been tense\u2014and new US support for rebels isn't helping.

{"document": ["cable news news Keith Olbermann Has Reportedly Been Negotiating His Exit for a While \n \n After Keith Olbermann suddenly announced his departure last night, some speculated that the impending NBC-Comcast merger played a role. NBC executives quickly denied any Comcast involvement in the decision. But how did it all really go down? Details are trickling in, and early anonymous sources say Olbermann was not flat-out fired. However, most outlets are also reporting that Olbermann and network brass have long been butting heads. \n \n According to TMZ, the exit was partially about money: \"Olbermann's agent went to NBC complaining that Keith was underpaid,\" the site reports. \"NBC execs told Olbermann's agent they would not cough up more money. Network execs were well aware that Comcast wanted Keith gone because he was 'a loose cannon that could not be controlled.' It became clear to both sides that Olbermann's days were numbered and they began negotiating an exit, completed just before airtime Friday night.\" Under the deal, Olbermann is allegedly barred from appearing on television for a certain period of time, but he will reappear soon with \"a presence on the Internet,\" where all fugitives of the television end up. \n \n Deadline reports a similar story: \"This was all Keith's choice. He has said several times over the years said that he wants out of his contract.\" The site says he began negotiating his out a few months ago, but, \"because of all the false threats in the past, it was impossible for the network to know if he was really going to sign the final document.\" Even his own staff learned he was quitting when they heard him say it on TV. \n \n And the New York Times concurs that NBC and Olbermann have been in negotiations to end Olbermann's run for weeks. The Times notes: \"Mr. Olbermann had butted heads with his superiors long before the Comcast deal, including Phil Griffin, the top MSNBC executive ... and NBC\u2019s management had been close to firing Mr. Olbermann before.\" One executive said Comcast \"dreaded the prospect\" of being blamed if Olbermann were to quit soon after the takeover. \n \n Only the New York Post reported that Olberamnn was \"unceremoniously dumped,\" but the paper also repeatedly refers to him as \"a garrulous gasbag.\" So.", "The ball was chopped slowly and to get the out the first baseman would have to pick it up barehanded in the grass corner between the foul line and the infield dirt. The pitcher would have to hustle over but as the game\u2019s most abused cliche reminds us every 43 minutes, that\u2019s why they have PFP in spring training. With a speedy runner it would still be close but this was the majors and he who executes best laughs last. \n \n The fans at Yankee Stadium didn\u2019t think twice about it when it happened in the top of the fourth yesterday. The play was difficult, but the pitcher was CC Sabathia and his hustle and athleticism have been one of the under-publicized aspects of the franchise\u2019s success since 2009. And of course, the New York first baseman for exactly the same length of time has been Mark Teixeira and the goaltender-like whip-lash catches he makes at the bag and his other defensive wizardry obscures the fact that if that comparatively ordinary slow chopper is hit to him 500 times over a decade he\u2019s going to pick it cleanly at least 499 times. \n \n Except the Yankee first baseman yesterday wasn\u2019t Teixeira, it was Kevin Youkilis. And no offense to Kevin Youkilis, but when he reached down to scoop up the Jose Iglesias chop and toss it to Sabathia for the out he got nothing but grass and air. \n \n An inning later Jarrod Saltalamacchia shot one into the corner in left, where Brett Gardner should have made an adroit pick-up of the ball as it rattled around. Except Gardner was in center because like Teixeira, Curtis Granderson is hurt and it was Vernon Wells. And no offense to Vernon Wells, but when he waited for the straight bounce off the fence that never comes out there, it didn\u2019t come, and he was left to play \u2018go chase\u2019 for awhile. All things considered Saltalamacchia probably would\u2019ve gotten a double out of it anyway but there would have been a play and every tenth or twentieth time \u2013 an out. \n \n In neither case did the Red Sox score. But those two plays alone added ten pitches or more to Sabathia\u2019s count and send him packing after five innings down 4-to-2, which opened things for the Yankee bullpen, which may be the least recognized problem among the cascade of them that started yesterday, and soon it would 5-to-2 and then 8-to-2 and then just as in \u201cYoung Frankenstein,\u201d it got worse \u2013 it started raining. \n \n The effect on the offense of the subtraction of Teixeira, Granderson, Derek Jeter, and even Alex Rodriguez is obvious. What will kill the Yankees \u2013 and I mean last place kill the Yankees; this is not the collapse of 1965, that was last year in the ALCS, this is 1966 \u2013 will be its effect on the defense. Bad defense is not only its own punishment but it makes bums out of the best of the pitchers. And to re-use yet another old joke, kid, these aren\u2019t the best of them. \n \n And much of this mess will never show up in the box score. The Iglesias and Saltalamacchia plays were both clearly to be scored base hits. Unfortunately this Yankee team \u2013 the Muddlers\u2019 Row of Brennan Boesch, Ben Francisco, Travis Hafner, Lyle Overbay, Wells, and Youkilis \u2013 has been assembled through (in the memorable phrase of the equally memorable San Francisco baseball writer Hank Schulman) dumpster-diving. And defensively they\u2019re just bad enough to not make the plays, but just good enough to not get the errors. \n \n It\u2019s hard to say how this impending disaster will be received in the Bronx. The Yankees haven\u2019t had a losing season since 1992 and they\u2019ve either won or been in contention every year since 1993. Hal Steinbrenner was still at the University of Florida Business School then, and the Yankees could and often did draw half of what they draw these days. A front office with no memory of the Bad Old Days never mind experience with alleviating them is likely to panic and throw some babies out with the bathwater (heck, the Yankees began panicking about mild media criticism more than a year ago). And the front-running fans who have filled the place during these later glory years will not know what that they were seeing, and never fully realize the implications of the fact that their new platoon third baseman was guy who had been released by the Red Sox exactly a week ago today. \n \n Toronto: I\u2019m not one of those stick-in-the-muds who looked at the Dodgers last year and tut-tutted \u201cyou can\u2019t parachute in four new guys in mid-season and expect to form a team.\u201d I mean, for one thing I\u2019m an entirely different kind of stick-in-the-mud. But more importantly, that conclusion ignores the reality that the Giants have won two World Series while parachuting in four guys (last year) and five guys (2010). \n \n So my refusal to jump on the Bandwagon going doing Blue Jay Way is nothing about team chemistry or parachuting or trying to meld a team while competing or Jose Reyes\u2019s hamstrings on turf. I just think that the laudable effort to rebuild a once-great franchise has somewhat obscured some remaining problems \u2013 like a very average bullpen, very average production out of the DH spot, and trouble at third base until Brett Lawrie returns. \n \n Plus there\u2019s this little scandal from last year that sneaked in under everybody\u2019s radar. The big trade for the noble Cy Young Award winner R.A. Dickey? It came less than a year after Dickey became one of a handful of major league pitchers to admit to taking painkiller injections during the season (Jonathan Papelbon, Jon Lester, and Clay Buchholz were among the others). In Dickey\u2019s case this was 2011; I\u2019ve seen no reporting about him and the drug \u2013 Toradol \u2013 in 2012: \n \n Dickey is among the players who believe Toradol is more effective than taking over-the-counter pain pills. He said he believed the injections helped keep him on the field to pitch 2082/3 innings last season (2011), despite his injured foot. Some doctors, though, said athletes might believe Toradol to be more effective only because of the way it is commonly administered. \n \n The emphasis there was mine. \n \n Giving your starting pitcher a series of anti-inflammatory pain-dulling injections all seasons long is ok because the drug, while requiring a prescription, supposedly only has a slightly greater impact than a couple of Advil (injected directly into the source of your pain). Except, oh by the way, that pesky drug insert sheet references limiting its use to five days in pill form and two days for injections, and oh by the way in England physicians are instructed to start patients on Toradol only in a hospital, and oh by the way when Clay Buchholz was in a hospital with internal bleeding last June he said he thought his use of the drug contributed to his crisis and the fact that doctors had to transfuse him with three or four pints of blood. \n \n Dickey is hardly deserving of being the only one with a finger pointed at him. My understanding is there isn\u2019t a rotation in the majors that doesn\u2019t have at least one regular Toradol, and that some of them may be in new uniforms this year in part because of their teams\u2019 fears that the painkiller could mask necessary pain, the kind that warns you of impending injury. For as with any drug that dulls pain, or covers up muscular damage or exhaustion, or which neutralizes tiredness, the possibility is increased of sudden serious injury. You don\u2019t know you\u2019re hurting and you push it to far \u2013 and something snaps. \n \n In short, if a Toradol scandal, or a Prescription Drug scandal, breaks in baseball this year the guys on the record as (past) users are few and far between. And only one of them is a defending Cy Young Winner. \n \n Almost as an aside I also have doubts about the efficacy of Toronto\u2019s rotation. Dickey went from 8-13 in 2011 to 20-6 last year. His strikeouts soared from 134 to 230 in only 25 more innings. His offensive support went up 8/10ths of a run. I don\u2019t know if any of that is sustainable or repeatable this year \u2013 especially without the joy of facing pitchers every ninth batter. Tell me how much you\u2019re willing to rely on Mark Buehrle and Josh Johnson, to say nothing of Ricky Romero, currently of the Dunedin Blue Jays. \n \n Boston: The gift of Jackie Bradley being ready as much as a year early \u2013 and it is a gift, his at bats are those of a 10-year veteran who draws 100 walks every year \u2013 may hide some dubious free agent signings. When your key acquisition does so poorly on his physical that you (and he) agree to cut the deal from three years to one, that\u2019s a problem. When you are hoping that Jonny Gomes, Shane Victorino, and Ryan Dempster all had \u2018blips\u2019 last year, that\u2019s a lot of high-odds wagering. \n \n The Red Sox probably did themselves a favor by sacrificing the stability that was Adrian Gonzalez in order to offload the franchise-sinking contracts of Josh Beckett and Carl Crawford. But as has been noted elsewhere, they were left with a lot of contract room and not that many people to spend it on. Instead of a Josh Hamilton they went for \u201cClubhouse Guys\u201d \u2013 which is great for long road trips, flights, bus rides in traffic, rain delays, etc. \u2013 but rarely seems to be the corrective folks assume insomuch as the last time I checked the game was still played out on the field and very rarely in the clubhouse. \n \n Bradley, of course, is the real deal (though I\u2019ve never seen a player whose Dad didn\u2019t reach the majors use the \u201cjunior\u201d on his uni \u2013 his reads \u201cBRADLEY JR.\u201d). Will Middlebrooks is legit too. If Jacoby Ellsbury and Dustin Pedroia stay healthy that\u2019s four of nine positions that will excel offensively and defensively. But with David Ortiz hurt and presumably waning there is no longer a feared hitter in this line-up and given the depth of this division that\u2019s a serious impediment to contention. \n \n Baltimore: As mentioned in the AL Central preview the Orioles could\u2019ve easily offed the Yankees in the ALDS last year even though they were relying on two outfielders \u2013 Lew Ford and Nate McLouth \u2013 who had been released earlier in the same season (Ford, by a team in an independent league). The O\u2019s were reshaped by two guys who were largely viewed as having been bypassed by the proverbial parade, Buck Showalter and Dan Duquette, and featured the contributions of only a couple of homegrown guys (Markakis, Machado, Wieters, Jim Johnson). \n \n What becomes of the Orioles when the revivified farm system begins to contribute? Dylan Bundy was arguably the game\u2019s top pitching prospect, until this spring when he was bypassed by his teammate Kevin Gausman. Will they step into the rotation or be used out of the bullpen a la David Price? Could WBC-tested infielder Jonathan Schoop help out? Or outfielder L.J. Hoes? Could any American League team add more key parts from its own farm system as 2013 rolls along? \n \n Tampa Bay: Well, yeah, actually. \n \n Even while trading off Wade Davis and James Shields, the Rays still have a complete back-up rotation (Jeff Niemann in the bullpen, Chris Archer, Jake Odorizzi, Mike Montgomery, and Alex Colome in the minors) to say nothing of a Cy Young Winner (David Price) and two possible future candidates (Jeremy Hellickson and Matt Moore) at the front of Plan A. \n \n And if the primary bounty in the Shields trade, Wil Myers, is not summoned into the Tampa line-up it will only be because of injury, or because the traditional small-ball line-up is producing satisfactorily and there\u2019s no need to squeeze out James Loney or the platooners at second or DH. \n \n The key Tampa weakness would seem to be behind the plate. They kept Jose Molina intact enough to appear in 102 games last year and one wonders if that can be done again, or if Jose Lobaton is a satisfactory alternative. There isn\u2019t a catching prospect in the system and despite the sense that the Rays hit the bullseye with every one of their very few economic darts, the minors are thin generally in terms of position players (2009 was a bad draft, and every year that passes makes the 2008 selection of Tim Beckham as the overall number one pick instead of some kid named Posey look that much sillier). But the arms keep appearing, the down-market free agent signings keep producing (you realize that Loney could out-hit his predecessor Carlos Pena by a hundred points and still not hit .300?), and the veterans get transformed either into more draft choices (or guys like Wil Myers. Good grief, the team with the thinnest tightrope in the sport was somehow able to trade for Wil Myers). Marc Topkin has a superb and concise explanation of how the Rays keep the machine turning here and I offer the usual disclaimer here that I went to college with the future Mrs. Stuart Sternberg and their oldest son was an intern for me one summer. \n \n The Division: I know this is viewed as a three, four, or even five team race. I just don\u2019t see anybody seriously challenging the Rays, especially when Myers comes up. I\u2019m not certain on whether the Orioles\u2019 Tampa-like structuring and youth flood can overcome the value of Toronto\u2019s mass additions in the race for second place; either way it\u2019ll be close. The Red Sox are not likely to compete but also not likely to be challenged by the Yankees who \u2013 even in the disaster of last place \u2013 will still be the division\u2019s lead story. \n \n Tomorrow we\u2019ll finish it up with the Tarot Card reading that those one-game wild cards make trying to predict the playoffs six months in advance.", "Keith Olbermann -- The Rich Get Richer \n \n Keith Olbermann -- The Rich Get Richer \n \n scored an even sweeter exit package than previously reported.

Stay tuned.", "Since joining Twitter early last year, now-former Countdown host Keith Olbermann has become one of the platform\u2019s most loquacious users, tweeting more frequently than a meth-tweaked canary. All of that came to an abrupt end in the hour before his Friday announcement that he, and his show, were leaving MSNBC. \n \n Saturday night, though, Olbermann-watchers saw the first sign of post-Countdown life from his Twitter feed: an update to his profile which read \u201cWATCHTHISSPACE MLB.com Baseball Nerd blog returns 2/14.\u201d \n \n At this point, very little should be read into this, but that won\u2019t stop people from trying. The New York Daily News speculates that maybe the update signifies a return to sports for the former Sportscenter co-anchor: \n \n Since his sudden split with MSNBC, Keith Olbermann could be going back to his roots \u2013 at least on Twitter. \u201cW A T C H T H I S S P A C E MLB.Com Baseball Nerd blog returns 2/14,\u201d he wrote on his biography line\u2013 the only update he\u2019s written on his usually prolific account since Friday evening. \n \n They go on to note that a return to ESPN is unlikely, for a variety of reasons that Sportsgrid details here. \n \n The problem here is that promoting the Baseball Nerd blog is nothing new to Olbermann\u2019s Twitter feed, and so \u201cWatch this space\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily related to it. If Olbermann does remain silent until February 14, though, you can bet that will be the most widely-read edition to date. \n \n In any case, those watching Olbermann\u2019s feed for dirty laundry, or laundry of any kind, regarding his departure from MSNBC are likely in for a big disappointment. As much as it\u2019s probably killing the normally-outspoken Olbermann, news accounts from respected journalists generally concur that the terms of his exit include some kind of gag order. \n \n Much more likely is the prospect that Olbermann will share, in fairly short order, some level of detail about his future plans. Ironically, his departure has elevated his Twitter feed to near-Sarah Palin status, anticipation-wise. The parallel has been noted by some conservatives on Twitter, who wondered if Olbermann could continue to slam Palin for resigning the Alaska Governorship, which caused Olbermann to dub Palin the \u201cformer Half-Governor.\u201d (This says more about their attitudes about the gravity of elected office than anything else.) \n \n In that vein, it would be a satirical masterstroke if Olbermann emerged from Twitter exile to tweet about \u201cDeath Panels,\u201d as they relate to cuts to transplant funding in Arizona. \n \n Either way, Olbermann has to be aware that his status as a Palin-level Twitter celebrity has a short shelf-life, and if he wants to use the platform to promote his next move, sooner is better than later. \n \n Update: On Sunday, perhaps in response to the Daily News\u2019 speculation, the message on Olbermann\u2019s Twitter profile was tweaked to more clearly separate the messages.

{"document": ["\n \n Waves driven by a cyclone appear in the Elbe estuary near the North Sea close to northern Germany. (Christian Charisius/European Pressphoto Agency) \n \n A group of scientists says it has now reconstructed the history of the planet\u2019s sea levels arcing back over some 3,000 years \u2014 leading it to conclude that the rate of increase experienced in the 20th century was \u201cextremely likely\u201d to have been faster than during nearly the entire period. \n \n \u201cWe can say with 95 percent probability that the 20th-century rise was faster than any of the previous 27 centuries,\u201d said Bob Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers University who led the research with nine colleagues from several U.S. and global universities. Kopp said it\u2019s not that seas rose faster before that \u2013 they probably didn\u2019t \u2013 but merely that the ability to say as much with the same level of confidence declines. \n \n The study was published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \n \n Seas rose about 14 centimeters (5.5 inches) from 1900 to 2000, the new study suggests, for a rate of 1.4 millimeters per year. The current rate, according to NASA, is 3.4 millimeters per year, suggesting that sea level rise is still accelerating. \n \n Oceanographer Josh Willis from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory explains how sea levels have changed over the last two decades. (NASA) \n \n Unsurprisingly, the study blames the anomalous 20th-century rise on global warming \u2014 and not just that. It also calculates that, had humans not been warming the planet, there\u2019s very little chance that seas would have risen so much during the century, finding that instead of a 14 centimeter rise, we would have seen somewhere between a 3 centimeter fall and a 7 centimeter rise. \n \n [Why the U.S. East Coast could be a major \u2018hotspot\u2019 for rising seas] \n \n The new work is particularly significant because, in effect, the sea level analysis produces a so-called \u201chockey stick\u201d graph \u2014 showing a long and relatively flat sea level \u201chandle\u201d for thousands of years, followed by a \u201cblade\u201d that turns sharply upwards in very recent times. \n \n The discovery of such patterns itself has a long history, going back to a 1998 study by climate researcher Michael Mann of Penn State University and two colleagues \u2014 who found a \u201chockey stick\u201d graph for the planet\u2019s temperature, rather than for its sea level. Since then the \u201chockey stick,\u201d in its various incarnations, has come in for voluminous criticism from skeptics and doubters of human-caused climate change \u2014 even as multiple scientists have continued to affirm the conclusion that the last 100 years or so are way out of whack with what the planet has seen in the past thousand or more. \n \n [Why the planet\u2019s ancient past holds a worrying lesson about Antarctica] \n \n The new research also forecasts that no matter how much carbon dioxide we emit, 21st-century sea level rise will still greatly outstrip what was seen in the 1900s. Nonetheless, choices made today could have a big impact. For a low emissions scenario, it finds that seas might only rise between 24 and 61 centimeters. In contrast, for a high emissions scenario \u2014 one that the recent Paris climate accord pledged the world to avert \u2014 they could rise as much as 52 to 131 centimeters, or, at the very high end, 4.29 feet. \n \n However, Kopp notes that the methods used to project these totals may not fully capture what happens over the course of this century. \u201cWe have a model that\u2019s calibrated against a period when a certain set of processes, largely thermal expansion and glaciers, were dominant,\u201d he says, \u201cand we\u2019re looking forward to a period when other factors will be dominant.\u201d \n \n As Kopp\u2019s words acknowledge, the major contributors to sea level rise in the 20th century were the melting of mountain glaciers around the globe and the natural expansion of ocean water as it warms. However, in the 21st century, researchers think that the truly major players in potential sea level rise, the huge ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, will come to play a larger role. (Just how large remains unclear.) \n \n The current study was based on combining a variety of so-called \u201creconstructions\u201d of past rates of sea level from 24 locations around the world with more recent measurements from 66 global tide gauges. That\u2019s necessary because you can\u2019t just measure sea level change in a single place and get a global picture \u2014 over long time periods, factors ranging from whether land is rising or sinking to changes in ocean currents and the gravitational pull of the planet\u2019s ice sheets mean that different regions can see different amounts of sea level rise (or fall). \n \n One of the sites where past sea levels were reconstructed by scientists is pictured below: \n \n \n \n Coastal wetland in Newfoundland, Canada, that harbors a record of sea level for the past 2,000 years. (Courtesy of Ben Horton) \n \n The new study follows in the footsteps of a 2011 study that looked at the ocean and climate records contained in salt marshes in North Carolina to infer the history of sea level rise over the past 2,100 years \u2014 research that had many of the same authors. That study, too, found that the recent sea level rise is unprecedented over that time period. \n \n Mann of Penn State, one originator of the \u201chockey stick\u201d reference and a co-author on the 2011 study (but not the current one), said by email that he thinks the current work is an \u201cincremental advance\u201d on that prior study, albeit one he agreed with in broad outline \n \n Mann continued by email: \n \n The study nonetheless reiterates the conclusion we reached [in 2011] that the acceleration in sea level rise over the past century is unprecedented over at least the past millennium, and that this acceleration is directly related to the spike in surface temperature over the past century (i.e. the \u201chockey stick\u201d). \n \n The new paper emerges even as another study, also published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, produced very similar 21st-century projections of sea level rise. That paper, led by Matthias Mengel of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, also calculated that with unconstrained emissions, the Earth could see a maximum of some four feet of sea level rise by 2100. But it too acknowledged that the approach \u201ccannot cover processes\u201d like the possible collapse of the oceanfront glaciers of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which, it said, \u201cis hypothesized to be already underway.\u201d \n \n Such calculations are roughly in line with the 2013 projections of the U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for expected sea level rise by 2100, although they rely on a different, more simple type of model than that body used. However, Princeton climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer, who was not involved in the current work but collaborates with Kopp and was his postdoctoral adviser, says that this agreement between approaches still \u201cbegs the question of just how much disintegration of the polar ice sheets will contribute to sea level during the 21st century since neither type of model is adequate for capturing this growing and potentially disastrous contribution \u2013 and that is ultimately the most important unknown, both with regard to sea level and potentially with respect to the whole field of climate change.\u201d \n \n Capping a major day for sea level rise news, Kopp also released a report Monday along with Benjamin Strauss of Climate Central and two other researchers, using the current study\u2019s approach to determine that thousands of coastal \u201cnuisance\u201d floods in the United States over the 20th century would not have happened without human-caused global warming. \n \n Based on just four inches of sea level rise attributed to humans in the 20th century, and another two inches so far in the 21st, Strauss said he \u201cwas really surprised to see that there are human fingerprints on thousands of coastal floods that we\u2019ve already had in the United States.\u201d The reason is that such nuisance floods \u2014 King Tide flooding in Miami would be a good example \u2014 represent what Strauss calls a \u201cthreshold\u201d phenomenon, which is caused after sea level rise reaches a certain level. \n \n \u201cI think these studies really put the human fingerprint on Miami Beach\u2019s hundred-million-dollar saltwater flooding problem, and really a lot of what\u2019s going on in South Florida,\u201d Strauss said. \n \n More at Energy & Environment: \n \n The solution to climate change that has nothing to do with cars or coal \n \n We may have just seen a truly ominous new weather record \n \n It\u2019s not just Flint: Poor communities across the U.S. live with \u2018extreme\u2019 polluters \n \n For more, you can sign up for our weekly newsletter here, and follow us on Twitter here.", "Abstract \n \n We present new sea-level reconstructions for the past 2100 y based on salt-marsh sedimentary sequences from the US Atlantic coast.

Temperatures rise, and satellites watch glaciers and ice sheets shrink; networks of robotic buoys sample ocean waters as they heat and expand. \n \n We have also known that coastal floods are increasing. The link to sea level rise is clear. A higher starting level means that the same tide, the same storm surge, goes higher than it otherwise would have. Tide gauges dotting our bays and beaches have been recording this shift. \n \n So far as I know, until now, no study has extended the links all the way from burning fossil fuels, to global warming, to sea level rise, to coastal floods that were caused unambiguously by us. But that is what collaborators and I have attempted to do in a new analysis. \n \n Sea level change has a dizzying array of causes, not just global warming. In some places, land is sinking. In others, it is rising. People have pumped enough freshwater out of deep aquifers to swell the ocean, but also captured enough water behind dams to shrink it. Currents shift. Even gravity shifts, as ice sheets lose mass and tug the oceans toward them just a little bit less. \n \n The result is a complex mosaic with different rates of sea level rise in different places. Since 1950, for example, we\u2019ve seen parts of Chesapeake Bay rise by a foot, half that in Boston, and half that again in Honolulu. Amidst all this noise, new research led by Robert Kopp of Rutgers University, has extracted an essential signal: the amount of global sea level rise that has come from us. \n \n For the 20th century, Kopp and his colleagues\u2019 central estimate is global sea level has risen about four-and-a-half inches. Extended through 2014 for our follow-on report, the estimate increases to six inches. These don\u2019t sound like world-changing numbers, especially considering that many sea level projections for the this century run beyond three feet. But if you live in Annapolis or Charleston, Atlantic City or Port Isabel, our analysis shows that those inches have already changed your world. \n \n In our report, we took a simple approach. We subtracted yearly estimates for human-caused global sea level rise based on Kopp\u2019s paper, from hourly water level records at 27 tide gauges around the United States. Then we compared how many days the water level exceeded the local threshold for nuisance flooding \u2014 with or without our subtractions. \n \n Nuisance flooding is flooding that closes coastal area roads, overwhelms storm drains, and compromises infrastructure. It doesn\u2019t wreck your home, but it could make it hard to get to work, or even to flush the toilet. The National Weather Service defines local nuisance flood thresholds based on decades of observing local impacts. \n \n From 1950 through 2014, out of the 8,726 actual nuisance flood days that our analysis identified, 5,809 of them \u2014 two-thirds \u2014 would not have taken place if you remove Kopp et al.\u2019s central estimate of human-caused global sea level rise. Even using a low estimate \u2014 one more than 95 percent likely to be too low \u2014 more than 3,500 of the flood days would not have taken place. \n \n These totals represent just 27 tide gauges within the U.S.: 27 gauges that happen to have high quality hourly water level records since 1950. The true impact of human-caused sea level rise is much broader. And it has been sharply accelerating. Our central assessment indicates that within the past decade, human-caused rise tips the balance for 75 percent of floods study-wide, and for more than 90 percent of floods at sites ranging from Florida to San Diego, Seattle to Honolulu. \n \n When a street floods with saltwater, and you can\u2019t drive home, or you have to sandbag your store, human instinct looks for the nearby cause: it was a very high tide, or a strong wind blew from the wrong direction. But what if the tide or the wind were not enough to tip the balance? What if the waters would not have crossed the last lip, the critical threshold, without a few inches of boost? \n \n Now we have looked into the pool of water gathered on the asphalt and found an uncomfortable answer reflecting back: the flood is us. \n \n You May Also Like: \n \n These Paintings Turn Climate Data Into Art \n \n Weakening Ice Shelves Raise Sea Level Rise Concerns \n \n Wildfires Are Burning Some of the World\u2019s Oldest Trees \n \n What Scalia\u2019s Death Means For Climate Change", "Significance We present the first, to our knowledge, estimate of global sea-level (GSL) change over the last \u223c3,000 years that is based upon statistical synthesis of a global database of regional sea-level reconstructions. GSL varied by \u223c\u00b18 cm over the pre-Industrial Common Era, with a notable decline over 1000\u20131400 CE coinciding with \u223c0.2 \u00b0C of global cooling. The 20th century rise was extremely likely faster than during any of the 27 previous centuries. Semiempirical modeling indicates that, without global warming, GSL in the 20th century very likely would have risen by between \u22123 cm and +7 cm, rather than the \u223c14 cm observed. Semiempirical 21st century projections largely reconcile differences between Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections and semiempirical models. \n \n Abstract We assess the relationship between temperature and global sea-level (GSL) variability over the Common Era through a statistical metaanalysis of proxy relative sea-level reconstructions and tide-gauge data. GSL rose at 0.1 \u00b1 0.1 mm/y (2\u03c3) over 0\u2013700 CE. A GSL fall of 0.2 \u00b1 0.2 mm/y over 1000\u20131400 CE is associated with \u223c0.2 \u00b0C global mean cooling. A significant GSL acceleration began in the 19th century and yielded a 20th century rise that is extremely likely (probability P \u2265 0.95 ) faster than during any of the previous 27 centuries. A semiempirical model calibrated against the GSL reconstruction indicates that, in the absence of anthropogenic climate change, it is extremely likely ( P = 0.95 ) that 20th century GSL would have risen by less than 51% of the observed 13.8 \u00b1 1.5 cm. The new semiempirical model largely reconciles previous differences between semiempirical 21st century GSL projections and the process model-based projections summarized in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report. \n \n Estimates of global mean temperature variability over the Common Era are based on global, statistical metaanalyses of temperature proxies (e.g., refs. 1\u21d3\u20133). In contrast, reconstructions of global sea-level (GSL) variability have relied upon model hindcasts (e.g., ref. 4), regional relative sea-level (RSL) reconstructions adjusted for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) (e.g., refs. 5\u21d3\u21d3\u20138), or iterative tuning of global GIA models (e.g., ref. 9). Based primarily on one regional reconstruction (8), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) (10) concluded with medium confidence that GSL fluctuations over the last 5 millennia were < \u00b1 25 cm. However, AR5 was unable to determine whether specific fluctuations seen in some regional records (e.g., ref. 5) were global in extent. Similarly, based upon a tuned global GIA model, ref. 9 found no evidence of GSL oscillations exceeding \u223c 15 \u201320 cm between \u22122250 and 1800 CE and no evidence of GSL trends associated with climatic fluctuations. \n \n The increasing availability and geographical coverage of continuous, high-resolution Common Era RSL reconstructions provides a new opportunity to formally estimate GSL change over the last \u223c3,000 years. To do so, we compiled a global database of RSL reconstructions from 24 localities (Dataset S1, a and Fig. S1A), many with decimeter-scale vertical resolution and subcentennial temporal resolution. We augment these geological records with 66 tide-gauge records, the oldest of which (11) begins in 1700 CE (Dataset S1, b and Fig. S1B), as well as a recent tide-gauge\u2013based estimate of global mean sea-level change since 1880 CE (12). \n \n Fig. S1. Locations of sites with (A) proxy data and (B) tide-gauge data included in the analysis. \n \n To analyze this database, we construct a spatiotemporal empirical hierarchical model (13, 14) that distinguishes between sea-level changes that are common across the database and those that are confined to smaller regions. The RSL field f ( x , t ) is represented as the sum of three components, each with a Gaussian process (GP) prior (15), f ( x , t ) = g ( t ) + l ( x ) ( t \u2212 t 0 ) + m ( x , t ) . [1]Here, x represents spatial location, t represents time, and t 0 is a reference time point (2000 CE). The three components are (i) GSL g ( t ) , which is common across all sites and primarily represents contributions from thermal expansion and changing land ice volume; (ii) a regionally varying, temporally linear field l ( x ) ( t \u2212 t 0 ) , which represents slowly changing processes such as GIA, tectonics, and natural sediment compaction; and (iii) a regionally varying, temporally nonlinear field m ( x , t ) , which primarily represents factors such as ocean/atmosphere dynamics (16) and static equilibrium \u201cfingerprint\u201d effects of land\u2212ice mass balance changes (17, 18). The regional nonlinear field also incorporates small changes in rates of GIA, tectonics, and compaction that occur over the Common Era. The incorporation of the regionally correlated terms l ( x ) ( t \u2212 t 0 ) and m ( x , t ) ensures that records from regions with a high density of observations are not unduly weighted in estimating the common GSL signal g ( t ) . \n \n Because a constant-rate trend in g ( t ) could also be interpreted as a regional linear trend that is present at all reconstruction sites but is not truly global, we condition the model on the assumption that mean GSL over \u2212100\u2013100 CE is equal to mean GSL over 1600\u20131800 CE and focus on submillennial variations (Fig. 1A). We chose the first window to encompass the beginning of the Common Era and the last window to cover the last 2 centuries before the development of a tide-gauge network outside of northern Europe. \n \n Fig. 1. (A) Global sea level (GSL) under prior ML 2,1 . Note that the model is insensitive to small linear trends in GSL over the Common Era, so the relative heights of the 300\u20131000 CE and 20th century peaks are not comparable.

We consider five priors with different hyperparameters (see Supporting Information). The presented rates are taken from prior ML 2,1 , which is optimized under the assumption that the a priori timescales of variability in global and regional sea-level change are the same. Results from the four alternative priors are presented in Supporting Information. Quoted probabilities are conservatively taken as minima across all five priors. Illustrative fits at specific sites are shown in Fig. S2. \n \n Fig. S2.

Errors are \u00b1 2 \u03c3 . \n \n Results and Discussion Common Era Reconstruction. Pre-20th-century Common Era GSL variability was very likely (probability P = 0.90 ) between \u223c \u00b1 7 cm and \u00b1 11 cm in amplitude (Fig. 1A and Dataset S1, e). GSL rose from 0 CE to 700 CE ( P \u2265 0.98 ) at a rate of 0.1 \u00b1 0.1 mm/y (2\u03c3), was nearly stable from 700 CE to 1000 CE, then fell from 1000 CE and 1400 CE ( P \u2265 0.98 ) at a rate of 0.2 \u00b1 0.2 mm/y (Fig. 1A). GSL likely rose from 1400 CE to 1600 CE ( P \u2265 0.75 ) at 0.3 \u00b1 0.4 mm/y and fell from 1600 CE to 1800 CE ( P \u2265 0.86 ) at 0.3 \u00b1 0.3 mm/y. Historic GSL rise began in the 19th century, and it is very likely ( P \u2265 0.93 ) that GSL has risen over every 40-y interval since 1860 CE. The average rate of GSL rise was 0.4 \u00b1 0.5 mm/y from 1860 CE to 1900 CE and 1.4 \u00b1 0.2 mm/y over the 20th century. It is extremely likely ( P \u2265 0.95 ) that 20th century GSL rise was faster than during any preceding century since at least \u2212800 CE. The spatial coverage of the combined proxy and long-term tide-gauge dataset is incomplete. The available data are sufficient to reduce the posterior variance in the mean 0\u20131700 CE rate by > 10 % relative to the prior variance along coastlines in much of the North Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, and parts of the Mediterranean, the South Atlantic, the South Pacific, and Australasia (Fig. 2A). High-resolution proxy records are notably lacking from Asia, most of South America, and most of Africa. Nevertheless, despite the incomplete coverage and regional variability, sensitivity analyses of different data subsets indicate that key features of the GSL curve\u2014a rise over 0\u2013700 CE, a fall over 1000\u20131400 CE, and a rise beginning in the late 19th century\u2014are not dependent on records from any one region (Dataset S1, f). By contrast, the rise over 1400\u20131600 CE and fall over 1600\u20131800 CE are not robust to the removal of data from the western North Atlantic. Fig. 2. (A) Mean estimated rate of change (millimeters per year) over 0\u20131700 CE under prior ML 2,1 . In shaded areas, conditioning on the observations reduces the variance by at least 10% relative to the prior. (B\u2212F) Mean estimated rates of change (mm/y) from (B) 0\u2013700 CE, (C) 700\u20131400 CE, (D) 1400\u20131800 CE, (E) 1800\u20131900 CE, and (F) 1900\u20132000 CE, after removing the 0\u20131700 CE trend. Areas where a rise and a fall are about equally likely ( P = 0.33\u20130.67) are crosshatched. The color scales are centered around the noted rate of GSL change. On millennial and longer timescales, regional RSL change can differ significantly from GSL change as a result of GIA, tectonics, and sediment compaction (Fig. 2). For example, over 0\u20131700 CE, RSL rose at 1.5 \u00b1 0.1 mm/y in New Jersey, on the collapsing forebulge of the former Laurentide Ice Sheet, and fell at 0.1 \u00b1 0.1 mm/y on Christmas Island, in the far field of all late Pleistocene ice cover (Dataset S1, g). Detrended RSL (after removal of the average 0\u20131700 CE rate) reveals notable patterns of temporal variability, especially in the western North Atlantic, where the highest-resolution reconstructions exist. Rates of RSL change in New Jersey and North Carolina vary from the long-term mean in opposite directions over 0\u2013700 CE and 1000\u20131400 CE (Fig. 2 and Dataset S1, g). Over 0\u2013700 CE, a period over which GSL rose at 0.1 \u00b1 0.1 mm/y, detrended RSL rose in New Jersey ( P \u2265 0.91 ) while it fell in North Carolina ( P \u2265 0.88 ). Conversely, over 1000\u20131400 CE, while GSL was falling, detrended RSL fell in New Jersey ( P > 0.90 ) while it rose in North Carolina ( P \u2265 0.99 ). This pattern is consistent with changes in the Gulf Stream (16) or in mean nearshore wind stress (19). If driven by the Gulf Stream, it suggests a weakening or polar migration of the Gulf Stream over 0\u2013700 CE, with a strengthening or equatorial migration occurring over 1000\u20131400 CE. Our estimate differs markedly from previous reconstructions of Common Era GSL variability (5, 6, 9, 20) (Fig. S3F). For example, the ref. 20 hindcast predicts GSL swings with \u223c4\u00d7 larger amplitude, and it includes a rise from 650 CE to 1200 CE (a period of GSL stability and fall in the data-based estimate) and a fall from 1400 CE to 1700 CE (a period of approximate GSL stability in the data-based estimate). The curve derived from the detrended North Carolina RSL reconstruction (5) indicates an amplitude of change closer to our GSL reconstruction but differs in phasing from it, with a relatively high sea level during \u223c 1200 \u20131500 CE likely reflecting the regional processes mentioned above. The globally tuned GIA model of ref. 9, which includes 31 data points from the last millennium (compared with 790 proxy data points in our analysis), found no systematic GSL changes over the Common Era. Fig. S3. (A\u2013E) GSL estimates under priors (A) ML 2,1 , (B) ML 2,2 , (C) ML 1,1 , (D) Gr, and (E) NC. (F) GSL reconstruction under prior ML 2,1 (black) compared with the hindcast of ref. 20 (G09 hindcast; red), a curve derived from the North Carolina RSL curve by detrending and the addition of \u00b1 10 mm ( 2 \u03c3 ) errors after ref. 5 (NC pseudo-GSL; green), and the 19th\u201320th century GMSL reconstructions of ref. 12 (Hay2015; magenta) and ref. 106 (CW2011; yellow). Multicentury records are aligned relative to the 1600\u20131800 CE average; 19th\u201320th century reconstructions are aligned to match our GSL reconstruction in 2000 CE. Errors are \u00b1 1 \u03c3 . Twentieth Century GSL Rise. Semiempirical models of GSL change, based upon statistical relationships between GSL and global mean temperature or radiative forcing, provide an alternative to process models for estimating future GSL rise (e.g., refs. 20\u21d3\u21d3\u201323) and generating hypotheses about past changes (e.g., refs. 4, 20, and 24). The underlying physical assumption is that GSL is expected to rise in response to climatic warming and reach higher levels during extended warm periods, and conversely during cooling and extended cool periods. Ref. 5 generated the first semiempirical GSL model calibrated to Common Era proxy data, but relied upon sea-level data from a single region rather than a global synthesis. Our new GSL curve shows that multicentury GSL variability over the Common Era shares broad commonalities with global mean temperature variability, consistent with the assumed link that underlies semiempirical models. For example, the 9 \u00b1 8 cm GSL fall over 1000\u20131400 CE coincides with a \u223c0.2 \u00b0C decrease in global mean temperature, and the 9 \u00b1 3 cm GSL rise over 1860\u20131960 CE coincides with \u223c0.2 \u00b0C warming (2). Motivated by these commonalities, using our GSL reconstruction and two global mean temperature reconstructions (1, 2), we construct a semiempirical GSL model that is able to reproduce the main features of GSL evolution (Fig. 1 B and C). To assess the anthropogenic contribution to GSL rise, we consider two hypothetical global mean temperature scenarios without anthropogenic warming. In scenario 1, the gradual temperature decline from 500 CE to 1800 CE is taken as representative of Earth\u2019s long-term, late Holocene cooling (2), and, in 1900 CE, temperature returns to a linear trend fit to 500\u20131800 CE. In scenario 2, we assume that 20th century temperature stabilizes at its 500\u20131800 CE mean. The difference between GSL change predicted under these counterfactuals and that predicted under observed temperatures represents two alternative interpretations of the anthropogenic contribution to GSL rise (Table 1, Fig. 1A, and Fig. S4). Both scenarios show a dominant human influence on 20th century GSL rise. Table 1. Hindcasts of 20th century GSL rise (centimeters) Fig. S4. Counterfactual hindcasts of global mean sea-level rise in the absence of anthropogenic warming. Each row assumes a different counterfactual temperature scenario (see Materials and Methods), and each column represents model calibration to a different temperature reconstruction (Inset). In the temperature Insets, the black lines represent the original temperature reconstruction to 1900, the blue line represents the counterfactual scenario, and the red line represents the HadCRUT3 temperature reconstruction for the 20th century. In the main plots, the blue and red curves correspond, respectively, to the HadCRUT3 and counterfactual temperature scenarios. The difference between them can be interpreted as the anthropogenic GSL rise. Heavy shading, 67% credible interval; light shading, 90% credible interval. The hindcast 20th century GSL rise, driven by observed temperatures, is \u223c13 cm, with a 90% credible interval of 7.7\u201317.5 cm. This is consistent with the observed GSL rise of 13.8 \u00b1 1.5 cm, which is due primarily to contributions from thermal expansion and glacier mass loss (25). Of the hindcast 20th century GSL rise, it is very likely ( P = 0.90 ) that \u221227% to +41% of the total (scenario 1) or \u221210% to +51% of the total (scenario 2) would have occurred in the absence of anthropogenic warming. Under all calibrations and scenarios, it is likely ( P \u2265 0.88 ) that observed 20th century GSL rise exceeded the nonanthropogenic counterfactuals by 1940 CE and extremely likely ( P \u2265 0.95 ) that it had done so by 1950 CE (Dataset S1, h). The GSL rise in the alternative scenarios is related to the observation that global mean temperature in the early 19th century was below the 500\u20131800 CE trend (and thus below the 20th century in scenario 1) and, for most of the 19th century, was below the 500\u20131800 CE mean (and thus below the 20th century in scenario 2) (Fig. S4). The estimates of the nonanthropogenic contribution to 20th century GSL rise are similar to ref. 4\u2019s semiempirical estimate of 1\u20137 cm. They are also comparable to the detrended fluctuation analysis estimates of refs. 26 and 27, which found it extremely likely that < \u223c40% of observed GSL rise could be explained by natural variability. These previous estimates, however, could have been biased low by the short length of the record used. The 3,000-y record underlying our estimates provides greater confidence. Projected 21st Century GSL Rise. The semiempirical model can be combined with temperature projections for different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to project future GSL change (Table 2, Fig. 1D, and Dataset S1, i). RCPs 8.5, 4.5, and 2.6 correspond to high-end \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d greenhouse gas emissions, moderate emissions abatement, and extremely strong emissions abatement, respectively. They give rise to very likely ( P = 0.90 ) GSL rise projections for 2100 CE (relative to 2000 CE) of 52\u2013131 cm, 33\u201385 cm, and 24\u201361 cm, respectively. Comparison of the RCPs indicates that a reduction in 21st century sea-level rise of \u223c30 to 70 cm could be achieved by strong mitigation efforts (RCP 2.6), even though sea level is a particularly \u201cslow-responding\u201d component of the climate system. Table 2. Projections of 21st century GSL rise (centimeters) Since ref. 21 inaugurated the recent generation of semiempirical models with its critique of the process model-based GSL projections of the IPCC\u2019s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) (28), semiempirical projections have generally exceeded those based upon process models. While AR5\u2019s projections (29) were significantly higher than those of AR4, semiempirical projections (e.g., ref. 23) have continued to be higher than those favored by the IPCC. However, our new semiempirical projections are lower than past results, and they overlap considerably with those of AR5 (29) and of ref. 30, which used a bottom-up probabilistic estimate of the different factors contributing to sea-level change. They also agree reasonably well with the expert survey of ref. 31 (Table 2). Our analysis thus reconciles the remaining differences between semiempirical and process-based models of 21st century sea-level rise and strengthens confidence in both sets of projections. However, both semiempirical and process model-based projections may underestimate GSL rise if new processes not active in the calibration period and not well represented in process models [e.g., marine ice sheet instability in Antarctica (32)] become major factors in the 21st century. \n \n Conclusions We present, to our knowledge, the first Common Era GSL reconstruction that is based upon the statistical integration of a global database of RSL reconstructions. Estimated GSL variability over the pre-20th century Common Era was very likely between \u223c \u00b1 7 cm and \u223c \u00b1 11 cm, which is more tightly bound than the < \u00b1 25 cm assessed by AR5 (10) and smaller than the variability estimated by a previous semiempirical hindcast (4). The most robust pre-Industrial signals are a GSL increase of 0.1 \u00b1 0.1 mm/y from 0 CE to 700 CE and a GSL fall of 0.2 \u00b1 0.2 mm/y from 1000 CE to 1400 CE. The latter decline coincides with a decline in global mean temperature of \u223c0.2 \u00b0C, motivating the construction of a semiempirical model that relates the rate of GSL change to global mean temperature. Counterfactual hindcasts with this model indicate that it is extremely likely ( P = 0.95 ) that less than about half of the observed 20th century GSL rise would have occurred in the absence of global warming, and that it is very likely ( P = 0.90 ) that, without global warming, 20th century GSL rise would have been between \u22123 cm and +7 cm, rather than the observed 14 cm. Forward projections indicate a very likely 21st century GSL rise of 52\u2013131 cm under RCP 8.5 and 24\u201361 cm under RCP 2.6, values that provide greater consistency with process model-based projections preferred by AR5 than previous semiempirical projections. \n \n Materials and Methods Sea-Level Records. The database of RSL reconstructions (Dataset S2) was compiled from published literature, either directly from the original publications or by contacting the corresponding author (5, 7, 8, 33\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u201389). The database is not a complete compilation of all sea-level index points from the last \u223c3,000 years. Instead, we include only those reconstructions that we qualitatively assessed as having sufficient vertical and temporal resolution and density of data points to allow identification of nonlinear variations, should they exist. This assessment was primarily based on the number of independent age estimates in each record. Where necessary and possible, we also included lower-resolution reconstructions to ensure that long-term linear trends were accurately captured if the detailed reconstruction was of limited duration. For example, the detailed reconstruction from the Isle of Wight (69) spans only the last 300 y, and we therefore included a nearby record that described regional RSL trends in southwest England over the last 2,000 y (51). Each database entry includes reconstructed RSL, RSL error, age, and age error. For regional reconstructions produced from multiple sites (e.g., ref. 5), we treated each site independently. Where we used publications that previously compiled RSL reconstructions (e.g., refs. 37 and 45), the results were used as presented in the compilation. RSL error was assumed to be a 2 \u03c3 range unless the original publication explicitly stated otherwise or if the reconstruction was generated using a transfer function and a Random Mean SE Standard Error of Prediction was reported, in which case this was treated as a 1 \u03c3 range. We did not reinterpret or reanalyze the published data, except for the South American data (33, 59, 71, 90) that were mostly derived from marine mollusks (vermetids). The radiocarbon ages for these data were recalibrated using a more recent marine reservoir correction (91) and the IntCal13 and MARINE13 radiocarbon age calibration curves (92). Tide gauge records were drawn from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) (93, 94). We included all records that were either (i) longer than 150 y, (ii) within 5 degrees distance of a proxy site and longer than 70 y, or (iii) the nearest tide gauge to a proxy site that is longer than 20 y (Dataset S1, b). We complement these with multicentury records from Amsterdam (1700\u20131925 CE) (11), Kronstadt (1773\u20131993 CE) (95), and Stockholm (1774\u20132000 CE) (96), as compiled by PSMSL. Annual tide-gauge data were smoothed by fitting a temporal GP model to each record and then transforming the fitted model to decadal averages, both for computational efficiency and because the decadal averages more accurately reflect the recording capabilities of proxy records. To incorporate information from a broader set of tide-gauge records, we also included decadal averages from the Kalman smoother-estimated GSL for 1880\u20132010 CE of ref. 12. Off-diagonal elements of the GSL covariance matrix were derived from an exponential decay function with a 3-y decorrelation timescale. This timescale was set based on the mean temporal correlation coefficient across all tide gauges using the annual PSMSL data, which approaches zero after 2 y. Spatiotemporal Statistical Analysis. Hierarchical models (for a review targeted at paleoclimatologists, see ref. 14) divide into different levels. The hierarchical model we use separates into (i) a data level, which models how the spatiotemporal sea-level field is recorded, with vertical and temporal noise, by different proxies; (ii) a process level, which models the latent spatiotemporal field of RSL described by Eq. 1; and (iii) a hyperparameter level. We used an empirical Bayesian analysis method, meaning that, for computational efficiency, the hyperparameters used are point estimates calibrated in a manner informed by the data (and described in greater detail in Supporting Information); thus, our framework is called an empirical hierarchical model. The output of the hierarchical model includes a posterior probability distribution of the latent spatiotemporal field f ( x , t ) , conditional on the point estimate hyperparameters. (Dataset S3 provides the full time series and covariance of the posterior estimate of GSL.) Our use of GP priors at the process level and normal likelihoods at the data level renders the calculation of this conditional posterior analytically tractable (15). At the data level, the observations y i are modeled as y i = f ( x i , t i ) + w ( x i , t i ) + y 0 ( x i ) + \u03f5 i y [2] t i = t ^ i + \u03f5 i t [3] w ( x , t ) \u2248 G P { 0 , \u03c3 w 2 \u03b4 ( x , x \u2032 ) \u03b4 ( t , t \u2032 ) } [4] y 0 ( x ) \u2248 G P { 0 , \u03c3 0 2 \u03b4 ( x , x \u2032 ) } [5] where x i is the spatial location of observation i, t i is its age, w ( x , t ) is a white noise process that captures sea-level variability at a subdecadal level (which we treat here as noise), t ^ i is the mean observed age, \u03f5 i t and \u03f5 i y are errors in the age and sea-level observations, y 0 ( x ) is a site-specific datum offset, and \u03b4 is the Kronecker delta function. The notation G P { \u03bc , k ( x , x \u2032 ) ) } denotes a GP with mean \u03bc and covariance function k ( x , x \u2032 ) . For tide gauges, \u03f5 t is zero and the distribution of \u03f5 y is estimated during the GP smoothing process, in which annual tide-gauge averages are assumed to have uncorrelated, normally distributed noise with SD 3 mm. For proxy data, \u03f5 t and \u03f5 y are treated as independent and normally distributed, with an standard deviation (SD) specified for each data point based on the original publication. Geochronological uncertainties are incorporated using the noisy input GP method of ref. 97, which uses a first-order Taylor series approximation of the latent process to translate errors in the independent variable into errors in the dependent variable, f ( x i , t i ) \u2248 f ( x i , t ^ i ) + \u03f5 i t \u2202 f ( x i , t ^ i ) \u2202 t . [6] The assumption that mean GSL over \u2212100\u2013100 CE is equal to mean GSL over 1600\u20131800 CE is implemented by conditioning on a set of pseudodata with very broad uncertainties (SD of 100 m on each individual pseudodata point) and a correlation structure that requires equality in the mean levels over the two time windows. At the process level, the GP priors for g ( t ) , l ( x ) and m ( x , t ) are given by g ( t ) \u2248 G P { 0 , \u03c3 g 0 2 + \u03c3 g 2 \u03c1 ( t , t \u2032 ; \u03c4 g ) } [7] l ( x ) \u2248 G P { ICE 5 G ( x ) , \u03c3 l 2 \u03b3 ( x , x \u2032 ; \u03bb l ) } [8] m ( x , t ) \u2248 G P { 0 , \u03c3 m 2 \u03b3 ( x , x \u2032 ; \u03bb m ) \u03c1 ( t , t \u2032 ; \u03c4 m ) } . [9] Here, ICE 5 G ( x ) denotes the GIA rate given by the ICE5G-VM2-90 model of ref. 98 for 1700\u20131950 CE. The temporal correlation function \u03c1 ( t , t \u2032 ; \u03c4 ) is a Mat\u00e9rn correlation function with smoothness parameter 3/2 and scale \u03c4. (The choice of smoothness parameter 3/2 implies a functional form in which the first temporal derivative is everywhere defined.) The spatial correlation \u03b3 ( x , x \u2032 ; \u03bb ) is an exponential correlation function parameterized in terms of the angular distance between x and x \u2032 . The hyperparameters of the model include the prior amplitudes \u03c3 g 0 , which is a global datum offset (for ML 2,1 , 118 mm); \u03c3 g , which is the prior amplitude of GSL variability (for ML 2,1 , 67 mm); \u03c3 l , which is the prior SD of slopes of the linear rate term (for ML 2,1 , 1.1 mm/y); and \u03c3 m , which is the prior amplitude of regional sea-level variability (for ML 2,1 , 81 mm). They also include the timescales of global and regional variability, \u03c4 g and \u03c4 m (for ML 2,1 , 136 y), the spatial scale of regional sea-level variability \u03bb m (for ML 2,1 , 7.7\u00b0), and the spatial scale of deviations of the linear term from the ICE5G-VM2-90 GIA model, \u03bb l (for ML 2,1 , 5.9\u00b0). In the ML 2,1 results presented in the main text, it is assumed that \u03c4 g = \u03c4 m ; four alternative sets of assumptions and calibrations of the hyperparameters are described in Supporting Information. Semiempirical Sea-Level Model. Our semiempirical sea-level model relates the rate of GSL rise d h / d t to global mean temperature T ( t ) , d h / d t = a ( T ( t ) \u2212 T 0 ( t ) ) + c ( t ) [10] with d T 0 ( t ) / d t = ( T ( t ) \u2212 T 0 ( t ) ) / \u03c4 1 d c ( t ) / d t = c / \u03c4 2 , where a is the sensitivity of the GSL rate to a deviation of T ( t ) from an equilibrium temperature T 0 ( t ) , \u03c4 1 is the timescale on which the actual temperature relaxes toward the equilibrium temperature, and c is a temperature-independent rate term with e-folding time \u03c4 2 . The first term describes the GSL response to climate change during the study period. The second term covers a small residual trend arising from the long-term response to earlier climate change (i.e., deglaciation), which is very slowly decaying over millennia and of the order 0.1 mm/y in 2000 CE. It thus has a negligible effect on the modeled GSL rise during the 20th and 21st centuries. By comparison with Eq. 2, ref. 5 used the formulation d h / d t = a 1 ( T ( t ) \u2212 T 0,0 ) + a 2 ( T ( t ) \u2212 T 0 ( t ) ) + b ( d T / d t ) . [11] The present model has two differences from that of ref. 5. First, we substitute the temperature-independent term c ( t ) for term a 1 ( T ( t ) \u2212 T 0,0 ) and thus eliminate the temperature dependence in this term. This modified term describes a very slow component of sea-level adjustment that can capture the tail end of the response to the last deglaciation. Second, we omit the fast response term b ( d T / d t ) because it is of no consequence on the long timescales considered here. We sample the posterior probability distribution of the parameter set \u03a8 = { c ( t ) , T 0 ( t ) , a , \u03c4 1 , \u03c4 2 } , specified as P ( \u03a8 | g ( t ) , T ( t ) ) , using a Metropolis\u2212Hastings (MH) algorithm (99) (Fig. S5A and Dataset S1, j). The starting parameter set is a maximum-likelihood set, determined by simulated annealing. Sampled Markov Chains are thinned to every 500th sample, with the first 1,000 samples discarded in a burn-in period. Fig. S5. (A) Probability distributions of semiempirical model parameters. Prior distributions (gray) are not shown in full where scaling axes to display them would render posteriors obscure. (B) Likelihood of different values of \u03c4 c o v . Black dots show likelihoods across all semiempirical projections, and the bars show the 5th/17th/83rd/95th percentile conditional likelihoods for individual semiempirical projections. A value of \u03c4 c o v = 100 y is used in the analysis. Orange [green] represents calibration with the Mann et al. (1) [Marcott et al. (2)] temperature curve. We use two alternative temperature reconstructions (Fig. 1B): (i) the global regularized expectation-maximization (RegEM) climate field reconstruction (CFR) temperature proxy of Mann et al. (1), incorporating the HadCRUT3 instrumental data of ref. 100 after 1850 CE, and (ii) the Marcott et al. (2) RegEM global reconstruction. We use 11-y averages from the Mann et al. reconstruction\u2019s annual values, whereas the Marcott et al. reconstruction reports 20-y average values. Because the number of proxy data in the Marcott et al. reconstruction decreases toward present, we combine it with 20-y averages from the HadCRUT3 data (100) and align them over their period of overlap (1850\u20131940 CE). The two temperature reconstructions are generally in good agreement, although the Marcott et al. record shows \u223c0.2 \u00b0C lower temperatures before \u223c 1100 CE. This overall agreement provides confidence that the true global temperature is represented within the uncertainties of the records, whereas the modest differences motivate the use of both records to provide a more realistic representation of uncertainty in the calculated GSL. We denote the temperature reconstruction as S ( t ) and treat it as noisy observations of T ( t ) ; i.e., S \u2248 N ( T , \u03a9 ) . To construct the temperature reconstruction covariance \u03a9 , we assume S is an AR(1) time series, with variance as specified in the reconstruction and a correlation e-folding time of 10 y. For each iteration i of our MH algorithm, we draw n = 100 samples T j from T | S . We assume that S and T have uninformative priors, so that P ( T | S ) = P ( S | T ) . We then calculate the corresponding sea-level time series h i , j = h ( \u03a8 i , T j ) , which we compare with the reconstructed GSL g to calculate the posterior probability distribution P ( \u03a8 i | g , S ) , P ( \u03a8 i | g , S ) \u2248 P ( g | \u03a8 i , S ) P ( \u03a8 i | S ) = P ( g | \u03a8 i , S ) P ( \u03a8 i ) \u2248 P ( g | \u03a8 i , T ) P ( T | S ) P ( \u03a8 i ) \u2248 1 n \u2211 j = 1 n P ( g | \u03a8 i , T j ) P ( \u03a8 i ) [12] P ( g | \u03a8 i , T j ) = | 2 \u03c0 \u03a3 | \u2212 1 / 2 \u00d7 exp ( \u2212 1 2 [ g ^ \u2212 h i , j ] \u22a4 \u03a3 \u2212 1 [ g ^ \u2212 h i , j ] ) [13] where g \u2248 N ( g ^ , \u03a3 ) is taken from the ML 2,1 reconstruction. To calculate the posterior distribution of the portion of GSL change explainable by the semiempirical model, we simply take the distribution of h i , j . The prior and posterior distributions of \u03a8 are shown in Dataset S1, j. To balance skill in modeling GSL with skill modeling the rate of change of GSL, we taper the original covariance matrix \u03a3 r estimated from the GP model. The resulting matrix \u03a3 = \u03a3 r \u2218 \u03bb is the entrywise product of the original matrix and an exponentially falling tapering function \u03bb i , j = exp ( \u2212 | t i \u2212 t j | / \u03c4 c o v ) . We select a value of \u03c4 c o v = 100 y, which is the maximum-likelihood estimate for the Mann et al. calibration based on a comparison of results for no tapering, a fully diagonal matrix, and values of \u03c4 c o v \u2208 { 10 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 , 1,000 } y (Fig. S5B). Counterfactual hindcasts of 20th century GSL were calculated by substituting T j \u2032 for T j in Eqs. 12 and 13, where each sample T j was transformed into T j \u2032 such that either (i) 20th century temperature followed a trend line fit to T j from 500 CE to 1800 CE, or (ii) 20th century temperature was equal to the 500\u20131800 CE average of T j . The historical baseline T j \u2033 was generated by replacing T j after 1900 CE with HadCRUT3, shifted so as to minimize the misfit between HadCRUT3 and T j over 1850\u20131900. The nonanthropogenic fraction is calculated as the distribution of h ( \u03a8 i , T j \u2033 ) \u2212 h ( \u03a8 i , T j \u2032 ) (Fig. S4). Projections of global mean temperature for the three RCPs were calculated using the simple climate model MAGICC6 (101) in probabilistic mode, similar to the approach of ref. 23. As described in ref. 102, the distribution of input parameters for MAGICC6 was constructed through a Bayesian analysis based upon historical observations (103, 104) and the equilibrium climate sensitivity probability distribution of AR5 (105). We combined every set of parameters \u03a8 i and historical temperatures T j with every single temperature realization of MAGICC6, so the uncertainties are a combination of parameter uncertainty, initial condition uncertainty, and projected temperature uncertainty. \n \n Sensitivity Tests for Reconstruction We consider five alternative empirical calibrations of the hyperparameters \u0398 = { \u03c3 g , \u03c3 l , \u03c3 m , \u03c3 w , \u03c3 0 , \u03c3 g 0 , \u03c4 g , \u03c4 m , \u03bb l , \u03bb m } (Dataset S1, c, and Fig. S3). (i) For prior ML 2,2 , \u0398 is empirically calibrated through a hybrid global simulated annealing/local sequential quadratic programming optimization to find the hyperparameters that maximize the likelihood of the model conditional upon the observations. (ii) Prior ML 2,1 is similar to prior ML 2,2 , but with the constraint that \u03c4 m = \u03c4 g , i.e., that there is one timescale hyperparameter for the nonlinear terms. (iii) Prior ML 1,1 is similar to prior ML 2,2 , but with the constraints that \u03c4 m = \u03c4 g and \u03c3 m = \u03c3 g , i.e., that there is one timescale hyperparameter and one amplitude hyperparameter for the nonlinear terms. (iv) For prior NC, \u03c3 g and \u03c4 g are optimized to maximize the likelihood of a GP model fit to the curve derived from the detrended North Carolina RSL reconstruction. The remaining hyperparameters are then empirically optimized to maximize the likelihood of the model conditional upon the observations. (v) For prior Gr, \u03c3 g and \u03c4 g are optimized to maximize the likelihood of a GP model fit to the ref. 20 GSL hindcast. The remaining hyperparameters are then empirically optimized to maximize the likelihood of the model conditional upon the observations. In all cases, the parameters were optimized conditional only upon observations with 2 \u03c3 age uncertainties of less than \u00b1 50 years. In order to ensure that the optimization process does not confuse the interpretations of the terms reflecting the processes of interest and the white-noise term, we optimized under the constraint that \u03c4 g and \u03c4 m > 100 y. To ensure that this is a reasonable constraint, we also tested a model in which the amplitude of the global term, \u03c3 g , was set equal to zero; thus, in this model, all observations were interpreted as reflecting regional changes. Without the inclusion of the global term, the optimal value of \u03c4 m is 123 y, consistent with the constraint. From an interpretive perspective, the main difference among the calibrated prior is the timescale of GSL variability \u03c4 g (Dataset S1, c). In priors ML 2,1 and ML 1,1 , this timescale is \u223c 100 y, whereas, for ML 2,2 , it is \u223c2,000 y, yielding an overly smooth GSL curve; other priors have intermediate timescales. Shorter timescales lead a greater proportion of centennial-scale variability to be attributed to GSL. Although ML 2,2 has the highest marginal likelihood, we focus on ML 2,1 in presenting results, as inspection of within-20th century rate estimates for ML 2,2 suggests oversmoothing. Prior estimates of rates and variability are shown in Dataset S1, d. We also consider the application of the model with the ML 2,1 before different subsets of data (Dataset S1, f). The decline in GSL between 1000 CE and 1400 CE is robust to the removal of North Atlantic data ( P = 0.91 in subset -NAtlantic+GSL) and to the consideration only of data from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean ( P = 1.00 in subset +AtlanticMediterranean+GSL). It is, however, not robust to the consideration only of data from South America ( P = 0.48 in subset +SAmerica+GSL) or only of data outside the Atlantic and Mediterranean ( P = 0.25 in subset -AtlanticMediterranean+GSL). To assess the impact of the exogenous ref. 12 GSL curve for the 20th century, we consider each subset of data with and without the inclusion of this curve (indicated in Dataset S1, f by +GSL and -GSL). Twentieth century rates have broader errors without the exogenous 20th century curve but are in general agreement with that curve (e.g., +All+GSL: 1.38 \u00b1 0.15 mm/y; +All-GSL: 1.31 \u00b1 0.33 mm/y). \n \n Acknowledgments We thank M.

A new study\u2014based on \"reconstructions\" of past sea levels from 24 areas around the world, plus tide gauges\u2014finds global sea levels were steady for almost three millennia before they began to rise with the Industrial Revolution, reports USA Today. \"We can say with 95% probability that the 20th-century rise was faster than any of the previous 27 centuries,\" the lead author tells the Washington Post. Sea levels rose 5.5 inches from 1900 to 2000, or about 1.4 millimeters per year. NASA puts the current rate at 3.4 millimeters per year. Scientists expect sea levels to rise between 9.5 inches and 2 feet by 2100\u2014if we stick to the climate treaty agreed upon in Paris. But a high emissions scenario could see seas rise by more than 4 feet. Another study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences seconds that finding but notes researchers didn't consider the collapse of glaciers of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which \"is hypothesized to be already underway.\" There's no surprise why: Humans burned fossil fuels, which produced greenhouse gases, which melted glaciers and warmed ocean waters, scientists say.

Lubitz's breathing can still be heard on the voice recorder, according to Bild's report. \n \n Two minutes later, investigators think they hear the plane's right wing scrape a mountaintop. \n \n Screams can be heard one final time. \n \n 'Unbelievable' leak \n \n Cockpit recordings are some of the most sensitive and closely held parts of aviation crash investigations. They're never officially released, according to CNN aviation reporter Richard Quest. \n \n Quest called it \"unbelievable\" that the black box audio would be leaked in this manner. \n \n Communications between air traffic control and a plane's cockpit can be downloaded privately, but that's less common in Europe than it is in the United States. \n \n An edited and redacted version of the transcript is usually published in part of a final report on an incident. \n \n Although search teams have recovered the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder remains missing. That device could reveal crucial details about what happened during the final moments of the flight. \n \n What authorities know \n \n Jean Pierre Michel, lead investigator for the French inquiry, said on Saturday that investigators are not ruling out any scenario with respect to the crash out at this point. \n \n But French authorities have said that Lubitz appeared to have crashed Germanwings Flight 9525 deliberately into the Alps on Tuesday as it flew from Barcelona, Spain, toward Dusseldorf, Germany, with 150 people on board. \n \n Much attention has focused on Lubitz's state of mind since then, with suggestions that he may have had mental health issues. \n \n Lubitz, 27, passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014, a German aviation source told CNN. \n \n An official with Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, said that the exam only tests physical health, not psychological health. \n \n JUST WATCHED Police search Germanwings co-pilot's home for clues Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Police search Germanwings co-pilot's home for clues 00:10 \n \n The official also said that the company was never given any indication Lubitz was depressed, and that if he went to a doctor on his own, he would have been required to self-report if deemed unfit to fly. \n \n A Dusseldorf clinic said he'd gone there twice, most recently on March 10, \"concerning a diagnosis.\" But the University Clinic said it had not treated Lubitz for depression. \n \n The speculation about Lubitz' mental state is based on a letter found in a waste bin in his Dusseldorf apartment. \n \n The note, which was \"slashed,\" said Lubitz was not able to do his job, city prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said Friday. \n \n The fact that investigators found \"ripped, recent medical leave notes, including for the day of the offense, leads to the preliminary conclusion that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment,\" prosecutors said. \n \n Germanwings corroborated that assertion, saying it had never received a sick note from Lubitz. \n \n Anxiety, burnout and depression \n \n A handful of publications, citing unnamed sources, have reported that Lubitz suffered from various psychological maladies. \n \n CNN has not been able to confirm these reports. \n \n Lubitz suffered from \"generalized anxiety disorder,\" and from severe depression in the past, Le Parisien newspaper reported Sunday, citing sources close to the investigation. In 2010, Lubitz received injections of antipsychotic medication, the paper said. \n \n He was also prescribed a medication that influences neurotransmitters, but it's unclear when that happened, according to Le Parisien. \n \n The newspaper said investigators found a handful of pills in his apartment in addition to two sick notes, which forbade him from working from March 16 to March 29. \n \n The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that Lubitz suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer. \n \n A subsequent report from the Times on Saturday, citing two officials with knowledge of the investigation, said Lubitz sought treatment before the crash for vision problems that might have put his career at risk. However, an official with Lufthansa, said that if Lubitz had vision problems, they would have been discovered during his pilot recertification medical examination. \n \n Authorities have not ruled out the vision problems could have been psychosomatic, according to the Times. \n \n Citing an unidentified senior investigator, German newspaper Die Welt said that Lubitz suffered from a severe \"psychosomatic illness\" and that German police seized prescription drugs that treat the condition. Lubitz suffered from a \"severe subjective burnout syndrome\" and from severe depression, the source told the newspaper. \n \n News reports also stated that antidepressants were found during the search of his apartment. \n \n Investigators are expected to question his relatives, friends and co-workers as they try to pin down what could have prompted the co-pilot to steer a jetliner full of people into a mountainside. \n \n Lubitz had a girlfriend, a teacher at a school in Dusseldorf not far from his apartment, according to German media. \n \n 'This is a man whose life is totally broken' \n \n Dozens of people attended a remembrance ceremony Saturday for the victims of the crash at a church in a nearby town, Digne-les-Bains, France. Most of the people on the plane were from Germany and Spain. \n \n Relatives of the victims and local residents also gathered Saturday afternoon by a simple stone memorial set up near the crash site, in the village of Le Vernet. Flowers have been laid there, in the shadow of the snow-covered peaks of the French Alps. \n \n The mayor of one local community said he had seen Lubitz's father on Thursday evening, describing him as \"a man in deep distress.\" \n \n \"We get the impression that that man is bearing the whole weight of the disaster on his shoulders,\" Bernard Bartolini, the mayor of Prads-Haute-Bleone, said Saturday. \n \n \"I can tell that this is a man whose life is totally broken,\" Bartolini said. \"He had so much emotion in him.\"", "MONTABAUR, Germany (AP) \u2014 The pastor of the Lutheran church in Andreas Lubitz's hometown said Sunday that the community stands by him and his family, despite the fact that prosecutors blame the 27-year-old co-pilot for causing the plane crash that killed 150 people in southern France. \n \n Buses of the French gendarmerie, park and mask the homage ceremony with family members of Japanese victims in the area where the Germanwings jetliner crashed in the French Alps, in Le Vernet, France,...

(Associated Press) \n \n The town of Montabaur has been rattled by the revelation that Lubitz, who first learned to fly at a nearby glider club, may have intentionally caused Tuesday's crash of Germanwings Flight 9525. \n \n \"For us, it makes it particularly difficult that the only victim from Montabaur is suspected to have caused this tragedy, this crash \u2014 although this has not been finally confirmed, but a lot is indicating that \u2014 and we have to face this,\" pastor Michael Dietrich said. \n \n He spoke to The Associated Press after holding a church service Sunday to commemorate the crash victims and support their families. \n \n \"The co-pilot, the family belong to our community, and we stand by this, and we embrace them and will not hide this, and want to support the family in particular,\" Dietrich said. \n \n He added that there is no direct contact with the family at the moment, but that he believes they are receiving good assistance. \n \n French prosecutors haven't questioned the family yet \"out of decency and respect for their pain,\" Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said. \n \n Authorities are trying to understand what made Lubitz lock his fellow pilot out of the cockpit and ignore his pleas to open the door before slamming the plane into a mountain on what should have been a routine flight from Barcelona to Duesseldorf. \n \n French officials refused to confirm or deny a partial transcript that German newspaper Bild am Sontag said it had obtained of the cockpit recording. The paper reported Sunday that the pilot left for the toilet shortly before 10:30 a.m. and was heard trying unsuccessfully to get into the cockpit again a few minutes later, then shouting \"for God's sake open the door.\" \n \n After several more minutes in which the pilot could be heard trying to break open the door, the plane crashed into the mountainside, according to Bild am Sonntag, which didn't say how it obtained the report. \n \n Brice, the Marseille prosecutor said that none of the bodies recovered so far have been identified, denying German media reports that Lubitz's body had been found. \n \n Tests on the body of the co-pilot may provide clues on any medical treatment he was receiving. Germany prosecutors said Friday that Lubitz was hiding an illness and sick notes for the day of the crash from his employer. \n \n Dietrich, the pastor, said he knew Lubitz as a teenager, when he attended religious education 13 years ago, and his mother, who worked as a part-time organist in the community. \n \n \"When I worked with her or talked to her, it was very good and very harmonious. We had good conversations,\" Dietrich said. \"I know her and her family. This does not make sense. It is incomprehensible for me, for us, for everyone who knew her and the family.\" \n \n \"From what I've heard, there were no obvious signs that there is anything in the background that could lead to this,\" he added. \n \n In Rome, Pope Francis on Sunday prayed for the victims of the plane crash, citing in particular the 16 German students returning from an exchange trip to Spain. \n \n Francis offered the prayer after Palm Sunday Mass in St. Peter's Square at the start of Holy Week. \n \n In Le Vernet, a town near the crash site, families and friends of those killed were still coming to terms with what had happened. \n \n \"Members of the family shed tears as they went to see the site,\" said Ippei Yamanaka, co-worker of Japanese passenger Junichi Sato who died in the crash. \"It was particularly moving to see Mr. Sato's father asking the leader of the Kempeitai (a Japanese military rescue team), with many tears in his eyes, for them to continue the search operation and for it to finish earlier even by just one day.\" \n \n \"His wife says she still she cannot believe what has happened, saying that it almost feels like her husband is away on his business trip and that it still feels like he is going to return soon,\" Yamanaka said. \n \n ___ \n \n Frank Jordans in Berlin, Philippe Sotto in Paris and Frances D'Emilio in Rome, contributed to this report.", "In an interview published on Sunday, Airbus chairman Tom Enders sharply criticized some television discussions about Tuesday's crash, in which an Airbus 320 came down in the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board. \n \n \"What we should critically examine is the mischief that some 'experts' get up to, especially in TV talk shows,\" Enders told the weekly Bild am Sonntag. \n \n \"Sometimes people there speculate, fantasize and lie with no basis in fact,\" he said, describing many of the opinions expressed as \"outrageous nonsense\" that constituted \"mockery of the victims.\" \n \n Referring to reports that the co-pilot of the plane appeared to have deliberately flown Germanwings flight 4U9525 into a rocky mountainside, Enders said it was important not to think that the exception was the rule. \n \n \"One black sheep does not constitute a herd,\" he said, adding that the overwhelming majority of pilots were \"very reliable\" and \"excellently\" trained. \n \n 'Meaningless explanations' \n \n Leading figures in the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD) have also called for caution with regard to speculation on the causes of the crash. \n \n \"We will perhaps never know exactly what happened, and we should simply not say anything,\" Margot K\u00e4ssmann, the former council chair of the EKD, wrote in an article for the same newspaper. \n \n K\u00e4ssmann says we may never know what happened \n \n She said journalists should heed the same advice and \"stop giving us explanations that explain nothing.\" \n \n The current EKD council chair, Heinrich Bedford-Strohm, also warned in the Sunday edition of the Berlin paper BZ against seeing the co-pilot's actions as being evidence of supernatural evil. \n \n \"We should not attribute people's acts to some dark powers or other,\" he said, adding that \"no one knows what abysses of the soul led to this iniquitous act.\" \n \n Case still open \n \n The mayor of the co-pilot's home town of Montabaur has also called on journalists to exercise restraint toward the man's parents. \n \n \"Regardless of whether the accusations against the co-pilot are true, we sympathize with his family and ask the media to be considerate,\" Edmund Schaaf said, alluding to the crowds of reporters that have gathered in the town. \n \n German state prosecutors and police spokespeople have said there will be no official statements on the case before Monday, and a chief French investigator, General Jean-Pierre Michel, told French media on Saturday that other hypotheses on the cause of the crash must also be examined. \n \n \"[We] have no right today to rule out other hypotheses, including mechanical hypotheses, as long as we haven't proved that the plane had no (mechanical) problem,\" he said. \n \n The European Cockpit Association (ECA), which represents European pilots, said on Saturday that leaks of data from the crashed plane's voice recorder to the media - which led to the allegations that the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane - were a \"serious breach of fundamental and globally accepted international accident investigation rules.\" \n \n tj/sms (dpa, Reuters, AFP, epd, dpa)", "Rescuers still to find plane\u2019s flight data recorder, leading to growing calls for caution in blaming co-pilot Andreas Lubitz for deliberately downing the aircraft \n \n Forensic teams have identified 78 distinct DNA strands from body parts spread across the remote mountainside in the French Alps where Germanwings flight 4U9525 crashed, killing all 150 people on board. \n \n Rescuers are still, however, to locate the plane\u2019s second black box \u2014 its flight data recorder \u2014 six days after the Barcelona to D\u00fcsseldorf flight crashed into a rocky ravine at 435 miles (700km) per hour. \n \n Between 400 and 600 body parts have been located and are currently being examined. \n \n \u201cWe haven\u2019t found a single body intact,\u201d said Patrick Touron, the deputy director of the police\u2019s criminal research institute. Identification experts were using dental records, DNA samples from family members, fingerprints, jewellery and bits of ID card to help the process. \n \n The black box, which is actually orange and weighs around 10kg, was originally in a protective casing, but only the empty casing has been found. \n \n Captain Yves Naffrechoux, a mountain ranger, told Agence France-Presse: \u201cIf it has not been completely destroyed or pulverised, the black box will be under the rubble and debris. We must work with caution and a lot of precision. We have to look under every last bit of plane and lift every rock.\u201d \n \n An access road was being built to the site to allow all-terrain vehicles to remove some of the larger parts of the plane. \n \n Prosecutors in France and Germany have suggested that the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, deliberately crashed the plane. They have retrieved a torn-up sicknote from his flat in D\u00fcsseldorf, which was dated for the day of the disaster. Lubitz, who is from the small German town of Montabaur, had a history of depression which he hid from his employer and colleagues, they said. \n \n \n \n The suicide-mass murder theory is based on the cockpit voice recorder retrieved from the crash site near the village of Le Vernet. According to Germany\u2019s Bild am Sonntag newspaper, the captain, Patrick Sondheimer, asked Lubitz to prepare the plane to land in D\u00fcsseldorf. Lubitz responded \u201claconically\u201d. Sondheimer then left the cockpit to go to the toilet, telling his co-pilot: \u201cYou can take over.\u201d \n \n \n \n There was a sound of a seat being pushed back, and the door clicking shut. According to Bild, the plane then went into a steady descent. Minutes later there is a loud knocking and the voice of the captain saying: \u201cFor God\u2019s sake open the door.\u201d In the final moments the screams of passengers can be heard. \n \n \n \n German and European pilots\u2019 associations urged caution last week in stating the cause of the crash until the second black box was discovered and the air accident investigation brought to a conclusion. \n \n \n \n Jean-Pierre Michel, the head of the French investigation agency, said that some technical details of what precisely happened to the Airbus A320 aircraft were still missing. \u201cAt the moment we can\u2019t rule out the hypothesis of a technical fault,\u201d Michel told the French channel BFM TV. \n \n The German chief executive of the Airbus Group, Tom Enders, expressed his irritation on Sunday and criticised TV talkshow coverage of the disaster. \u201cThere has been speculation without facts, fantasy and lies,\u201d Enders said. Such \u201coutrageous nonsense\u201d mocked the victims, he added. \n \n \n \n In Montabaur, where Lubitz lived part of the time with his father, mother and younger brother, prayers were said on Sunday for the victims of the crash, and for the co-pilot and his grieving family. Hundreds of worshippers packed into St Peter\u2019s Catholic church on the town\u2019s cobbled main street, on a morning of pouring rain. \n \n \n \n Many there believed that investigators had been too quick to blame Lubitz for the disaster. Candles and flowers have been left outside the church, and one note read: \u201cWe think of all victims of this tragic crash, and their families and friends, in these difficult hours.\u201d \n \n The priest expressed sympathy for Lubitz\u2019s parents whom, he said, had found themselves \u201cat the centre of attention\u201d, the families and friends of the victims, and the rescue workers in France. \n \n", "Andreas Lubitz, 27, was living with the unnamed 26-year-old woman in his D\u00fcsseldorf apartment up until the crash last Tuesday, Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper and Der Spiegel magazine reported. \n \n She worked as a teacher at an unnamed comprehensive school in the state of North Rhine Westfalia and Bild said she had told her pupils that she was pregnant. Lubitz had also recently ordered two new cars for them. \n \n The woman \u2013 given the pseudonym, Sabine L, by Bild to protect her identity \u2013 visited the crash site last week, discovering on the way there that Lubitz had deliberately crashed the plane, killing himself and 149 others. \n \n Sabine was said to have met Lubitz when the two were school students doing holiday jobs at a hamburger restaurant. \u201cEventually they no longer kept their relationship a secret,\u201d the former manager was quoted as saying. \n \n It is thought that Lubitz deliberately crashed the plane because he was deeply depressed and was being treated for vision problems that could have ended his flying career. Some sources suggested he was suffering from a detached retina. \n \n The reports came as a transcript of the last voice recordings was revealed yesterday, which reveals that Lubitz urged the pilot to go to the toilet, leaving him alone in the cockpit. Passengers can be heard screaming uncontrollably for minutes before the crash, according to details published by Bild am Sonntag. \n \n Over the course of the transcript, Lubitz can be heard telling Captain Patrick Sondheimer that he is ready to take over \u201cany time\u201d. \n \n As Capt Sondheimer orders Lubitz to prepare the plane for landing in D\u00fcsseldorf, Lubitz appears to give clues about what he is about to do, responding with \u201chopefully\u201d and \u201clet\u2019s wait and see\u201d. He then tells Capt Sondheimer: \u201cYou can go now\u201d. \n \n Two minutes later, the Captain says, \u201cyou can take over now\u201d and the sound of a cockpit seat sliding backwards is followed by the clicking of the cockpit door. \n \n Shortly after, Lubitz puts the aircraft into descent mode. Air traffic controllers can then be heard trying to contact the plane and the automatic \u201csink rate\u201d alarm starts sounding. \n \n Seconds later, there is thudding on the cockpit door. Capt Sondheimer can be heard shouting, \u201cFor God\u2019s sake open the door!\u201d Behind him, passengers can be heard screaming. Among the last sounds appear to be attempts by Capt Sondheimer to break down the door with the aircraft\u2019s emergency axe, as he shouts: \u201cOpen the goddam door.\u201d But to no avail. Shortly after, the plane\u2019s wing is heard scraping the side of a mountain.

To aid the search, an access road is being built to the remote site in the French Alps, where forensic teams have so far recovered DNA belonging to 78 of the 150 people killed, the Guardian reports. Investigators say that so far, only the empty protective casing of the black box has been found. In other developments: Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz is believed to have deliberately crashed the plane, but with the failure to find the flight's second black box, some in the aviation world are saying it is too early to rule out other causes. Airbus chairman Tom Enders slammed TV coverage of the crash in an interview published yesterday, Deutsche Welle reports. \"Sometimes people there speculate, fantasize, and lie with no basis in fact,\" he said, calling some of the reporting \"outrageous nonsense\" that was a \"mockery of the victims.\" The cockpit voice recorder was recovered soon after the crash, and German newspaper Bild has published what it says is a leaked transcript. Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer (also spelled Sonderheimer or Sondheimer, depending on the source) can be heard pleading for Lubitz to let him back in the cabin, shouting, \"Open the goddamn door!\" as passengers scream minutes before impact, according to the transcript. A spokeswoman for France's accident investigation agency tells CNN that investigators are \"dismayed\" by the leak. Over the weekend, there were reports that Lubitz suffered from a psychomatic illness that may have been linked to a vision problem. German newspapers, including Bild, also reported that Lubitz's girlfriend, a teacher, was pregnant and the couple had planned to marry, according to the Independent. In Lubitz's hometown of Montabaur, the local Lutheran pastor tells the AP that despite mounting evidence that Lubitz caused the crash, he was still part of the community and the church is standing by his family. He says Lubitz's mother is a part-time organist for the church and he knew the co-pilot as a teenager. \"This does not make sense.

Police say James Emswiller, described as a sound mixer on his IMDb page, had gone out onto the balcony for a smoke in between shooting scenes for the film and apparently plummeted over the balcony's brick wall about 7:30pm Thursday. No one saw him fall, but others nearby heard a sound and soon discovered Emswiller on the ground below. \"He appears to have suffered from a medical emergency while on the balcony,\" Mount Lebanon Chief of Police Aaron Lauth tells People. Emswiller was initially listed in serious condition, but he soon deteriorated and was pronounced dead at a local hospital about an hour after the fall. He had previously done work on The Avengers and Jack Reacher, per his IMDb creds; the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review notes he won an Emmy for the TV movie Bessie in 2015. \"This is a devastating tragedy and the studio is investigating the matter,\" Sony Pictures/TriStar Pictures said in a statement to USA Today.

{"document": ["If you\u2019re serious about crafting, then you may have fantasized about ditching the 9-5, picking up the glue gun, and opening an eponymous Etsy shop. \n \n Well, Alicia Shaffer from Three Bird Nest, is living that dream. \n \n Shaffer is one of the most successful sellers on the online craft site, with more than, gulp, an estimated $65,000 a month in sales. But she tells Yahoo DIY that it didn\u2019t all happen, overnight, though. \n \n \n \n \n \n (Alicia Shaffer and family. All images courtesy Three Bird Nest) \n \n Etsy may seem like a quaint little destination for vintage pendants and handmade birthday cards, but with 30 million registered users, one million sellers and over one billion in total annual transactions, this is not your neighborhood craft fair. This is big e-commerce. \n \n \n \n \n \n girls posing with boquets More \n \n Where most shops would love to sell 300 items a day, Three Bird Nest is selling over 3,000. (If those numbers don\u2019t make you wanting to quit your day job, then you must really love what you do.) \n \n Three Bird Nest has its own distinctive sensibility, but it\u2019s not breaking the mold with exclusive, rarefied creations. Items similar to her lovely handmade, knitted scarves, wraps, headbands, beanies, boot socks and calf cozies (adorably irresistible) can be found elsewhere. So why is Shaffer cleaning up when others are coasting? \n \n \n \n \n \n Alicia wearing a homemade purple headband More \n \n One thing that stands out is Shaffer\u2019s passion for her work. \u201cI love textiles, fabric, fashion, designs, and seeing how different colors and fabrics pair together,\u201d she says on her site. When the seller\u2019s passion comes through, the shopper connects with craftsperson. \n \n But Shaffer also loves the business side. She happily absorbs the pressures that come from running her own mini empire. The creative process, from concepting, to production, to getting it in front of people to delivery is a high for her. To have a successful business on Etsy (or anywhere), she advises: you need to eat, sleep and breathe your brand. \n \n Shaffer also designs for a wide range of women, which broadens her potential customer base. \u201cShe\u2019s a mom, a student, a daughter, a bride, a woman going on a first date,\u201d she says. \n \n \n \n \n \n bracelets closeup More \n \n Read More", "Form S-1 \n \n As filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 4, 2015. \n \n Registration No. 333- \n \n UNITED STATES \n \n SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION \n \n Washington, D.C. 20549 \n \n FORM S-1 \n \n REGISTRATION STATEMENT \n \n UNDER \n \n THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n (Exact Name of Registrant as Specified in its Charter) \n \n Delaware 5961 20-4898921 (State or Other Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Organization) (Primary Standard Industrial Classification Code Number) (I.R.S.

We are building a human, authentic and community-centric global and local marketplace. We are committed to using the power of business to create a better world through our platform, our members, our employees and the communities we serve. These guiding principles are core to our mission: \u0095 Make it easy to find and buy unique goods from real people every day, on any platform, online and offline, anywhere in the world. \u0095 Help creative entrepreneurs start, responsibly scale and enjoy their businesses with Etsy. \u0095 Communicate the power of human connection whenever anyone experiences Etsy. Overview We operate a marketplace where people around the world connect, both online and offline, to make, sell and buy unique goods. Handmade goods are the foundation of our marketplace. Whether crafted by an Etsy seller herself, with the assistance of her team or with an outside manufacturer in small batches, handmade goods spring from the imagination and creativity of an Etsy seller and embody authorship, responsibility and transparency. We believe we are creating a new economy, which we call the Etsy Economy, where creative entrepreneurs find meaningful work and both global and local markets for their goods, and where thoughtful consumers discover and buy unique goods and build relationships with the people who sell them. Etsy was founded in June 2005 in Brooklyn, New York as a marketplace for handmade goods and craft supplies. From those beginnings, we have built an innovative, technology-based platform that, as of \n \n 1 \n \n December 31, 2014, connected 54.0 million members, including 1.4 million active sellers and 19.8 million active buyers, in nearly every country in the world. In 2014, Etsy sellers generated GMS of $1.93 billion, of which 36.1% came from purchases made on mobile devices and 30.9% came from an Etsy seller or an Etsy buyer outside of the United States. Our community is the heart and soul of Etsy. Our community is made up of creative entrepreneurs who sell on our platform, thoughtful consumers looking to buy unique goods in our marketplace, responsible manufacturers who help Etsy sellers grow their businesses and Etsy employees who maintain our platform and nurture our ecosystem. Our business model is based on shared success: we make money when Etsy sellers make money. Our revenue is diversified, generated from a mix of marketplace activities and the services we provide Etsy sellers to help them create and grow their businesses. Marketplace revenue includes the fee an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction and the listing fee an Etsy seller pays for each item she lists. Seller Services revenue includes fees an Etsy seller pays for services such as prominent placement in search results via Promoted Listings, payment processing via Direct Checkout and purchases of shipping labels through our platform via Shipping Labels. Other revenue includes the fees we receive from a third-party payment processor. In 2014, Etsy sellers generated GMS of $1.93 billion, up 43.3% over 2013. In 2014, we generated revenue of $195.6 million, up 56.4% over 2013. In 2014, we generated a net loss of $15.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $23.1 million compared to a net loss of $0.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $16.9 million in 2013. See \u0093Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u0097Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u0094 for more information and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. Our Values We are a mindful, transparent and humane business. We believe that business interests and social and environmental responsibility are interwoven and aligned and that the power of business should be used to strengthen communities and empower people. We plan and build for the long term. We want to build a company that lasts, and we plan to measure our success in years and decades. Etsy sellers in particular depend on us and on our platform to grow their businesses, so we will strive to make decisions that are best for the long-term health of our ecosystem. We value craftsmanship in all we make. Craftsmanship is the marriage of skill and passion. We believe every job at our company should demonstrate our commitment to craft. We are an engineering-driven company, and we think of our code as craft: we are makers of the products and services that our members use, and we approach the work we do with the same care and inspiration as do Etsy sellers. \n \n 2 \n \n We believe fun should be part of everything we do. Our mission includes fostering a world in which personal fulfillment is a key element of success. We believe that this way of working is connected and joyful. We strive to do excellent work and bring a sense of humor and playfulness to it. We keep it real, always. We have the courage and the will to do business in ways that are unconventional and impactful. We strive to stay genuine, maintaining integrity, humility and sincerity in everything we do. When we feel that we are not being true to our values or our mission, we are not afraid to stop and change course. Our Opportunity We operate at the center of several converging macroeconomic trends in online and mobile commerce, employment, consumption and manufacturing. We believe that in combination these trends will benefit millions of people in our ecosystem around the world: Etsy sellers engaging in their creative passion, working for themselves and defining success on their own terms; Etsy buyers accessing a diverse, global marketplace of goods that have historically been found in highly fragmented markets; and, increasingly, responsible manufacturers using modern tools to craft goods in partnership with Etsy sellers. Trends in Online and Mobile Commerce. Etsy sellers offer goods in dozens of online retail categories, including jewelry, stationery, clothing, home goods, craft supplies and vintage items. Euromonitor, a consumer market research company, estimated that the global online retail market was $695 billion in 2013, up from $280 billion in 2008, representing a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 19.9%. This growth is expected to continue, with the global online retail market becoming a significantly larger portion of the total retail market, reaching $1.5 trillion by 2018, implying a 16.6% CAGR from 2013. Mobile commerce is also increasingly important in online retail. comScore estimated that since the first quarter of 2013, consumers visiting online commerce sites spent more than half of their browsing time on mobile devices; however, online commerce spending via mobile devices represented only 11% of total online commerce dollars in the third quarter of 2014. Trends in Employment. Whether motivated by economic necessity or personal preference, a growing number of people are turning to self-employment for their livelihoods. In a 2012 survey of middle-class households in the United States by the Pew Research Center, 85% said that it was more difficult to maintain their living standards today than it was ten years ago. A study commissioned in July 2014 by the Freelancers Union and Elance-oDesk estimated that 53 million Americans are working as freelancers. Women are also contributing to the trend towards self-employment. World Bank research shows that, in certain developing nations, over half of the women in the labor force are self-employed. We believe that many of these people have creative skills that could provide a foundation for entrepreneurship, but that they often have little or no experience running their own businesses, and they typically lack the marketing resources, the technological expertise and the manufacturing and logistics capabilities to turn their creativity into a business. \n \n 3 \n \n Trends in Consumption. Most large retailers today follow the same formula, emphasizing efficiency and scale and pressuring their suppliers to reduce their costs in order to serve mass-produced goods at the lowest-possible prices. We believe, however, that many consumers want to purchase goods that are unique and that reflect their personality and style, not simply mass-produced, generic goods. Some consumers want their purchases to reflect their values; they want to support retailers and suppliers that have responsible and sustainable policies toward their employees, their communities and the environment. Finding these goods can be difficult, as markets for such goods have historically been highly fragmented across boutiques, consignment stores and other venues and marketplaces. Trends in Manufacturing. Because of advances in manufacturing technologies, individuals and small businesses now have the ability to manufacture goods in their homes and studios using tools such as computer-assisted design, 3D printers, computer-controlled routers and other machines at a fraction of the historical cost. We believe the decrease in the size and the cost of these tools will make it easier for creative entrepreneurs to start new businesses. We also believe that small-batch manufacturers will be able to use these new technologies to provide high-quality manufacturing services so that creative entrepreneurs can scale their own businesses. Our Strengths Our platform connects millions of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers globally, making it one of the largest online marketplaces in the world. We have achieved our scale because of the following key strengths: \u0095 Our Authentic, Trusted Marketplace. We have built an authentic, trusted marketplace that embodies our values-based culture, emphasizing respect, direct communication and fun. We have developed a reputation for authenticity as a result of Etsy sellers\u0092 unique offerings and their adherence to our policies for handmade goods. We establish trust in our marketplace by emphasizing the person behind every transaction. We deepen connections among our members, making a personal relationship central to the member experience. The authenticity of our marketplace and the connections among people in our community are the cornerstones of our business. \u0095 Our Passionate, Engaged and Loyal Members. Our members are passionate, engaged and loyal\u0097not only to us, but to each other\u0097building a strong community. \u0095 Our Innovative Technology. Our widely-respected engineering team has built a sophisticated platform that enables millions of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to smoothly transact across borders, languages and devices. \u0095 Our Scaled, Global-Local Marketplace. Our marketplace is global-local, meaning that we focus on building local Etsy communities around the world. Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers in these local \n \n 4 \n \n communities, in turn, have global reach and access through our platform. We believe our global-local marketplace creates strong competitive advantages outside the United States because our success is not dependent on scale in any given country. \u0095 Our Seller-Aligned Business Model. Etsy sellers are drawn to our platform because we empower them to succeed, and as Etsy sellers succeed, so do we. Our seller-aligned business model creates network effects. The more we invest in our platform, the more we enable Etsy sellers to pursue their craft and grow their businesses and the easier we make it for Etsy buyers to find unique goods. We call this Etsy\u0092s Empowerment Loop. Our Strategy: The Path Ahead We plan to continue connecting creative entrepreneurs, thoughtful consumers and responsible manufacturers and expanding the impact of our platform through the following key strategies: \u0095 Make Etsy an Everyday Experience. We emphasize relationships, connecting creative entrepreneurs to thoughtful consumers around the world, and we continually strive to make those connections a daily habit for our members. The everyday experience starts with mobile. \u0095 Build Local Marketplaces, Globally. Our vision is global and local. We plan to invest in local marketing and content and local payment and shipping solutions in countries around the world. We believe our locally-focused work will broaden the reach of our global platform. \u0095 Offer High-impact Seller Services. Seller Services help an Etsy seller spend more time on the pleasures of her craft and less time on the administrative aspects of her business. We intend to enhance existing Seller Services, extend their geographic reach and introduce new ones. \u0095 Expand the Etsy Economy. We intend to fulfill our mission to reimagine commerce by expanding the impact of our platform beyond our community. For example, we intend to further develop our manufacturing program, our strategic partnerships and our public-private endeavors to bring the benefit of the Etsy Economy to more people and more communities. \u0095 Invest in Marketing. We believe that the rapid growth of our marketplace is a testament to our compelling value proposition for Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers have been our best marketers, sharing their positive experiences with their own communities. Even so, we plan to increase our marketing spending on traditional and online media to increase awareness of our brand and attract additional members to our ecosystem. \n \n 5 \n \n Risks Associated With Our Business Our business is subject to numerous risks described in \u0093Risk Factors\u0094 immediately following this prospectus summary and elsewhere in this prospectus. Some of the more significant risks are: \u0095 We have a history of operating losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. \u0095 Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which could cause our stock price to decline. \u0095 Adherence to our values and our focus on long-term sustainability may negatively influence our short- or medium-term financial performance. \u0095 The authenticity of our marketplace and the connections within our community are important to our success. If we are unable to maintain them, our ability to retain existing members and attract new members could suffer. \u0095 Further expansion into markets outside of the United States is important to the growth of our business but will subject us to risks associated with operations abroad. \u0095 We expect to increase our marketing efforts to help grow our business, but those efforts may not be effective at attracting new members and retaining existing members. \u0095 Our payments system depends on third-party providers and is subject to evolving laws and regulations. \u0095 Our ability to expand our ecosystem is important to the growth of our business. \u0095 We must develop new offerings to respond to our members\u0092 changing needs. \u0095 If the mobile solutions available to Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers are not effective, the use of our platform could decline. \u0095 We face intense competition and may not be able to compete effectively. See \u0093Risk Factors\u0094 immediately following this prospectus summary for a more thorough discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties we face.

We do not intend our use or display of other companies\u0092 trademarks and trade names to imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us by, those other companies. JOBS Act We are an \u0093emerging growth company,\u0094 as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion or (c) in which we become a large accelerated filer, which means that we have been public for at least 12 months, have filed at least one annual report and the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last day of our then most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. We refer to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 as the \u0093JOBS Act,\u0094 and references to \u0093emerging growth company\u0094 have the meaning associated with such term in the JOBS Act. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. \n \n 7 \n \n Glossary The following terms are used throughout this prospectus: Term Definition Active buyer An Etsy buyer is a member who has created an account in our marketplace.

(4) Reflects the conversion of all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock into 106,896,493 shares of common stock as of the date reflected and, on a pro forma basis, our sale of shares of common stock that we are offering at the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the offering price range on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. The pro forma balance sheet data is illustrative only and will change based on the actual initial public offering price and other terms of this offering determined at pricing. Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the offering price range on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase or decrease each of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, working capital, total assets, deferred revenue, long-term liabilities and total stockholders\u0092 equity on a pro forma basis by approximately $ , assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same. We may also increase or decrease the number of shares we are offering. Each increase or decrease by shares in the number of shares offered by us would increase or decrease each of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, working capital, total assets, deferred revenue, long-term liabilities and total stockholders\u0092 equity by approximately $ million, assuming that the assumed initial price to public remains the same, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. \n \n 14 \n \n Risk Factors \n \n Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding whether to purchase shares of our common stock, you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, our consolidated financial statements and related notes and all of the other information in this prospectus. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. As a result, the price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. \n \n Risks Related to Our Business and Industry \n \n We have a history of operating losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. \n \n We incurred net losses of $15.2 million, $0.8 million and $2.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $32.4 million. We may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. We expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially as we hire additional employees, increase our marketing efforts, expand our operations and continue to invest in the development of our platform, including new services and features for our members. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and our revenue may not increase sufficiently to offset these additional expenses. In addition, as a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. Further, our revenue growth may slow or our revenue may decline for a number of reasons, including those described in these Risk Factors. \n \n Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which could cause our stock price to decline. \n \n Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate for a variety of reasons, many of which are beyond our control. These reasons include those described in these Risk Factors as well as the following: \n \n \u0095 fluctuations in revenue generated from Etsy sellers on our platform, including as a result of the seasonality of marketplace transactions and Etsy sellers\u0092 use Seller Services; \n \n \u0095 our success in retaining existing members and attracting new members; \n \n \u0095 the amount and timing of our operating expenses; \n \n \u0095 the timing and success of new services and features we introduce; \n \n \u0095 the impact of competitive developments and our response to those developments; \n \n \u0095 our ability to manage our existing business and future growth; \n \n \u0095 disruptions or defects in our marketplace, such as privacy or data security breaches; and \n \n \u0095 economic and market conditions, particularly those affecting our industry. \n \n 15 \n \n Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause those results to fall below the expectations of analysts or investors, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. Fluctuations in our results could also cause a number of other problems. For example, analysts or investors might change their models for valuing our common stock, we could experience short-term liquidity issues, our ability to retain or attract key personnel may diminish and other unanticipated issues may arise. \n \n In addition, we believe that our quarterly operating results may vary in the future and that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. For example, our historical growth may have overshadowed the seasonal effects on our historical operating results. These seasonal effects may become more pronounced over time, which could also cause our operating results to fluctuate. You should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance. \n \n Adherence to our values and our focus on long-term sustainability may negatively influence our short- or medium-term financial performance. \n \n Our values are integral to everything we do, and accordingly, we intend to focus on the long-term sustainability of our business and our ecosystem. We may take actions that we believe will benefit our business and our ecosystem and, therefore, our stockholders over a period of time, even if those actions do not maximize short- or medium-term financial results. However, these longer-term benefits may not materialize within the timeframe we expect or at all. For example: \n \n \u0095 we may choose to prohibit the sale of items in our marketplace that we believe are inconsistent with our values even though we could benefit financially from the sale of those items; \n \n \u0095 we may choose to revise our policies in ways that we believe will be beneficial to our members and our ecosystem in the long term even though the changes are perceived unfavorably among our existing members; or \n \n \u0095 we may take actions, such as investing in alternative forms of shipping or locating our servers in low-impact data centers, that reduce our environmental footprint even though these actions may be more costly than other alternatives. \n \n The authenticity of our marketplace and the connections within our community are important to our success. If we are unable to maintain them, our ability to retain existing members and attract new members could suffer. \n \n We have built an authentic, trusted marketplace that embodies our values-based culture, emphasizing respect, direct communication and fun. We have developed a reputation for authenticity as a result of Etsy sellers\u0092 unique offerings and their adherence to our policies for handmade goods. We establish trust in our marketplace by emphasizing the person behind every transaction. We deepen connections among our members through our direct communication tools, seller stories on our website and our in-person events, making a personal relationship central to the member experience. As part of our community, we also strive to build meaningful connections with our members. For example, each of our employees, including \n \n 16 \n \n management, is expected to perform member support rotations to help foster connections among our community and to help us better understand the needs of our members. The authenticity of our marketplace and the connections among our members are the cornerstones of our business. Many things could undermine these cornerstones, such as: \n \n \u0095 complaints or negative publicity about us or our platform, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents; \n \n \u0095 changes to our policies that our members perceive as inconsistent with our values or that are not clearly articulated; \n \n \u0095 our failure to enforce our policies fairly and transparently, such as by failing to prevent the widespread listing of items in our marketplace that do not comply with our policies; \n \n \u0095 our failure to respond to feedback from our community; or \n \n \u0095 our failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our values. \n \n If we are unable to maintain the authenticity of our marketplace and encourage connections among members of our community, then our ability to retain existing members and attract new members could be impaired and our reputation and business could be adversely affected. \n \n In addition, our reputation could be harmed if we lose our status as a Certified B Corporation, whether by our choice or by our failure to meet B Lab\u0092s certification requirements. Likewise, our reputation could be harmed if our publicly reported B Corporation score declines. B Lab, an independent, third-party organization, sets the standards for Certified B Corporation certification and may change those standards over time. \n \n Our growth depends on our ability to attract and retain an active community of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. \n \n In order to increase revenue and to achieve and maintain profitability, we must attract new members and retain existing members. We must also encourage Etsy sellers to list items for sale and use our Seller Services and encourage Etsy buyers to purchase items in our marketplace. \n \n We believe that many of our new members find Etsy by word of mouth and other non-paid referrals from existing members. If existing Etsy sellers are dissatisfied with their experience on our platform, they may stop listing items in our marketplace and may stop referring others to us. Likewise, if existing Etsy buyers do not find our platform appealing, whether because of a negative experience, lack of buyer-friendly features, declining interest in the nature of the goods offered by Etsy sellers or other factors, they may make fewer purchases and they may stop referring others to us. Under these circumstances, we may have difficulty attracting new Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers without incurring additional marketing expense. \n \n 17 \n \n Even if we are able to attract new members to replace members we lose, they may not maintain the same level of activity and the revenue generated from new members may not be as high as the revenue generated from the lost members. If we are unable to retain existing members and attract new members who contribute to an active community, our growth prospects would be harmed and our business could be adversely affected. \n \n Further expansion into markets outside of the United States is important to the growth of our business but will subject us to risks associated with operations abroad. \n \n Expanding our community into markets outside of the United States is an important part of our strategy. Although we have a significant number of members outside of the United States, we have limited experience in developing local markets outside the United States. The nature of the goods that Etsy sellers list in our marketplace may not appeal to non-U.S. consumers in the same way as they do to consumers in the United States. Also, visits to our marketplace from Etsy buyers outside the United States may not convert into sales as often as visits from within the United States. Our success in markets outside the United States will be linked to our ability to attract local Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to our platform. If we are not able to do so, our growth prospects could be harmed. \n \n In addition, competition is likely to intensify in the international markets where we operate and plan to expand our operations. Local companies based in markets outside the United States may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, those local markets. Some of our competitors may also be able to develop and grow in international markets more quickly than we will. \n \n Continued expansion in markets outside of the United States will also require significant financial investment. These investments include marketing to attract and retain new members, developing localized services, forming relationships with third-party service providers, supporting operations in multiple countries and potentially acquiring companies based outside the United States and integrating those companies with our operations. \n \n Doing business in markets outside of the United States also subjects us to increased risks and burdens such as: \n \n \u0095 complying with different regulatory standards (including those related to the use of personal information, particularly in the European Union); \n \n \u0095 managing and staffing operations over a broader geographic area with varying cultural norms and customs; \n \n \u0095 adapting our platform to local cultural norms and customs; \n \n \u0095 potentially heightened risk of fraudulent transactions; \n \n \u0095 limitations on the repatriation of funds and fluctuations of foreign exchange rates; \n \n 18 \n \n \u0095 exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and export control laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the UK Bribery Act of 2010, trade controls and sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions; \n \n \u0095 varying levels of Internet, e-commerce and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure; \n \n \u0095 our ability to enforce contracts and intellectual property rights in jurisdictions outside the United States; and \n \n \u0095 barriers to international trade, such as tariffs or other taxes. \n \n Etsy sellers face similar risks in conducting their businesses across borders. Even if we are successful in managing the risks of conducting our business across borders, if Etsy sellers are not, our business could be adversely affected. \n \n Finally, operating in markets outside of the United States requires significant management attention. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations outside of the United States and cannot manage these risks effectively, the costs of doing business in those markets may be prohibitive or our expenses may increase disproportionately to the revenue generated in those markets. \n \n We expect to increase our marketing efforts to help grow our business, but those efforts may not be effective at attracting new members and retaining existing members. \n \n Maintaining and promoting awareness of our marketplace and broader platform is important to our ability to retain existing members and to attract new members. We believe that much of the growth in our member base to date has originated from word-of-mouth referrals and other organic means, as our historical marketing efforts and expenditures have been relatively limited. Going forward, we intend to invest more in marketing, with a particular focus on bringing more Etsy buyers to our platform. We anticipate that our marketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive as competition increases, and generating a meaningful return on those initiatives may be difficult. Also, the marketing efforts we implement in the future may not succeed as we have limited marketing experience. Even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of these efforts, that additional revenue may not offset the expenses we incur. \n \n Our marketing efforts currently include search engine marketing and display advertising, as well as search engine optimization, social media usage, mobile \u0093push\u0094 notifications and email. We obtain a significant number of visits via search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!. Search engines frequently change the algorithms that determine the ranking and display of results of a user\u0092s search, and those changes can negatively affect the placement of links to our marketplace and, therefore, reduce the number of visits to our marketplace. We also obtain a significant number of visits through email advertising. If we are unable to successfully deliver emails to our members or if members do not open our emails, whether out of choice, because those emails are marked as low priority or spam or for other reasons, our business could be adversely affected. Social networking websites, such as Facebook and Pinterest, are another important \n \n 19 \n \n source of visits to our marketplace. As online commerce and social networking continue to evolve, we must maintain a presence within these networks. We may be unable to develop or maintain such a presence. \n \n Our payments system depends on third-party providers and is subject to evolving laws and regulations. \n \n Etsy buyers can pay for purchases using Direct Checkout or PayPal. In the United States and other countries where Direct Checkout is available, Etsy buyers can pay with credit cards, debit cards, bank transfers and Etsy gift cards on our platform rather than being directed to a third-party payment platform. A significant portion of our GMS is processed through Direct Checkout, and a portion of our revenue is derived from Direct Checkout. \n \n We have engaged third-party service providers to perform underlying card processing, currency exchange, identity verification and fraud analysis services. If these service providers do not perform adequately or if our relationships with these service providers were to terminate, Etsy sellers\u0092 ability to accept orders could be adversely affected and our business would be harmed. In addition, if these providers increase the fees they charge us, our operating expenses could increase. Alternatively, if we respond by increasing the fees we charge to Etsy sellers, some Etsy sellers may stop using Direct Checkout, stop listing new items for sale or even close their accounts altogether. \n \n The laws and regulations related to payments are complex and vary across different jurisdictions in the United States and globally. As a result, we are required to spend significant time and effort to comply with those laws and regulations. Any failure or claim of our failure to comply, or any failure by our third-party service providers to comply, could cost us substantial resources, could result in liabilities, or could force us to stop offering Direct Checkout. As we expand the availability of Direct Checkout or offer new payment methods to our members in the future, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements. \n \n Further, through our agreement with our third-party credit card processor, we are indirectly subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We are also subject to rules governing electronic funds transfers. Any change in these rules and requirements could make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. \n \n Our ability to expand our ecosystem is important to the growth of our business. \n \n We spend substantial time and resources creating new offerings in order to add new constituents to our ecosystem and to open new sales channels for Etsy sellers. For example, in October 2013, we expanded our ecosystem by allowing Etsy sellers to work with small-batch manufacturers. Additionally, in August 2014, we added traditional retailers to our ecosystem with the launch of our Wholesale offering, which allows Etsy sellers to sell their products to retailers on our platform. \n \n Our efforts to expand our ecosystem could fail for many reasons, including lack of acceptance of our offerings by existing members or new constituents, our failure to market our offerings effectively to new constituents, defects or errors in our new offerings or negative publicity about us or our new offerings. \n \n 20 \n \n Diversifying our offerings and expanding our ecosystem to benefit our community involves significant risk. For example, these initiatives may not drive increases in revenue, may require substantial investment and planning and may bring us more directly into competition with companies that are better established or have greater resources than we do. It will require additional investment of time and resources in the development and training of our personnel and our members. If we are unable to cost-effectively expand our ecosystem, then our growth prospects and competitive position may be harmed. \n \n We must develop new offerings to respond to our members\u0092 changing needs. \n \n Our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology, new service and product introductions and changing customer demands. We spend substantial time and resources understanding our members\u0092 needs and responding to them. For example, we are continually developing additional Seller Services, improving search and discovery functionality and enhancing the member experience. Recently, we have focused on providing additional Seller Services and tools to help Etsy sellers manage and scale their businesses. For example, in August 2014, we launched our Wholesale offering. In addition, we developed a mobile app and expanded Direct Checkout to enable an Etsy seller in the United States to use our \u0093Sell on Etsy Reader\u0094 to accept credit card and debit card payments in person, such as at her store or her booth at a craft fair. \n \n Our members may not be satisfied with our new offerings or perceive that the new offerings respond to their needs. Developing new offerings is complex, and the timetable for commercial release is difficult to predict and may vary from our historical experience. As a result, the introduction of new offerings may occur after anticipated or announced release dates. Our new offerings also may bring us more directly into competition with companies that are better established or have greater resources than we do. \n \n If we do not continue to cost-effectively develop new offerings that satisfy our members, then our competitive position and growth prospects may be harmed. In addition, new offerings may have lower margins than existing offerings and our revenue may not grow enough as a result of the new offerings to offset the cost of developing them. \n \n If the mobile solutions available to Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers are not effective, the use of our platform could decline. \n \n Visits and purchases made on mobile devices by consumers, including Etsy buyers, have increased significantly in recent years. The smaller screen size and reduced functionality associated with some mobile devices may make the use of our platform more difficult or less appealing to members. Visits to our marketplace on mobile devices may not convert into purchases as often as visits made through personal computers, which could result in less revenue for us. Etsy sellers are also increasingly using mobile devices to operate their businesses on our platform. If we are not able to deliver a rewarding experience on mobile devices, Etsy sellers\u0092 ability to manage and grow their businesses may be harmed and, consequently, our business may suffer. Further, although we strive to provide engaging mobile experiences for both Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers who visit our mobile website using a browser on their mobile device, we depend on Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers downloading our mobile apps to provide them the optimal mobile experience. \n \n 21 \n \n As new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, we may encounter problems in developing or supporting apps for them. In addition, supporting new devices and mobile device operating systems may require substantial time and resources. \n \n The success of our mobile apps could also be harmed by factors outside our control, such as: \n \n \u0095 actions taken by providers of mobile operating systems or mobile app download stores; \n \n \u0095 unfavorable treatment received by our mobile apps, especially as compared to competing apps, such as the placement of our mobile apps in a mobile app download store; \n \n \u0095 increased costs to distribute or have members use our mobile apps; or \n \n \u0095 changes in mobile operating systems, such as iOS and Android, that degrade the functionality of our mobile website or mobile apps or that give preferential treatment to competitive products. \n \n If our members encounter difficulty accessing or using our platform on their mobile devices, or if our members choose not to use our platform on their mobile devices, our growth prospects and our business may be adversely affected. \n \n We face intense competition and may not be able to compete effectively. \n \n Our industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future. To be successful, we need to attract and retain both Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. As a result, we face competition from a wide range of online and offline competitors. See \u0093Business\u0097Competition.\u0094 \n \n We compete with retailers for Etsy sellers. An Etsy seller can list her goods for sale with online retailers, such as Amazon.com, eBay or Alibaba, or sell her goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues or marketplaces. She may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers, including large national retailers, who discover her goods in our marketplace or otherwise. We also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses, enabling an Etsy seller to sell from her own website or otherwise run her business independently of our platform, such as Square, Intuit and Shopify. \n \n We compete to attract, engage and retain Etsy sellers based on many factors, including: \n \n \u0095 our brand awareness; \n \n \u0095 the breadth of our online presence; \n \n \u0095 the number and engagement of Etsy buyers; \n \n \u0095 the extent to which our Seller Services can ease the administrative tasks that an Etsy seller might encounter in running her business, including through mobile apps; \n \n \u0095 our fees; \n \n 22 \n \n \u0095 the strength of our community; and \n \n \u0095 our values. \n \n In addition, we compete with retailers for the attention of the Etsy buyer. An Etsy buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer, whether large marketplaces, such as Amazon.com, eBay or Alibaba, or national retail chains, such as Pottery Barn or Target, or local consignment and vintage stores or other venues or marketplaces. Many of these competitors offer low-cost or free shipping, fast shipping times, favorable return policies and other features that may be difficult or impossible for Etsy sellers to match. \n \n We compete to attract, engage and retain Etsy buyers based on many factors, including: \n \n \u0095 the unique goods that Etsy sellers list in our marketplace; \n \n \u0095 our brand awareness; \n \n \u0095 the person-to-person commerce experience; \n \n \u0095 our reputation for authenticity; \n \n \u0095 our mobile apps; \n \n \u0095 ease of payment; and \n \n \u0095 the availability and reliability of our platform. \n \n Many of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater resources, better name recognition or more customers than we do. They may invest more to develop and promote their services than we do, and they may offer lower fees to sellers than we do. Additionally, we believe that it is relatively easy for new businesses to create online commerce offerings or tools or services that enable entrepreneurship. \n \n Local companies or more established companies based in markets where we operate outside of the United States may also have a better understanding of local customs, providing them a competitive advantage. For example, in certain markets outside the United States, we compete with smaller, but similar, local online marketplaces with a focus on unique goods that are attempting to attract sellers and buyers in those markets. \n \n If we are unable to compete successfully, or if competing successfully requires us to expend significant resources in response to our competitors\u0092 actions, our business could be adversely affected. \n \n 23 \n \n We may expand our business through acquisitions of other businesses, which may divert management\u0092s attention and/or prove to be unsuccessful. \n \n We have acquired a number of other businesses in the past and may acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future. For example, in April 2014 we acquired Jarvis Labs, Inc. (d/b/a Grand St.) and in June 2014 we acquired Incubart SAS (d/b/a A Little Market). Acquisitions may divert management\u0092s time and focus from operating our business. Acquisitions also may require us to spend a substantial portion of our available cash, incur debt or other liabilities, amortize expenses related to intangible assets or incur write-offs of goodwill or other assets. In addition, integrating an acquired business or technology is risky. Completed and future acquisitions may result in unforeseen operational difficulties and expenditures associated with: \n \n \u0095 incorporating new businesses and technologies into our infrastructure; \n \n \u0095 consolidating operational and administrative functions; \n \n \u0095 coordinating outreach to our community; \n \n \u0095 maintaining morale and culture and retaining and integrating key employees; \n \n \u0095 maintaining or developing controls, procedures and policies (including effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures); and \n \n \u0095 assuming liabilities related to the activities of the acquired business before the acquisition, including liabilities for violations of laws and regulations, commercial disputes, taxes and other matters. \n \n Moreover, we may not benefit from our acquisitions as we expect, or in the time frame we expect. We also may issue additional equity securities in connection with an acquisition, which could cause dilution to our stockholders. Finally, acquisitions could be viewed negatively by analysts, investors or our members. \n \n Our ability to recruit and retain employees is important to our success. \n \n We strive to attract and motivate employees, from our office administrators to our management team, who share our dedication to our community and our mission. \n \n Some of the challenges we face in attracting and retaining employees include: \n \n \u0095 preserving our company culture as we grow; \n \n \u0095 continuing to attract and retain employees who share our values; \n \n \u0095 promoting existing employees into leadership positions to help sustain and grow our culture; \n \n \u0095 hiring employees in multiple locations globally; \n \n \u0095 responding to competitive pressures and changing business conditions in ways that do not divert us from our values; and \n \n 24 \n \n \u0095 integrating new personnel and businesses from acquisitions. \n \n Our ability to attract, retain and motivate employees, including our management team, is important to our success. In general, our key personnel work for us on an at-will basis. Other companies, including our competitors, may be successful in recruiting and hiring our employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis or on competitive terms. \n \n Filling engineering, product management and other technical positions in the New York City area is particularly challenging, especially in light of our distinctive technology philosophy and engineering culture. Qualified individuals are limited and in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract, develop and motivate them. Even if we were to offer higher compensation and other benefits, people with suitable technical skills may choose not to join us or to continue to work for us. If we are not able to maintain our engineering culture and broader company culture, then our ability to recruit and retain employees could suffer and our business would be harmed. \n \n The growth of our business may strain our management team and our operational and financial infrastructure. \n \n We have experienced rapid growth in our business, such as in headcount, the number of Etsy sellers and the number of countries in which we have members, and we plan to continue to grow in the future, both in the United States and abroad. For example, our headcount has grown from 251 employees on December 31, 2011 to 685 employees on December 31, 2014, an increase of 172.9%. The growth of our business places significant demands on our management team and pressure to expand our operational and financial infrastructure. As we continue to grow, our operating expenses will increase. If we do not manage our growth effectively, the increases in our operating expenses could outpace any increases in our revenue and our business could be harmed. \n \n Continued growth could also pose other challenges, such as the need to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls and to enhance our reporting systems and procedures. For example, in 2013 we began implementing a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system to enhance a variety of important functions such as invoicing, accounts receivable, accounts payable, foreign currency translation, financial consolidation and internal and external financial and management reporting matters. ERP system implementations are complex, long-term projects that involve substantial expenditures. To fully realize the benefits of the new ERP system we must also make significant changes to our business and financial processes. Our business may be harmed if the ERP system does not function as expected or does not result in the expected benefits. \n \n We rely on Etsy sellers to provide a fulfilling experience to Etsy buyers. \n \n A small portion of Etsy buyers complain to us about their experience with our platform. For example, Etsy buyers may report that they have not received the items that they purchased, that the items received were not as represented by an Etsy seller or that an Etsy seller has not been responsive to their questions. \n \n 25 \n \n Negative publicity and member sentiment generated as a result of these types of complaints could reduce our ability to attract new members or retain our current members or damage our reputation. A perception that our levels of responsiveness and member support are inadequate could have similar results. In some situations, we may choose to reimburse Etsy buyers for their purchases to help avoid harm to our reputation, but we may not be able to recover the funds we expend for those reimbursements. \n \n Anything that disrupts the operations of a substantial number of Etsy sellers, such as interruptions in delivery services, natural disasters, inclement weather, public health crises or political unrest, could also result in negative experiences for a substantial number of Etsy buyers. \n \n Etsy sellers rely on third-party services to deliver their orders. \n \n Etsy sellers work with a number of third-party services such as FedEx, UPS, the United States Postal Service and Canada Post to deliver their products to Etsy buyers. Anything that prevents timely delivery of goods to Etsy buyers could harm Etsy sellers and could negatively affect our reputation. Delays or interruptions may be caused by events that are beyond the control of the delivery services, such as inclement weather, natural disasters, transportation disruptions, terrorism, public health crises or labor unrest. For example, certain delivery services were reported to have been overwhelmed by the volume of shipments during the 2013 holiday season, resulting in significant delays in delivery times. The delivery services could also be affected by industry consolidation, insolvency or government shut-downs. Although we have agreements with certain delivery services that enable us to provide pre-paid shipping labels as a convenience to Etsy sellers, our agreements do not require these providers to offer delivery services to Etsy sellers. Further, our competitors could obtain preferential rates or shipping services, causing Etsy sellers to pay higher shipping costs or find alternative delivery services. If the goods sold in our marketplace are not delivered in proper condition, on a timely basis or at shipping rates that Etsy buyers are willing to pay, our reputation and our business could be adversely affected. \n \n Our reputation may be harmed if members of our community use unethical business practices. \n \n Our emphasis on our values makes our reputation particularly sensitive to allegations of unethical business practices by Etsy sellers or other members of our community. Our policies promote legal and ethical business practices, such as encouraging Etsy sellers to work only with manufacturers who do not use child or involuntary labor, who do not discriminate and who promote sustainability and humane working conditions. However, we do not control Etsy sellers or other members of our community or their business practices and cannot ensure that they comply with our policies. If members of our community engage in illegal or unethical business practices or are perceived to do so, we may receive negative publicity and our reputation may be harmed. \n \n Failure to deal effectively with fraud could harm our business. \n \n Although we have measures in place to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent activity in our marketplace, those measures may not always be effective. \n \n 26 \n \n For example, Etsy sellers occasionally receive orders placed with fraudulent or stolen credit card data. Under current credit card practices, we may be liable for orders placed through Direct Checkout with fraudulent credit card data even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction. Although we attempt to detect or challenge allegedly fraudulent transactions, we may not be able to do so effectively. As a result, our business could be adversely affected. We could also incur significant fines or lose our ability to give members the option of paying with credit cards if we fail to follow payment card industry data security standards or fail to limit fraudulent transactions conducted in our marketplace. \n \n Negative publicity and member sentiment resulting from fraudulent or deceptive conduct by members or the perception that our levels of responsiveness and member support are inadequate could reduce our ability to attract new members or retain existing members and damage our reputation. \n \n If sensitive information about our members is disclosed, or if we or our third-party providers are subject to cyber attacks, our members may curtail use of our platform, we may be exposed to liability and our reputation would suffer. \n \n We collect, transmit and store personal and financial information provided by our members, such as names, email addresses, the details of transactions and credit card and other financial information. Some of our third-party service providers, such as identity verification and payment processing providers, also regularly have access to member data. In an effort to protect sensitive information, we rely on a variety of security measures, including encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties. However, advances in computer capabilities, increasingly sophisticated tools and methods used by hackers and cyber terrorists, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in our failure or inability to adequately protect sensitive information. The preventive measures we take to address these risks are costly and may become more costly in the future. \n \n Like all online services, our platform is vulnerable to power outages, telecommunications failures and catastrophic events, as well as computer viruses, break-ins, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber attacks. Any of these incidents could lead to interruptions or shutdowns of our platform, loss of data or unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable or other sensitive information. Cyber attacks could also result in the theft of our intellectual property. If we gain greater visibility, we may face a higher risk of being targeted by cyber attacks. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments may result in cyber attacks becoming more sophisticated and more difficult to detect. We and our third-party service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all such cyber attacks. Moreover, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. Security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or employees of our third-party service providers. \n \n We and our third-party service providers regularly experience cyber attacks aimed at disrupting our and our third-party service providers\u0092 services. If we or our third-party service providers experience security breaches that result in marketplace performance or availability problems or the loss or unauthorized \n \n 27 \n \n disclosure of sensitive information, people may become unwilling to provide us the information necessary to set up member accounts. Existing members may also decrease their purchases or stop listing new items for sale or close their accounts altogether. We could also face potential liability and litigation, which may not be adequately covered by insurance. Any of these results could harm our growth prospects, our business and our reputation. \n \n Our business depends on network and mobile infrastructure provided by third parties and on our ability to maintain and scale the technology underlying our platform. \n \n The reliability of our platform is important to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain members. As our number of members, volume of traffic, number of transactions and the amount of information shared on our platform grow, our need for additional network capacity and computing power will also grow. The operation of the technology underlying our platform is expensive and complex, and we could experience operational failures. If we fail to accurately predict the rate or timing of the growth of our platform, we may be required to incur significant additional costs to maintain reliability. \n \n We also depend on the development and maintenance of the Internet and mobile infrastructure. This includes maintenance of reliable Internet and mobile networks with the necessary speed, data capacity and security, as well as timely development of complementary products. \n \n Third-party providers host much of our technology infrastructure. Any disruption in their services, or any failure of our providers to handle the demands of our marketplace could significantly harm our business. We exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to their financial conditions and to problems with the services they provide. If we experience failures in our technology infrastructure or do not expand our technology infrastructure successfully, then our ability to attract and retain members could be adversely affected, which could harm our growth prospects and our business. \n \n Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet and mobile networks. \n \n Our members rely on access to the Internet or mobile networks to access our marketplace. Internet service providers may choose to disrupt or degrade our members\u0092 access to our platform or increase the cost of such access. Mobile network operators or operating system providers could block or place onerous restrictions on our members\u0092 ability to download and use our mobile apps. \n \n Internet service providers or mobile network operators could also attempt to charge us for providing access to our platform. Although the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, recently approved new rules that would prohibit Internet service providers from charging content providers higher rates in order to deliver their content over certain \u0093fast traffic\u0094 lanes, these rules will not go into effect until later this year and could be subject to legal challenge or statutory preemption, which could delay or prevent implementation. If the FCC\u0092s rules are not implemented, our business could be adversely impacted. Outside of the United States, government regulation of the Internet, including the idea of network neutrality, may be developing or non-existent. As a result, we could face discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede both our and Etsy sellers\u0092 growth prospects, increase our costs and harm our business. \n \n 28 \n \n Our business is subject to a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. laws, many of which are evolving. \n \n We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and around the world, including those relating to traditional businesses, such as employment laws and taxation, and newer laws and regulations focused on the Internet and online commerce, such as payment systems, privacy, anti-spam, data protection, electronic contracts and consumer protection. These laws and regulations are continuously evolving, and compliance is costly and can require changes to our business practices and significant management time and effort. Additionally, it is not always clear how existing laws apply to the Internet as many of these laws do not address the unique issues raised by the Internet or online commerce. \n \n For example, laws relating to online privacy are evolving differently in different jurisdictions. Federal, state and non-U.S. governmental authorities, as well as courts interpreting the laws, continue to evaluate the privacy implications of the use of third-party \u0093cookies,\u0094 \u0093web beacons\u0094 and other methods of online tracking. The United States, the European Union and other governments have enacted or are considering legislation that could significantly restrict the ability of companies and individuals to collect and store user information, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tracking tools. \n \n Some providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented, or have announced plans to implement, ways to block tracking technologies which, if widely adopted, could also result in online tracking methods becoming significantly less effective. Any reduction in our ability to make effective use of such technologies could harm our ability to personalize the experience of Etsy buyers, increase our costs and limit our ability to attract new members and retain existing members on cost-effective terms. As a result, our business could be adversely affected. \n \n In some cases, non-U.S. privacy, data protection, consumer protection and other laws and regulations are more restrictive than those in the United States. For example, the European Union traditionally has imposed stricter obligations under such laws than the United States. Consequently, the expansion of our operations internationally may require changes to the ways we collect and use consumer information. \n \n Existing and future laws and regulations enacted by federal, state or non-U.S. governments could impede the growth or use of the Internet or online commerce. It is also possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on our platform or may even attempt to block access to our platform. If we are restricted from operating in one or more countries, our ability to attract or retain members may be adversely affected and we may not be able to grow our business as we anticipate. \n \n We strive to comply with all applicable laws, but they may conflict with each other, and by complying with the laws or regulations of one jurisdiction, we may find that we are violating the laws or regulations of another jurisdiction. Despite our efforts, we may not have fully complied in the past and may not in the future. If we become liable under laws or regulations applicable to us, we could be required to pay significant fines and penalties, and we may be forced to change the way we operate. That could require us to incur significant expenses or to discontinue certain services, which could negatively affect our business. \n \n 29 \n \n Additionally, if third parties with whom we work violate applicable laws or our policies, those violations could result in other liabilities for us and could harm our business. \n \n We may be unable to protect our intellectual property adequately. \n \n Our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business. To establish and protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark and, to a lesser extent, patent laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. We generally do not elect to register our copyrights or the majority of our trademarks, relying instead on the laws protecting unregistered intellectual property, which may not be sufficient. In addition, our copyrights and trademarks, whether or not registered, and patents, may be held invalid or unenforceable if challenged. While we have obtained or applied for patent protection with respect to some of our intellectual property, we generally do not rely on patents as a principal means of protecting intellectual property. To the extent we do seek patent protection, any U.S. or other patents issued to us may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies. \n \n In addition, we may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Even if we do detect violations, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights. Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive and could divert our management\u0092s attention. In addition, our efforts may be met with defenses and counterclaims challenging the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights or may result in a court determining that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable. If we are unable to cost-effectively protect our intellectual property rights, then our business could be harmed. \n \n We may be subject to claims that items listed in our marketplace are counterfeit, infringing or illegal. \n \n Although we do not create or take possession of the items listed in our marketplace by Etsy sellers, we frequently receive communications alleging that items listed in our marketplace infringe third-party copyrights, trademarks, patents or other intellectual property rights. We have intellectual property complaint and take-down procedures in place to address these communications, and we believe such procedures are important to promote confidence in our marketplace. We follow these procedures to review complaints and relevant facts to determine whether to take the appropriate action, which may include removal of the item from our marketplace and, in certain cases, closing the shops of Etsy sellers who repeatedly violate our policies. \n \n Our procedures may not effectively reduce or eliminate our liability. In particular, we may be subject to civil or criminal liability for activities carried out by Etsy sellers on our platform, especially outside the United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Under current U.S. copyright law and the Communications Decency Act, we may benefit from statutory safe harbor provisions that protect us from liability for content posted by our members. However, trademark and patent laws do not include similar statutory provisions, liability for these forms of intellectual property is often \n \n 30 \n \n determined by court decisions. These safe harbors and court rulings may change unfavorably. In that event, we may be held secondarily liable for the intellectual property infringement of Etsy sellers. \n \n Regardless of the validity of any claims made against us, we may incur significant costs and efforts to defend against or settle them. If a governmental authority determines that we have aided and abetted the infringement or sale of counterfeit goods or if legal changes result in us potentially being liable for actions by Etsy sellers on our platform, we could face regulatory, civil or criminal penalties. Successful claims by third-party rights owners could require us to pay substantial damages or refrain from permitting any further listing of the relevant items. These types of claims could force us to modify our business practices, which could lower our revenue, increase our costs or make our platform less user-friendly for our members. Moreover, public perception that counterfeit or other unauthorized items are common in our marketplace, even if factually incorrect, could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation. \n \n We may be subject to intellectual property claims, which are extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future. \n \n Companies in the Internet and technology industries are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We periodically receive notices that claim we have infringed, misappropriated or misused other parties\u0092 intellectual property rights. To the extent we gain greater public recognition, we may face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property claims. Third-party intellectual property rights may cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods or block us from expanding our offerings. Any intellectual property claim against us, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert the attention of our management. Litigation regarding intellectual property rights is inherently uncertain due to the complex issues involved, and we may not be successful in defending ourselves in such matters. \n \n In addition, some of our competitors have extensive portfolios of issued patents. Many potential litigants, including some of our competitors and patent holding companies, have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights. Any claims successfully brought against us could subject us to significant liability for damages and we may be required to stop using technology or other intellectual property alleged to be in violation of a third party\u0092s rights. We also might be required to seek a license for third-party intellectual property. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties or submit to unreasonable terms, which would increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and expense. If we cannot license or develop technology for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit our service and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results could harm our business. \n \n 31 \n \n We may be involved in litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming. \n \n In addition to intellectual property claims, we may become involved in other litigation matters, including class action lawsuits. Any lawsuit to which we are a party, with or without merit, may result in an unfavorable judgment. We also may decide to settle lawsuits on unfavorable terms. Any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial damages or fines, damage to our reputation or adverse changes to our offerings or business practices. Any of these results could adversely affect our business. In addition, defending claims is costly and can impose a significant burden on our management. \n \n Our software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors. \n \n The software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after the code has been released. We rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as \u0093continuous deployment,\u0094 meaning that we typically release software code many times per day. This practice may result in the more frequent introduction of errors or vulnerabilities into the software underlying our platform. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after release could result in damage to our reputation, loss of members, loss of revenue or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our growth prospects and our business. \n \n We are subject to the terms of open source licenses because our platform incorporates open source software. \n \n The software powering our marketplace incorporates software covered by open source licenses. In addition, we regularly contribute source code to open source software projects and release internal software projects under open source licenses, and we anticipate doing so in the future. The terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts and there is a risk that the licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to operate our marketplace. Under certain open source licenses, we could be required to publicly release the source code of our software or to make our software available under open source licenses. To avoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code, we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software. In addition, use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform. Additionally, because any software source code we contribute to open source projects is publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we will be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and, if not addressed, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n \n 32 \n \n Our business and our members may be subject to sales and other taxes. \n \n The application of indirect taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, or VAT, provincial taxes, goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipt tax, to businesses like ours and to our members is a complex and evolving issue. For example, as of January 1, 2015, the European Union imposed an obligation on marketplaces to collect and remit VAT on sales of automatically-downloaded digital items, and we are in the process of implementing such collection and remittance procedures. Significant judgment is required to evaluate applicable tax obligations and as a result amounts recorded are estimates and could change. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how existing statutes apply to our business or to Etsy sellers\u0092 businesses. One or more states, the federal government or other countries may seek to impose additional reporting, record-keeping or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours that facilitate online commerce. For example, the U.S. Congress is currently considering the \u0093Marketplace Fairness Act,\u0094 which would grant states the authority to require online merchants to collect sales tax on online sales at the time a transaction is completed. New taxes could also require us or Etsy sellers to incur substantial costs to capture data and collect and remit taxes. If such obligations were imposed, the additional costs associated with tax collection, remittance and audit requirements could make selling in our marketplace less attractive and more costly for Etsy sellers, which could adversely affect our business. \n \n We may experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate. \n \n We are subject to taxation in the United States and in numerous other jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on current tax payments and our estimates of future tax payments, which may include reserves for estimates of probable settlements of tax audits. At any one time, multiple tax years could be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and exposures are re-evaluated. Further, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, changes in the mix of revenue among different jurisdictions, changes to accounting rules and changes to our ownership or capital structure. Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate could adversely affect our business. \n \n In January 2015, we implemented a revised corporate structure to more closely align our structure with our global operations and future expansion plans outside of the United States. Our new corporate structure changes how we use our intellectual property and implements certain intercompany arrangements, which we expect may result in a reduction in our overall effective tax rate and other operational efficiencies. The tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to interpretation, and their application may depend on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure. Moreover, these tax laws are subject to change. Tax authorities may disagree with our position as to the tax treatment of our transfer of intangible assets or determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax consequences. If our new corporate structure does not achieve our expectations for any of these or other reasons, we may be subject to a higher overall effective tax rate and our business may be adversely affected. \n \n 33 \n \n We rely on consumer discretionary spending and may be adversely affected by economic downturns and other macroeconomic conditions or trends. \n \n Macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect our business. If general economic conditions deteriorate in the United States or other markets where we operate, consumer discretionary spending may decline and demand for the goods available in our marketplace may be reduced. This would cause sales in our marketplace to decline and adversely impact our business. Conversely, if recent trends supporting self-employment and the desire for supplemental income were to reverse, the number of Etsy sellers offering their goods in our marketplace could decline and the number of goods listed in our marketplace could decline. \n \n Even without changes in economic conditions, the demand for the goods listed in our marketplace is dependent on consumer preferences. Consumer preferences can change quickly and may differ across generations and cultures. If demand for the goods that Etsy sellers offer in our marketplace declines, our business would be harmed. Trends in socially-conscious consumerism and buying locally could also shift or slow to the detriment of our business. Our growth prospects would also be hampered if the shift to online and mobile commerce does not continue. \n \n The terms of our debt instruments may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies. \n \n We do not currently have any obligations outstanding under our credit facility. However, our credit facility requires us, and any debt instruments we may enter into in the future may require us, to comply with various covenants that limit our ability to take actions such as: \n \n \u0095 disposing of assets; \n \n \u0095 completing mergers or acquisitions; \n \n \u0095 incurring additional indebtedness; \n \n \u0095 encumbering our properties or assets; \n \n \u0095 paying dividends or making other distributions; \n \n \u0095 making specified investments; and \n \n \u0095 engaging in transactions with our affiliates. \n \n These restrictions could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies. If we default under our credit facility and if the default is not cured or waived, the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend to us and cause any amounts outstanding to be payable immediately. Such a default could also result in cross defaults under other debt instruments. Our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon a default. Moreover, any such default would limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which may have an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity. \n \n 34 \n \n We may need additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. \n \n We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility, will be enough to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other developments, such as acquisitions or investments we may decide to pursue. If our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to borrow funds under our credit facility or sell additional equity or debt securities. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders. Borrowing funds would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in additional operating and financial covenants that would limit our operations. It is also possible that financing may not be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. \n \n If our insurance coverage is insufficient or our insurers are unable to meet their obligations, our insurance may not mitigate the risks facing our business. \n \n We contract for insurance to cover a number of risks and potential liabilities. Our insurance policies cover areas such as general liability, errors and omissions liability, employment liability, business interruptions, data breach, crime, product liability and directors\u0092 and officers\u0092 liability. For certain types of business risk, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire insurance. In addition, we may not obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate the risks we face or we may have to pay high premiums and/or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain. Additionally, if any of our insurers becomes insolvent, it would be unable to pay any claims that we make. \n \n We are an emerging growth company and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors. \n \n We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of some of the exemptions from the reporting requirements applicable to other public companies. For example, we intend to take advantage of the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments. It is possible that investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions. If so, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. \n \n We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion or (c) in which we become a large accelerated filer, which means that we have been public for at least 12 months, have filed at least one annual report and the market value of our common \n \n 35 \n \n stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last day of our then most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. \n \n Operating as a public company will require us to incur substantial costs and will require substantial management attention. In addition, our management team has limited experience managing a public company. \n \n As a public company, we will incur substantial legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, or the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. The rules and regulations of Nasdaq will also apply to us following this offering. As part of the new requirements, we will need to establish and maintain effective disclosure and financial controls and make changes to our corporate governance practices. We expect that compliance with these requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming. \n \n Most of our management and other personnel have little experience managing a public company and preparing public filings. In addition, we expect that our management and other personnel will need to divert attention from other business matters to devote substantial time to the reporting and other requirements of being a public company. In particular, we expect to incur significant expense and devote substantial management effort to complying with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. \n \n Our management will not be required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the end of the fiscal year for which our second annual report is due. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy of our financial reports. \n \n As a public company, we will be required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Beginning with our second annual report following this offering, we will be required to provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting. When we are no longer an emerging growth company, our management report on internal control over financial reporting will need to be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm. We do not expect to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to our management report on internal control over financial reporting while we are an emerging growth company. \n \n If we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. In addition, our internal control \n \n 36 \n \n over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and fraud. Because of the inherent limitations in \n \n all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. \n \n If there are material weaknesses or failures in our ability to meet any of the requirements related to the maintenance and reporting of our internal controls, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and that could cause the price of our common stock to decline. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional management attention and which could adversely affect our business. \n \n As described below we currently have two material weaknesses, which we are in the process of remediating. \n \n We currently have identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that, if not corrected, could result in material misstatements of our financial statements. \n \n In connection with the audit of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, we identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. \n \n First, we determined that we did not have adequate procedures and controls to appropriately account for certain non-income tax-related expenses and comply with the related filing requirements. Second, we determined that we did not have adequate cut-off procedures to ensure the timely recording of certain period-end accruals. \n \n These two material weaknesses resulted in a misstatement of expenses in prior periods that were immaterial to previously issued annual financial statements but in combination were material to certain interim periods. The impact of these material weaknesses resulted in the revision of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, for the three months ended March 31, 2013, the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, the three months ended December 31, 2013 and the three months ended September 30, 2014. The impacts of these material weaknesses also resulted in the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2014, the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014. \n \n Neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm has performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In light of the material weaknesses that were identified, we believe that it is possible that additional material weaknesses and control deficiencies may have been identified if such an evaluation had been performed. \n \n 37 \n \n We are working to remediate the material weaknesses. We have taken steps to enhance our internal control environment and plan to take additional steps to remediate the material weaknesses. Specifically: \n \n \u0095 we began building an in-house tax function in early 2014 and have added a global head of tax, senior tax manager of planning and a dedicated senior state tax accountant and plan to add an experienced director of tax accounting. We have also hired additional qualified personnel in our accounts payable function, including an experienced supervisor, and plan to add an additional experienced senior accountant. We will continue to evaluate the structure of the finance organization and add resources as needed; \n \n \u0095 we are implementing additional internal reporting procedures, including those designed to add depth to our review processes and improve our segregation of duties; \n \n \u0095 we are updating our systems so that we may collect the necessary information to enable us to more effectively monitor and comply with applicable non-income tax-filing requirements on a timely basis; \n \n \u0095 we are improving the communication and coordination among our finance departments and our record-keeping procedures and we have expanded cross-functional involvement and input into period-end accruals. We are also planning enhancements in our procure-to-pay process as well as additions to analytical procedures used to assess period-end accruals; and \n \n \u0095 we are in the process of documenting, assessing and testing our internal control over financial reporting as part of our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. \n \n The actions that we are taking are subject to ongoing senior management review as well as audit committee oversight. Although we plan to complete this remediation process as quickly as possible, we cannot at this time estimate how long it will take, and our efforts may not be successful in remediating these material weaknesses. In addition, we will incur additional costs in improving our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to successfully remediate these material weaknesses or if we identify additional material weaknesses, we may not detect errors on a timely basis. This could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our SEC reporting obligations or Nasdaq listing requirements on a timely basis, adversely affect our reputation, cause our stock price to decline or result in inaccurate financial reporting or material misstatements in our annual or interim financial statements. \n \n Our business could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises or other unexpected events. \n \n Natural disasters and other adverse weather and climate conditions, public health crises, political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war and other political instability, or other unexpected events, could disrupt our operations, Internet or mobile networks, or the operations of one or more of our service providers. For example, when Hurricane Sandy struck New York in October 2012, although our data centers were unaffected, our headquarters in Brooklyn was closed for five days, and we experienced a heavy volume of \n \n 38 \n \n member support requests which required us to devote additional resources to handle those requests. Events of this type could also impact Etsy sellers\u0092 ability to continue producing goods for sale in our marketplace. In addition, such events could negatively impact consumer spending in the affected regions. If any of these events occurs, our business could be adversely affected. \n \n 39 \n \n Risks Related to This Offering and Ownership of Our Common Stock \n \n The price of our common stock could be volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above our initial public offering price. Declines in the price of common stock could subject us to litigation. \n \n There has not been a public market for our common stock prior to this offering and an active trading market may not develop following this offering. Even if such a market does develop, it may not be sustainable. If trading in our common stock is not active, you may not be able to sell your shares quickly, at the market price or at all. The initial public offering price for the shares was determined by negotiations between us and the representative of the underwriters and may not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the trading market following this offering. In addition, the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have historically been highly volatile. Accordingly, the price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations for many reasons, many of which are beyond our control, including those described in these Risk Factors and others such as: \n \n \u0095 variations in our operating results and other financial and operational metrics, including the key financial and operating metrics disclosed in this prospectus, as well as how those results and metrics compare to analyst and investor expectations; \n \n \u0095 speculation about our operating results in the absence of our own financial projections; \n \n \u0095 failure of analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in their estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by analysts that follow our common stock; \n \n \u0095 announcements of new services or enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements or other developments by us or our competitors; \n \n \u0095 announcements by us or our competitors of mergers or acquisitions or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; \n \n \u0095 changes in our board of directors, management or other key personnel; \n \n \u0095 disruptions in our marketplace due to hardware, software or network problems, security breaches or other issues; \n \n \u0095 the strength of the global economy or the economy in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and market conditions in our industry and those affecting our members; \n \n \u0095 trading activity by our principal stockholders, including upon the expiration of contractual lock-up agreements; \n \n \u0095 the performance of the equity markets in general and in our industry; \n \n \u0095 the operating performance of other similar companies; \n \n 40 \n \n \u0095 changes in legal requirements relating to our business; \n \n \u0095 litigation or other claims against us; \n \n \u0095 the number of shares of our common stock that are available for public trading; and \n \n \u0095 any other factors discussed in this prospectus. \n \n In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations or financial condition. The price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies, even if those events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and could divert our management\u0092s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business. \n \n We have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this offering and may not use them effectively. \n \n The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our visibility, create a public market for our common stock and facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including continued investments in the growth of our business. We also intend to use $300,000 of the proceeds of this offering to partially fund Etsy.org, a Delaware non-profit organization that we formed in January 2015. We may use a portion of the net proceeds to fund the build-out of our new corporate headquarters. In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds received by us from this offering for acquisitions of other complementary businesses, technologies or other assets. However, we have no current understandings, agreements or commitments for any specific material acquisitions at this time. Except with respect to Etsy.org, we have not yet determined the manner in which we will allocate the net proceeds we receive from this offering. As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the allocation and use of the net proceeds. See \u0093Use of Proceeds.\u0094 \n \n The failure by our management to allocate or use these funds effectively could harm our business. Pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds we receive from this offering in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value. Our ultimate use of the net proceeds from this offering may vary substantially from their currently intended use. \n \n We do not intend to pay dividends on our capital stock, so any returns will be limited to increases in the value of our common stock. \n \n We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock is restricted by the terms of our credit facility and is likely to be restricted by \n \n 41 \n \n any future debt financing arrangement we enter into. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to increases in the price of our common stock, if any. \n \n Our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders beneficially own a substantial percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval. \n \n Our directors, executive officers, greater than 5% stockholders and their respective affiliates will hold in the aggregate approximately % of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock following this offering, assuming no exercise of the underwriters\u0092 option to purchase additional shares of our common stock in this offering. Therefore, these stockholders will continue to have the ability to influence us through their ownership position, even after this offering. If these stockholders act together, they may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders will be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our charter documents or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that other stockholders may feel are in their best interests. \n \n If you purchase our common stock in this offering, you will incur immediate and substantial dilution. \n \n The initial public offering price is substantially higher than the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our common stock of $ per share as of December 31, 2014. Investors purchasing common stock in this offering will pay a price per share that substantially exceeds the net tangible book value per share. As a result, investors purchasing common stock in this offering will incur immediate dilution of $ per share, based on the initial public offering price of $ per share, the midpoint of the price range on the cover page of this prospectus. \n \n This dilution is due to the substantially lower price paid by our investors who purchased shares prior to this offering as compared to the price offered to the public in this offering. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, there were outstanding options to purchase 23,050,594 shares of our common stock with a weighted average exercise price of approximately $2.67 per share and warrants to purchase 406,060 shares of our common stock (including preferred stock on an as-converted basis) with a weighted average exercise price of approximately $0.66 per share. The exercise of any of these options or warrants would result in additional dilution. As a result of the dilution to investors purchasing shares in this offering, investors may receive less than the purchase price paid in this offering in the event of our liquidation. See \u0093Dilution.\u0094 \n \n Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders following this offering could cause the price of our common stock to decline. \n \n Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing price of our common stock. \n \n 42 \n \n All of our executive officers and directors and the holders of substantially all of our capital stock are subject to lock-up agreements with the underwriters of this offering that restrict the stockholders\u0092 ability to transfer shares of our common stock for periods of at least 180 days, and for a portion of the shares, 270 and 360 days from the date of this prospectus. The lock-up agreements limit the number of shares of common stock that may be sold immediately following this offering. Subject to certain limitations, approximately shares will become eligible for sale upon expiration of the 180-day lock-up period, approximately shares will become eligible for sale upon expiration of the 270-day lock-up period and approximately shares will become eligible for sale upon expiration of the 360-day lock-up period. In addition, based on our capitalization as of December 31, 2014, shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants will also be eligible for sale upon expiration of the 180-day lock-up period. We intend to register all of the shares underlying outstanding options and any shares underlying other equity incentives we may grant in the future for public resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance to the extent permitted by any applicable vesting requirements and the lock-up agreements described above. Sales of stock by these stockholders could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. \n \n Certain holders of shares of our common stock have registration rights. See \u0093Description of Capital Stock\u0097Registration Rights.\u0094 Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by our affiliates as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Sales of securities by any of these stockholders could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. \n \n Future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. \n \n We may issue additional common stock, convertible securities or other equity following the completion of this offering. We also expect to issue common stock to our employees, directors and other service providers pursuant to our equity incentive plans. Such issuances could be dilutive to investors and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. New investors in such issuances could also receive rights senior to those of holders of our common stock. \n \n If analysts do not publish research about our business or if they publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, our stock price and trading volume could decline. \n \n The trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that analysts publish about our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If few analysts cover us, demand for our common stock could decrease and our common stock price and trading volume may decline. Similar results may occur if one or more of these analysts stop covering us in the future or fail to publish reports on us regularly. \n \n 43 \n \n Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, could limit attempts to make changes in our management and could depress the price of our common stock. \n \n Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or limiting changes in our management. Among other things, these provisions: \n \n \u0095 establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time; \n \n \u0095 permit our board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships; \n \n \u0095 provide that directors may only be removed for cause; \n \n \u0095 require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws; \n \n \u0095 authorize the issuance of \u0093blank check\u0094 preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan; \n \n \u0095 eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; \n \n \u0095 prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which means all stockholder actions must be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; \n \n \u0095 provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to amend or repeal any provision of our bylaws; \n \n \u0095 restrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware; and \n \n \u0095 establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. \n \n These provisions may delay or prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace members of our management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock. Anti-takeover provisions could depress the price of our common stock by acting to delay or prevent a change in control of our company. \n \n For information regarding these and other provisions, see \u0093Description of Capital Stock.\u0094 \n \n 44 \n \n Our certificate of incorporation will provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u0092 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. \n \n Our certificate of incorporation will provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u0092s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. \n \n 45 \n \n Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements \n \n This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that are based on our beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to us. The forward-looking statements are contained principally in \u0093Prospectus Summary,\u0094 \u0093Risk Factors,\u0094 \u0093Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u0094 \u0093Letter from Chad\u0094 and \u0093Business.\u0094 Forward-looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations and expenses, business strategies and plans, competitive position, business environment and potential growth opportunities. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terms such as \u0093anticipates,\u0094 \u0093believes,\u0094 \u0093could,\u0094 \u0093estimates,\u0094 \u0093expects,\u0094 \u0093intends,\u0094 \u0093may,\u0094 \u0093plans,\u0094 \u0093potential,\u0094 \u0093predicts,\u0094 \u0093projects,\u0094 \u0093seeks,\u0094 \u0093should,\u0094 \u0093will,\u0094 \u0093would\u0094 or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. \n \n Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Those risks include those described in \u0093Risk Factors\u0094 and elsewhere in this prospectus. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements in this prospectus. Also, forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this prospectus. You should read this prospectus and the documents that we have filed as exhibits to the registration statement, of which this prospectus is a part, and any related free writing prospectus, completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. \n \n Any forward-looking statement made by us in this prospectus speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by law, we disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements. \n \n 46 \n \n Industry and Market Data \n \n We obtained the industry, market and competitive position data in this prospectus from our own internal estimates and research, from industry and general publications and from research, surveys and studies conducted by third parties. This information involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such estimates. \n \n In addition, industry publications, studies and surveys generally state that they have been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. While we believe that each of these studies and publications is reliable, we have not independently verified market and industry data from third parties. Likewise, while we believe our internal company data is reliable and the definitions of these key operating metrics are appropriate, neither such data nor these definitions have been verified by any independent source. \n \n 47 \n \n Use of Proceeds \n \n We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the issuance of our common stock in this offering, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately $ million, or approximately $ million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, assuming an initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the offering price range on the cover page of this prospectus. \n \n We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. \n \n Each $1.00 increase (or decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, the midpoint of the offering price range on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase (or decrease) net proceeds to us by $ million, assuming that the number of shares offered by us on the cover page of this prospectus remains the same, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Each 1,000,000 increase (or decrease) in the number of shares of common stock offered by us would increase (or decrease) net proceeds to us by approximately $ million, assuming an initial public offering price of $ per share, the midpoint of the price range on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. \n \n The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our visibility, create a public market for our common stock and facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including continued investments in the growth of our business. Consistent with our values and our mission, we also intend to use $300,000 of the proceeds of this offering to partially fund Etsy.org, a Delaware non-profit organization that we formed in January 2015. Etsy.org will be dedicated to educating women and other under-represented entrepreneurial populations and empowering them to build businesses that regenerate communities and the planet. See \u0093Business\u0097Our Strategy: The Path Ahead\u0094 for additional information about Etsy.org. We may use a portion of the net proceeds to fund the build-out of our new corporate headquarters. In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds received by us from this offering for acquisitions of other complementary businesses, technologies or other assets. However, we have no current understandings, agreements or commitments for any specific material acquisitions at this time. Except with respect to Etsy.org, we have not allocated specific amounts of the net proceeds received by us from this offering for any of these purposes and, as a result, we will have broad discretion in the allocation and use of the net proceeds. \n \n Pending our use of the net proceeds received by us from this offering, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short and intermediate term, interest-bearing obligations, investment grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. \n \n 48 \n \n Dividend Policy \n \n We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future decision to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors thinks are relevant. Under Delaware law, we can only pay dividends either out of \u0093surplus\u0094 or out of the current or the immediately preceding year\u0092s net profits. Surplus is defined as the excess, if any, at any given time, of the total assets of a corporation over its total liabilities and statutory capital. As a result, we may not pay dividends according to our policy or at all if, among other things, we do not have sufficient cash to pay the intended dividends. Our future ability to pay cash dividends on our stock may be limited by the terms of any future debt or preferred securities and is limited by the terms of our Credit Agreement. See \u0093Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u0097Liquidity and Capital Resources\u0097Sources of Liquidity\u0094 for further information about our Credit Agreement. \n \n 49 \n \n Capitalization \n \n The following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and capitalization as of December 31, 2014: \n \n \u0095 on an actual basis; \n \n \u0095 on a pro forma basis to give effect to (i) the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock into common stock and (ii) the effectiveness of the amendment and restatement of our certificate of incorporation in connection with the completion of this offering; and \n \n \u0095 on a pro forma as adjusted basis to give effect to the adjustments discussed above and the issuance and sale by us of shares of common stock in this offering, and the receipt of the net proceeds from our sale of these shares at an assumed initial public offering price of the common stock of $ per share, the midpoint of the offering price range on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. \n \n The unaudited pro forma and pro forma as adjusted information below is illustrative only, and cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, total stockholders\u0092 equity and total capitalization after this offering will be adjusted based on the actual initial public offering price and other terms of this offering determined at pricing.

If the underwriters\u0092 option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, additional paid-in capital and total capitalization would increase by approximately $ million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, and we would have shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. \n \n See \u0093Prospectus Summary\u0097The Offering\u0094 for a description of those shares that are or are not reflected as outstanding shares on a pro forma basis in the table above. \n \n 51 \n \n Dilution \n \n If you invest in our common stock, your investment will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the offering price per share of our common stock and the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after this offering. Dilution results from the fact that the per share offering price of our common stock is substantially higher than the book value per share attributable to our existing stockholders. \n \n Our pro forma net tangible book value as of was $ million, or $ per share of common stock. Our pro forma net tangible book value per share represents the amount of our total tangible assets reduced by the amount of our total liabilities and divided by the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of , after giving effect to the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock into common stock in connection with this offering. \n \n After giving effect to our sale in this offering of shares of common stock at an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, the midpoint of the offering price range on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of would have been approximately $ million, or $ per share of common stock. This represents an immediate pro forma as adjusted dilution of $ per share to investors purchasing shares in this offering. \n \n The following table illustrates this per share dilution. \n \n Assumed initial offering price per share $ Pro forma net tangible book value per share as of $ Increase in pro forma net tangible book value per share attributable to investors purchasing shares in this offering $ Pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering Dilution per share to investors in this offering $ \n \n A $1.00 increase (or decrease) in the assumed offering price of $ per share would increase (or decrease) our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering by $ , assuming that the number of shares offered by us on the cover page of this prospectus remains the same, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions payable by us. \n \n If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after giving effect to this offering would be approximately $ per share, and the dilution in pro forma net tangible book value per share to investors in this offering would be approximately $ per share. \n \n The following table summarizes, as of , the differences between the number of outstanding shares of our common stock purchased from us, after giving effect to the conversion of our preferred stock into common stock, the total cash consideration paid and the average price per share paid by our existing \n \n 52 \n \n stockholders and by our new investors purchasing shares in this offering at the assumed offering price of the common stock of $ per share, the midpoint of the offering price range on the cover page of this prospectus, before deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us: \n \n Shares Purchased Total Consideration Average \n \n Price Per \n \n Share Number Percent Amount Percent Existing stockholders % $ % $ New investors Total 100 % $ 100 % $ \n \n Sales by the selling stockholders in this offering will cause the number of shares held by existing stockholders to be reduced to shares, or % of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding after this offering, and will increase the number of shares held by new investors to shares, or % of the total number of shares outstanding after this offering. \n \n A $1.00 increase (or decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share would increase (or decrease) total consideration paid by new investors by $ million, assuming that the number of shares offered by us on the cover page of this prospectus remains the same, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions payable by us. \n \n After giving effect to the sale of shares in this offering by us and the selling stockholders, if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, our existing stockholders would own % and our new investors would own % of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding after this offering. \n \n See \u0093Prospectus Summary\u0097The Offering\u0094 for a description of those shares that are or are not reflected in the foregoing tables or discussion. \n \n To the extent that any outstanding options or warrants are exercised, new investors will experience further dilution. \n \n 53 \n \n Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data \n \n The following tables show selected consolidated financial data. The selected consolidated statements of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, and the selected consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, are derived from our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus.

We began tracking mobile visits and mobile GMS in 2013. \n \n Non-GAAP Financial Measures \n \n Adjusted EBITDA \n \n In this prospectus, we provide Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net (loss) income before interest expense, net, (benefit) provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization, adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation expense, net unrealized loss on warrant and other liabilities, foreign exchange loss and acquisition-related expenses. Below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. \n \n We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this prospectus because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends, allocate internal resources, prepare and approve our annual budget, develop short- and long-term operating plans and assess the health of our business. As our Adjusted EBITDA increases, we are able to invest more in our platform. We believe \n \n 56 \n \n that Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business as it removes the impact of certain non-cash items and certain variable charges. \n \n Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: \n \n \u0095 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; \n \n \u0095 Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of stock-based compensation expense or changes in the fair value of warrants; \n \n \u0095 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; \n \n \u0095 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect acquisition-related expenses; \n \n \u0095 Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of foreign exchange loss; \n \n \u0095 Adjusted EBITDA, in future periods, will not reflect the impact of our contributions to Etsy.org; and \n \n \u0095 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. \n \n Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net (loss) income and our other GAAP results. \n \n The following table reflects the reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated: \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 2013 2014 (in thousands) Net loss $ (2,385) $ (796) $ (15,243) Excluding: Interest expense, net 438 256 549 (Benefit) provision for income taxes (145) 854 4,983 Depreciation and amortization 7,930 12,380 17,223 Stock-based compensation expense 4,094 3,834 5,920 Stock-based compensation expense\u0097acquisitions \u0097 \u0097 4,130 Net unrealized loss on warrant and other liabilities 737 419 411 Foreign exchange loss \u0097 \u0097 3,049 Acquisition-related expenses \u0097 \u0097 2,059 Adjusted EBITDA $ 10,669 $ 16,947 $ 23,081 \n \n 57 \n \n Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial \n \n Condition and Results of Operations \n \n You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this prospectus. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or elsewhere in this prospectus, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and our performance and future success, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the \u0093Risk Factors\u0094 section of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. \n \n Overview \n \n We operate a marketplace where people around the world connect, both online and offline, to make, sell and buy unique goods. Handmade goods are the foundation of our marketplace. Whether crafted by an Etsy seller herself, with the assistance of her team or with an outside manufacturer in small batches, handmade goods spring from the imagination and creativity of an Etsy seller and embody authorship, responsibility and transparency. We believe we are creating a new economy, which we call the Etsy Economy, where creative entrepreneurs find meaningful work and both global and local markets for their goods, and where thoughtful consumers discover and buy unique goods and build relationships with the people who sell them. \n \n Etsy was founded in June 2005 in Brooklyn, New York as a marketplace for handmade goods and craft supplies. From those beginnings, we have built an innovative, technology-based platform that, as of December 31, 2014, connected 54.0 million members, including 1.4 million active sellers and 19.8 million active buyers, in nearly every country in the world. In 2014, Etsy sellers generated GMS of $1.93 billion, of which 36.1% came from purchases made on mobile devices and 30.9% came from an Etsy seller or an Etsy buyer outside of the United States. \n \n Our business has grown in significant ways: \n \n \u0095 Our GMS was $1.35 billion in 2013, up 50.6% over 2012, and was $1.93 billion in 2014, up 43.3% over 2013. \n \n \u0095 Our revenue was $125.0 million in 2013, up 67.6% over 2012. In 2013, our Marketplace revenue was $78.5 million, up 42.0% over 2012, and our Seller Services revenue was $42.8 million, up 169.9% over 2012. Our revenue was $195.6 million in 2014, up 56.4% over 2013. In 2014, our Marketplace revenue was $108.7 million, up 38.4% over 2013, and our Seller Services revenue was $82.5 million, up 92.7% over 2013. \n \n 58 \n \n \u0095 As of December 31, 2013, our number of active sellers was 1.1 million, up 29.4% since December 31, 2012, and our number of active buyers was 14.0 million, up 50.6% since December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2014, our number of active sellers was 1.4 million, up 26.0% since December 31, 2013, and our number of active buyers was 19.8 million, up 41.2% since December 31, 2013. \n \n \u0095 Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers have transacted across borders since our first year of business, and our international community continues to grow. International GMS was 28.4% of GMS in 2013 and was 30.9% of GMS in 2014. Currently, Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers are based in nearly every country in the world and our marketplace is available in 10 languages. \n \n \u0095 We launched our first mobile app in 2011, and we continue to enhance our mobile offerings. Mobile visits represented 41.3% of visits in 2013 and 53.2% of visits in 2014. Mobile GMS represented 29.5% of GMS in 2013 and 36.1% of GMS in 2014. \n \n \u0095 We have continued to expand our Seller Services. We launched Promoted Listings in 2011, followed by Direct Checkout in 2012, Shipping Labels in 2013 and Wholesale in 2014. \n \n We operate a platform for third-party sellers. Our business model is based on shared success: we make money when Etsy sellers make money. We do not compete with Etsy sellers, hold inventory or sell goods. Our revenue is diversified, generated from a mix of marketplace activities and the services we provide Etsy sellers to help them create and grow their businesses. Marketplace revenue includes the fee an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction and the listing fee an Etsy seller pays for each item she lists. Seller Services revenue includes fees an Etsy seller pays for services such as prominent placement in search results via Promoted Listings, payment processing via Direct Checkout and purchases of shipping labels through our platform via Shipping Labels. Other revenue includes the fees we receive from a third-party payment processor. \n \n In 2013, Etsy sellers generated GMS of $1.35 billion, up 50.6% over 2012, and in 2014, Etsy sellers generated GMS of $1.93 billion, up 43.3% over 2013. In 2013, we generated revenue of $125.0 million, up 67.6% over 2012, and in 2014, we generated revenue of $195.6 million, up 56.4% over 2013. In 2013, we generated a net loss of $0.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $16.9 million compared to a net loss of $2.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $10.7 million in 2012. In 2014, we generated a net loss of $15.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $23.1 million compared to a net loss of $0.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $16.9 million in 2013. See \u0093Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u0097Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u0094 for more information and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. \n \n The consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 have been revised to correct for the understatement of certain non-income tax-related expenses. See Note 15 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. \n \n 59 \n \n Key Operating and Financial Metrics \n \n We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our ecosystem, allocate our resources (such as capital, time and technology investments) and assess the performance of our business. In addition to revenue, net (loss) income and other results under GAAP, the key operating and financial metrics we use are: \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 2013 2014 (in thousands, except percentages) GMS $ 895,152 $ 1,347,833 $ 1,931,981 Adjusted EBITDA $ 10,669 $ 16,947 $ 23,081 Active sellers 830 1,074 1,353 Active buyers 9,317 14,032 19,810 Percent mobile visits N/A 41.3 % 53.2 % Percent mobile GMS N/A 29.5 % 36.1 % Percent international GMS 28.4 % 28.4 % 30.9 % \n \n GMS \n \n Gross merchandise sales, or GMS, is the dollar value of items sold in our marketplace within the applicable period, excluding shipping fees and net of refunds associated with cancelled transactions. GMS does not represent revenue earned by us. GMS relates only to Marketplace activity and does not reflect Seller Services activity. However, because our revenue and cost of revenue depend significantly on the dollar value of items sold in our marketplace, we believe that GMS is an indicator of the success of Etsy sellers, the satisfaction of Etsy buyers, the health of our ecosystem and the scale and growth of our business. \n \n Adjusted EBITDA \n \n Adjusted EBITDA represents our net (loss) income before interest expense, net, (benefit) provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization, adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation expense, net unrealized loss on warrant and other liabilities, foreign exchange loss and acquisition-related expenses. In future periods, we intend to exclude the impact of our contributions to Etsy.org from Adjusted EBITDA. We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this prospectus because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, allocate internal resources, prepare and approve our annual budget, develop short- and long-term operating plans and assess the health of our ecosystem. As our Adjusted EBITDA increases, we are able to invest more resources in our community. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business as it removes the impact of non-cash items and certain variable charges. See \u0093Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u0097Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u0094 for information regarding the limitations of using Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. \n \n 60 \n \n Active Sellers \n \n An active seller is an Etsy seller who has incurred at least one charge from us in the last 12 months. Charges include transaction fees, listing fees and fees for Direct Checkout, Promoted Listings, Shipping Labels and Wholesale enrollment. An Etsy seller is a member who has created an account and has listed an item in our marketplace. An Etsy seller is identified by a unique e-mail address; a single person can have multiple Etsy seller accounts. We succeed when Etsy sellers succeed, so we view the number of active sellers as a key indicator of the awareness of our brand, the reach of our platform, the potential for growth in GMS and revenue and the health of our ecosystem. \n \n Active Buyers \n \n An active buyer is an Etsy buyer who has made at least one purchase in the last 12 months. An Etsy buyer is a member who has created an account in our marketplace. An Etsy buyer is identified by a unique e-mail address; a single person can have multiple Etsy buyer accounts. We succeed when Etsy buyers order items from Etsy sellers, so we view the number of active buyers as a key indicator of our potential for growth in GMS and revenue, the reach of our platform, awareness of our brand, the engagement and loyalty of Etsy buyers and the health of our ecosystem. \n \n Mobile Visits \n \n A mobile visit is a visit that occurs on a mobile device, such as a tablet or a smartphone. Etsy sellers are increasingly using mobile devices to manage their listings and track their business performance on our platform. In addition, Etsy buyers increasingly use mobile devices to search, browse and purchase items on our platform. We began tracking mobile visits in 2013. We view percent mobile visits as a key indicator of the level of engagement of our members on our mobile website and mobile apps and of our ability to sustain GMS and revenue. \n \n Mobile GMS \n \n Mobile GMS is GMS that occurs on a mobile device, such as a tablet or a smartphone. Mobile GMS excludes orders initiated on mobile devices but ultimately completed on a desktop. We began tracking mobile GMS in 2013. We believe that mobile GMS indicates our success in converting mobile activity into mobile purchases and demonstrates our ability to grow GMS and revenue. \n \n International GMS \n \n International GMS is GMS from transactions where either the billing address for the Etsy seller or the shipping address for the Etsy buyer at the time of sale is outside of the United States. We believe that international GMS shows the level of engagement of our community outside the United States and demonstrates our ability to grow GMS and revenue. \n \n 61 \n \n Key Factors Affecting Our Performance \n \n We believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in the section titled \u0093Risk Factors.\u0094 \n \n Growth and Retention of Active Sellers and Active Buyers \n \n Our success depends in part on the growth and retention of our active sellers and active buyers. Our revenue is driven by the number of active sellers, seller engagement, the number of active buyers, buyer engagement and our ability to maintain an authentic, trusted marketplace. As of December 31, 2014, our marketplace had grown to 1.4 million active sellers and 19.8 million active buyers, up from 1.1 million active sellers and 14.0 million active buyers as of December 31, 2013. Failure to effectively attract and retain new active sellers and active buyers, to re-engage inactive sellers and inactive buyers and to engage active sellers and active buyers on a cost-effective basis would adversely affect our revenue growth, operating results and the overall health of our ecosystem. \n \n To analyze our retention rates, we measure repeat activity by our members. \n \n Cohort of 2011 Active Sellers \n \n We refer to active sellers as of December 31, 2011 as \u00932011 Active Sellers.\u0094 Fifty-three percent of 2011 Active Sellers remained active sellers as of December 31, 2012, 39% of 2011 Active Sellers remained active sellers as of December 31, 2013 and 32% of 2011 Active Sellers remained active sellers as of December 31, 2014. The average annual GMS per 2011 Active Seller in 2012 was nearly three times higher than in 2011, the average annual GMS per 2011 Active Seller in 2013 was four times higher than in 2011 and the average annual GMS per 2011 Active Seller in 2014 was five times higher than in 2011. \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2011 2012 2013 2014 Percent 2011 Active Sellers 100 % 52.6 % 39.3 % 32.3 % Average GMS per 2011 Active Seller $ 817 $ 2,241 $ 3,314 $ 4,299 \n \n Cohort of 2011 Active Buyers \n \n We refer to active buyers as of December 31, 2011 as \u00932011 Active Buyers.\u0094 Forty-six percent of 2011 Active Buyers remained active buyers as of December 31, 2012, 45% of 2011 Active Buyers remained active buyers as of December 31, 2013 and 45% of 2011 Active Buyers remained active buyers as of December 31, 2014. The average annual GMS per 2011 Active Buyer in 2012 was 72% higher than in 2011, the average annual GMS per 2011 Active Buyer in 2013 was 81% higher than in 2011 and the average annual GMS per 2011 Active Buyer in 2014 was 89% higher than in 2011. \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2011 2012 2013 2014 Percent 2011 Active Buyers 100 % 46.2 % 44.7 % 44.7 % Average GMS per 2011 Active Buyer $ 103 $ 177 $ 186 $ 195 \n \n 62 \n \n High-Impact Seller Services Growth \n \n Our business model is based on shared success: we make money when Etsy sellers make money. Because of this, we provide services to an Etsy seller to help her start and grow her shop. As of December 31, 2014, 18.2% of active sellers used Promoted Listings, 36.1% of active sellers used Direct Checkout and 21.4% of active sellers in the United States and Canada used Shipping Labels. Our effectiveness in increasing the uptake of our Seller Services, enhancing existing Seller Services and extending their geographic reach and introducing new Seller Services will directly impact the success of Etsy sellers, our revenue growth and our operating results. \n \n International Growth \n \n Our growth will depend in part on international Etsy sellers and international Etsy buyers constituting an increasing portion of our community. International GMS was 28.4% of GMS in 2013 compared to 30.9% in 2014. Currently, Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers are based in nearly every country in the world, and our marketplace is available in 10 languages. Although we promote cross-border transactions, our strategy is to build and deepen local Etsy communities around the world, each with its own ecosystem of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. To meet this goal, we plan to invest in local marketing and content and local payment and shipping solutions. An inability to develop these Etsy communities or to otherwise grow our business outside the United States on a cost-effective basis could adversely affect our GMS, revenue and other operating results. \n \n Mobile Growth \n \n We believe continued enhancement of the mobile features of our platform will be critical to attracting and retaining Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers and maintaining the vibrancy of our marketplace. The success of this effort will be increasingly important as shopping on mobile devices displaces shopping on desktops and as Etsy sellers increasingly seek to run their shops via mobile devices. \n \n We launched our first mobile app in 2011 and since then have expanded our mobile offerings for both Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. Our \u0093Sell on Etsy\u0094 mobile app, which we launched in April 2014, is designed to help an Etsy seller operate her shop, manage orders and access resources. Our Etsy buyer apps and mobile web experience include features designed to keep Etsy buyers engaged and offer an improved shopping experience. As of December 31, 2014, our mobile apps have been downloaded 21.8 million times, and mobile visits represented 53.2% of visits in 2014. In addition, in the same period, mobile GMS was 36.1% of GMS. If we are unable to continue to engage Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers through our mobile offerings, then our GMS and revenue growth and other operating results could be adversely affected. \n \n Investment in Marketing \n \n To date, we have grown largely due to strong brand awareness and word-of-mouth referrals, with the majority of our visits coming from direct and organic channels. In 2013, we spent $17.9 million on marketing expenses, or 14.3% of revenue, compared with 14.6% of revenue in 2012. However, in 2014, we began \n \n 63 \n \n increasing our brand and digital marketing efforts. In 2014, we spent $39.7 million on marketing expenses, or 20.3% of revenue, up 122.2% over 2013. Our growth will depend in part on our continued ability to launch marketing campaigns that resonate with new and existing members and appropriately balance our level of marketing spending with the benefits that may be realized through member and revenue growth. \n \n Investment in Growth \n \n We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in our platform to attract members and enhance the member experience. In 2013, we spent $27.5 million on product development expenses, or 22.0% of revenue, up 47.7% over 2012, and in 2014, we spent $36.6 million on product development expenses, or 18.7% of revenue, up 33.0% over 2013. We have invested significant resources in our technology platform and infrastructure to date and plan to continue to invest in innovation to address the needs of our members. We also plan to hire additional personnel to address the needs of our community. As part of this growth in headcount, we signed a lease in May 2014 for a new headquarters facility to accommodate our anticipated growth in personnel. The investments we make in our platform are all designed to grow our ecosystem and revenue and to improve our operating results in the long term, but these investments could also delay our ability to achieve profitability or reduce our profitability in the near term. \n \n Components of Our Results of Operations \n \n Revenue \n \n Our revenue consists of Marketplace revenue, Seller Services revenue and Other revenue. \n \n Marketplace revenue. Marketplace revenue consists of the 3.5% fee that an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction on our platform, exclusive of shipping fees charged. Marketplace revenue also consists of a listing fee of $0.20 per item that she lists (for up to four months) in our marketplace. Although revenue from completed Wholesale transactions is included in Marketplace revenue, revenue from Wholesale enrollment is included in Seller Services revenue. \n \n Seller Services revenue. Seller Services revenue consists of fees an Etsy seller pays us for the Seller Services she uses, including Promoted Listings, Direct Checkout, Shipping Labels and Wholesale. \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Promoted Listings consists of cost-per-click based fees an Etsy seller pays us for prominent placement of her listings in search results generated by Etsy buyers in our marketplace. \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Direct Checkout consists of fees an Etsy seller pays us to process credit, debit and Etsy Gift Card payments. Direct Checkout fees vary between 3\u00964% of the item\u0092s total sale price plus a flat fee per order, depending on the country in which her bank account is located. Direct Checkout fees are taken from the item\u0092s total sale price, including shipping. \n \n 64 \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Shipping Labels consists of fees an Etsy seller pays us when she purchases shipping labels through our platform, net of the cost we incur in purchasing those shipping labels. We are able to provide our sellers shipping labels from the United States Postal Service and Canada Post at discounted pricing due to the volume of purchases through our platform. \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Wholesale consists of fees an Etsy seller pays us when she is approved to enroll in our Wholesale program. \n \n Other revenue. Other revenue includes the fees we receive from a third-party payment processor. \n \n Our revenue recognition policies are discussed under \u0093\u0097Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates.\u0094 \n \n Cost of Revenue \n \n Cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the operation and maintenance of our platform and data centers, including depreciation and amortization, employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes the cost of interchange and other fees for credit card processing services, credit card verification service fees and credit card chargebacks to support Direct Checkout revenue, as well as employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for our member support staff, and costs of refunds made to Etsy buyers that we are not able to collect from Etsy sellers. Our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue may change over time as our revenue mix changes; for example, to the extent that Direct Checkout revenue increases as a percentage of revenue, there may be a dampening effect on our gross margin. \n \n Operating Expenses \n \n Operating expenses consist of marketing, product development and general and administrative expenses. Direct and indirect employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, are the most significant component of the product development and general and administrative expense categories, and we expect these costs to increase as we continue to hire new employees in order to support our anticipated growth. We include stock-based compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options in the applicable operating expense category based on the respective equity award recipient\u0092s function. \n \n Marketing. Marketing expenses consist primarily of targeted online marketing costs, such as search engine marketing and, to a much lesser extent, offline marketing expenses, such as television advertising. Marketing expenses also include employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for our employees involved in marketing, public relations and communications activities. Marketing expenses are primarily driven by investments to grow and retain members on our platform. \n \n Product development. Product development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for our employees involved in product development activities. Additional expenses include consulting costs related to the development, quality assurance and testing of new technology and enhancement of our existing technology. \n \n 65 \n \n General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the use of facilities and equipment, including depreciation and amortization, rent, and certain professional services expenses. General and administrative expenses also include employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for our employees involved in general corporate functions and currency gains or losses. General and administrative expenses are primarily driven by increases in headcount required to support business growth, and, to a lesser extent in the near term, will be driven by expenses incurred to make the transition to being a public company. \n \n Other Expense, net \n \n Other expense, net consists of interest expense, interest income, foreign exchange loss and net unrealized loss on warrant and other liabilities. \n \n 66 \n \n Results of Operations \n \n The following tables show our results of operations for the periods presented and express the relationship of certain line items as a percentage of revenue for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results. \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 2013 2014 (in thousands) Revenue: Marketplace $ 55,330 $ 78,544 $ 108,732 Seller Services 15,863 42,817 82,502 Other 3,409 3,661 4,357 Total revenue 74,602 125,022 195,591 Cost of revenue 24,493 47,779 73,633 Gross profit 50,109 77,243 121,958 Operating expenses: Marketing 10,902 17,850 39,655 Product development 18,653 27,548 36,634 General and administrative 21,909 31,112 51,920 Total operating expenses 51,464 76,510 128,209 (Loss) income from operations (1,355) 733 (6,251) Other expense, net (1,175) (675) (4,009) (Loss) income before income taxes (2,530) 58 (10,260) Benefit (provision) for income taxes 145 (854) (4,983) Net loss $ (2,385) $ (796) $ (15,243) Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 2013 2014 Revenue: Marketplace 74.2% 62.8% 55.6% Seller Services 21.3 34.2 42.2 Other 4.6 2.9 2.2 Total revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of revenue 32.8 38.2 37.6 Gross profit 67.2 61.8 62.4 Operating expenses: Marketing 14.6 14.3 20.3 Product development 25.0 22.0 18.7 General and administrative 29.4 24.9 26.5 Total operating expenses 69.0 61.2 65.5 (Loss) income from operations (1.8) 0.6 (3.2) Other expense, net (1.6) (0.5) (2.0) (Loss) income before income taxes (3.4) 0.0 (5.2) Benefit (provision) for income taxes 0.2 (0.7) (2.5) Net loss (3.2) (0.6) (7.8) \n \n 67 \n \n Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2014 \n \n Revenue \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2013 2014 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) Revenue: Marketplace $ 78,544 $ 108,732 $ 30,188 38.4 % Percentage of total revenue 62.8 % 55.6 % Seller Services $ 42,817 $ 82,502 $ 39,685 92.7 % Percentage of total revenue 34.2 % 42.2 % Other $ 3,661 $ 4,357 $ 696 19.0 % Percentage of total revenue 2.9 % 2.2 % Total revenue $ 125,022 $ 195,591 $ 70,569 56.4 % \n \n Revenue increased $70.6 million, or 56.4%, to $195.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013, of which 55.6% consisted of Marketplace revenue and 42.2% consisted of Seller Services revenue. \n \n Marketplace revenue increased $30.2 million, or 38.4%, to $108.7 million in 2014 compared to 2013. This growth corresponded with a 43.3% increase in GMS to a total of $1.93 billion for 2014. As our GMS increased, our Marketplace revenue increased, primarily as a result of an increase in the amount of transaction fees received and an increase in listings from new and existing Etsy sellers with a corresponding increase in listing fees received. During 2014, international GMS increased as a percentage of total GMS to 30.9%, up from 28.4% for 2013. During 2014, mobile GMS increased as a percentage of total GMS to 36.1%, up from 29.5% for 2013. Active sellers increased 26.0% to 1.4 million and active buyers increased 41.2% to 19.8 million for 2014 compared to 2013. \n \n Seller Services revenue increased $39.7 million, or 92.7%, to $82.5 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The growth in Seller Services revenue was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from Direct Checkout services, as well as increases in Promoted Listings and Shipping Labels. The increase in Direct Checkout services revenue reflects continued increases in U.S. Direct Checkout revenue, as well as growth in international Direct Checkout services as those services were initiated in the second quarter of 2013. As of December 31, 2014, we offered Direct Checkout in 10 currencies, including the U.S. dollar. The increase in Promoted Listings revenue reflects enhancements made to the service in 2014. The increase in Shipping Label revenue reflects an increase in the number of Etsy sellers using the service and, to a lesser extent, the introduction of Shipping Labels in Canada in 2014. \n \n Other revenue increased $0.7 million, or 19.0%, to $4.4 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Other revenue decreased as a percentage of total revenue, however, as Etsy buyers opted to use Direct Checkout for their purchases rather than a third-party payment processor. \n \n 68 \n \n Cost of Revenue \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2013 2014 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) Cost of revenue $ 47,779 $ 73,633 $ 25,854 54.1 % Percentage of total revenue 38.2 % 37.6 % \n \n Cost of revenue increased $25.9 million, or 54.1%, to $73.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily as a result of an increase in the cost of supporting Direct Checkout revenue due to the introduction of international Direct Checkout as well as growth in the U.S. Direct Checkout revenue. To a lesser extent, the increase was due to an increase in depreciation and amortization for ongoing maintenance of our technology infrastructure and an increase in employee-related costs resulting from increased headcount in our member support and technical operations teams. \n \n Operating Expenses \n \n Marketing \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2013 2014 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) Marketing $ 17,850 $ 39,655 $ 21,805 122.2 % Percentage of total revenue 14.3 % 20.3 % \n \n Marketing expenses increased $21.8 million, or 122.2%, to $39.7 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily as a result of an increase in search engine marketing from Google product listing ads and, to a lesser extent, from an increase in employee-related costs resulting from increased headcount in our marketing team, which includes our public relations and communications teams. \n \n Product development \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2013 2014 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) Product development $ 27,548 $ 36,634 $ 9,086 33.0 % Percentage of total revenue 22.0 % 18.7 % \n \n Product development expenses increased $9.1 million, or 33.0%, to $36.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily as a result of an increase in employee-related costs resulting from increased headcount in our product and engineering teams. \n \n 69 \n \n General and administrative \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2013 2014 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) General and administrative $ 31,112 $ 51,920 $ 20,808 66.9 % Percentage of total revenue 24.9 % 26.5 % \n \n General and administrative expenses increased $20.8 million, or 66.9%, to $51.9 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily as a result of an increase in employee-related costs from headcount growth in general corporate functions and from building out the executive management team and, to a lesser extent, due to increased legal and accounting fees. \n \n Other Expense, net \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2013 2014 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) Other expense, net $ (675) $ (4,009) $ (3,334) 493.9 % Percentage of total revenue (0.5)% (2.0)% \n \n Other expense, net increased $3.3 million, or 493.9%, to $4.0 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily as a result of the foreign exchange loss. \n \n Provision for Income Taxes \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2013 2014 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ (854 ) $ (4,983) $ (4,129) NM Percentage of total revenue (0.7 )% (2.5)% \n \n Our effective tax rate fluctuates from period to period due to changes in the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, the amount of stock-based compensation expense and net unrealized loss on warrants, the impact of acquisitions, the change resulting from the amount of recorded valuation allowance, the permanent difference between GAAP and local tax laws and certain one-time items such as tax rate changes. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we determined that the existence of a three-year cumulative loss in a foreign jurisdiction was sufficient negative evidence to warrant the establishment of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in that jurisdiction. As a result, we recorded a valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets of $0 as of December 31, 2013 and $2.1 million as of December 31, 2014. \n \n 70 \n \n Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 \n \n Revenue \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2012 2013 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) Revenue: Marketplace $ 55,330 $ 78,544 $ 23,214 42.0 % Percentage of total revenue 74.2 % 62.8 % Seller Services $ 15,863 $ 42,817 $ 26,954 169.9 % Percentage of total revenue 21.3 % 34.2 % Other $ 3,409 $ 3,661 $ 252 7.4 % Percentage of total revenue 4.6 % 2.9 % Total revenue $ 74,602 $ 125,022 $ 50,420 67.6 % \n \n Revenue increased $50.4 million, or 67.6%, to $125.0 million in 2013 compared to 2012, of which 62.8% consisted of Marketplace revenue and 34.2% consisted of Seller Services revenue. \n \n Marketplace revenue increased $23.2 million, or 42.0%, to $78.5 million in 2013 compared to 2012. This growth corresponded with a 50.6% increase in GMS to a total of $1.35 billion for 2013. As our GMS increased, our Marketplace revenue increased, primarily as a result of an increase in the amount of transaction fees received and an increase in listings from new and existing Etsy sellers with a corresponding increase in listing fees received. During 2013, international GMS as a percentage of total GMS was 28.4%, and mobile GMS as a percentage of total GMS was 29.5%. Active sellers increased 29.4% to 1.1 million and active buyers increased 50.6% to 14.0 million for 2013 compared to 2012. \n \n Seller Services revenue increased $27.0 million, or 169.9%, to $42.8 million in 2013 compared to 2012. The growth in Seller Services revenue was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from Direct Checkout services, as well as increases in Promoted Listings and Shipping Labels. The increase in Direct Checkout services revenue reflects a full year of U.S. Direct Checkout revenue, as the service was first introduced in the United States in the second quarter of 2012, as well as the introduction of international Direct Checkout services starting in the second half of 2013. As of the end of 2013, we offered Direct Checkout in 10 currencies, including the U.S. dollar. The increase in Promoted Listings revenue and the increase in Shipping Label revenue reflect an increase in the number of Etsy sellers using these services. \n \n Other revenue increased $0.3 million, or 7.4%, to $3.7 million in 2013 compared to 2012. Other revenue decreased as a percentage of revenue, however, as Etsy buyers opted to use Direct Checkout for their purchases rather than a third-party payment processor. \n \n 71 \n \n Cost of Revenue \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2012 2013 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) Cost of revenue $ 24,493 $ 47,779 $ 23,286 95.1 % Percentage of total revenue 32.8 % 38.2 % \n \n Cost of revenue increased $23.3 million, or 95.1%, to $47.8 million in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily as a result of an increase in the cost of supporting Direct Checkout revenue due to the introduction of international Direct Checkout as well as growth in the U.S. Direct Checkout revenue.

\n \n Etsy sellers experience increased sales and use more Seller Services during the fourth-quarter holiday shopping season. This has resulted in increased revenue for us during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, which can compare to lower revenue in the first quarter of the following fiscal year. For example, revenue in the first quarter of 2014 decreased slightly when compared with revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013. We expect this seasonality to continue in future years. Our operating (loss) income has also been affected by these historical trends because many of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term. As our growth rates begin to moderate, the impact of these seasonality trends on our results of operations may become more pronounced. \n \n Our quarterly revenue increased sequentially quarter-to-quarter for all periods presented above, other than the first quarter of 2014, corresponding to our GMS performance in the same periods. We cannot assure you that this pattern of sequential revenue growth will continue. We believe that it is generally more meaningful to compare year-over-year results than sequential quarter-over-quarter results. \n \n Our quarterly cost of revenue increased sequentially quarter-to-quarter for substantially all periods presented above, primarily due to increases in visits and to increased usage of Direct Checkout during the period and, to a lesser extent, to an increase in employee-related costs resulting from increased headcount in our member support and technical operations teams. \n \n Marketing expenses increased sequentially quarter-to-quarter for substantially all periods presented above, and significantly increased beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to increased marketing \n \n 76 \n \n programs to attract and retain new Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers on our platform and, to a lesser extent, to an increase in employee-related costs resulting from increased headcount in our marketing team, which includes our public relations and communications teams. \n \n Product development expenses generally remained consistent or increased sequentially quarter-to-quarter for the periods presented above, primarily as a result of an increase in employee-related costs resulting from increased headcount in our product and engineering teams. \n \n General and administrative expenses increased sequentially quarter-to-quarter for substantially all periods presented above, primarily as a result of an increase in employee-related costs from headcount growth in general corporate functions and from building out the executive management team. \n \n Our business is directly affected by the behavior of consumers. Economic conditions and competitive pressures can significantly impact, both positively and negatively, the level of demand by Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers on our platform. Consequently, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance. \n \n Liquidity and Capital Resources \n \n The following tables show our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and working capital as of the dates indicated: \n \n As of \n \n December 31, 2013 2014 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 36,795 $ 69,659 Short-term investments 18,075 19,184 Accounts receivable, net 11,102 15,404 Working capital 57,566 88,540 \n \n As of December 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents, a majority of which were held in cash deposits and money market funds, were held for working capital purposes. We intend to increase our capital expenditures to support the growth in our business and operations, and intend to invest approximately $50.0 million through the middle of 2016 to build out our new Brooklyn, New York headquarters. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, our liquidity assumptions may prove to be incorrect, and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. We may seek to borrow funds under our Credit Agreement or raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those described in the section of this prospectus captioned \u0093Risk Factors.\u0094 We may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our operating requirements on acceptable terms, or at all. \n \n 77 \n \n Sources of Liquidity \n \n Since our inception, we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flows generated by operations and through non-registered sales of preferred stock and common stock. Since inception and as of December 31, 2014, we have raised a total of $125.6 million from the sale of preferred stock and common stock (including proceeds from the exercise of stock options), net of costs and expenses associated with such financings and net of repurchases of $0.5 million of capital stock. \n \n Credit Facility \n \n In May 2014, we entered into a $35.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to a Revolving Credit and Guaranty Agreement with several lenders, or the Credit Agreement. In March 2015, we amended the Credit Agreement to increase the credit facility to $50.0 million. As amended, the Credit Agreement will mature in May 2019. The amended Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sublimit of $10.0 million and a swingline loan sublimit of $15.0 million. \n \n Borrowings under the amended Credit Agreement (other than swingline loans) bear interest, at our option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) an adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, in each case plus a margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.25% or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.25%. Swingline loans under the amended Credit Agreement bear interest at the same base rate (plus the margin applicable to borrowings bearing interest at the base rate). These margins are determined based on the total leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarters. We are also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including an unused commitment fee and fees associated with letters of credit. As amended, the Credit Agreement also permits us, in certain circumstances, to request an increase in the facility by an additional amount of up to $50.0 million (and in minimum amounts of $10.0 million) at the same maturity, pricing and other terms. \n \n The amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties applicable to us and our subsidiaries and customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us and our restricted subsidiaries. The negative covenants include restrictions on, among other things, indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, transactions with affiliates and dividends and other distributions. These restrictions do not prohibit any of our subsidiaries from making pro rata payments to us or any other person that owns an equity interest in any such subsidiary. The amended Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us and our subsidiaries to maintain a total leverage ratio (defined as net debt to adjusted EBITDA) not to exceed 3.50 to 1.00. \n \n As amended, the Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including a change in control and a cross-default on our material indebtedness. Our obligations under the amended Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiaries\u0092 assets, and our obligations under the amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. \n \n As of March 4, 2015, no amounts have been drawn under the credit facility. In January 2015, we implemented a revised corporate structure to more closely align our structure with our global operations \n \n 78 \n \n and future expansion plans outside the United States. The amendment to the Credit Agreement includes a waiver with respect to our compliance with certain restrictions in the Credit Agreement, to the extent that actions taken to implement our revised corporate structure could be construed as breaches or defaults under the Credit Agreement. \n \n Historical Cash Flows \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 2013 2014 (in thousands) Cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 9,684 $ 16,542 $ 12,087 Investing activities (28,877 ) (15,025 ) (20,723 ) Financing activities 42,972 (103 ) 45,237 \n \n Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities \n \n Our cash flows from operations are largely dependent on the amount of revenue generated on our platform. Net cash provided by operating activities in each period presented has been influenced by changes in accounts receivable, funds receivable and customer accounts, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and funds payable and amounts due to customers. \n \n Net cash provided by operating activities was $12.1 million in 2014, as a result of net loss of $15.2 million, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense and other non-cash charges of $27.1 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities that provided $0.3 million in cash. \n \n Net cash provided by operating activities was $16.5 million in 2013, as a result of net loss of $0.8 million, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense and other non-cash charges of $19.6 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities that used $2.2 million in cash. \n \n Net cash provided by operating activities was $9.7 million in 2012 as a result of net loss of $2.4 million, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense and other non-cash charges of $13.5 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities that used $1.4 million in cash. \n \n Net Cash Used in Investing Activities \n \n Our primary investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures, including investments in website development and internal-use software and purchases of property and equipment to support our overall business growth. Investments in website development and internal-use software and purchases of property and equipment may vary from period to period due to timing of the expansion of our operations. Additionally, we have invested some of our excess cash balances in U.S. Government and agency bills. \n \n Net cash used in investing activities was $20.7 million in 2014. This was primarily attributable to $5.3 million in restricted cash associated with the lease of our new Brooklyn, New York headquarters, $4.7 million in cash paid to acquire businesses, capital expenditures, including $8.3 million for website development and internal-use software and $1.3 million for purchases of property and equipment, and net purchases of marketable securities of $1.1 million. \n \n 79 \n \n Net cash used in investing activities was $15.0 million in 2013. This was primarily attributable to capital expenditures, including $9.3 million for website development and internal-use software and $7.8 million for purchases of property and equipment, offset by sales of marketable securities of $2.8 million. \n \n Net cash used in investing activities was $28.9 million in 2012. This was primarily attributable to purchases of U.S. Government and agency bills of $16.1 million as well as capital expenditures, including $7.4 million for website development and internal-use software and $6.5 million for purchases of property and equipment, offset by sales of marketable securities of $1.4 million. \n \n Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities \n \n Net cash provided by financing activities was $45.2 million in 2014. This was primarily attributable to net proceeds from a common stock financing of $35.0 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $8.0 million and the excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of $4.9 million, offset by payments related to our public offering of $1.0 million and payments on capitalized lease obligations of $1.5 million. \n \n Net cash used in financing activities was $0.1 million in 2013. This was primarily attributable to payments on capitalized lease obligations of $1.3 million, offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $1.3 million. \n \n Net cash provided by financing activities was $43.0 million in 2012. This was primarily attributable to net proceeds from a preferred stock financing of $39.8 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $4.6 million, offset by payments on capitalized lease obligations of $1.4 million. \n \n Off Balance Sheet Arrangements \n \n We did not have any off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, in 2012, 2013 or 2014. \n \n Contractual Obligations \n \n The following table summarizes our future fixed contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 (in thousands): \n \n Total Less than 1 \n \n Year 1\u00963 \n \n Years 3\u00965 \n \n Years More than \n \n 5 Years Capital lease obligations $ 4,903 $ 1,755 $ 3,148 $ \u0097 $ \u0097 Operating lease obligations 21,044 3,870 2,699 3,523 10,952 Long-term debt 547 \u0097 267 280 \u0097 Interest payments 892 535 357 \u0097 \u0097 Facility financing obligations 90,314 \u0097 9,684 18,858 61,772 Purchase obligations 9,824 5,154 3,734 936 \u0097 Total contractual obligations $ 127,524 $ 11,314 $ 19,889 $ 23,597 $ 72,724 \n \n 80 \n \n Capital lease obligations consist of obligations under capital leases for computer equipment. \n \n Operating lease obligations consist of obligations under non-cancelable operating leases for our existing and new headquarters (both in Brooklyn, New York) and for our offices in San Francisco, California and Dublin, Ireland. \n \n Long-term debt consists of obligations we assumed in connection with our acquisition of Incubart SAS. \n \n Interest payments consist of interest due in connection with our capital leases. \n \n Facility financing obligations consist of the portion of our obligations for our new headquarters in Brooklyn, New York that is accounted for as a build-to-suit lease. \n \n Purchase obligations consist of commitments for our co-location and other support services. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate what the total obligation may be beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing. \n \n In addition, we have uncertain tax positions of $0.4 million, which are not reflected in the table as the ultimate resolution and timing are uncertain. \n \n Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates \n \n Our management\u0092s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. \n \n We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, income taxes, internal-use software and website development costs, business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets, leases and stock-based compensation have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. \n \n Revenue Recognition \n \n We operate a platform for third-party sellers. Our business model is based on shared success: we make money when Etsy sellers make money, and we offer services to help Etsy sellers be more successful. We do not compete with Etsy sellers, hold inventory or sell goods. Our revenue is diversified, generated from a mix \n \n 81 \n \n of marketplace activities and the services we provide Etsy sellers to help them create and grow their businesses. Our revenue consists of Marketplace revenue, Seller Services revenue and Other revenue. Our revenue is recorded net of actual and expected refunds. Marketplace revenue includes the fee an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction and the listing fee an Etsy seller pays for each item she lists. Seller Services revenue includes fees an Etsy seller pays for services such as prominent placement in search results via Promoted Listings, payment processing via Direct Checkout and purchases of shipping labels through our platform via Shipping Labels. We deduct our cost of shipping labels and estimated refunds from gross shipping fees to determine net shipping fees. Other revenue includes the fees we receive from a third-party payment processor. \n \n We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the Etsy seller; (3) the collection of fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the Etsy seller is fixed or determinable. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon our evaluation of whether we: are the primary obligor in a transaction, have inventory risk and have latitude in establishing pricing and selecting suppliers. Based on our evaluation of these factors, revenue is recorded net of merchandise values associated with the transaction. \n \n Marketplace revenue. Marketplace revenue consists of the 3.5% fee that an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction on our platform, exclusive of shipping fees charged. Marketplace revenue also consists of a listing fee of $0.20 per item that she lists in our marketplace. Although revenue from completed Wholesale transactions is included in Marketplace revenue, revenue from Wholesale enrollment is included in Seller Services revenue. Transaction fees are recognized when the corresponding transaction is made. Listing fees are recognized ratably over a four-month listing period, unless the item is sold or the seller relists it, at which time any remaining listing fee is recognized. \n \n Seller Services revenue. Seller Services revenue consists of fees an Etsy seller pays us for the Seller Services she uses, including Promoted Listings, Direct Checkout, Shipping Labels and Wholesale. \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Promoted Listings consists of cost-per-click based fees an Etsy seller pays us for prominent placement of her listings in search results generated by Etsy buyers in our marketplace. Revenue is recognized when the Promoted Listing is clicked. \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Direct Checkout consists of fees an Etsy seller pays us to process credit, debit and Etsy Gift Card payments. Direct Checkout fees vary between 3\u00964% of the item\u0092s total sale price plus a flat fee per order, depending on the country in which her bank account is located. Direct Checkout fees are taken from the item\u0092s total sale price, including shipping. Revenue from Direct Checkout is recognized when the corresponding transaction is made. Revenue from breakage on Etsy Gift Cards is recognized when the amount is probable and estimable. Given the lack of historical experience related to gift card activity, there has been no breakage revenue recorded to date. \n \n 82 \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Shipping Labels consists of fees an Etsy seller pays us when she purchases shipping labels through our platform, net of the cost we incur in purchasing those shipping labels. We are able to provide our sellers shipping labels from the United States Postal Service and Canada Post at a discounted price due to the volume of purchases through our platform. We recognize Shipping Label revenue when an Etsy seller purchases a shipping label. We recognize Shipping Label revenue on a net basis as we are not the primary obligor in the delivery of these services. \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Wholesale consists of fees an Etsy seller pays us when she is approved to enroll in our Wholesale program. The one-time Wholesale enrollment fee is recognized ratably over the estimated customer life. Revenue from completed Wholesale transactions is included in Marketplace revenue. \n \n Other revenue. Other revenue includes the fees we receive from a third-party payment processor. Other revenue is recognized as the transactions are processed by the third-party payment processor. \n \n Income Taxes \n \n We account for income tax benefit (provision) based on (loss) income before income taxes, and we use the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We assess the need for a valuation allowance on an annual basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we expect to be realized. \n \n We account for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement. We have no unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2012 and 2013 and have an unrecognized tax benefit of $0.4 million as of December 31, 2014. \n \n We recognize interest and penalties, if any, associated with tax matters as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interest and penalties with the related tax liability in our consolidated balance sheet. \n \n Website Development and Internal-Use Software \n \n We capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with software developed for our platform and software developed for internal use. In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, we begin to capitalize our costs to develop software when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding and it is probable that the project will be completed and the \n \n 83 \n \n software will be used as intended. We also capitalize costs related to upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality or will extend the useful life of existing functionality. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically three years. \n \n We periodically review these assets to determine whether the projects will be completed, placed in service, removed from service or replaced by other internally-developed or third-party software; if an asset is not expected to provide any future benefit, the asset is retired and any unamortized cost is expensed. \n \n Costs related to the design or maintenance of software developed for our platform and software developed for internal use are expensed as incurred. \n \n Business Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets \n \n We have completed a number of acquisitions of other businesses in the past and may acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future. The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. We allocate the purchase price, which is the sum of the consideration provided and may consist of cash, equity or a combination of the two, in a business combination to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenues and cash flows, discount rates and selection of comparable companies. \n \n When we issue stock-based or cash awards to an acquired company\u0092s stockholders, we evaluate whether the awards are contingent consideration or compensation for post-acquisition services. The evaluation includes, among other things, whether the vesting of the awards is contingent on the continued employment of the acquired company\u0092s stockholder beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are treated as compensation for post-acquisition services and recognized as expense over the requisite service period. \n \n We carry intangible assets at cost, and we amortize them on a straight-line basis, which approximates the pattern of the benefits derived, over their estimated useful lives, typically three to five years. When circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, we review our identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment. \n \n Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, as well as when events indicate that the carrying amount of this asset may exceed its fair value. The assessment is performed at the reporting unit level using the two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment. The first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the book value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the book value, goodwill is not impaired. If the book value exceeds the fair value, the second step of the process is performed to measure the amount of the impairment. The accounting guidance also allows for a simplified approach to testing for impairment, in \n \n 84 \n \n which a company can assess certain qualitative factors (referred to as \u0093step zero\u0094) to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If that is the case, the entity must perform the quantitative analysis. \n \n No impairment of goodwill was recorded at December 31, 2013 or 2014. \n \n Leases \n \n We lease office space and certain computer equipment in multiple locations under non-cancelable lease agreements. The leases are reviewed for classification as operating or capital leases. For operating leases, rent is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease period. For capital leases, we record the leased asset with a corresponding liability. Payments are recorded as reductions to the liability with an appropriate interest charge recorded based on their outstanding remaining liability. \n \n We consider the nature of the renovations and our involvement during the construction period of newly-leased office space to determine if we are considered to be the owner of the construction project during the construction period. If we determine that we are the owner of the construction project, we are required to capitalize the fair value of the building as well as the construction costs incurred on our consolidated balance sheet along with a corresponding financing liability (\u0093build-to-suit accounting\u0094). Upon occupancy for build-to-suit leases, we assess whether the circumstances qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If the lease meets the sale-leaseback criteria, we will remove the asset and related financial obligation from the balance sheet and treat the building lease as an operating lease. If upon completion of construction, the project does not meet the \u0093sale-leaseback\u0094 criteria, the leased property will be treated as a capital lease for financial reporting purposes. \n \n Stock-Based Compensation \n \n Stock options awarded to employees, members of our board of directors and non-employee third parties are measured at fair value at each grant date. We consider what we believe to be comparable publicly-traded companies, discounted free cash flows and an analysis of our enterprise value in estimating the fair value of our common stock. Options generally vest over a four-year period with 25% of the shares underlying the options vesting on the date that is 12 months after the vesting commencement date and thereafter 1/48th of the shares vesting each month, subject to continued service with us through each vesting date. \n \n Stock-based compensation cost is measured on the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award using a Black-Scholes pricing model and recognized as an expense over the employee\u0092s or director\u0092s requisite service period on a straight-line basis. We expect to continue to grant stock options in the future, and, to the extent that we do, our stock-based compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase. \n \n We account for stock-based compensation arrangements with non-employees using a fair value approach. The fair value of these options is measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model reflecting the \n \n 85 \n \n same assumptions as applied to employee options in each of the reported periods, other than the expected life, which is assumed to be the contractual life of the option. The compensation costs of these arrangements are subject to remeasurement over the vesting terms as earned. \n \n We account for stock-based compensation arrangements in restricted shares, subject to a put option that allows the holder of the shares to put the shares back to us for cash, as liability-classified stock awards. These awards are re-measured at each reporting period, with changes in fair value being charged to the statement of operations. Compensation expense is recognized using a graded vesting methodology for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were, in substance, multiple awards. Unless the put option is exercised, the restricted shares will be reclassified from a liability to an equity classified award upon the termination of the put option. \n \n Key Assumptions \n \n Our Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, the expected term of the option and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management\u0092s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. \n \n \u0095 Fair Value of Our Common Stock. Because our stock is not publicly traded, we must estimate the fair value of our common stock, as discussed in \u0093\u0097Common Stock Valuations\u0094 below. \n \n \u0095 Expected Volatility. As we have not been a public company and do not have a trading history for our common stock, the expected stock price volatility for our common stock is estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants. Industry peers, which we have selected, consist of several public companies in the industry similar in size, stage of life cycle and financial leverage. These industry peers are also used in our common stock valuations. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be used in the calculation. \n \n \u0095 Risk-free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group. \n \n \u0095 Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. As we do not have sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term of the stock option awards granted, we base our expected term for awards issued to employees or \n \n 86 \n \n members of our board of directors on the simplified method, which represents the average period from vesting to the expiration of the stock option. For grants to non-employees, the expected term is equal to the contractual term, which is generally ten years. \n \n \u0095 Expected Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends to common stockholders and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero. \n \n In determining the fair value of stock options granted, the following weighted average assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for awards granted in the periods indicated: \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 2013 2014 Assumptions: Expected volatility 42.7% \u0096 43.9% 45.7% \u0096 50.3% 43.0% \u0096 49.0% Risk-free interest rate 0.7% \u0096 1.1% 0.9% \u0096 1.9% 1.7% \u0096 2.1% Expected term (in years) 5.12 \u0096 6.08 5.48 \u0096 6.08 5.46 \u0096 6.08 Dividend rate \u0097% \u0097% \u0097% \n \n Common Stock Valuations \n \n The fair value of our common stock underlying stock options has historically been determined by our board of directors, with assistance from management, based upon information available at the time of grant. Given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or the Practice Aid, our board of directors has exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock at each grant date. These factors included: \n \n \u0095 contemporaneous third-party valuations of our common stock; \n \n \u0095 the prices, rights, preferences and privileges of our preferred stock relative to the common stock; \n \n \u0095 the prices of preferred stock sold by us to third-party investors in arms-length transactions; \n \n \u0095 the prices of common stock sold to third-party investors by us and in secondary transactions or repurchased by us in arms-length transactions; \n \n \u0095 our operating and financial performance; \n \n \u0095 current business conditions and projections; \n \n \u0095 the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock underlying these stock options, such as an initial public offering or sale of our company, given prevailing market conditions; \n \n 87 \n \n \u0095 the lack of marketability of our common stock; \n \n \u0095 the market performance of comparable publicly traded e-commerce and technology companies; and \n \n \u0095 the U.S. and global economic and capital market conditions and outlook. \n \n The per share estimated fair value of our common stock in the table below represents the determination by our board of directors of the fair value of our common stock as of the date of grant, taking into consideration the various objective and subjective factors described above, including the valuations of our common stock. There is inherent uncertainty in these estimates and, if we had made different assumptions than those described below, the fair value of the underlying common stock and amount of our stock-based compensation expense, net loss and net loss per share amounts would have differed. Following the closing of our initial public offering, the fair value per share of our common stock for purposes of determining stock-based compensation will be the closing price of our common stock as reported on the applicable grant date. \n \n The following table summarizes by grant date the number of shares of common stock subject to stock options granted from January 1, 2013 through the date of this prospectus, as well as the associated per share exercise price and the estimated fair value per share of our common stock on the grant date: \n \n Grant Date Number of Shares \n \n Underlying \n \n Options Granted Exercise \n \n Price \n \n per Share Estimated \n \n Fair Value \n \n per Share January 22, 2013 713,810 $ 2.38 $ 2.38 February 4, 2013 1,521,851 $ 2.38 $ 2.38 May 7, 2013 460,384 $ 2.79 $ 2.79 July 17, 2013 236,465 $ 2.79 $ 2.79 September 20, 2013 157,938 $ 3.01 $ 3.01 October 29, 2013 2,263,295 $ 3.01 $ 3.01 December 11, 2013 798,467 $ 3.11 $ 3.11 February 19, 2014 2,203,970 $ 4.13 $ 4.13 March 13, 2014 121,010 $ 4.13 $ 4.13 April 22, 2014 501,064 $ 5.18 $ 5.18 July 16, 2014 1,442,401 $ 5.23 $ 5.23 November 5, 2014 2,132,990 $ 6.19 $ 6.19 November 12, 2014 12,000 $ 6.19 $ 6.19 January 30, 2015 2,037,490 $ 8.50 $ 8.50 \n \n Based on an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, the midpoint of the offering price range on the cover page of this prospectus, the intrinsic value of stock options outstanding at was $ million, of which $ million and $ million related to stock options that were vested and unvested, respectively, at that date. \n \n In valuing our common stock, our board of directors determined the equity value of our business using the income approach. The income approach estimates the fair value of a company based on the present value of such company\u0092s future estimated cash flows and the residual value of such company beyond the forecast period. These future values are discounted to their present values to reflect the risks inherent in such company achieving these estimated cash flows. Significant inputs of the income approach (in addition to \n \n 88 \n \n our estimated future cash flows themselves) include the long-term growth rate assumed in the residual value, discount rate and normalized long-term operating margin. The terminal value was calculated to estimate our value beyond the forecast period by applying valuation metrics to the final year of our forecasted revenue and discounting that value to the present value using the same weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, applied to the forecasted periods. \n \n For valuations through February 10, 2014, the equity value determined was allocated to the common stock using the Option Pricing Method, or OPM. The OPM treats common stock and preferred stock as call options on an equity value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preference of the preferred stock. Therefore, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution to the stockholders exceed the value of the liquidation preference at the time of a liquidity event such as a merger, sale or initial public offering, assuming the enterprise has funds available to make a liquidation preference meaningful and collectible by the stockholders. The common stock is modeled to be a call option with a claim on the enterprise at an exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after the preferred stock is liquidated. The OPM uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to price the call options. The OPM is appropriate to use when the range of possible future outcomes is so difficult to predict that forecasts would be highly speculative. \n \n Beginning with the March 31, 2014 valuation, we changed the methodology for allocating our equity value to our common stock to a probability weighted expected return method, or PWERM. We made this change as greater certainty developed regarding a possible liquidity event. The PWERM methodology relies on a forward-looking analysis to predict the possible future value of a company. Under this method, discrete future outcomes, including initial public offering, non-IPO scenarios and a merger or sale are weighted based on our estimate of the probability of each scenario. We applied a hybrid method of the PWERM where the non-IPO scenario is modeled using an OPM to reflect the full distribution of possible non-IPO outcomes. The hybrid method is useful when certain discrete future outcomes can be predicted, but also accounts for uncertainty regarding the timing or likelihood of specific alternative exit events. \n \n Recent Accounting Pronouncements \n \n Under the JOBS Act, we meet the definition of an emerging growth company. We have irrevocably elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. \n \n In March 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued new accounting guidance clarifying the accounting for the release of cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a company either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2013. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n \n 89 \n \n In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that will replace existing revenue recognition guidance. Among other things, the updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. \n \n In August 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update under which management will be required to assess an entity\u0092s ability to continue as a going concern and provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and for annual and interim periods thereafter. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on our financial statements or disclosures. \n \n Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk \n \n We have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including the effects of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks is described below. \n \n Interest Rate Sensitivity \n \n Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2014 were held primarily in cash deposits and money market funds. The fair value of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments would not be significantly affected by either an increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short-term nature of these instruments. As of December 31, 2014, no amounts were outstanding under our credit facility. Any future borrowings incurred under the credit facility would accrue interest at a floating rate based on a formula tied to certain market rates at the time of incurrence (as described above). A 10% increase or decrease in our current interest rate would not have a significant impact on our interest expense. \n \n Foreign Currency Risk \n \n Most of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, our revenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk. Our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, and may be subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Pound Sterling and Euro. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. A 10% increase or decrease in current exchange rates could result in additional income or expense of $1.8 million. \n \n 90 \n \n Letter from Chad \n \n The Etsy Economy \n \n Since inception, Etsy has challenged conventional ways of thinking about commerce, business, individuals and communities. I intend to keep our unconventional operating philosophy as we become a public company, and I welcome new investors into our community. \n \n When I joined Etsy almost seven years ago, Etsy was an online marketplace for handmade goods, vintage items and craft supplies that connected sellers and buyers. Even in my early days at Etsy, it was clear to me that the vision for Etsy could extend far beyond the founding idea of the company and have even more potential to impact the world for good. \n \n Vision is just the starting point. I believe Etsy can truly change the world when our vision is met with strong culture, a powerful team and disciplined execution. In my time at Etsy, I\u0092ve put my heart and soul into nurturing a culture and building a team and company that match the ambition of our mission. Today our mission is much more expansive than when Etsy began: to reimagine commerce in ways that build a more fulfilling and lasting world. \n \n The reimagination of commerce means transforming every aspect of how goods are made, bought and sold. We believe that Etsy has the long-term potential to transform the world economy into one that is more people-centered and community-focused\u0097one that values and honors designers and makers and one that creates stronger connections among people who make, sell and buy goods. We see an economy that is more sustainable and transparent\u0097and one that is more joyful. We believe in an economy that transcends price and convenience, one that emphasizes relationships over transactions and optimizes for authorship and provenance. We call this the Etsy Economy. \n \n Building the Etsy Economy matters more than ever. For decades now, the conventional and dominant retail model has relentlessly focused on delivering goods at the lowest price, valuing products and profits over community, short-changing the future with the instant gratification of today. I do not believe that this race to the bottom is a sustainable, successful model. Our growing community has made it clear that they desire thoughtful alternatives to mass commerce and impersonal retail and products that better reflect their personal style and values. Person by person, sale by sale, we are building a new model to replace the old. With GMS of $1.93 billion in 2014, I see the Etsy Economy emerging. \n \n 91 \n \n Etsy\u0092s Values \n \n If you want to understand Etsy, you\u0092ll have to understand our values. \n \n \u0095 We are a mindful, transparent and humane business. \n \n \u0095 We plan and build for the long term. \n \n \u0095 We value craftsmanship in all we make. \n \n \u0095 We believe fun should be part of everything we do. \n \n \u0095 We keep it real, always. \n \n Fundamentally, we believe that companies can and should use the power of business to create social good, which is reflected in our status as a Certified B Corporation. Our commitment to using business as a force of good manifests itself in the way we run our business. \n \n People often ask me how I choose between the success of our community and the success of our business. My answer is that I don\u0092t have to choose; we have built a business that does well when our community is successful. Making money matters to Etsy because our financial success creates long-term sustainability for our community. The more we invest in our platform, the more we enable Etsy sellers to pursue their craft and grow their businesses and the easier we make it for Etsy buyers to find unique goods. We call this Etsy\u0092s Empowerment Loop. \n \n Community \n \n At Etsy, we believe that our strength and business success rest in the interdependence among Etsy sellers, Etsy buyers, responsible manufacturers and our employees\u0097in other words, our community. \n \n Etsy sellers represent a diverse mosaic of needs and aspirations. Some sellers are first-time small business owners and benefit greatly from our seller support and education programs. The vast majority of sellers on Etsy are one-person shops, and we continue to embrace and develop new ways to support them. Other sellers have grown and need help scaling with the assistance of responsible manufacturers, creating opportunity for other participants in the Etsy Economy. In all cases, we empower each Etsy seller to succeed on her own terms. \n \n I have heard concerns that by allowing our sellers to partner with responsible manufacturers, we are diluting our handmade ethos. I share our community\u0092s desire to preserve what is special about Etsy. After all, Etsy has always served as an antidote to mass manufacturing. We still do. With our vision of responsible manufacturing, we are promoting a new, people-centered model in which artisans can preserve the spirit of craftsmanship and grow responsibly by collaborating with people at small-batch manufacturers to make their goods. This brings more hands together to build both products and \n \n 92 \n \n more diverse local, living economies. These local, living economies band together into a larger Etsy Economy made up of individuals with diverse roles but all sharing a collective vision of an economy based on community. \n \n When individuals share a collective vision, the power and possibility of community manifest in profound ways. Etsy is, by design, a collection of many small things. As we grow, Etsy becomes a larger collection of individuals and communities, with compounding benefits when they connect with each other. Etsy sellers have self-organized into more than 10,000 groups around the world, known as \u0093Etsy Teams.\u0094 They provide local support to each other and collaborate with Etsy on initiatives, such as teaching entrepreneurship to economically disadvantaged people in their communities, lobbying the government on issues important to Etsy sellers, running local craft fairs and translating Etsy\u0092s site into other languages. \n \n In 2012, Mayor Larry Morrissey reached out to me on Twitter asking how to build an Etsy Economy in his community of Rockford, Illinois. Rockford is a city that has faced challenges familiar to many cities in America and around the world: loss of manufacturing jobs, high unemployment and a struggling economy. We worked with Mayor Morrissey, members of the local Rockford Etsy Team, the public education system, local arts organizations and the public housing authority to launch the Etsy Craft Entrepreneurship Program. This program teaches people with a craft skill that entrepreneurship and economic opportunity are within reach on our platform. We have extended this program to 10 cities around the world and see it as an inspirational model for even deeper community involvement in the coming years. \n \n Our concept of community includes the cities where we live and work, and we run Etsy in a way that supports our own local economy and ecosystem. At our headquarters in Brooklyn, twice a week we serve a meal that we call \u0093Eatsy.\u0094 Our approach is to foster community and productivity through a meal, designed for employees to eat together on picnic-style benches. This meal allows employees to engage with each other, within and across teams, and increases team-building and work relationships throughout the company. Eatsy also serves as an end point for company-wide meetings, so that employees can continue the conversation on important workplace topics. \n \n In 2014, we sourced food from over 40 local businesses with an emphasis on our health and ecological impact. We eat on compostable plates, and employees sign up to deliver our compost by bike to a local farm in Red Hook, Brooklyn, where it is turned back into the soil that produces the food we enjoy together. In this way, Eatsy goes into the very soil we live and work on. Eatsy is a metaphor for how I think about many aspects of our business and our relationship to the world around us: regenerative, mindful, interdependent, community-based and fun. \n \n 93 \n \n Why Etsy Should be a Public Company \n \n I believe the principles and resources of being a public company align well with the model of shared success that is fundamental to Etsy\u0092s way of doing business, namely that we make money when our sellers make money. Investing in the growth of our business and increasing Etsy\u0092s visibility will help elevate Etsy sellers and attract more buyers, which creates more opportunities for everyone. \n \n Accountability / transparency \n \n Etsy has a long history of providing data to the community, everything from key financial metrics, to our gross happiness index, to our carbon footprint data, to our workplace diversity stats. As a public company, we will be able to provide a higher level of transparency and accountability to a broader number of people. \n \n Community participation \n \n Being a private company means that most people don\u0092t have an opportunity to invest in Etsy. When Etsy is a public company, anyone will be able to own a piece of Etsy, including our sellers, our buyers and anyone else who shares Etsy\u0092s values and mission. These shareholders will be valued members of our community. \n \n Long-term sustainability \n \n We want to be a company that spans generations. Eighty-six of the original companies in the S&P 500 index are still publicly traded after 58 years. I view going public as an important step towards providing Etsy with the capital and long-term corporate structure to achieve similar longevity. \n \n Making the world more like Etsy \n \n I believe that Etsy can be a public company that holistically integrates the concerns of people and the planet, the present and the future, profitability and accountability. If we succeed, then other companies might replicate our model. We think the world will be a better place for it. \n \n As a public company, we will continue to concentrate on the long term. Our mission to reimagine commerce is a big goal and it will take time to achieve it; success will be based on strategies that evolve over years and decades, not just quarters. We are more focused on creating long-term results for us and our community than short-term results that lack that promise. \n \n I believe this approach will deliver the most sustainable long-term returns to investors. \n \n 94 \n \n When we\u0092re public, we do not plan to give quarterly or annual earnings guidance. I think providing quantitative earnings guidance is misaligned with Etsy\u0092s mission. For example, the pressure to hit a quarterly financial target could incent us too heavily to seek near-term gains, which could diminish our ability to fulfill our larger mission over the long-term. \n \n We will continue to be transparent with our investors. Instead of providing guidance in the traditional sense, I plan to talk frequently with our investors about our progress, challenges and opportunities. I welcome investors who share our long-term, community-oriented philosophy. \n \n What\u0092s Ahead \n \n I am intensely grateful to all of the people who have given so much of themselves to build Etsy, and I am excited to welcome new like-minded shareholders to our community. \n \n We are entering a new era. I believe that successful businesses will be those that combine vision, execution and discipline with values, heart and conviction. That is how I plan to lead Etsy and work with our community to build a more fulfilling and lasting world through commerce. Etsy will be entering its second decade this year, and we look forward to many more in our new form as a public company. \n \n Onward, \n \n 95 \n \n Business \n \n Our Mission \n \n Our mission is to reimagine commerce in ways that build a more fulfilling and lasting world. \n \n We are building a human, authentic and community-centric global and local marketplace. We are committed to using the power of business to create a better world through our platform, our members, our employees and the communities we serve. \n \n Overview \n \n We operate a marketplace where people around the world connect, both online and offline, to make, sell and buy unique goods. Handmade goods are the foundation of our marketplace. Whether crafted by an Etsy seller herself, with the assistance of her team or with an outside manufacturer in small batches, handmade goods spring from the imagination and creativity of an Etsy seller and embody authorship, responsibility and transparency. We believe we are creating a new economy, which we call the Etsy Economy, where creative entrepreneurs find meaningful work and both global and local markets for their goods, and where thoughtful consumers discover and buy unique goods and build relationships with the people who sell them. \n \n Etsy was founded in June 2005 in Brooklyn, New York as a marketplace for handmade goods and craft supplies. From those beginnings, we have built an innovative, technology-based platform that, as of December 31, 2014, connected 54.0 million members, including 1.4 million active sellers and 19.8 million active buyers, in nearly every country in the world. In 2014, Etsy sellers generated GMS of $1.93 billion, of which 36.1% came from purchases made on mobile devices and 30.9% came from an Etsy seller or an Etsy buyer outside of the United States. \n \n Our Community \n \n Our community is the heart and soul of Etsy. Our community is made up of creative entrepreneurs who sell on our platform, thoughtful consumers looking to buy unique goods in our marketplace, responsible manufacturers who help Etsy sellers grow their businesses and Etsy employees who maintain our platform and nurture our ecosystem. \n \n 96 \n \n Our business model is based on shared success: we make money when Etsy sellers make money. Our revenue is diversified, generated from a mix of marketplace activities and the services we provide Etsy sellers to help them create and grow their businesses. Marketplace revenue includes the fee an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction and the listing fee an Etsy seller pays for each item she lists. Seller Services revenue includes fees an Etsy seller pays for services such as prominent placement in search results via Promoted Listings, payment processing via Direct Checkout and purchases of shipping labels through our platform via Shipping Labels. Other revenue includes the fees we receive from a third-party payment processor. \n \n In 2014, Etsy sellers generated GMS of $1.93 billion, up 43.3% over 2013. In 2014, we generated revenue of $195.6 million, up 56.4% over 2013. In 2014, we generated a net loss of $15.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $23.1 million compared to a net loss of $0.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $16.9 million in 2013. See \u0093Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u0097Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u0094 for more information and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. \n \n Our Values \n \n Our values are integral to everything we do. \n \n We are a mindful, transparent and humane business. We believe that business interests and social and environmental responsibility are interwoven and aligned and that the power of business should be used to strengthen communities and empower people. To demonstrate our commitment, each year we publish a Values & Impact report to monitor and then publicly report our efforts to minimize the harm and maximize the benefit that we have on people and the planet. B Lab, an independent nonprofit organization, has certified us as a B Corporation for our adherence to rigorous social and environmental standards, and Fortune has recognized us as a great place to work in both 2013 and 2014. \n \n We plan and build for the long term. We want to build a company that lasts, and we plan to measure our success in years and decades. Etsy sellers in particular depend on us and on our platform to grow their businesses, so we will strive to make decisions that are best for the long-term health of our ecosystem. \n \n We value craftsmanship in all we make. Craftsmanship is the marriage of skill and passion. We believe every job at our company should demonstrate our commitment to craft. We are an engineering-driven company, and we think of our code as craft: we are makers of the products and services that our members use, and we approach the work we do with the same care and inspiration as do Etsy sellers. \n \n 97 \n \n We believe fun should be part of everything we do. Our mission includes fostering a world in which personal fulfillment is a key element of success. We believe that this way of working is connected and joyful. We strive to do excellent work and bring a sense of humor and playfulness to it. \n \n We keep it real, always. We have the courage and the will to do business in ways that are unconventional and impactful. We strive to stay genuine, maintaining integrity, humility and sincerity in everything we do. When we feel that we are not being true to our values or our mission, we are not afraid to stop and change course. \n \n Our Community \n \n Our community includes Etsy sellers, Etsy buyers, responsible manufacturers and Etsy employees. \n \n Etsy Sellers: Creative Entrepreneurs \n \n Etsy sellers join our community to be part of a vibrant global-local marketplace that allows them to express their creativity and turn their passion into a business while connecting to thoughtful consumers locally and around the world. As of December 31, 2014, there were 1.4 million active sellers on our platform and more than 11% of active sellers as of that date had been selling on Etsy for more than four years. \n \n Etsy Sellers \n \n We support a diverse group of artists, makers, designers and collectors from around the world\u0097from the solo artisan to the full-time jewelry maker with staff; from the antique furniture collector to the textile graphic designer partnering with a small-batch manufacturer. \n \n Etsy sellers range from hobbyists to professional merchants, and have a broad range of personal and professional goals. In November 2014, we conducted a survey of U.S. Etsy sellers who made a sale in the preceding 12 months, to which 4,000 sellers responded. The 2014 Seller Survey reveals a unique population of Internet-enabled creative entrepreneurs who are building businesses on their own terms\u0097prioritizing flexibility, independence and creativity. Some Etsy sellers are looking for extra pocket money, while others depend on their shops to support themselves and their families. According to our 2014 Seller Survey, among U.S. Etsy sellers: \n \n \u0095 86% are women; \n \n 98 \n \n \u0095 95% run their shops from their homes; \n \n \u0095 90% aspire to grow their sales in the future; \n \n \u0095 79% started their Etsy shop as an outlet for creativity; \n \n \u0095 65% started their Etsy shop as a way to supplement income; and \n \n \u0095 76% consider their Etsy shop to be a business. \n \n Etsy Buyers: Thoughtful Consumers \n \n Etsy buyers visit our marketplace to discover a broad selection of unique goods that are hard to find elsewhere, ranging from a $5 ornament to a $50 hand-knit sweater to a $2,000 custom-made coffee table. We believe many Etsy buyers are motivated by more than simply price and convenience; we believe they also value craftsmanship, artistry, uniqueness, authenticity and sustainability. We find that Etsy buyers want to know how items were made, where they were made and who made them. In our marketplace, Etsy buyers can enjoy a personalized shopping experience and direct interactions with Etsy sellers. Etsy buyers can also purchase customized items or other bespoke goods from Etsy sellers. By buying in our marketplace, Etsy buyers are supporting creative entrepreneurs in their local communities and around the world. As of December 31, 2014, there were 19.8 million active buyers on our platform. \n \n Marketplace Activity \n \n Etsy buyers also include retailers we have selected for our Wholesale offering, which we launched in August 2014. From local boutiques to national chains such as Nordstrom, West Elm and Whole Foods, retailers use our platform to connect with new artists and designers and to add unique and distinctive items to their store offerings. As of December 31, 2014, more than 6,500 local boutiques and three U.S. national retail chains had been invited to join our Wholesale offering. \n \n Responsible Manufacturers \n \n We are committed to helping Etsy sellers who want to work with responsible, small-batch manufacturing partners to increase their production. An Etsy seller might work with a cut-and-sew shop to make clothes she has designed, a casting house that casts her wax models for her jewelry designs or a digital printing \n \n 99 \n \n house that prints her photographs on household items. We ask Etsy sellers to work with manufacturers who adhere to our ethical expectations: humane working conditions, non-discrimination policies, sustainability practices and no child, youth or involuntary labor. As of December 31, 2014, we had approved more than 3,000 Etsy shops for over 5,000 manufacturing partnerships. Much of this production is local: as of December 31, 2014, 86% of manufacturers partnering with Etsy sellers were located in the same country as the Etsy seller. \n \n Etsy Employees \n \n We too are members of our community. Whether crafting our policies, talking with Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers in our online forums or building the tools and services underlying our marketplace, our employees create lasting, authentic connections in our community. Etsy employees emphasize building personal relationships with Etsy sellers, visiting their shops, inviting them to our offices for lunch or celebrating with them at in-person events. \n \n Our Opportunity \n \n We operate at the center of several converging macroeconomic trends in online and mobile commerce, employment, consumption and manufacturing. We believe that in combination these trends will benefit millions of people in our ecosystem around the world: Etsy sellers engaging in their creative passion, working for themselves and defining success on their own terms; Etsy buyers accessing a diverse, global marketplace of goods that have historically been found in highly fragmented markets; and, increasingly, responsible manufacturers using modern tools to craft goods in partnership with Etsy sellers. \n \n Trends in Our Favor \n \n Trends in Online and Mobile Commerce \n \n Etsy sellers offer goods in dozens of online retail categories, including jewelry, stationery, clothing, home goods, craft supplies and vintage items. Euromonitor, a consumer market research company, estimated that the global online retail market was $695 billion in 2013, up from $280 billion in 2008, representing a \n \n 100 \n \n compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 19.9%. This growth is expected to continue, with the global online retail market becoming a significantly larger portion of the total retail market, reaching $1.5 trillion by 2018, implying a 16.6% CAGR from 2013. \n \n Mobile commerce is also increasingly important in online retail. comScore estimated that since the first quarter of 2013, consumers visiting online commerce sites spent more than half of their browsing time on mobile devices; however, online commerce spending via mobile devices represented only 11% of total online commerce dollars in the third quarter of 2014. \n \n Trends in Employment \n \n Whether motivated by economic necessity or personal preference, a growing number of people are turning to self-employment for their livelihoods. \n \n In a 2012 survey of middle-class households in the United States by the Pew Research Center, 85% said that it was more difficult to maintain their living standards today than it was ten years ago. The erosion of middle-income jobs is not unique to the United States: we believe middle-class families in many developed countries face similar challenges. Responding to these challenges, many people supplement their incomes and support their families by becoming freelancers, and freelancers are now making significant contributions to their respective economies. A study commissioned in July 2014 by the Freelancers Union and Elance-oDesk, or the Freelancer Study, estimated that 53 million Americans are working as freelancers, or 34% of the U.S. workforce. The same study estimated that this freelance workforce adds $715 billion to the U.S. economy each year. \n \n Brandi Harper, Etsy Shop: purlBknit, Brooklyn, NY \n \n The Freelancer Study also found that millennials (workers under 35) represent a source of growth in the number of Americans working as freelancers. Millennials are more likely to freelance than older workers\u009738% of millennials are freelancing, compared to 32% of workers over 35\u0097and many millennials have spent their entire working lives in this freelance era. Millennial freelancers are also more likely to search out work that has \u0093a positive impact on the world\u0094 (62% of millennials vs. 54% of non-millennials) or is \u0093exciting\u0094 (62% of millennials vs. 47% of non-millennials). \n \n 101 \n \n Many other people are motivated by similar personal priorities to start their own businesses. In 2012, a Harvard Business School study found that \u0093autonomy\u0094 was a top motivation in a faculty survey of 2,000 business founders, amongst all age cohorts and for both men and women. \n \n Women are also contributing to the trend towards self-employment. According to an October 2012 analysis by Booz and Company, by 2020, 865 million women worldwide who have not previously been part of the economic mainstream will join as producers, consumers, employees and entrepreneurs. World Bank research shows that, in certain developing nations, over half of the women in the labor force are self-employed. \n \n In combination, these data underscore the importance of tools that help people start and grow their businesses. We believe that many of these freelancers, millennials and women have creative skills that could provide a foundation for entrepreneurship, but that they often have little or no experience running their own businesses, and they typically lack the marketing resources, the technological expertise and the manufacturing and logistics capabilities to turn their creativity into a business. \n \n Trends in Consumption \n \n Most large retailers today follow the same formula, emphasizing efficiency and scale and pressuring their suppliers to reduce their costs in order to serve mass-produced goods at the lowest-possible prices. We believe, however, that many consumers want to purchase goods that are unique and that reflect their personality and style, not simply mass-produced, generic goods. Some consumers want their purchases to reflect their values; they want to support retailers and suppliers that have responsible and sustainable policies toward their employees, their communities and the environment. Finding these goods can be difficult, as markets for such goods have historically been highly fragmented across boutiques, consignment stores and other venues and marketplaces. \n \n Chris and Katie Francis, Lee Goodwin, Olivia Turrell, Etsy Shop: Docksmith, Brunswick, ME \n \n A 2014 Nielsen study reported that global consumers between the ages of 21 and 34 represent 51% of all consumers who are willing to pay extra for sustainable products. The Nielsen study also indicated that 55% of consumers worldwide are willing to pay extra for products and services from companies committed to social impact, a 10% increase from a similar study in 2011, and that 46% of those consumers identified support for small businesses and entrepreneurship as a key cause. \n \n 102 \n \n Still other thoughtful consumers are looking to support their local communities and prefer buying goods that they can trace to an individual person or community. According to a 2014 Havas Worldwide case study, 53% of consumers say that when possible they prefer to buy directly from an individual producer than from a store or shopping center. These consumers prefer to bypass large manufacturers and retailers when possible in favor of buying locally and independently-produced goods. \n \n Trends in Manufacturing \n \n Just as the power of computing, once reserved for government and large businesses, is now available to individuals on their personal computers and mobile devices, individuals and small businesses now have the ability to manufacture goods in their homes and studios using tools such as computer-assisted design, 3D printers, computer-controlled routers and other machines at a fraction of the historical cost. We believe the decrease in the size and the cost of these tools will make it easier for creative entrepreneurs to start new businesses. We also believe that small-batch manufacturers will be able to use these new technologies to provide high-quality manufacturing services to creative entrepreneurs. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2011, approximately 65% of manufacturing establishments had 19 or fewer employees. Manufacturing plants that produce items such as apparel, leather, ornamental metal, furniture, printing materials, cutlery and jewelry tended to have even smaller workforces, as 80% had 19 or fewer employees. We believe that to scale their own businesses, creative entrepreneurs can access this growing number of small-batch manufacturers. \n \n Allison Faunce, Etsy Shop: Little Hero Capes, Somerset, MA \n \n 103 \n \n Our Strengths \n \n Our platform connects millions of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers globally, making it one of the largest online marketplaces in the world. We have achieved our scale because of the following key strengths: \n \n Our Authentic, Trusted Marketplace. We have built an authentic, trusted marketplace that embodies our values-based culture, emphasizing respect, direct communication and fun. We have developed a reputation for authenticity as a result of Etsy sellers\u0092 unique offerings and their adherence to our policies for handmade goods embodying the principles of authorship, responsibility and transparency. We establish trust in our marketplace by emphasizing the person behind every transaction. We deepen connections among our members through our direct communication tools, seller stories on our website and apps and in-person events, making a personal relationship central to the member experience. The authenticity of our marketplace and the connections among people in our community are the cornerstones of our business. \n \n Our Passionate, Engaged and Loyal Members. Our members are passionate, engaged and loyal\u0097not only to us, but to each other\u0097building a strong community. \n \n \u0095 Our active sellers and active buyers remain so for multiple years. For example, 32.3% of active sellers and 44.7% of active buyers as of December 31, 2011 continued to be active sellers and active buyers, respectively, three years later, as of December 31, 2014. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, 11% of active sellers have been selling on Etsy for more than four years. Likewise, as of December 31, 2014, 11% of active buyers have been members for more than four years. \n \n \u0095 Our members\u0092 repeat sales and purchases drive GMS growth. In 2014, 78.5% of our GMS resulted from repeat purchases made by Etsy buyers, and 99.3% of our GMS was generated by repeat sales made by Etsy sellers. \n \n \u0095 Our active sellers and active buyers also log into Etsy frequently. During the fourth quarter of 2014, 78% of active sellers as of December 31, 2014 and 63% of active buyers as of December 31, 2014 logged in to our marketplace. \n \n \u0095 Our members also spend time with each other. For example, Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers sent 216 million messages on our platform in 2014 using our Conversations tool. As of December 31, 2014, 27.7% of active sellers belong to a self-organized Etsy Team, developing supportive personal relationships with other Etsy sellers as they build their independent creative businesses. Currently, over 10,000 Etsy Teams have formed around the world. \n \n 104 \n \n The passion and loyalty demonstrated by Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers underlies the growth and scale of our platform. See \u0093Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u0097Key Factors Affecting Our Performance\u0097Growth and Retention of Active Sellers and Active Buyers\u0094 for more information. \n \n GMS Contribution by Purchase Type \n \n Our Innovative Technology. Our widely-respected engineering team has built a sophisticated platform that enables millions of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to smoothly transact across borders, languages and devices. Our team is at the forefront of the software engineering practice of continuous deployment. We update our code as often as every 20 minutes, and as many as 70 times per day, with more than 10,000 deploys during the year ended December 31, 2014. To enhance the performance of our platform, we collect and analyze a large volume of data. For example, we currently collect more than 1.8 million discrete metrics, which we expect will increase as we grow. Further, in the field of search relevance and purchase recommendations, we currently collect and analyze more than 1,200 terabytes of data to calculate search and personalization relevance signals in real time to recommend goods to each prospective Etsy buyer from a broad inventory of unique goods. \n \n For the year ended December 31, 2014, 53.2% of our visits and 36.1% of our GMS were generated on a mobile device. We developed our \u0093Sell on Etsy\u0094 mobile app to help the Etsy seller operate her shop and manage orders. Our mobile website and our mobile app for Etsy buyers, which we developed to keep Etsy buyers engaged wherever they are, includes search, discovery, curation, personalization and social shopping features, optimized for the mobile experience. \n \n 105 \n \n Our Scaled, Global-Local Marketplace. Our marketplace is global-local, meaning that we focus on building local Etsy communities around the world. Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers in these local communities, in turn, have global reach and access through our platform. Currently, Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers are based in nearly every country in the world and our marketplace is available in 10 languages. In 2014, 30.9% of our GMS involved an Etsy seller or Etsy buyer outside of the United States. We believe our global-local marketplace creates strong competitive advantages outside the United States because our success is not dependent on scale in any given country; instead, the diverse location of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers creates the scale, and a concentration of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers in any given region can give rise to a vibrant local Etsy marketplace. \n \n Our Seller-Aligned Business Model. Etsy sellers are drawn to our platform because we empower them to succeed, and as Etsy sellers succeed, so do we. Our seller-aligned business model creates network effects. The more we invest in our platform, the more we enable Etsy sellers to pursue their craft and grow their businesses and the easier we make it for Etsy buyers to find unique goods. We call this Etsy\u0092s Empowerment Loop. Some 76% of Etsy sellers consider their Etsy shops to be businesses and 90% want to grow their businesses, as indicated by our 2014 Seller Survey. We focus on offering Seller Services that help an Etsy seller spend more of her time on her creative passion and less of her time on the administrative aspects of running a business. During the year ended December 31, 2014, 46.1% of Etsy sellers used at least one of our Seller Services. Similarly, we have launched our manufacturing and Wholesale offerings in an effort to enable an Etsy seller to grow her business on our platform. \n \n Etsy Empowerment Loop \n \n 106 \n \n Our Strategy: The Path Ahead \n \n Make Etsy an Everyday Experience. The power of human connection is central to the Etsy member experience. We emphasize relationships, connecting creative entrepreneurs to thoughtful consumers around the world, and we continually strive to make those connections a daily habit for our members. \n \n The everyday experience starts with mobile. In 2014, 53.2% of our visits and 36.1% of our GMS were generated on a mobile device: \n \n \u0095 We will continue to help the Etsy seller manage her shop, connect with Etsy buyers and sell her goods on our platform, all on her mobile device. We plan to bring the Etsy experience to local communities, using mobile technology to highlight Etsy sellers\u0092 goods in nearby brick-and-mortar stores and crafts fairs. \n \n \u0095 We will continue to make it easy and fun for Etsy buyers to connect with Etsy sellers and to discover and purchase Etsy sellers\u0092 unique goods, particularly though mobile devices. We plan to improve Etsy buyers\u0092 engagement with our community through enhanced content, search and discovery. \n \n Build Local Marketplaces, Globally. Our vision is global and local. In 2014, 28.9% of Etsy sellers were located outside the United States, and 30.9% of our GMS involved an Etsy seller or Etsy buyer outside of the United States. Although we promote cross-border transactions, our strategy is to build and deepen local Etsy communities around the world, each with its own ecosystem of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. To meet this goal, we plan to invest in local marketing and content and local payment and shipping solutions in countries around the world. We believe our locally-focused work will broaden the reach of our global platform. \n \n Kamma Spring, Etsy Shop: Lorgie, Fremantle, Australia \n \n 107 \n \n Offer High-impact Seller Services. Seller Services, such as Promoted Listings, Direct Checkout and Shipping Labels, help an Etsy seller spend more time on the pleasures of her craft and less time on the administrative aspects of her business. Seller Services represented $42.8 million, or 34.2%, of our revenue in 2013, a 169.9% increase over 2012, and $82.5 million, or 42.2%, of our revenue in 2014, a 92.7% increase over 2013. According to our 2014 Seller Survey, for every hour that an Etsy seller spends making her products, she spends another hour doing business-related tasks, including inventory management, shipping, customer service, marketing and accounting. We intend to enhance existing Seller Services, extend their geographic reach and introduce new ones to increase the amount of time an Etsy seller can devote to her craft. \n \n How an Etsy Seller Spends Her Time \n \n Expand the Etsy Economy. We intend to fulfill our mission to reimagine commerce by expanding the impact of our platform beyond our community. By further developing our manufacturing program, we believe we will help Etsy sellers who want to grow their businesses connect with skilled partners, while helping to revitalize small-batch manufacturing in local communities. We will also continue to focus on our Wholesale offering, which we launched in August 2014, so that Etsy sellers can sell their products to select retail partners such as Nordstrom, West Elm and Whole Foods. Finally, we plan to focus on strategic partnerships, technological advances and public-private endeavors such as our Craft Entrepreneurship program, which we believe will bring the benefit of the Etsy Economy to more people and more communities. \n \n 108 \n \n Invest in Marketing. We believe that the rapid growth of our marketplace is a testament to our compelling value proposition for Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers have been our best marketers, and the majority of our visits have come from direct and organic channels. Historically, we have invested relatively small amounts in marketing. We spent only $10.9 million on marketing in 2012 and only $17.9 million in 2013. In 2014, we began increasing our brand and digital marketing efforts and spent $39.7 million in marketing, up 122% from 2013. \n \n We plan to continue to increase our marketing spending on traditional and online media to increase awareness of our brand and attract additional members to our ecosystem. \n \n Visits to Etsy by Channel \n \n Our investment in marketing has shown early signs of success. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, we strategically increased our marketing spending in the United Kingdom, our second largest market in terms of number of active sellers, with a goal of growing the number of Etsy buyers in the United Kingdom. In the following twelve months, we spent five times more on search engine marketing in the United Kingdom during the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 than we did during the same period in the prior year. During the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, the number of active buyers in the United Kingdom grew 112.9% year-over-year, compared to 89.0% year-over-year in the same period in the prior year. Additionally, Etsy buyers in the United Kingdom spent more in our marketplace, with the amount spent increasing by 114.2% year-over-year versus 64.7% year-over-year in the same period in the prior year. Our success in the United Kingdom demonstrates our ability to accelerate growth with marketing improvements and increased marketing spending. We intend to apply the key lessons from our experience in the United Kingdom into growing other local Etsy markets around the globe. \n \n 109 \n \n Our Platform \n \n Our platform is an authentic vehicle for person-to-person commerce, both globally and locally. Our platform includes our marketplace, our Seller Services, our technology and our community, both online and offline. The core of our platform is our marketplace, which connects people around the world to make, sell and buy unique goods. \n \n Connecting People through Our Platform \n \n The Etsy Seller Experience \n \n Our platform makes it easy for an Etsy seller to open an Etsy shop and operate her business. We help the Etsy seller in the following ways: \n \n \u0095 Seller Services. We offer a variety of services to help Etsy sellers build their personal brands, engage potential customers and complete transactions. These services include: \n \n \u0095 Promoted Listings. Our Promoted Listings offering enables an Etsy seller to pay a cost-per-click based fee to feature and promote her goods in search results generated by Etsy buyers on our platform. This service allows an Etsy seller to target Etsy buyers who are specifically searching for goods similar to those she offers for sale. As of December 31, 2014, 18.2% of active sellers used Promoted Listings in 2014. \n \n \u0095 Direct Checkout. Our Direct Checkout offering allows Etsy sellers to accept various forms of payment such as credit cards, debit cards and Etsy gift cards. As of December 31, 2014, Direct Checkout was available in 22 countries and 10 currencies. Once an Etsy buyer makes payment, the Etsy seller receives the funds in her own bank account and in her local currency. In addition, in October 2014, we expanded Direct Checkout to enable an Etsy seller in the United States to use our \u0093Sell on Etsy Reader\u0094 to accept credit card and debit card payments in person, whether at her store or her booth at a craft fair. As of December 31, 2014, 36.1% of active sellers used Direct Checkout in 2014. \n \n 110 \n \n \u0095 Shipping Labels. Etsy sellers can purchase United States Postal Service and Canada Post shipping labels through our platform with the appropriate amount of postage. The ability to print shipping labels at home reduces the cost and time it takes Etsy sellers to ship goods to Etsy buyers. As of December 31, 2014, 21.4% of active sellers in the United States and Canada purchased shipping labels through our platform in 2014. \n \n Use of Seller Services in 2014 \n \n \u0095 Mobile. We developed our \u0093Sell on Etsy\u0094 mobile app to help Etsy sellers operate their shops and manage orders. Etsy sellers can also access communication and shop management tools and help resources through the Sell on Etsy mobile app. From its launch in April 2014 through December 31, 2014, 21.9% of active sellers used our Sell on Etsy app. \n \n \u0095 Seller Dashboard. Etsy sellers can analyze visits to their shop and listings, estimate the effectiveness of their spending on Promoted Listings, monitor orders and track sales using our online seller dashboard. Etsy sellers can access the dashboard on our website or on our Sell on Etsy mobile app. \n \n \u0095 Education. We provide extensive educational resources to teach Etsy sellers how to build and grow their businesses on our platform through blog posts, video tutorials, the Etsy Seller Handbook (available on our website), access to our online forums, and insights from our support teams. In addition to our own educational resources, Etsy sellers connect through Etsy Teams to build personal relationships, collaborate, and educate and support each other. \n \n The Etsy Buyer Experience \n \n To help Etsy buyers discover and purchase items that they love, we provide a number of tools, including: \n \n \u0095 Communication. We believe human connection is central to Etsy buyers\u0092 engagement. Etsy buyers and Etsy sellers use the Conversations tool on our platform to communicate, person to person, about their orders, to request custom goods or personalization of goods or simply to have a conversation about the product or the process. In 2014, our members sent 216 million messages on our platform. \n \n \u0095 Search and discovery. Our platform is engineered to provide a personalized experience to each Etsy buyer that adjusts in real time based on her interactions with our marketplace. An Etsy buyer may search for an item using our search tool bar and filter the results by color, price, location or other characteristics. She may browse through items, creating an activity feed by \u0093favoriting\u0094 items that catch \n \n 111 \n \n her eye and by following shops and tastemakers. In 2014, our members tagged 775 million favorites on our platform. We glean insights from Etsy buyers\u0092 interactions through our machine-learning algorithms and through traditional information retrieval techniques, such as cookies. We use these insights to personalize the activity feed an Etsy buyer sees when she comes to Etsy, with suggestions of shops or tastemakers to follow and items to buy or favorite. We use the data we collect and the insights we gain to match Etsy sellers\u0092 goods with Etsy buyers\u0092 tastes and interests. Our community is large and engaged, with more than 4.3 billion search page views in 2013. \n \n Discovering Unique Goods \n \n \u0095 Mobile. We strive to keep Etsy buyers engaged wherever they are, by providing the functionality of our website in iOS and Android mobile apps, specifically crafted for Etsy buyers. Our mobile apps for Etsy buyers include search and discovery, curation, personalization and social shopping features similar to those that Etsy buyers enjoy on our desktop site. Our mobile apps have been downloaded 21.8 million times as of December 31, 2014. \n \n Our Policies \n \n Our members rely on us to maintain a marketplace that meets their expectations for authenticity. Our policies are designed to give the Etsy buyer the comfort that she is purchasing unique goods from a small business that adheres to certain principles. \n \n Most fundamentally, we require that goods listed in our marketplace be handmade, vintage or craft supplies. Handmade items begin with the imagination and creativity of the Etsy seller. To conform to our vision of handmade, we ask that the Etsy seller follow these three principles: \n \n \u0095 Authorship: The Etsy seller should have a meaningful design and creative role in the items she is selling. \n \n \u0095 Responsibility: The Etsy seller should know how her goods are made and by whom. \n \n \u0095 Transparency: The Etsy seller should be open and honest about how her goods are made and by whom. \n \n 112 \n \n Etsy buyers enjoy a high degree of insight into Etsy sellers\u0092 business practices. Our policies encourage Etsy sellers to be transparent about themselves, their businesses and the goods they sell. We enforce our policies through the following: \n \n Integrity team. The job of our Integrity team is to remove items that do not belong in our marketplace. We use a combination of machine learning, automated systems and community-generated queries and flags to review items and shops that may be in violation of our policies. \n \n Trust and Safety team. Our Trust and Safety team uses human review and sophisticated automated tools and algorithms to detect fraud. We cancel transactions if fraud is detected, and we strive to prohibit bad actors from using our platform. \n \n Responsible Seller Growth team. Our Responsible Seller Growth team reviews the application of every Etsy seller who applies to work with an outside manufacturer. We do not review or approve the manufacturer; instead, we look to the Etsy seller to provide evidence of authorship, responsibility and transparency. \n \n Our Case System. Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers communicate via our Case System in instances when items do not arrive or are not as expected. Disputes are often resolved without our involvement. When necessary, we intervene, and when appropriate, we may suspend or terminate the accounts of members who do not adhere to our policies. \n \n Our Unique Engineering Culture and Approach \n \n Etsy engineering is widely known for its thought-leading approaches to software development as well as its unique engineering culture. Our engineering team coined the phrase \u0093Code as Craft\u0094 to describe our love for building software and our melding of engineering discipline and individual craftsmanship. We believe our engineers have the skills, practices and experience needed to embrace the change the future inevitably brings. As of December 31, 2014, our engineering team consisted of 241 employees. \n \n Code as Craft \n \n 113 \n \n Our engineering culture is built on three principles: \n \n \u0095 A mindful and humane approach. We trust humans and we build for humans. We believe that judgment, mindfulness and intelligence can be found and developed in the people doing the work, and our environment provides continuous opportunities to develop those traits. An organization of engaged, empowered, mindful engineers can adapt to inevitable and unpredictable change. \n \n \u0095 A spirit of generosity. Our engineers believe that we are part of a larger community of practice and a larger world, and part of each engineer\u0092s job is improving our team, our company, our industry and the world. Every engineer is expected to contribute to open source software projects and to write or speak publicly. We believe this increases job satisfaction and retention, gives us outsized influence in our industry and eases onboarding as prospective employees can learn about our culture before joining us. \n \n \u0095 Adaptability and learning. We learn through honest, blameless reflection on lessons and surprises. We believe that traditional root-cause analysis makes learning from mistakes difficult. Our blameless post-mortem process is a widely-cited technique that we believe is becoming best practice among organizations that value innovation. Blameless post-mortems drive a significant percentage of our development as we analyze what about our production environment was less then optimal and rapidly make corresponding adjustments. \n \n Our Work Culture \n \n We pride ourselves on our values-based culture. We emphasize respect, direct communication and fun. We focus on maximizing our employees\u0092 professional and personal well-being. We evaluate performance not just on traditional business metrics, but also on societal and environmental goals and on adherence to our mission and values. \n \n We believe employee happiness comes from engaging and fulfilling work and from ample personal and professional growth opportunities. We invest heavily in employee development by offering coaching, skills workshops and training. We actively encourage personal education through arts and crafts workshops and employee-taught classes called \u0093Etsy School,\u0094 covering subjects ranging from screen printing to Python programming. \n \n As of December 31, 2014, we had 685 employees worldwide, with 430 in our offices in Brooklyn, New York. Of those employees, we had 153 in member operations, 332 in product and engineering, 89 in marketing and 111 in corporate. Our product development expenses were $18.7 million, $27.5 million and $36.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. \n \n We proactively work and recruit to improve the gender balance at all levels of our company. As of December 31, 2014, 51% of employees identified as female. As of December 31, 2014, women comprised 46% of managers and 28% of product, engineering and technical operations employees. \n \n 114 \n \n Etsy.org \n \n In January 2015, we formed Etsy.org, a Delaware non-profit organization, to focus on building innovative educational programs that reimagine how and to whom business is taught. In particular, Etsy.org will focus on educating women and other under-represented entrepreneurial populations and empowering them to build businesses that regenerate communities and the planet. In January 2015, we issued 376,471 shares of our common stock to Etsy.org, and we expect to use $300,000 of the proceeds of this offering to partially fund Etsy.org. \n \n Competition \n \n We compete with retailers for the Etsy seller. An Etsy seller can list her goods for sale with online retailers or sell her goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues and marketplaces. She may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers, including large national retailers, who discover her goods in our marketplace or otherwise. We also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses, enabling an Etsy seller to sell from her own website or otherwise run her business independently of our platform. We are able to compete for Etsy sellers based on our brand awareness, the breadth of our online presence, the number and engagement of Etsy buyers, our Seller Services, our fees, the strength of our community and our values. \n \n We also compete with retailers for the attention of the Etsy buyer. An Etsy buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer, whether large marketplaces or national retail chains or local consignment and vintage stores or other venues or marketplaces. We are able to compete for Etsy buyers based on the unique goods that Etsy sellers list in our marketplace, awareness of our brand, the person-to-person commerce experience, our reputation for authenticity, our mobile apps, ease of payment and the availability and reliability of our platform. \n \n Intellectual Property \n \n Protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success. We rely on intellectual property laws, primarily including trade secret, copyright and trademark laws in the United States and abroad, and we use confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect our intellectual property. \n \n While we have obtained or applied for patent protection for some of our intellectual property, we generally do not rely on patents as a principal means of protecting intellectual property. We register domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and abroad. We also rely upon common law protection for certain trademarks. \n \n 115 \n \n Circumstances beyond our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we operate. In addition, the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business, our ability to compete and our operating results. \n \n Facilities \n \n Our headquarters are located in Brooklyn, New York where we occupy approximately 104,493 square feet under a lease that expires in 2016. We use these facilities for our principal administration, technology and development and engineering activities. Our European headquarters are located in Dublin, Ireland. \n \n In May 2014, we signed a lease for new corporate headquarters, also located in Brooklyn, which we expect to occupy in 2016. The lease covers two buildings totaling approximately 198,635 square feet and will expire approximately ten years from the later to occur of the two buildings\u0092 lease commencement dates. We expect that our new space will allow us to grow our local staff, will be LEED-certified and will support our efforts to reduce our environmental footprint. \n \n We also maintain offices in Hudson (New York), San Francisco, Berlin, Dublin, London, Paris, Melbourne and Toronto. \n \n We believe that our current facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our ongoing needs and that, if we require additional space, we will be able to obtain additional facilities. \n \n Government Regulation \n \n As with any company operating on the Internet, we grapple with a growing number of local, national and international laws and regulations. These laws are often complex, sometimes contradict other laws, and are frequently still evolving. Laws may be interpreted and enforced in different ways in various locations around the world, posing a significant challenge to our global business. For example, U.S. federal and state laws, EU directives, and other national laws govern the processing of payments, consumer protection and the privacy of consumer information; other laws define and regulate unfair and deceptive trade practices. Still other laws dictate when and how sales or other taxes must be collected. Laws of defamation apply online and vary by country. The growing regulation of e-commerce worldwide could impose additional compliance burdens and costs on us or on Etsy sellers, and could subject us to significant liability for any failure to comply. Additionally, because we operate internationally, we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the United States, including anti-money laundering, anti-corruption and export control laws. \n \n 116 \n \n Legal Matters \n \n From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings and subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although the results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe we are not currently party to any legal proceedings which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. There can be no assurances that we will obtain a favorable outcome. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings can harm us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources and other factors. \n \n 117 \n \n Management \n \n Executive Officers and Directors \n \n Our executive officers and directors, and their ages and positions as of January 31, 2015, are listed below: \n \n Name Age Position(s) Executive Officers: Chad Dickerson 42 President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Kristina Salen 43 Chief Financial Officer Jordan Breslow 59 General Counsel and Secretary Kellan Elliott-McCrea 37 Chief Technology Officer and Chief Architect Non-Employee Directors: James W.

We reimburse directors for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending board of directors and committee meetings. \n \n For services rendered during the year ended December 31, 2014, our non-employee directors received the following compensation: \n \n Name Option \n \n Awards \n \n ($)(1) Total \n \n ($) Fred Wilson \u0097 \u0097 James W.

Under this program, each new, non-employee director who joins our board of directors will be granted equity compensation (in the form of stock options or restricted stock units) upon the effective date of his or her election to our board of directors with a fair value (calculated in accordance with FASB \n \n 125 \n \n ASC Topic 718) at the time of grant equal to $350,000. Equity awards for new directors will vest in equal annual installments on the first three anniversaries of the grant date if the director has served continuously as a member of our board of directors through the applicable vesting date. In addition, equity awards for new directors will vest in full in the event that we are subject to a change in control or upon certain other events. \n \n Beginning in 2016 on the date of our annual meeting of stockholders, each non-employee director will receive an annual board retainer equity award with a fair value (calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718) at the time of grant equal to $175,000. At the election of the director, up to 50% of the annual retainer may be paid in cash. Equity awarded as an annual retainer will vest in full on the date of our next annual meeting of stockholders if the director has served continuously as a member of our board of directors through the date of that meeting. In addition, annual retainer equity awards will vest in full in the event that we are subject to a change in control or upon certain other events. A director will not be eligible to receive an annual retainer in the same calendar year in which he or she receives an initial new director equity grant. \n \n In addition to the annual and new director fees described above, non-employee directors will receive the following payments in cash, payable annually: \n \n Role Annual Cash Payments \n \n ($) Lead Independent Director 15,000 Audit Committee Chairperson 18,000 Audit Committee Member 9,000 Compensation Committee Chairperson 10,000 Compensation Committee Member 5,000 Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Chairperson 6,000 Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Member 3,000 \n \n Mr. Breyer and Mr. Wilson have waived their compensation as directors. \n \n 126 \n \n Executive Compensation \n \n Summary Compensation Table \n \n The following table provides information concerning the compensation of our chief executive officer and our two other most highly compensated executive officers, or our named executive officers. \n \n Name and Principal Position Year Salary \n \n ($) Bonus \n \n ($) Option \n \n Awards \n \n ($)(1) Non-equity \n \n Incentive Plan \n \n Compensation \n \n ($) All Other \n \n Compensation \n \n ($) Total \n \n ($) Chad Dickerson 2014 300,000 \u0097 \u0097 247,500 \u0097 547,500 President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 2013 300,000 \u0097 \u0097 \u0097 \u0097 300,000 Kristina Salen 2014 297,917 \u0097 \u0097 211,750 70,316 (2) 579,983 Chief Financial Officer 2013 251,202 175,000 1,715,430 \u0097 192,333 2,333,965 Jordan Breslow 2014 275,000 \u0097 \u0097 166,375 \u0097 441,375 General Counsel and Secretary 2013 38,616 75,000 1,010,468 \u0097 25,000 1,149,074 \n \n (1) The amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of stock option awards granted to the officer in the applicable fiscal year computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 and do not reflect cash compensation actually received by the named executive officer.

Historically, the base salaries of our executive officers have been reviewed on an ad hoc basis and adjusted only when our board of directors or compensation committee determines an adjustment is appropriate. In February 2014, Ms. Salen\u0092s salary was increased from her initial base salary of $275,000 to $300,000 in light of her performance in 2013 and her responsibilities. \n \n 127 \n \n Annual Cash Incentive Bonuses \n \n Prior to 2014, we did not have a regular annual cash incentive bonus program for our executive officers. In 2014, our compensation committee approved an annual cash incentive plan in which certain of our employees, including our named executive officers, participated. The bonus plan was funded based upon the satisfaction of company-wide Adjusted EBITDA margin and net revenue goals. Because we exceeded our Adjusted EBITDA margin goal, the bonus plan was funded above target. The target bonuses for our named executive officers for 2014, as a percentage of base salary, were 75% for Mr. Dickerson, 59% for Ms. Salen and 50% for Mr. Breslow, and the actual bonus payouts were 110% of target for Mr. Dickerson and 121% of target for Ms. Salen and Mr. Breslow. The individual bonus payments were approved by our compensation committee and our board of directors with input from Mr. Dickerson for the other named executive officers. \n \n Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation \n \n We grant stock options to our employees, including our named executive officers, as the long-term equity incentive component of our compensation program. Stock options allow employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a price no less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and are generally granted to employees in connection with their commencement of employment. Our board of directors or compensation committee from time to time also grants stock options to certain employees who have had a long tenure at Etsy, who have taken on significant new responsibilities or as a reward for superior performance. Employee stock options generally vest 25% when an employee completes 12 months of service with us and then in equal monthly installments over the following 36 months of service with us. None of our named executive officers received stock options in 2014. \n \n In January 2015, we granted an option to purchase 600,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Dickerson and an option to purchase 290,000 shares of our common stock to Ms. Salen. The options vest 25% upon Mr. Dickerson\u0092s or Ms. Salen\u0092s 12 months of continuous service from January 30, 2015 and then in equal monthly installments over his or her following 36 months of service with us. \n \n For information regarding the vesting acceleration provisions applicable to the options held by our named executive officers, see \u0093\u0097Change in Control Benefits\u0094 below. \n \n Employee Benefits and Perquisites \n \n Our named executive officers are eligible to participate in our health and welfare plans to the same extent as other full-time employees generally. We generally do not provide our named executive officers with perquisites or other personal benefits. From time to time, however, we provide relocation benefits to new executive officers. \n \n 128 \n \n Outstanding Equity Awards at 2014 Fiscal Year-End \n \n The following table sets forth information regarding unexercised stock options held by each of our named executive officers as of December 31, 2014. \n \n Stock Option Awards Name Number of Securities \n \n Underlying Unexercised \n \n Options Exercisable(#) Number of Securities \n \n Underlying Unexercised \n \n Options Unexercisable(#) Option \n \n Exercise \n \n Price ($) Option \n \n Expiration \n \n Date Chad Dickerson 600,000 350,000 (1) 1.15 7/28/2021 1,713,876 1,521,702 (2) 2.38 7/16/2022 Kristina Salen 697,515 824,336 (3) 2.38 2/3/2023 Jordan Breslow 192,345 517,852 (4) 3.11 12/10/2023 \n \n (1) This stock option vested 25% on July 19, 2012, with the remainder vesting in 36 equal monthly installments thereafter if Mr. Dickerson remains continuously employed with us on each vesting date. \n \n (2) This stock option vested 25% on June 11, 2013, with the remainder vesting in 36 equal monthly installments thereafter if Mr. Dickerson remains continuously employed with us on each vesting date. \n \n (3) This stock option vested 25% on February 3, 2014, with the remainder vesting in 36 equal monthly installments thereafter if Ms. Salen remains continuously employed with us on each vesting date. \n \n (4) This stock option vested 25% on November 11, 2014, with the remainder vesting in 36 equal monthly installments thereafter if Mr. Breslow remains continuously employed with us on each vesting date. \n \n For information regarding the vesting acceleration provisions applicable to the options held by our named executive officers, see \u0093\u0097Change in Control Benefits\u0094 below. \n \n Employment Agreements \n \n A summary of the material terms of the employment letter agreements with our named executive officers and other arrangements providing benefits in connection with such officers\u0092 termination of employment or in connection with a change in control is below. \n \n Chad Dickerson \n \n In August 2011, we entered into an employment letter agreement with Mr. Dickerson in connection with his promotion to chief executive officer.

Under this agreement, Mr. Breslow\u0092s annual salary was set at $275,000 and he is eligible to receive a cash incentive bonus for each fiscal year starting in 2014 if the relevant performance measures are satisfied. Mr. Breslow also received a signing bonus of $75,000 and was entitled to relocation benefits of up to $25,000 to assist with his move to the New York metropolitan area. \n \n In addition, pursuant to Mr. Breslow\u0092s employment letter agreement, he received an option to purchase 710,197 shares of our common stock in 2013, as described in more detail above under \u0093\u0097Outstanding Equity Awards at 2014 Fiscal-Year End.\u0094 In addition, for information regarding the vesting acceleration provisions applicable to Mr. Breslow\u0092s stock options, see \u0093\u0097Change in Control Benefits\u0094 below. \n \n If Mr. Breslow\u0092s employment is involuntarily terminated, he will be entitled to the severance benefits described below under \u0093\u0097Severance Benefits\u0094 or \u0093\u0097Change in Control Benefits.\u0094 \n \n 130 \n \n Severance and Change in Control Benefits \n \n Prior to the completion of this offering, only Mr. Dickerson was provided severance benefits. In connection with this offering, our board adopted the severance plan and change in control severance plan described below. \n \n Severance Benefits \n \n Severance Plan \n \n In 2015, our board of directors adopted a severance plan for key employees, including our named executive officers, effective upon the completion of this offering. Under the severance plan, if we terminate a named executive officer\u0092s employment without cause or if a named executive officer terminates employment for good reason other than in the 3 months before or 12 months after a change in control, then, if the named executive officer signs a release of claims, he or she will be entitled to receive continued salary payments for 12 months, in the case of Mr. Dickerson, and 6 months, in the case of Ms. Salen and Mr. Breslow. The named executive officer will also be entitled to receive reimbursement for healthcare continuation coverage for the lesser of the number of months in the severance period or until healthcare continuation coverage ends or the named executive officer becomes eligible for substantially equivalent coverage. This severance plan supersedes Mr. Dickerson\u0092s prior severance benefits. \n \n Chad Dickerson \n \n Prior to the completion of this offering, Mr. Dickerson was provided severance benefits pursuant to his employment letter agreement. Under this agreement, if we terminated Mr. Dickerson\u0092s employment without cause or if he resigned for good reason, we would continue to pay his base salary for a period of six months. The salary continuation would be subject to Mr. Dickerson\u0092s resignation from our board of directors and the boards of directors of any of our subsidiaries and execution of a release of claims. \n \n Change in Control Benefits \n \n Change in Control Severance Plan \n \n In 2015, our board of directors also adopted a change in control severance plan for key employees, including our named executive officers, effective upon the completion of this offering. Under this change in control severance plan, if we terminate a named executive officer\u0092s employment without cause or if a named executive officer terminates employment for good reason in the 3 months before or 12 months after a change in control, then, if the named executive officer signs a release of claims, he or she will be entitled to receive continued salary payments for 24 months, in the case of Mr. Dickerson, and 12 months, in the case of Ms. Salen and Mr. Breslow. The named executive officer will also be entitled to receive reimbursement for healthcare continuation coverage for the lesser of the number of months in the severance period or until healthcare continuation coverage ends or the executive becomes eligible for substantially equivalent \n \n 131 \n \n coverage. Finally, the named executive officer will be entitled to full vesting of any outstanding equity awards then held by the named executive officer. This change in control severance plan supersedes Mr. Dickerson\u0092s prior change in control severance benefits. \n \n Chad Dickerson \n \n Prior to the completion of this offering, only Mr. Dickerson was provided severance benefits in connection with a change in control. Pursuant to Mr. Dickerson\u0092s stock option agreements, in the event that we experienced a change in control and, within 12 months following such change in control, Mr. Dickerson was terminated involuntarily, his stock options would fully vest. \n \n Equity Plans \n \n 2015 Equity Incentive Plan \n \n Our board of directors adopted the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan in , and our stockholders approved it in . The 2015 Plan became effective immediately on adoption although no awards will be made under it until the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. Our 2015 Stock Equity Incentive will replace our 2006 Stock Plan described below, and no further grants will be made under our 2006 Stock Plan following completion of this offering. However, awards outstanding under the 2006 Stock Plan will continue to be governed by their existing terms. \n \n Share Reserve. The number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan will equal the sum of (a) shares , (b) the number of shares of our common stock remaining available for issuance under our 2006 Stock Plan as of the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, and (c) the number of shares of our common stock subject to awards under our 2006 Stock Plan that subsequently expire or lapse unexercised and shares issued pursuant to such awards that are forfeited or repurchased by us (such combined number not to exceed shares). The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan will be increased automatically on the first business day of each of our fiscal years during the term of the plan, commencing in 2016, by a number equal to the smallest of: \n \n \u0095 shares; \n \n \u0095 % of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the prior year; and \n \n \u0095 the number of shares determined by our board of directors. \n \n In general, to the extent that any awards under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan are forfeited, terminate, expire or lapse without the issuance of shares, or if we repurchase the shares subject to awards granted under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, those shares will again become available for issuance under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, as will shares applied to pay the exercise or purchase price of an award or to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to any award. All share numbers described in this summary of the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan will automatically adjust in the event of a stock split, a stock dividend, a reverse stock split or similar occurrence. \n \n 132 \n \n Administration. Our compensation committee administers the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. The compensation committee has complete discretion to make all decisions relating to the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan and outstanding awards, including repricing outstanding options and modifying outstanding awards. \n \n Eligibility. Employees, non-employee directors and consultants are eligible to participate in our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. \n \n Types of Award. Our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan provides for the following types of awards: \n \n \u0095 incentive and nonstatutory stock options; \n \n \u0095 stock appreciation rights; \n \n \u0095 restricted share awards; \n \n \u0095 stock unit awards; and \n \n \u0095 performance cash awards. \n \n Options and Stock Appreciation Rights. The exercise price for options granted under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. Optionees may pay the exercise price in cash or, with the consent of the compensation committee and as set forth in the applicable option grant agreement: \n \n \u0095 with shares of common stock that the optionee already owns; \n \n \u0095 by an immediate sale of shares through a broker approved by us; \n \n \u0095 through a net exercise procedure; or \n \n \u0095 by other methods permitted by applicable law. \n \n An optionee who exercises a stock appreciation right receives the increase in value of our common stock over the exercise price. The exercise price for stock appreciation rights may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. The settlement value of a stock appreciation right may be paid in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of these forms of payment. \n \n Options and stock appreciation rights vest as determined by the compensation committee at the time of grant. In most cases, they will vest over a four-year period following the date of grant. Options and stock appreciation rights expire at the time determined by the compensation committee but in no event more than ten years after they are granted. These awards generally expire earlier if the participant\u0092s service terminates earlier. No participant may be granted stock options and stock appreciation rights covering more than 2,000,000 shares (or stock options and/or stock appreciation rights covering more than 4,000,000 shares for a new hire) in any fiscal year. \n \n 133 \n \n Restricted Shares and Stock Units. Restricted shares and stock units may be awarded under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan in return for any lawful consideration, and participants who receive restricted shares or stock units generally are not required to pay cash for their awards. In general, these awards will be subject to vesting. Vesting may be based on length of service, the attainment of performance-based goals or a combination of both, as determined by the compensation committee. No participant may be granted restricted share awards and stock units covering more than 1,500,000 shares (or 3,000,000 restricted shares and/or restricted stock units for a new hire) in any fiscal year. This annual limit is in addition to any stock options and stock appreciation rights the participant may receive during a calendar year. Settlement of vested stock units may be made in the form of cash, shares of common stock or a combination of these forms of payment. The permissible performance goals to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code are listed under \u0093\u0097Performance Goals.\u0094 \n \n Performance Cash Awards. Performance cash awards may be granted under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan that qualify as performance-based compensation that is not subject to the income tax deductibility limitations imposed by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, if the award is approved by our compensation committee and the grant or vesting of the award is tied solely to the attainment of performance goals during a designated performance period. The permissible performance goals to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code are listed under \u0093\u0097Performance Goals.\u0094 No participant may be paid more than $1,500,000 in cash (or $3,000,000 for a new hire) in any fiscal year pursuant to a performance cash award granted under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. \n \n Performance Goals. Performance goals for the grant or vesting of awards under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan may be based on any one of, or combination of, the following: budget performance, buyer acquisition, retention and/or growth, cash flow, cash flow return on investment, comparisons with various stock market indices, costs and expenses (including reduction of both), earnings or earnings per share (including earnings before taxes, earnings before interest and taxes, earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including adjusted measures), employee satisfaction and/or retention, free cash flow or free cash flow per share, gross margin, gross profits, headcount, market share, net income (before or after taxes), operating income or EBIT (Earnings before Interest and Taxes) on a GAAP or non-GAAP basis, operating or EBIT margin, return on assets, investment or capital employed, return on equity or average stockholders\u0092 equity, revenue (gross or net), GMS, seller acquisition, retention and/or growth, member satisfaction, stockholders\u0092 equity, stock price return relative to market indices and/or peer group, total stockholder return and working capital. \n \n Any of the above metrics may be measured either in absolute terms, compared to any incremental increase or decrease or compared to results of a peer group, to market performance indicators or to market indices. \n \n To the extent a performance award is not intended to comply with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, the compensation committee may select other measures of performance. \n \n 134 \n \n Corporate Transactions. In the event we are a party to a merger, consolidation or certain change in control transactions, outstanding awards granted under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, and all shares acquired under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, will be subject to the terms of the definitive transaction agreement (or, if there is no such agreement, as determined by our compensation committee). Unless an award agreement provides otherwise, such treatment may include any of the following with respect to each outstanding award: \n \n \u0095 the continuation, assumption or substitution of an award by us or the acquiror or surviving corporation; \n \n \u0095 the cancellation of the unvested portion of an award without payment of any consideration; \n \n \u0095 the cancellation of the vested portion of options and stock appreciation rights in exchange for a payment equal to the excess, if any, of the value that a holder of a share of our common stock receives in the transaction over the exercise or purchase price of such award; \n \n \u0095 the cancellation of outstanding stock units (whether vested or unvested) in exchange for a payment equal to the value that a holder of a share of our common stock receives in such transaction; or \n \n \u0095 the assignment of any repurchase or reacquisition rights held by us to the surviving or acquiring entity. \n \n The compensation committee is not required to treat all awards, or portions thereof, in the same manner. \n \n The compensation committee has the discretion to provide that an award granted under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan will vest on an accelerated basis if we are subject to a change in control or if the participant is subject to an involuntary termination, either at the time such award is granted or afterwards. \n \n A change in control includes: \n \n \u0095 any person acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 50% of our total voting power; \n \n \u0095 the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets; \n \n \u0095 our merger or consolidation after which our voting securities represent 50% or less of the total voting power of the surviving or acquiring entity; or \n \n \u0095 individuals who are members of our board of directors or individuals who were approved or recommended by members of our board of directors cease to constitute a majority of our board of directors over a 12-month period. \n \n Changes in Capitalization. In the event that there is a specified type of change in the capital structure of our common stock, such as a stock split, reverse stock split or dividend paid in common stock, proportionate adjustments will automatically be made to the kind and maximum number of shares: \n \n \u0095 reserved for issuance under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan; \n \n 135 \n \n \u0095 by which the share reserve may increase automatically each year; \n \n \u0095 that may be granted to a participant in a year (as established under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code); \n \n \u0095 that may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock options; and \n \n \u0095 covered by each outstanding option, stock appreciation right and stock unit; \n \n as well as the exercise price applicable to each outstanding option and stock appreciation right and the repurchase price, if any, applicable to restricted shares. \n \n In the event that there is a declaration of an extraordinary dividend payable in a form other than our common stock in an amount that has a material effect on the price of our common stock, a recapitalization, a spin-off or a similar occurrence, the compensation committee may make such adjustments as it deems appropriate, in its sole discretion. \n \n Amendments or Termination. Our board of directors may amend or terminate the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan at any time. If our board of directors amends the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, it does not need to ask for stockholder approval of the amendment unless required by applicable law, regulation or rules. The 2015 Equity Incentive Plan will continue in effect for ten years from the later of its adoption date or the date of approval of the latest share increase, unless our board of directors decides to terminate the plan earlier. \n \n Forfeiture. Awards under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan are subject to recovery to the extent required by any law, government regulation, stock exchange listing requirement or company policy. \n \n 2006 Stock Plan \n \n Our board of directors adopted our 2006 Stock Plan in May 2006, and our stockholders approved it in June 2006. The most recent amendment to the 2006 Stock Plan was adopted by our board of directors in December 2013, and we obtained stockholder approval of that amendment in January 2014. No further awards will be made under our 2006 Stock Plan after this offering. The awards outstanding after this offering under the 2006 Stock Plan will continue to be governed by their existing terms. \n \n Share Reserve. We have reserved 48,505,935 shares of our common stock for issuance under the 2006 Stock Plan, all of which may be issued as incentive stock options. In general, if options or shares awarded under the 2006 Stock Plan are reacquired or repurchased by us or otherwise forfeited by a 2006 Stock Plan participant, then those shares or option shares will again become available for awards under the 2006 Stock Plan. \n \n Administration. Our board of directors administered the 2006 Stock Plan before this offering, and the compensation committee will administer the 2006 Stock Plan after this offering. Before this offering, our board of directors had, and after this offering, our compensation committee will have, complete discretion to make all decisions relating to our 2006 Stock Plan. \n \n 136 \n \n Eligibility. Employees, members of our board of directors who are not employees and consultants are eligible to participate in our 2006 Stock Plan. \n \n Types of Award. Our 2006 Stock Plan provides for the following types of awards: \n \n \u0095 incentive and nonstatutory stock options; and \n \n \u0095 direct award or sale of shares of our common stock, including restricted shares (subject to a right of repurchase by us upon the participant\u0092s termination with respect to unvested shares). \n \n Options and restricted shares vest at the times determined by our board of directors. Both options and restricted shares generally vest over a four-year period following the date of grant. Options expire not more than 10 years after they are granted but generally expire earlier if the participant\u0092s service terminates earlier. \n \n Options. The exercise price for options granted under the 2006 Stock Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the option grant date. Participants may pay the exercise price of options, or the purchase price of shares, by using cash or cash equivalents. In addition, at the discretion of our board of directors, payment may be made by using: \n \n \u0095 a full-recourse promissory note, against which the purchased shares are pledged as security for payment of the principal amount of, and interest on, the note; \n \n \u0095 shares of common stock that the optionee already owns; \n \n \u0095 an immediate sale of the option shares through a broker designated by us; \n \n \u0095 in the case of a sale of shares, services rendered to us; or \n \n \u0095 any other form of payment permitted by applicable law. \n \n Restricted Stock. We may grant or sell restricted stock to participants under the 2006 Stock Plan. \n \n Change in Control. In the event we are a party to a merger or consolidation, outstanding options granted under the 2006 Stock Plan will be subject to the terms of the definitive transaction agreement. Such treatment shall include any of the following: \n \n \u0095 the continuation, assumption or substitution of the option by us or the acquiror or surviving corporation; \n \n \u0095 the full exercisability of outstanding options and full vesting of the common shares subject to options, followed by cancellation of such options; or \n \n \u0095 the cancellation of the outstanding options in exchange for a payment equal to the excess, if any, of the value that a holder of a share of our common stock receives in the transaction over the exercise price of the option. \n \n 137 \n \n Changes in Capitalization. In the event that there is a specified type of change in the capital structure of our common stock, such as a stock split, reverse stock split or dividend paid in common stock, proportionate adjustments will automatically be made to the kind and maximum number of shares: \n \n \u0095 reserved for issuance under the 2006 Stock Plan; \n \n \u0095 that may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock options; and \n \n \u0095 covered by each outstanding option; \n \n as well as the exercise price applicable to each outstanding option. \n \n In the event that there is a declaration of an extraordinary dividend payable in a form other than our common stock in an amount that has a material effect on the price of our common stock, a recapitalization, a spin-off or a similar occurrence, the compensation committee may make such adjustments as it deems appropriate, in its sole discretion. \n \n Amendments or Termination. Our board of directors may amend or terminate the 2006 Stock Plan at any time. If our board of directors amends the 2006 Stock Plan, it does not need to ask for stockholder approval of the amendment unless the amendment increases the number of shares available for issuance, materially changes the class of persons eligible to receive incentive stock options or is otherwise required by applicable law. The 2006 Stock Plan will continue in effect for ten years from the later of its adoption date or the date of approval of the latest share increase, unless our board of directors decides to terminate the plan earlier. \n \n 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan \n \n General. Our board of directors adopted our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or our ESPP, in , and our stockholders approved it in . The ESPP will become effective as of the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. Our ESPP is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. \n \n Share Reserve. We have reserved shares of our common stock for issuance under the ESPP. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the ESPP will automatically be increased on the first business day of each of our fiscal years, commencing in 2016, by a number equal to the smallest of: \n \n \u0095 shares; \n \n \u0095 % of the shares of common stock outstanding on the last business day of the prior fiscal year; or \n \n \u0095 the number of shares determined by our board of directors. \n \n 138 \n \n The number of shares reserved under the ESPP will automatically be adjusted in the event of a stock split, stock dividend, extraordinary dividend payable in a form other than our common stock in an amount that has a material effect on the price of our common stock or a reverse stock split (including an adjustment to the per-purchase period share limit). \n \n Administration. The compensation committee will administer the ESPP. \n \n Eligibility. All of our employees are eligible to participate if we employ them for 20 or more hours per week and for more than five months per year. Eligible employees may begin participating in the ESPP at the start of any offering period. \n \n Offering Periods. Each offering period will last a number of months determined by the compensation committee, not to exceed 27 months. A new offering period will begin periodically, as determined by the compensation committee. Offering periods may overlap or may be consecutive. Unless otherwise determined by the compensation committee, two offering periods of six months\u0092 duration will begin in each year on January 1 and July 1. However, our compensation committee has not yet determined when to commence operation of the ESPP, so we currently do not expect an offering period to commence in July 2015. \n \n Amount of Contributions. Our ESPP permits each eligible employee to purchase common stock through payroll deductions. Each employee\u0092s payroll deductions may not exceed 15% of the employee\u0092s cash compensation. Each participant may purchase up to the number of shares determined by the compensation committee on any purchase date, not to exceed shares. The value of the shares purchased in any calendar year may not exceed $25,000. Participants may withdraw their contributions at any time before the date 10 days before stock is purchased. \n \n Purchase Price. The price of each share of common stock purchased under our ESPP will not be less than 85% of the lower of the fair market value per share of common stock on the first day of the applicable offering period or the fair market value per share of common stock on the purchase date. \n \n Other Provisions. Employees may end their participation in the ESPP at any time. Participation ends automatically upon termination of employment with us. If we experience a change in control, our ESPP will end and shares will be purchased with the payroll deductions accumulated to date by participating employees. Our board of directors or our compensation committee may amend or terminate the ESPP at any time. If our board of directors amends the ESPP, it does not need to ask for stockholder approval of the amendment unless the amendment increases the number of shares available for issuance, extends the term of the ESPP or is otherwise required by applicable law. The ESPP will continue in effect for twenty years from its adoption date unless our board of directors decides to terminate the ESPP earlier. \n \n 139 \n \n Management Cash Incentive Plan \n \n Our board of directors adopted the Management Cash Incentive Plan, or the Bonus Plan, in March 2015 and our stockholders approved it in 2015. The Bonus Plan became effective upon adoption by our board of directors. \n \n General. The Bonus Plan is intended to motivate participants to achieve performance goals through cash incentive awards and is intended to permit awards that meet the requirements of the performance-based compensation exemption from Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code to the extent that it is applicable to us and the Bonus Plan. \n \n Administration. Our compensation committee has the authority to administer and interpret the Bonus Plan, including the authority to determine which employees shall be granted awards, the terms and conditions of awards and achievement of performance goals. \n \n Performance Criteria. To the extent Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code is applicable to us and an award under the Bonus Plan is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, our compensation committee establishes the performance goal or goals applicable to that award by the 90th day of the performance period (and no later than the date on which 25% of the performance period has lapsed). To the extent Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code is applicable to us and an award under the Bonus Plan is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, the performance criteria will be based on any one of, or combination of, the following: budget performance, buyer acquisition, retention and/or growth, cash flow, cash flow return on investment, comparisons with various stock market indices, costs and expenses (including reduction of both), earnings or earnings per share (including earnings before taxes, earnings before interest and taxes, earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including adjusted measures), employee satisfaction and/or retention, free cash flow or free cash flow per share, gross margin, gross profits, headcount, market share, net income (before or after taxes), operating income or EBIT (Earnings before Interest and Taxes) on a GAAP or non-GAAP basis, operating or EBIT margin, return on assets, investment or capital employed, return on equity or average stockholders\u0092 equity, revenue (gross or net), GMS, seller acquisition, retention and/or growth, member satisfaction, stockholders\u0092 equity, stock price return relative to market indices and/or peer group, total stockholder return and working capital. \n \n Any of the above metrics may be measured either in absolute terms, compared to any incremental increase or decrease or compared to results of a peer group, to market performance indicators or to market indices. \n \n Our compensation committee can establish other performance goals for any award under the Bonus Plan not intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. \n \n 140 \n \n Maximum Award; Discretion. The maximum award amount payable under the Bonus Plan is $7,500,000. Our compensation committee has the discretion to reduce awards under the Bonus Plan for any reason or increase awards that are not intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, up to the maximum award amount. Awards intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code cannot be increased beyond the award achieved based on actual performance. \n \n Forfeiture. Awards under the Bonus Plan are subject to recovery to the extent required by any law, government regulation, stock exchange listing requirement or company policy. \n \n 141 \n \n Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions \n \n In addition to the compensation arrangements with directors and executive officers described under \u0093Executive Compensation\u0094 and \u0093Management\u0094 and the registration rights described under \u0093Description of Capital Stock\u0097Registration Rights,\u0094 the following is a description of each transaction since January 1, 2012 and each currently proposed transaction in which: \n \n \u0095 we have been or are to be a participant; \n \n \u0095 the amount involved exceeds or will exceed $120,000; and \n \n \u0095 any of our directors, executive officers or beneficial holders of more than 5% of our capital stock, or any immediate family member of, or person sharing the household with, any of these individuals (other than tenants or employees), had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. \n \n Equity Financings \n \n Series F Preferred Stock \n \n In May 2012, we sold an aggregate of 11,594,203 shares of our Series F preferred stock at a purchase price of $3.45 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $40,000,000.

Since January 1, 2012, we have waived or assigned our right of first refusal in connection with the sale of certain shares of our capital stock, resulting in the purchase of such shares by certain holders of more than 5% of our capital stock in a series of transactions. Since January 2014, pursuant to agreements entered into in January 2014, as amended most recently in May 2014, we were obligated to assign all of our contractual rights of first refusal to Tiger Global PIP VII and Tiger Global Private Investment Partners VIII, L.P., or the Tiger Global funds, which funds collectively hold more than 5% of our capital stock, and two principals of the Tiger Global funds until the earlier of December 31, 2014 and such time as certain conditions have been satisfied.

We intend to adopt a written related person transaction policy to be effective upon the completion of this offering. Under our related person transaction policy, our management will be required to submit any related person transaction not previously approved or ratified by our audit committee to our audit committee. In approving or rejecting the proposed transactions, our audit committee will take into account the relevant facts and circumstances and will approve only those transactions that are in, or are not inconsistent with, our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. \n \n 145 \n \n Although we have not had a written policy prior to this offering for the review and approval of related person transactions, our board of directors has historically reviewed and approved any transaction where a director or officer had a financial interest, including the transactions described above. Prior to approving such a transaction, the material facts as to a director\u0092s or officer\u0092s relationship or interest as to the agreement or transaction were disclosed to our board of directors, which took take this information into account when evaluating the transaction and determining whether such transaction was fair to us and in the best interest of our stockholders. \n \n 146 \n \n Principal and Selling Stockholders \n \n The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of January 31, 2015, and as adjusted to reflect the sale of common stock offered by us and the selling stockholders in this offering, for: \n \n \u0095 each of our named executive officers; \n \n \u0095 each of our directors; \n \n \u0095 all of our executive officers and directors as a group; \n \n \u0095 each stockholder, or group of affiliated persons, known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock; and \n \n \u0095 each of the selling stockholders. \n \n We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC, which generally define beneficial ownership to include any shares over which a person exercises sole or shared voting or investment power. Such determination is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Except as indicated by the footnotes below, we believe, based on the information furnished to us, that the persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock that they beneficially own, subject to applicable community property laws. \n \n Applicable percentage ownership is based on 196,381,160 shares of common stock outstanding at January 31, 2015, after giving effect to the conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock as of that date into an aggregate of 106,896,493 shares of our common stock, which will occur immediately prior to the completion of this offering. For purposes of computing percentage ownership after this offering, we have assumed the issuance and sale by us of shares of common stock in this offering and that the underwriters will not exercise their option to purchase additional shares. In computing the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed to be outstanding all shares of common stock subject to options or warrants held by that person or entity that are currently exercisable or that will become exercisable within 60 days of January 31, 2015. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. \n \n 147 \n \n Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each beneficial owner listed in the table below is c/o Etsy, Inc., 55 Washington Street, Suite 512, Brooklyn, New York 11201. \n \n Beneficial \n \n Ownership Prior to \n \n this Offering Shares Being \n \n Offered Beneficial Ownership \n \n After this Offering Name of Beneficial Owner Number Percent Number Percent Named Executive Officers and Directors: Jordan Breslow(1) 236,732 * James W.

Under Delaware law, we can only pay dividends either out of \u0093surplus\u0094 or out of the current or the immediately preceding year\u0092s net profits. Surplus is defined as the excess, if any, at any given time, of the total assets of a corporation over its total liabilities and statutory \n \n 150 \n \n capital. The value of a corporation\u0092s assets can be measured in a number of ways and may not necessarily equal their book value. See \u0093Dividend Policy\u0094 for more information. \n \n Voting Rights \n \n The holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share. Stockholders do not have the ability to cumulate votes for the election of directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that will be in effect upon completion of this offering will provide for a classified board of directors consisting of three classes of approximately equal size, each serving staggered three-year terms. Only one class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of our stockholders, with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three-year terms. \n \n No Preemptive or Similar Rights \n \n Our common stock is not entitled to preemptive rights and is not subject to conversion, redemption or sinking fund provisions. \n \n Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions \n \n Upon our dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, the assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders are distributable ratably among the holders of our common stock, subject to prior satisfaction of all outstanding debt and liabilities and the preferential rights and payment of liquidation preferences, if any, on any outstanding shares of preferred stock. \n \n Preferred Stock \n \n Upon the completion of this offering, no shares of preferred stock will be outstanding. However, we will be authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, to issue preferred stock in one or more series, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each series and any of its qualifications, limitations or restrictions. Our board of directors also can increase or decrease the number of shares of any series, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock. We have no current plan to issue any shares of preferred stock. \n \n 151 \n \n Options \n \n As of December 31, 2014, we had options to purchase 23,050,594 shares of our common stock outstanding under our 2006 Stock Plan. Subsequent to December 31, 2014, we granted options to purchase 2,037,490 shares of our common stock under our 2006 Stock Plan. \n \n Warrants \n \n As of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding immediately exercisable warrants to purchase (i) an aggregate of 11,373 shares of our Series C preferred stock at an exercise price of $2.67 per share, or the Series C warrant, (ii) an aggregate of 24,510 shares of our Series D preferred stock at an exercise price of $6.63 per share, or the Series D warrant, and (iii) an aggregate of 4,723 shares of our Series E preferred stock at an exercise price of $15.88 per share, or the Series E warrant. Immediately following this offering, the Series C warrant will be exercisable for 113,730 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.267 per share, the Series D warrant will be exercisable for 245,100 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.663 per share and the Series E warrant will be exercisable for 47,230 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.588 per share. The Series C warrant expires on November 14, 2017. The Series D warrant expires on the later of May 15, 2015 and five years from the date of this offering. The Series E warrant expires on the later of August 9, 2017 and five years from the date of this offering. \n \n Registration Rights \n \n Following the completion of this offering, holders of an aggregate of shares of our common stock will have registration rights. These shares are referred to as registrable securities. The holders of these registrable securities possess registration rights pursuant to the terms of our sixth amended and restated investor rights agreement dated May 1, 2012, as amended, or investor rights agreement, which terms are described in additional detail below. We originally entered into the investor rights agreement in connection with our Series A-1 preferred stock financing and amended it mostly recently on May 2, 2014. \n \n Demand Registration Rights \n \n Under our investor rights agreement, at any time commencing on the date that is 180 days following the effective date of our first registration statement, upon the written request of the holders of not less than 30% of the registrable securities then outstanding that we file a registration statement under the Securities Act with an anticipated aggregate price to the public of at least $7.5 million, we will be obligated to use our commercially reasonable efforts to register the sale of all registrable securities that holders may request in writing to be registered within 20 days of the mailing of a notice by us to all holders of such registration. We are required to effect no more than two registration statements that are declared or ordered effective, subject to certain exceptions. We may postpone the filing of a registration statement for up to 120 days twice in any 12-month period if in the good faith judgment of our board of directors such registration would \n \n 152 \n \n be seriously detrimental to us, and we are not required to effect the filing of a registration statement during the period beginning 90 days prior to our good faith estimate of the date of the filing of, and ending on a date 180 days following the effective date of, a registration initiated by us. \n \n Piggyback Registration Rights \n \n If we register any of our securities for public sale, we will be obligated to use all commercially reasonable efforts to register all registrable securities that the holders of such securities request in writing be registered within 10 days of mailing of notice by us to all holders of the proposed registration. However, this right does not apply to a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans, a registration relating to the offer and sale of debt securities or a registration relating to a corporate reorganization or other transaction under Rule 145 of the Securities Act. The managing underwriter of any underwritten offering will have the right to limit, due to marketing reasons, the number of shares registered by these holders to 25% of the total shares covered by the registration statement, except for in this offering, in which these holders may be excluded entirely if the underwriters determine that the sale of their shares may jeopardize the success of the offering. \n \n Form S-3 Registration Rights \n \n At any time commencing on the date that is 180 days following the effective date of our first registration statement, the holders of the registrable securities can request that we register all or a portion of their shares on Form S-3 if we are eligible to file a registration statement on Form S-3 and the aggregate price to the public of the shares offered is at least $3 million. We are required to file no more than two registration statements on Form S-3 per 12-month period upon exercise of these rights, subject to certain exceptions. We may postpone the filing of a registration statement for up to 120 days twice in any 12-month period if in the good faith judgment of our board of directors such registration would be seriously detrimental to us, and we are not required to effect the filing of a registration statement during the period beginning 90 days prior to our good faith estimate of the date of the filing of, and ending on a date 180 days following the effective date of, a registration initiated by us. \n \n Registration Expenses \n \n We will pay all expenses (other than underwriting discounts, selling commissions and stock transfer taxes) of the holders incurred in connection with each of the registrations described above. However, we will not pay for any expenses of any demand or Form S-3 registration if the request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities to be registered, subject to limited exceptions. \n \n Termination of Registration Rights \n \n The registration rights described above will survive this offering and will terminate as to any stockholder at such time as all of such stockholder\u0092s securities (together with any affiliate of the stockholder with whom \n \n 153 \n \n such stockholder must aggregate its sales) could be sold pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act, but in any event no later than the five-year anniversary of this offering. \n \n Anti-Takeover Provisions \n \n Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law \n \n Upon the completion of this offering, we will be governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law regulating corporate takeovers. This section prevents some Delaware corporations from engaging, under some circumstances, in a business combination. A business combination includes a merger or sale of at least 10% of the corporation\u0092s assets with any interested stockholder, meaning a stockholder who, together with affiliates and associates, owns or, within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, did own 15% or more of the corporation\u0092s outstanding voting stock, unless: \n \n \u0095 the transaction is approved by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder; or \n \n \u0095 subsequent to such time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder. \n \n A Delaware corporation may \u0093opt out\u0094 of these provisions with an express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or an express provision in its certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws resulting from a stockholders\u0092 amendment approved by a majority of the outstanding voting shares. We have not opted out of these provisions. As a result, mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts of us may be discouraged or prevented. \n \n Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions \n \n Upon the completion of this offering, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws will include a number of provisions that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control of our management team, including the following: \n \n Board of Directors Vacancies. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will authorize only our board of directors to fill vacant directorships. In addition, the number of directors constituting our board of directors will be set only by resolution adopted by a majority vote of our entire board of directors. These provisions will prevent a stockholder from increasing the size of our board of directors and gaining control of our board of directors by filling the resulting vacancies with its own nominees. \n \n Classified Board. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will provide that our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors, each of whom will hold office for a three-year term. In addition, directors may only be removed from our board of directors for \n \n 154 \n \n cause and only by the approval of our then outstanding shares of our common stock. The existence of a classified board could delay a successful tender offeror from obtaining majority control of our board of directors, and the prospect of that delay might deter a potential offeror. \n \n Stockholder Action; Special Meeting of Stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that stockholders will not be able to take action by written consent, and will only be able to take action at annual or special meetings of our stockholders. Stockholders will not be permitted to cumulate their votes for the election of directors. Our amended and restated bylaws will further provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by a majority vote of our entire board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors or our chief executive officer. \n \n Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations. Our amended and restated bylaws will provide advance notice procedures for stockholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at any meeting of stockholders. Our amended and restated bylaws will also specify certain requirements regarding the form and content of a stockholder\u0092s notice. These provisions may preclude our stockholders from bringing matters before our annual meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for directors at our meetings of stockholders. \n \n Issuance of Undesignated Preferred Stock. Our board of directors will have the authority, without further action by the holders of common stock, to issue up to shares of undesignated preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by our board of directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock will enable our board of directors to render more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. \n \n Choice of Forum \n \n Upon the completion of this offering, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u0092 certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. \n \n 155 \n \n Transfer Agent and Registrar \n \n Upon the completion of this offering, the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock will be American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC. The transfer agent\u0092s address is 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11219, and its telephone number is (800) 937-5449. \n \n Listing \n \n We intend to apply to have our common stock listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u0093ETSY.\u0094 \n \n 156 \n \n Shares Available for Future Sale \n \n Before this offering, there has not been a public market for shares of our common stock. Future sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, in the public market following this offering or the possibility of these sales occurring could cause the prevailing market price for our common stock to fall or impair our ability to raise equity capital in the future. \n \n Following this offering, we will have outstanding shares of our common stock, based on the number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2014. Of these outstanding shares, all of the shares of common stock sold in this offering will be freely tradable, except that any shares purchased in this offering by our affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, can only be sold in compliance with Rule 144. \n \n The remaining shares of common stock that are not sold in this offering will be \u0093restricted securities,\u0094 as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. These restricted securities are eligible for public sale only if they are registered under the Securities Act or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rule 144 or Rule 701 under the Securities Act, which are summarized below. \n \n In addition, all of our executive officers and directors and the holders of substantially all of our capital stock are subject to lock-up agreements with us or the underwriters of this offering that restrict the stockholders\u0092 ability to transfer shares, subject to specific exceptions, of our common stock for periods of at least 180 days, and for a portion of the shares, 270 and 360 days from the date of this prospectus, as described below. As a result of these agreements and the provisions of our investors\u0092 rights agreement described above under \u0093Description of Capital Stock\u0097Registration Rights,\u0094 subject to the provisions of Rule 144 or Rule 701, shares will be available for sale in the public market as follows: \n \n \u0095 beginning on the date of this prospectus, the shares sold in this offering will be immediately available for sale in the public market; \n \n \u0095 beginning 181 days after the date of this prospectus, up to an aggregate of additional shares will become eligible for sale in the public market, of which shares will be held by affiliates and subject to the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144, as described below; \n \n \u0095 beginning 271 days after the date of this prospectus, up to an aggregate of additional shares will become eligible for sale in the public market, of which shares will be held by affiliates and subject to the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144, as described below; \n \n \u0095 beginning 361 days after the date of this prospectus, up to an aggregate of additional shares will become eligible for sale in the public market, of which shares will be held by affiliates and subject to the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144, as described below; \n \n 157 \n \n \u0095 the remainder of the shares will be eligible for sale in the public market from time to time thereafter, subject in some cases to the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144, as described below. \n \n Lock-Up Agreements \n \n Our executive officers, directors and stockholders holding substantially all of our outstanding capital stock are subject to lock-up agreements with the underwriters of this offering that restrict the stockholders\u0092 ability to transfer shares of our common stock, subject to certain exceptions, for periods of at least 180 days, and for a portion of the shares, 270 and 360 days from the date of this prospectus, except with the prior written consent of Goldman, Sachs & Co. In addition, substantially all other holders of our common stock, options and warrants have previously entered into lock-up agreements with us not to sell or otherwise transfer any of their common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock for a period that extends until 181 days after the date of this prospectus. \n \n See \u0093Underwriting\u0094 for a more complete description of the lock-up agreements with the underwriters. \n \n Rule 144 \n \n In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, a person who has beneficially owned shares of our restricted common stock for at least six months would be entitled to sell their securities provided that such person is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the 90 days preceding, a sale, and we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, for at least 90 days before the sale. In addition, under Rule 144, any person who is not an affiliate of ours and has held their shares for at least one year, including the holding period of any prior owner other than one of our affiliates, would be entitled to sell an unlimited number of shares immediately upon the completion of this offering without regard to whether current public information about us is available. Persons who have beneficially owned shares of our restricted common stock for at least six months but who are our affiliates at the time of, or any time during the 90 days preceding, a sale, would be subject to additional restrictions, by which such person would be entitled to sell within any three-month period only a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of either of the following: \n \n \u0095 1% of the number of common shares then outstanding, which will equal approximately shares immediately after this offering assuming no exercise of the underwriters\u0092 option to purchase additional shares, based on the number of common shares outstanding as of December 31, 2014; or \n \n \u0095 the average weekly trading volume of our common shares during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale; \n \n provided, in each case, that we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least 90 days before the sale. Such sales both by affiliates and by non-affiliates must also comply with the manner of sale, current public information and notice provisions of Rule 144. \n \n 158 \n \n Rule 701 \n \n Any of our service providers who purchased shares under a written compensatory plan or contract prior to this offering may be entitled to rely on the resale provisions of Rule 701. Rule 701, as currently in effect, permits resales of shares, including by affiliates, in reliance upon Rule 144 but without compliance with certain restrictions, including the holding period requirement, of Rule 144. Rule 701 further provides that non-affiliates may sell such shares in reliance on Rule 144 without having to comply with the public information, volume limitation or notice provisions of Rule 144. All holders of Rule 701 shares are required to wait until 90 days after the date of this prospectus before selling such shares if such resale is done under Rule 701. All Rule 701 shares are, however, subject to lock-up agreements and will only become eligible for sale upon the expiration of these lock-up agreements. \n \n Registration Rights \n \n Upon completion of this offering, the holders of shares of our common stock will have registration rights. See \u0093Description of Capital Stock\u0097Registration Rights.\u0094 All such shares are covered by lock-up agreements. Following the expiration of the lock-up period, registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act immediately upon the effectiveness of the registration, except for shares purchased by our affiliates. \n \n Form S-8 Registration Statements \n \n We intend to file a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act covering all of the shares of common stock subject to options outstanding, as well as reserved for future issuance, under our stock plans.

However, none of the shares registered on Form S-8 will be eligible for resale until the expiration of the lock-up agreements to which they are subject. \n \n 159 \n \n Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders of Common Stock \n \n The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations with respect to the ownership and disposition of shares of common stock applicable to non-U.S. holders who acquire such shares in this offering and hold such shares as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u0093Code\u0094) (generally, property held for investment). For purposes of this discussion, a \u0093non-U.S. holder\u0094 means a beneficial owner of our common stock (other than an entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is not, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any of the following: \n \n \u0095 a citizen or resident of the United States; \n \n \u0095 a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, or any other corporation treated as such; \n \n \u0095 an estate, the income of which is includable in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or \n \n \u0095 a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more \u0093U.S. persons,\u0094 as defined under the Code, have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) such trust has made a valid election to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. \n \n This discussion is based on current provisions of the Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial opinions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service and other applicable authorities, all of which are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect). This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to a particular non-U.S. holder in light of that non-U.S. holder\u0092s individual circumstances, nor does it address any aspects of the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, any U.S. federal estate and gift taxes, any U.S. alternative minimum taxes or any state, local or non-U.S. taxes. This discussion may not apply, in whole or in part, to particular non-U.S. holders in light of their individual circumstances or to holders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions, brokers or dealers in securities, \u0093controlled foreign corporations,\u0094 \u0093passive foreign investment companies,\u0094 non-U.S. holders that hold our common stock as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction or other integrated investment and certain U.S. expatriates). \n \n If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner therein will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partners of a partnership holding our common \n \n 160 \n \n stock should consult their tax advisor as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to them. \n \n THIS SUMMARY IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND IS NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF ALL TAX CONSEQUENCES FOR NON-U.S. HOLDERS RELATING TO THE OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF OUR COMMON STOCK. PROSPECTIVE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM (INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF ANY STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS) OF THE OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF OUR COMMON STOCK. \n \n Dividends \n \n In general, the gross amount of any distribution we make to a non-U.S. holder with respect to its shares of common stock will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30% to the extent the distribution constitutes a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes, unless the non-U.S. holder is eligible for a reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable tax treaty and the non-U.S. holder provides proper certification of its eligibility for such reduced rate (generally an applicable Internal Revenue Service Form W-8). A distribution will constitute a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To the extent any distribution does not constitute a dividend, it will be treated first as reducing the adjusted basis in the non-U.S. holder\u0092s shares of common stock and then, to the extent it exceeds the adjusted basis in the non-U.S. holder\u0092s shares of common stock, as gain from the sale or exchange of such stock. Any such gain will be subject to the treatment described below under \u0093\u0097Gain on Sale or Other Disposition of Common Stock.\u0094 \n \n Dividends we pay to a non-U.S. holder that are effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable tax treaty, are attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment of such non-U.S. holder) will not be subject to U.S. withholding tax, as described above, if the non-U.S. holder complies with applicable certification and disclosure requirements. Instead, such dividends generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis, at regular U.S. federal income tax rates. Dividends received by a non-U.S. corporation that are effectively connected with its conduct of trade or business within the United States may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable tax treaty). \n \n Gain on Sale or Other Disposition of Common Stock \n \n In general, a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale or other disposition of the non-U.S. holder\u0092s shares of common stock unless: \n \n \u0095 the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business carried on by the non-U.S. holder within the United States (and, if required by an applicable tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment of such non-U.S. holder); \n \n 161 \n \n \u0095 the non-U.S. holder is an individual and is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition and certain other conditions are met; or \n \n \u0095 we are or have been a U.S. real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding such disposition or such non-U.S. holder\u0092s holding period of our common stock, and the non-U.S. holder has held, at any time during said period, more than 5% of the class of our stock being sold. \n \n Gain that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States (or so treated) generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income tax basis, at regular U.S. federal income tax rates. If the non-U.S. holder is a non-U.S. corporation, the branch profits tax described above also may apply to such effectively connected gain. An individual non-U.S. holder who is subject to U.S. federal income tax because the non-U.S. holder was present in the United States for 183 days or more during the year of sale or other disposition of our common stock will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from such sale or other disposition, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses. We believe that we are not and we do not anticipate becoming a U.S. real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. \n \n Withholdable Payments to Foreign Financial Institutions and Other Non-U.S. Entities \n \n The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, will impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on certain payments to foreign financial institutions, investment funds and certain other non-U.S. persons that fail to comply with certain information reporting and certification requirements pertaining to their direct and indirect U.S. securityholders and/or U.S. accountholders. Such payments would include our dividends and the gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our common stock. Under applicable Treasury Regulations, this withholding will apply to payments of dividends on our common stock, and to payments of gross proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our common stock made on or after January 1, 2017. Prospective investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this legislation on their investment in our common stock. \n \n Backup Withholding, Information Reporting and Other Reporting Requirements \n \n We must report annually to the Internal Revenue Service and to each non-U.S. holder the amount of dividends paid to, and the tax withheld with respect to, each non-U.S. holder. These reporting requirements apply regardless of whether withholding was reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax treaty. Copies of this information reporting may also be made available under the provisions of a specific tax treaty or agreement with the tax authorities in the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established. \n \n 162 \n \n A non-U.S. holder will generally be subject to backup withholding for dividends on our common stock paid to such holder unless such holder certifies under penalties of perjury (generally by providing an applicable Internal Revenue Service form W-8) that, among other things, it is a non-U.S. holder (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a U.S. person) or otherwise establishes an exemption. \n \n Information reporting and backup withholding generally are not required with respect to the amount of any proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our common stock by a non-U.S. holder outside the United States through an office outside the United States of a non-U.S. broker that does not have certain specified connections to the United States. However, if a non-U.S. holder sells or otherwise disposes of its shares of common stock through a U.S. broker or the U.S. offices of a non-U.S. broker, the broker will generally be required to report the amount of proceeds paid to the non-U.S. holder to the Internal Revenue Service and also backup withhold on that amount unless such non-U.S. holder provides appropriate certification to the broker of its status as a non-U.S. person (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a U.S. person) or otherwise establishes an exemption. Information reporting will also apply if a non-U.S. holder sells its shares of common stock through a non-U.S. broker deriving more than a specified percentage of its income from U.S. sources or having certain other connections to the United States, unless such broker has documentary evidence in its records that such non-U.S. holder is a non-U.S. person (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a U.S. person) and certain other conditions are met, or such non-U.S. holder otherwise establishes an exemption. \n \n Backup withholding is not an additional income tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a non-U.S. holder generally can be credited against the non-U.S. holder\u0092s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, or refunded, provided that the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the information reporting and backup withholding rules to them. \n \n 163 \n \n Underwriting \n \n The company, the selling stockholders and the underwriters named below have entered into an underwriting agreement with respect to the shares being offered. Subject to certain conditions, each underwriter has severally agreed to purchase the number of shares indicated in the following table. Goldman, Sachs & Co. is the representative of the underwriters. \n \n Underwriters Number of Shares Goldman, Sachs & Co. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Allen & Company LLC Total \n \n The underwriters are committed to take and pay for all of the shares being offered, if any are taken, other than the shares covered by the option described below unless and until this option is exercised. \n \n The underwriters have an option to buy up to an additional shares from the company to cover sales by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than the total number in the table above. They may exercise that option for 30 days. If any shares are purchased pursuant to this option, the underwriters will severally purchase shares in approximately the same proportion as in the table above. \n \n The following tables show the per share and total estimated underwriting discounts and commissions to be paid to the underwriters by the company and the selling stockholders. Such amounts are shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters\u0092 option to purchase additional shares. \n \n Paid by the Company No Exercise Full Exercise Per Share $ $ Total $ $ \n \n Paid by the Selling Stockholders No Exercise Full Exercise Per Share $ $ Total $ $ \n \n Shares sold by the underwriters to the public will initially be offered at the initial public offering price on the cover of this prospectus. Any shares sold by the underwriters to securities dealers may be sold at a discount of up to $ per share from the initial public offering price. After the initial offering of the shares, the representative may change the offering price and the other selling terms. The offering of the shares by the underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the underwriters\u0092 right to reject any order in whole or in part. \n \n The company and its officers, directors and holders of substantially all of the company\u0092s capital stock, including the selling stockholders, have agreed with the underwriters, subject to certain exceptions, not to dispose of or hedge any of their common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of \n \n 164 \n \n common stock during periods of at least 180 days, and for a portion of the shares, 270 and 360 days from the date of this prospectus, except with the prior written consent of Goldman, Sachs & Co. This agreement does not apply to any existing employee benefit plans. See \u0093Shares Available for Future Sale\u0094 for a discussion of certain transfer restrictions. \n \n Prior to the offering, there has been no public market for the shares. The initial public offering price will be negotiated among the company and the representative. Among the factors to be considered in determining the initial public offering price of the shares, in addition to prevailing market conditions, will be the company\u0092s historical performance, estimates of the business potential and earnings prospects of the company, an assessment of the company\u0092s management and the consideration of the above factors in relation to market valuation of companies in related businesses. \n \n The company intends to apply to list the common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u0093ETSY.\u0094 \n \n In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell shares of common stock in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they are required to purchase in the offering, and a short position represents the amount of such sales that have not been covered by subsequent purchases. A \u0093covered short position\u0094 is a short position that is not greater than the amount of additional shares for which the underwriters\u0092 option described above may be exercised. The underwriters may cover any covered short position by either exercising their option to purchase additional shares or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to cover the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase additional shares pursuant to the option described above. \u0093Naked\u0094 short sales are any short sales that create a short position greater than the amount of additional shares for which the option described above may be exercised. The underwriters must cover any such naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for or purchases of common stock made by the underwriters in the open market prior to the completion of the offering. \n \n The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the representative has repurchased shares sold by or for the account of such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions. \n \n Purchases to cover a short position and stabilizing transactions, as well as other purchases by the underwriters for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the company\u0092s stock, and together with the imposition of the penalty bid, may stabilize, maintain or \n \n 165 \n \n otherwise affect the market price of the common stock. As a result, the price of the common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time. These transactions may be effected on , in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. \n \n The underwriters do not expect sales to discretionary accounts to exceed five percent of the total number of shares offered. \n \n The company and the selling stockholders estimate that the total expenses of the offering, including registration, filing and listing fees, printing fees and legal and accounting expenses and the expenses of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, qualification, but excluding estimated underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately $ . We have agreed to reimburse the underwriters for up to $ of expenses relating to clearance of this offering with FINRA. \n \n The company and the selling stockholders have agreed to indemnify the several underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. \n \n The underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage and other financial and non-financial activities and services. Certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, a variety of these services to the issuer and to persons and entities with relationships with the issuer, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. For example, affiliates of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC are lenders under our Credit Agreement. \n \n In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the underwriters and their respective affiliates, officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and trading activities may involve or relate to assets, securities and/or instruments of the issuer (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise) and/or persons and entities with relationships with the issuer. The underwriters and their respective affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they should acquire, long and/or short positions in such assets, securities and instruments. In addition, M. Michele Burns, a member of the company\u0092s board of directors, is also a member of the board of directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co., an underwriter in this offering. \n \n 166 \n \n IPO Participation Program \n \n At our request, the underwriters have reserved up to 5% of the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus for sale, at the initial public offering price, to individual investors. We call this our IPO Participation Program, or IPP. The purpose of the IPP is to allow our U.S.-based Etsy community and other individual investors to participate in our IPO. \n \n Sales in the IPP will be made at our direction by Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, an underwriter of this offering, or its affiliates. We do not know if individual investors will choose to purchase all or any portion of these reserved shares, but any purchases they do make will reduce the number of shares available in the overall offering. Any reserved shares not purchased in the IPP will be offered by the underwriters to the general public on the same terms as the other shares of common stock. \n \n Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area \n \n In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a Relevant Member State), each underwriter has represented and agreed that with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the Relevant Implementation Date) it has not made and will not make an offer of shares to the public in that Relevant Member State prior to the publication of a prospectus in relation to the shares which has been approved by the competent authority in that Relevant Member State or, where appropriate, approved in another Relevant Member State and notified to the competent authority in that Relevant Member State, all in accordance with the Prospectus Directive, except that it may, with effect from and including the Relevant Implementation Date, make an offer of shares to the public in that Relevant Member State at any time: \n \n (a) to legal entities which are authorised or regulated to operate in the financial markets or, if not so authorised or regulated, whose corporate purpose is solely to invest in securities; \n \n (b) to any legal entity which has two or more of (1) an average of at least 250 employees during the last financial year; (2) a total balance sheet of more than \u008043,000,000 and (3) an annual net turnover of more than \u008050,000,000, as shown in its last annual or consolidated accounts; \n \n (c) to fewer than 100 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus Directive) subject to obtaining the prior consent of the representative for any such offer; or \n \n (d) in any other circumstances which do not require the publication by the Issuer of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive. \n \n For the purposes of this provision, the expression an \u0093offer of shares to the public\u0094 in relation to any shares in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the shares to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to \n \n 167 \n \n purchase or subscribe the shares, as the same may be varied in that Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State and the expression Prospectus Directive means Directive 2003/71/EC and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State. \n \n Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom \n \n Each underwriter has represented and agreed that: \n \n (a) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the shares in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; and \n \n (b) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the shares in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. \n \n Notice to Prospective Investors in Hong Kong \n \n The shares may not be offered or sold by means of any document other than (i) in circumstances which do not constitute an offer to the public within the meaning of the Companies Ordinance (Cap.32, Laws of Hong Kong), or (ii) to \u0093professional investors\u0094 within the meaning of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap.571, Laws of Hong Kong) and any rules made thereunder, or (iii) in other circumstances which do not result in the document being a \u0093prospectus\u0094 within the meaning of the Companies Ordinance (Cap.32, Laws of Hong Kong), and no advertisement, invitation or document relating to the shares may be issued or may be in the possession of any person for the purpose of issue (in each case whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere), which is directed at, or the contents of which are likely to be accessed or read by, the public in Hong Kong (except if permitted to do so under the laws of Hong Kong) other than with respect to shares which are or are intended to be disposed of only to persons outside Hong Kong or only to \u0093professional investors\u0094 within the meaning of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571, Laws of Hong Kong) and any rules made thereunder. \n \n Notice to Prospective Investors in Singapore \n \n This prospectus has not been registered as a prospectus with the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

(the \u0093Company\u0094) and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u0092s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n \n /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n \n New York, New York \n \n March 4, 2015 \n \n F-2 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Consolidated

\n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Note 1\u0097Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n \n Description of Business \n \n Etsy, Inc. (the \u0093Company\u0094 or \u0093Etsy\u0094) was incorporated in Delaware in February 2006. Etsy operates a marketplace where people around the world connect, both online and offline, to make, sell and buy unique goods. The Company generates revenue primarily from transaction and listing fees, Promoted Listings, Direct Checkout fees, and Shipping Label sales. \n \n Evaluation of Subsequent Events \n \n The Company has evaluated subsequent events that occurred after December 31, 2014 through March 4, 2015, the date on which the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 were issued. \n \n Basis of Consolidation \n \n The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Etsy and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The 2012 and 2013 financial statements have been revised to correct certain errors. See Note 15\u0097Revisions to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n \n Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information \n \n Upon the consummation of the initial public offering contemplated by the Company, all of the outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock will convert into shares of common stock. The December 31, 2014 unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet data has been prepared assuming the conversion of the outstanding convertible preferred stock into 106,896,493 shares of common stock. \n \n Use of Estimates \n \n The preparation of the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u0093GAAP\u0094) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The accounting estimates that require management\u0092s most difficult and subjective judgments include revenue recognition, income taxes, website development costs and internal-use software, purchase price allocations for business combinations, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and stock based compensation. The Company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and revises them when necessary. Actual results may differ from the original or revised estimates. \n \n F-10 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Revenue Recognition \n \n The Company operates a platform for third-party sellers. Its business model is based on shared success: the Company makes money when Etsy sellers make money. The Company does not compete with Etsy sellers, hold inventory or sell goods. The Company\u0092s revenue is diversified, generated from a mix of marketplace activities and the services the Company provides Etsy sellers to help them create and grow their businesses. The Company\u0092s revenue consists of Marketplace revenue, Seller Services revenue and Other revenue. The Company\u0092s revenue is recorded net of actual and expected refunds. Marketplace revenue includes the fee an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction and the listing fee an Etsy seller pays for each item she lists. Seller Services revenue includes fees an Etsy seller pays for services such as prominent placement in search results via Promoted Listings, payment processing via Direct Checkout and purchases of shipping labels through the Company\u0092s platform via Shipping Labels. The Company deducts its cost of shipping labels and estimated refunds from gross shipping fees to determine net shipping fees. Other revenue includes the fees the Company receives from a third-party payment processor. \n \n The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the Etsy seller; (3) the collection of fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the Etsy seller is fixed or determinable. The Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon its evaluation of whether it is the primary obligor in a transaction, has inventory risk and has latitude in establishing pricing and selecting suppliers. Based on its evaluation of these factors, revenue is recorded net of merchandise values associated with the transaction. \n \n Marketplace revenue. Marketplace revenue consists of the 3.5% fee that an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction on the Company\u0092s platform, exclusive of shipping fees charged. Marketplace revenue also consists of a listing fee of $0.20 per item that she lists in its marketplace. Revenue from completed Wholesale transactions is also included in Marketplace revenue, whereas revenue from Wholesale enrollment is included in Seller Services revenue. Transaction fees are recognized when the corresponding transaction is made. Listing fees are recognized ratably over a four-month listing period, unless the item is sold or the seller relists it, at which time any remaining listing fee is recognized. \n \n Seller Services revenue. Seller Services revenue consists of fees an Etsy seller pays the Company for the Seller Services she uses, including Promoted Listings, Direct Checkout, Shipping Labels and Wholesale enrollment. \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Promoted Listings consists of cost-per-click based fees an Etsy seller pays the Company for prominent placement of her listings in search results generated by Etsy buyers in its marketplace. Revenue is recognized when the Promoted Listing is clicked. \n \n F-11 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Direct Checkout consists of fees an Etsy seller pays the Company to process credit, debit and Etsy Gift Card payments. Direct Checkout fees vary between 3-4% of the item\u0092s total sale price plus a flat fee per order, depending on the country in which her bank account is located. Direct Checkout fees are based on the item\u0092s total sale price, including shipping. Revenue from Direct Checkout is recognized when the corresponding transaction is made. Revenue from breakage on Etsy Gift Cards is recognized when the amount is probable and estimable. Given the lack of historical experience related to gift card activity, there has been no breakage revenue recorded to date. \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Shipping Labels consists of fees an Etsy seller pays the Company when she purchases shipping labels directly through its platform, net of the cost it incurs in purchasing those shipping labels. The Company provides its sellers shipping labels from the United States Postal Service and Canada Post at a discounted price due to the volume of purchases through its platform. The Company recognizes Shipping Label revenue when an Etsy seller purchases a shipping label. The Company recognizes Shipping Label revenue on a net basis as it is not the primary obligor in the delivery of these services. \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Wholesale consists of fees an Etsy seller pays the Company when she is approved to enroll in its Wholesale program. The one-time Wholesale enrollment fee is recognized ratably over the estimated customer life. Revenue from completed Wholesale transactions is included in Marketplace revenue. \n \n Other revenue. Other revenue includes the fees the Company receives from a third-party payment processor. Other revenue is recognized as the transactions are processed by the third-party payment processor. \n \n The following table summarizes revenue by type of service (in thousands): \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 2013 2014 Marketplace $ 55,330 $ 78,544 $ 108,732 Seller Services 15,863 42,817 82,502 Other 3,409 3,661 4,357 Revenue $ 74,602 $ 125,022 $ 195,591 \n \n F-12 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Cost of Revenue \n \n Cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the operation and maintenance of the Company\u0092s platform and data centers, including depreciation and amortization, employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes the cost of interchange and other fees for credit card processing services, credit card verification service fees and credit card chargebacks to support Direct Checkout revenue, as well as employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for our member support staff, and costs of refunds made to Etsy buyers that the Company is not able to collect from Etsy sellers. \n \n Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts \n \n The Company\u0092s trade accounts receivable are recorded at amounts billed to Etsy sellers and are presented on the consolidated balance sheet net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is determined by a number of factors, including age of the receivable, current economic conditions, historical losses and management\u0092s assessment of the financial condition of Etsy sellers. Receivables are written off once they are deemed uncollectible, which may arise when Etsy sellers file for bankruptcy or are otherwise deemed unable to repay the amounts owed to the Company. Estimates of uncollectible accounts receivable are recorded to general and administrative expense. \n \n The following table summarizes the allowance activity during the periods indicated (in thousands): \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 2013 2014 Balance as of the beginning of period $ 998 $ 1,357 $ 1,279 Bad debt expense 1,295 1,002 1,881 Write-offs, net of recoveries and other adjustments (936 ) (1,080 ) (1,319 ) Balance as of the end of period $ 1,357 $ 1,279 $ 1,841 \n \n Funds Receivable and Seller Accounts and Funds Payable and Amounts due to Sellers \n \n The Company records funds receivable and seller accounts and funds payable and amounts due to sellers as current assets and liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet. Funds receivable and seller accounts represent amounts received or expected to be received from Etsy buyers via third-party credit card processors, which flow through an Etsy bank account for payment to Etsy sellers. This cash and related receivable represent the total amount due to sellers, and as such a liability for the same amount is recorded to funds payable and amounts due to Etsy sellers. \n \n F-13 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Property and Equipment \n \n Property and equipment, consisting principally of computer equipment and purchased software, are recorded at cost. The Company capitalizes construction in progress for build-to-suit lease agreements where we are the owner, for accounting purposes only, during the construction period. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method in amounts sufficient to relate the cost of depreciable and amortizable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives. Repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. \n \n Internal-use Software and Website Development Costs \n \n Costs incurred to develop software for internal use and the Company\u0092s website are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three years. The Company also capitalizes costs related to upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality or will extend the useful life of existing functionality. Costs related to the design or maintenance of internal-use software and website development are expensed as incurred. The Company periodically reviews internal-use software and website development costs to determine whether the projects will be completed, placed in service, removed from service, or replaced by other internally developed or third-party software. If the asset is not expected to provide any future benefit, the asset is retired and any unamortized cost is expensed. \n \n Depreciable/Amortizable Tangible Long-Lived Assets \n \n When events or changes in circumstances require, the Company assesses the likelihood of recovering the cost of tangible long-lived assets based on its expectations of future profitability, undiscounted cash flows and management\u0092s plans with respect to operations to determine if the asset is impaired and subject to write-off. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the fair value. \n \n Leases \n \n The Company leases office space and certain computer equipment in multiple locations under non-cancelable lease agreements. The leases are reviewed for classification as operating or capital leases. For operating leases, rent is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease period. For capital leases, the Company records the leased asset with a corresponding liability. Payments are recorded as reductions to the liability with an appropriate interest charge recorded based on the then-outstanding remaining liability. \n \n The Company considers the nature of the renovations and the Company\u0092s involvement during the construction period of newly leased office space to determine if it is considered to be the owner of the \n \n F-14 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n construction project during the construction period. If the Company determines that it is the owner of the construction project, it is required to capitalize the fair value of the building as well as the construction costs incurred on its consolidated balance sheet along with a corresponding financing liability (\u0093build-to-suit accounting\u0094). Upon occupancy for build-to-suit leases, the Company assesses whether the circumstances qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If the lease meets the sale-leaseback criteria, the Company will remove the asset and related financial obligation from the balance sheet and treat the building lease as an operating lease. If upon completion of construction, the project does not meet the sale-leaseback criteria, the leased property will be treated as a capital lease for financial reporting purposes. \n \n Business Combinations \n \n The Company has completed a number of acquisitions of other businesses in the past and may acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future. The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The Company allocates the purchase price, which is the sum of the consideration provided and may consist of cash, equity or a combination of the two, in a business combination to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates and selection of comparable companies. \n \n When the Company issues stock-based or cash awards to an acquired company\u0092s stockholders, the Company evaluates whether the awards are contingent consideration or compensation for post-acquisition services. The evaluation includes, among other things, whether the vesting of the awards is contingent on the continued employment of the acquired company\u0092s stockholder beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are treated as compensation for post-acquisition services and recognized as expense over the requisite service period. \n \n The Company carries intangible assets at cost, and it amortizes them on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, typically three years. When circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, the Company reviews its identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment. \n \n To date, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Company\u0092s business combinations have primarily consisted of goodwill and finite-lived intangible assets, consisting primarily of developed technologies, customer relationships and trademarks. The estimated fair values and useful lives of identifiable intangible \n \n F-15 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n assets are based on many factors, including estimates and assumptions of future operating performance and cash flows of the acquired business, the nature of the business acquired, and the specific characteristics of the identified intangible assets. The estimates and assumptions used to determine the fair values and useful lives of identified intangible assets could change due to numerous factors, including market conditions, technological developments, economic conditions and competition. In connection with determination of fair values, the Company may engage independent appraisal firms to assist with the valuation of intangible and certain tangible assets acquired and certain assumed obligations. \n \n Acquisition-related transaction costs incurred by the Company are not included as a component of consideration transferred, but are accounted for as an expense in the period in which the costs are incurred. \n \n Goodwill \n \n Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate fair value of the consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of the assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Management has determined that the Company has a single reporting unit and performs its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired. \n \n Events or changes in circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include significant changes in the manner of the Company\u0092s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the Company\u0092s overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future results of operations, a significant adverse change in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition or a loss of key personnel. \n \n The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first of a two-step impairment test. \n \n The first step involves comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its respective book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, then a second step is required that compares the carrying amount of the goodwill with its implied fair value. The estimate of implied fair value of goodwill may require valuations of certain \n \n F-16 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n internally-generated and unrecognized intangible and tangible net assets. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. \n \n The Company completed a Step 1 analysis during the fourth quarter of 2014. No impairment of goodwill was recorded at December 31, 2013 or 2014. \n \n Intangible Assets \n \n Intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful life of the acquired technology, customer relationships and trademarks, generally three years. \n \n Stock-Based Compensation \n \n For employee stock-based awards, the Company calculates the fair value of the award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the expense is recognized over the service period for awards expected to vest. For non-employee stock-based awards, the Company calculates the fair value of the award on the date of grant in the same manner as employee awards over the contractual term; however, the unvested portion of the awards is revalued at the end of each reporting period until such time as the non-employee award is fully vested. \n \n We account for stock-based compensation arrangements in restricted shares, subject to a put option that allows the holder of the shares to put the shares back to the Company for cash, as liability-classified stock awards. These awards are re-measured at each reporting period, with changes in fair value being charged to the statement of operations. Compensation expense is recognized using a graded vesting methodology for each separately vesting tranche as though the award were, in substance, multiple awards. Unless the put option is exercised, the restricted shares will be reclassified from a liability to an equity classified award upon the termination of the put option. \n \n For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, the Company recognized expenses of approximately $3.9 million, $3.7 million and $5.9 million for employee stock options, respectively, and $0.2 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million for non-employee stock options, respectively. \n \n Additionally, the Company recorded $4.1 million in acquisition-related stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, of which $3.4 million relates to liability-classified awards. \n \n Cash and Cash Equivalents \n \n The Company considers all investments with an original maturity of three months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents. \n \n F-17 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Concentration of Credit Risk \n \n Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company reduces credit risk by placing its cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions with high credit ratings. At times, such amounts may exceed Federally insured limits. \n \n Fair Value of Financial Instruments \n \n Management believes that the fair value of financial instruments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximates carrying value due to the immediate or short-term maturity associated with its cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable. \n \n Income Taxes \n \n Income tax benefit (provision) is based on (loss) income before income taxes and is accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in the period that includes the enactment date. Management assesses the need for a valuation allowance on an annual basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. \n \n The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement. The Company has no unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2012 and 2013 and has an unrecognized tax benefit of $0.4 million at December 31, 2014. \n \n The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, associated with income tax matters as part of the income tax provision and includes accrued interest and penalties with the related income tax liability in the consolidated balance sheet. \n \n F-18 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Marketing \n \n Marketing expenses consist primarily of targeted online marketing costs, such as search engine marketing, and offline marketing expenses, such as television advertising. Marketing expenses also include employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for our employees involved in marketing, public relations and communications activities. Marketing expenses are expensed as incurred. \n \n Net (Loss) Income Per Share \n \n The Company follows the two-class method when computing net (loss) income per share as the Company has issued shares that meet the definition of participating securities. The two-class method determines net (loss) income per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. \n \n The Company\u0092s convertible preferred stock contractually entitles the holders of such shares to participate in dividends, but does not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in losses of the Company. Accordingly, the two-class method does not apply for periods in which the Company reports a net loss or a net loss attributable to common stockholders resulting from dividends, accretion or modifications to its convertible preferred stock. \n \n Basic net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders is computed by adjusting net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders to reallocate undistributed earnings based on the potential impact of dilutive securities, including outstanding common stock options, convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock and convertible preferred stock. \n \n Diluted net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the diluted net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares, including potential dilutive common shares assuming the dilutive effect of outstanding common stock options, convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock and convertible preferred stock. For periods in which the Company has reported net losses, diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, because dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. \n \n F-19 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Segment Data \n \n The Company identifies operating segments as components of an entity for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions regarding resource allocation and performance assessment. The Company defines the term \u0093chief operating decision maker\u0094 to be its chief executive officer. The Company has determined it operates in one operating segment and one reportable segment, as its chief operating decision maker reviews financial information presented on only a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. \n \n Foreign Currency \n \n The Company has determined that the functional currency for each of its foreign operations is the local currency in which the operation is located. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange rates during the period. Foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected in stockholders\u0092 equity as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in foreign exchange loss within other (expense) income in the statement of operations. \n \n Excess Tax Benefits from Exercise of Stock Options \n \n The Company uses the \u0093with and without\u0094 approach in determining the order in which tax attributes are utilized. As a result, the Company recognizes a tax benefit from stock-based awards in additional paid-in capital only if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to the Company have been utilized. When tax deductions from stock-based awards are less than the cumulative book compensation expense, the tax effect of the resulting difference (\u0093shortfall\u0094) is charged first to additional paid-in capital, to the extent of the Company\u0092s pool of windfall tax benefits, with any remainder recognized in income tax expense. The Company determined that it had a sufficient windfall pool available through December 31, 2014 to absorb any shortfalls. \n \n Recent Accounting Pronouncements \n \n Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (\u0093JOBS Act\u0094), the Company meets the definition of an emerging growth company. The Company has irrevocably elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. \n \n In March 2013, the FASB issued new accounting guidance clarifying the accounting for the release of cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a company either sells a part or all of its \n \n F-20 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2013. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements. \n \n In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. Among other things, the updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. \n \n In August 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update under which management will be required to assess an entity\u0092s ability to continue as a going concern and provide related disclosures in certain circumstances. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and for annual and interim periods thereafter. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Company\u0092s financial statements or disclosures. \n \n Note 2\u0097Business Combinations \n \n In April 2012, the Company acquired the assets of Trunkt LLC for a purchase price of $200,000, plus two additional contingent payments of $100,000 that were tied to continued employment with the Company and were recognized as post-acquisition compensation expense and paid out by the Company in 2013. Acquired assets consisted of customer information, domain access rights, certain web services and a trademark. The purchase price was allocated to the acquired technology intangible assets in the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements. This acquisition did not have any measureable impact on consolidated revenue or (loss) income from operations. \n \n In January 2013, the Company acquired the assets of The Lascaux Company, Inc., owners of the \u0093Mixel\u0094 iOS mobile application, for a purchase price of $750,000, which consisted of $675,000 paid on the closing date and $75,000 due on the first anniversary of the closing date, subject to indemnification provisions. In connection with the acquisition, the Company granted options to purchase 362,320 shares of common stock to certain key employees of the acquired company. Acquired assets consisted of the Mixel iOS mobile application and related source code and domain name registration. The purchase price was allocated between acquired technology intangible assets and goodwill in the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements. This acquisition did not have any measureable impact on consolidated revenue or (loss) income from operations. \n \n F-21 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n On April 29, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of Jarvis Labs, Inc., owners of the \u0093Grand St.\u0094 online technology marketplace. Total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $3.2 million, consisting of $1.0 million in cash and 425,104 shares of the Company\u0092s common stock with a fair value of $2.2 million on the acquisition date. Additionally, the Company issued 657,160 shares of common stock, with a fair value of $3.4 million on the acquisition date, which are tied to continued employment with the Company and are being accounted for as post-acquisition stock-based compensation expense over the three-year vesting period. Because the Company is not publicly traded, the Company utilizes equity valuations based on comparable publicly-traded companies, discounted cash flows, an analysis of the Company\u0092s enterprise value and any other factors deemed relevant in estimating the fair value of its common stock for purposes of calculating the fair value of the purchase price. \n \n The following table summarizes the components of the Grand St. purchase price and the allocation of the purchase price at fair value (in thousands): \n \n Cash paid $ 1,040 Common shares 2,202 Total purchase consideration $ 3,242 Working capital $ 85 Developed technology 2,000 Customer relationships 600 Trademarks 200 Goodwill 991 Deferred tax liability (634) Net assets acquired $ 3,242 \n \n Included in working capital is approximately $0.1 million of cash acquired. \n \n The amounts allocated to developed technology, customer relationships and trademark (the acquired intangible assets) total $2.8 million. The fair value assigned to developed technology was determined primarily using the cost approach, which estimates the cost to reproduce the asset, adjusted for loss due to functional and economic obsolescence. The fair value of the Company\u0092s customer relationships was determined primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management. The fair value assigned to trademark was determined using the relief from royalty method, where the owner of the asset realizes a benefit from owning the intangible asset rather than paying a rental or royalty rate for use of the asset. The acquired identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over three years, which approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized. None of the goodwill recorded in the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes. \n \n F-22 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n On June 18, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of Incubart SAS, a societe par actions simplifiee organized under the laws of France, which operates the online marketplace A Little Market (\u0093ALM\u0094). Total consideration for the acquisition was $30.8 million, consisting of $5.3 million in cash, of which $4.2 million was paid on the closing date and $0.3 million is due to be paid on March 31, 2015 and $0.8 million is due to be paid on February 16, 2016, and 4,879,693 shares of the Company\u0092s common stock with a fair value of $25.5 million on the acquisition date. Because the Company is not publicly traded, the Company utilizes equity valuations based on comparable publicly-traded companies, discounted cash flows, an analysis of the Company\u0092s enterprise value and any other factors deemed relevant in estimating the fair value of its common stock for purposes of calculating the fair value of the purchase price. The terms of the purchase agreement provide for the sale of put options to certain of the former shareholders of ALM. The put options enable the holders of the options to sell up to all of their shares back to the Company, subject to certain vesting and restrictions, at fair value, but not to exceed $4.13 per share and not less than $2.00 per share. The put right terminates with respect to a share on the earlier of one year from when such share is vested or the liquidation date, as defined in the agreement containing the put option. The holders of the options paid an aggregate of $0.1 million cash to the Company at the date of acquisition and the Company recorded a $0.1 million liability for the fair value of the put options at that time. Additionally, the Company issued 1,198,995 shares of common stock, with a fair value of $6.3 million on the acquisition date, which are tied to continued employment with the Company and are being accounted for as post-acquisition stock-based compensation expense over the three-year vesting period. Since the put options relate in part to these shares, these restricted shares will be recorded as liability-classified stock awards as earned. \n \n The following table summarizes the components of the purchase price at fair value and the allocation of the purchase price at fair value (in thousands): \n \n Cash paid $ 5,290 Common shares 25,521 Total purchase consideration $ 30,811 Working capital $ 625 Property and equipment and other assets 95 Developed technology 1,636 Customer relationships 1,693 Trademarks 775 Goodwill 27,309 Deferred tax liability (757) Other long-term liabilities (565) Net assets acquired $ 30,811 \n \n Included in working capital is approximately $0.5 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired. \n \n F-23 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n The amount allocated to developed technology, customer relationships and trademark (the acquired intangible assets) total $4.1 million. The fair value assigned to developed technology was determined primarily by using the cost approach, which estimates the cost to reproduce the asset, adjusted for loss due to functional and economic obsolescence. The fair value of the Company\u0092s customer relationships was determined primarily by using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management. The fair value assigned to trademark was determined using the relief from royalty method, where the owner of the asset realizes a benefit from owning the intangible asset rather than paying a rental or royalty rate for use of the asset. The acquired identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over three years, which approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized. Goodwill of $27.3 million, none of which is deductible for tax purposes, was recorded in connection with the ALM acquisition, which is primarily attributed to synergies arising from the acquisition and the value of the acquired workforce. \n \n The Company incurred approximately $2.1 million in acquisition-related costs, included in general and administrative expenses. These acquisitions increased revenue by $1.8 million and contributed $5.7 million to the Company\u0092s consolidated net loss in the year ended December 31, 2014. The impact to net loss was primarily due to amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation associated with the acquisitions. \n \n The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined operating results of the Company, Grand St. and ALM as if each acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2013. The unaudited pro forma financial information includes the accounting effects of the business combinations, including adjustments to the amortization of intangible assets and professional fees associated with the acquisition. The unaudited pro forma information does not necessarily reflect the actual results that would have been achieved, nor is it necessarily indicative of our future consolidated results. \n \n The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented in the table below for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014 (in thousands except per share amounts): \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2013 2014 Revenue $ 127,838 $ 197,395 Net loss (7,533) (15,403) Basic net loss per share (0.11) (0.19) Diluted net loss per share (0.11) (0.19) \n \n F-24 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Note 3\u0097Marketable Securities \n \n Short-term investments consist of marketable securities that are available-for-sale.

When evaluating investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and the Company\u0092s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value. The Company evaluates fair values for each individual security in the investment portfolio. \n \n Note 4\u0097Property and Equipment \n \n Property and equipment consisted of the following as of the dates indicated (in thousands): \n \n As of \n \n December 31, Estimated useful lives 2013 2014 Computer equipment 3 years $ 13,837 $ 16,876 Furniture and equipment 4 years 1,630 1,987 Software 1 - 3 years 2,380 1,146 Leasehold improvements Shorter of life of asset or lease term 2,706 3,134 Construction in progress(1) Not applicable \u0097 51,796 Website development 3 years 23,897 31,156 44,450 106,095 Less: Accumulated depreciation and amortization 21,343 30,557 $ 23,107 $ 75,538 \n \n (1) The Company capitalizes construction in progress and records a corresponding long-term liability for build-to-suit lease arrangements where it is considered the owner, for accounting purposes, during the construction period. \n \n Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $7.7 million, $12.1 million and $15.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively, which includes amortization expense for equipment acquired under capital leases of $1.5 million, $1.2 million and \n \n F-25 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.

All of these warrants were originally issued in connection with previous lines of credit and were fair valued on the date of issuance, and the fair value amount was recognized as debt issuance costs and amortized to interest expense over the original life of the line of credit. As these warrants are exercisable into shares of Preferred stock, which include certain redemption rights that are outside of the control the Company, in accordance with ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, the warrants are accounted for as liabilities and are revalued at each balance sheet date. The warrants were fully vested at issuance. \n \n F-27 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n The Company determined the fair value of the convertible preferred stock warrants utilizing the Black-Scholes model with the following weighted-average assumptions: \n \n Series C December 31, 2012 2013 2014 Risk-free interest rate 0.7% 1.3% 1.1% Expected term (in years) 5.0 4.0 3.0 Estimated dividend yield 0% 0% 0% Weighted-average estimated volatility 40.0% 41.0% 43.1% Fair value (in thousands) $ 319 $ 442 $ 579 Series D December 31, 2012 2013 2014 Risk-free interest rate 0.3% 0.3% 0.5% Expected term (in years) 2.5 1.5 0.5 Estimated dividend yield 0% 0% 0% Weighted-average estimated volatility 39.0% 36.0% 38.9% Fair value (in thousands) $ 597 $ 859 $ 1,156 Series E December 31, 2012 2013 2014 Risk-free interest rate 0.7% 1.3% 1.1% Expected term (in years) 5.0 4.0 3.0 Estimated dividend yield 0% 0% 0% Weighted-average estimated volatility 39.0% 41.0% 43.1% Fair value (in thousands) $ 93 $ 127 $ 185 \n \n During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of $0.7 million, $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively, from the remeasurement of the warrants to fair value. \n \n In June 2012, the Company issued 5,056 shares of Series C preferred stock to convert 5,481 warrants at an exercise price of $2.67 per share. The fair market value of a share of common stock at the time of exercise was $3.45. The warrant holder exercised the right to convert this warrant in a cashless transaction and 425 shares were forfeited to the Company as payment of the exercise price. The Company revalued the warrant at the time of exercise and reclassified approximately $0.2 million in warrant liability to Series C preferred stock. \n \n F-28 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Note 7\u0097Debt \n \n Credit Agreement \n \n In May 2014, the Company entered into a $35.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to a Revolving Credit and Guaranty Agreement with several lenders (the \u0093Credit Agreement\u0094). The Credit Agreement will mature in May 2019. The Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sublimit of $10.0 million and a swingline loan sublimit of $15.0 million. \n \n Borrowings under the Credit Agreement (other than swingline loans) bear interest, at the Company\u0092s option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) an adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, in each case plus a margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.25% or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.25%. Swingline loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at the same base rate (plus the margin applicable to borrowings bearing interest at the base rate). These margins are determined based on the total leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. The Company is also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including an unused commitment fee and fees associated with letters of credit. The Credit Agreement also permits the Company, in certain circumstances, to request an increase in the facility by an amount of up to $50.0 million (and in minimum amounts of $10.0 million) at the same maturity, pricing and other terms. \n \n The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries and customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the Company and its restricted subsidiaries. The negative covenants include restrictions on, among other things, indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, transactions with affiliates and dividends and other distributions. These restrictions do not prohibit a subsidiary of the Company from making pro rata payments to the Company or any other person that owns an equity interest in such subsidiary. The Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain a total leverage ratio (defined as net debt to adjusted EBITDA) not to exceed 3.50 to 1.00. \n \n The Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including a change in control and a cross-default on the Company\u0092s material indebtedness. The Company\u0092s obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company and its subsidiaries\u0092 assets, and its obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of the Company\u0092s subsidiaries. \n \n At December 31, 2014, the Company did not have any borrowings under the Credit Agreement. In January 2015, the Company implemented a revised corporate structure to more closely align its structure with its global operations and future expansion plans outside the United States. The amendment to the Credit \n \n F-29 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Agreement described below includes a waiver with respect to the Company\u0092s compliance with certain restrictions in the Credit Agreement, to the extent that actions taken to implement its revised corporate structure could be construed as breaches or defaults under the Credit Agreement. \n \n Subsequent Event \n \n In March 2015, the Company amended the Credit Agreement (the \u0093Amended Credit Agreement\u0094) to increase the senior secured revolving credit facility to $50.0 million. The Amended Credit Agreement contains the same pricing covenants and other material terms as the Credit Agreement. \n \n Facility Financing Obligation \n \n As a result of the nature of and the Company\u0092s involvement in the renovations during the construction period of the newly leased office space in Brooklyn, NY, it is considered to be the owner, for accounting purposes only, of the construction project and is required to capitalize the fair value of the building as well as the construction costs incurred by the landlord on its consolidated balance sheet (\u0093build-to-suit accounting\u0094). Under the build-to-suit accounting guidance, through December 31, 2014 the Company has recorded a facility financing obligation of $50.3 million, equal to the fair market value of the assets received from the landlord as of the lease signing date in May 2014 and the estimated fair value of the subsequent construction costs incurred by the landlord through December 31, 2014. \n \n Note 8\u0097Stockholders\u0092 Equity \n \n At December 31, 2013 and 2014, the authorized capital stock of the Company consisted of 205,000,000 and 240,000,000 shares of common stock, respectively, and 21,165,473 shares of convertible preferred stock. The convertible preferred stock, with the exclusion of Series 1 preferred stock, is referred to as \u0093senior preferred stock.\u0094 \n \n Common Stock \n \n At December 31, 2012, there were 65,461,422 and 64,163,832 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2013, there were 66,165,965 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. At December 31, 2014, there were 88,361,973 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share. Holders of common stock are not entitled to receive dividends unless declared by the board of directors. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of \n \n F-30 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n the holders of common stock are subject to and qualified by the rights and preferences of the holders of convertible preferred stock. No dividends have been declared through December 31, 2014. The common stock has a $0.001 par value. \n \n Convertible Preferred Stock \n \n In May 2012, the Company entered into the Series F Stock Purchase Agreement with several investors to sell 11,594,203 shares of Series F preferred stock at $3.45 per share for an aggregate value of $40.0 million. The Company recorded stock issuance costs of approximately $0.2 million as additional paid-in-capital in connection with the Series F preferred stock financing. \n \n At December 31, 2013 and 2014, the Company\u0092s outstanding convertible preferred stock consisted of the following (in thousands, except share data): \n \n Shares \n \n Authorized Shares \n \n Outstanding Carrying \n \n Values Series A and A-1 preferred stock 2,363,786 2,363,786 $ 808 Series B preferred stock 1,128,431 1,128,425 865 Series C preferred stock 1,234,084 1,222,282 3,361 Series D and D-1 preferred stock 4,240,120 4,215,610 27,870 Series E preferred stock 401,450 396,727 6,201 Series 1 preferred stock 203,399 203,399 1,322 Series F preferred stock 11,594,203 11,594,203 39,785 Total convertible preferred stock 21,165,473 21,124,432 $ 80,212 \n \n The rights and preferences of the convertible preferred stock are as follows: \n \n Voting Rights. Each holder of convertible preferred stock is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock into which such holder\u0092s shares of convertible preferred stock are then convertible. Except as provided by law or the Company\u0092s Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of the convertible preferred stock and common stock vote together as a single class. The holders of preferred stock are entitled to voting rights for the election of board of director members as follows: Series A-1, Series B and Series C vote together as a single class to elect one director, Series D and Series D-1 vote as a single class to elect one director and Series E votes to elect one director. Additionally, the holders of common stock elect one director. All remaining directors are elected by the holders of preferred stock and common stock voting together as a single class. \n \n Dividends. The holders of the convertible preferred stock are entitled, when, as and if declared by the board of directors, and prior and in preference to common stock, to receive non-cumulative dividends at a rate of 8% of the original purchase price per share (listed in the table below). Payment of any dividends to the holders of the convertible preferred stock shall be made on a pro rata, pari passu basis in proportion to the \n \n F-31 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n dividend rates for each series of convertible preferred stock. The right to receive dividends on shares of convertible preferred stock shall not be cumulative, and no right to such dividends shall accrue to holders of cumulative preferred stock by reason of the fact that dividends on said shares are not declared or paid in any calendar year. \n \n Liquidation. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, the holders of the senior preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution to the holders of the Series 1 preferred stock and common stock, an amount per share equal to the sum of the liquidation preference (presented below) and all declared but unpaid dividends (if any). If amounts available to be distributed are insufficient to pay the liquidation preferences of the senior preferred stock in full, then the entire assets of the Company legally available for distribution shall be distributed to the holders of the senior preferred stock ratably in proportion to the preferential amount each holder would have otherwise been entitled to receive. After payment of the liquidation preferences to the senior preferred stock, if assets remain available for distribution to the Company\u0092s stockholders, the holders of Series 1 preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution to the holders of common stock, an amount per share equal to the sum of the liquidation preference applicable to the Series 1 preferred stock and all declared but unpaid dividends (if any). If the remaining amounts available to be distributed are insufficient to pay the liquidation preferences of the Series 1 preferred stock in full, then the entire assets of the Company legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably in proportion to the preferential amount each holder would have otherwise been entitled to receive. After payment of the liquidation preferences to the convertible preferred stock, all remaining assets shall be distributed to the holders of the common stock of the Company in proportion to the number of shares of common stock held by them. \n \n The liquidation preference provisions of the convertible preferred stock are considered contingent redemption provisions because there are certain elements that are not solely within the control of the Company, such as a change in control of the Company. Accordingly, the Company has presented the convertible preferred stock within the mezzanine portion of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. \n \n F-32 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Conversion. Each outstanding share of convertible preferred stock is convertible, at the holder\u0092s option or automatically upon certain events as described below, into shares of common stock at a conversion rate determined by dividing the original issue price for such share by the then Conversion Price for such share. The original issue price, conversion price and liquidation preference price of each series of preferred stock are as follows: \n \n Price Per Share Original Issue \n \n Price Conversion \n \n Price Liquidation \n \n Preference Series A preferred stock $ 0.2429 $ 0.02429 $ 0.2429 Series A-1 preferred stock 0.3915 0.03915 0.3915 Series B preferred stock 0.80 0.080 0.80 Series C preferred stock 2.67 0.267 2.67 Series D preferred stock 6.63 0.663 6.63 Series D-1 preferred stock 6.63 0.663 6.63 Series E preferred stock 15.88 1.588 15.88 Series 1 preferred stock 6.45 0.645 6.45 Series F preferred stock 3.45 3.45 3.45 \n \n The conversion price is subject to adjustment in the event of certain anti-dilutive issuances of shares of common stock. The conversion price per share in the table above reflects the adjustment for the 10-for-1 stock split of the Company\u0092s common stock effective in May 2011. \n \n Each share of convertible preferred stock will convert into shares of common stock at its then effective conversion rate upon the earlier of (A) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, with gross proceeds to the Company of not less than $30 million, or (B) upon receipt by the Company of a written request for such conversion from the holders of not less than a majority of the convertible preferred stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis. No shares of Series F preferred stock shall be converted into shares of common stock unless either (i) such conversion is in connection with a public offering where the price per share is equal to or greater than $5.18, or (ii) the holders of a majority of the Series F preferred stock, voting as a separate class, otherwise consent to such conversion. \n \n Redemption. The convertible preferred stock is not redeemable at the option of the holder. \n \n Tender Offers \n \n In connection with the May 2012 Series F Preferred Stock financing, the Series F investors participated in a tender offer to purchase up to an aggregate of 12,753,623 shares of common stock and preferred stock (on an as-converted basis) at a price of $3.45 per share (on an as-converted basis) from the Company\u0092s employees and existing stockholders with the maximum aggregate offer price of up to $44.0 million. The terms of the tender offer were further limited to a maximum of 30% of a participant\u0092s fully-vested stock and options and \n \n F-33 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n warrants to purchase stock. The tender offer was made on May 15, 2012 and expired on July 6, 2012. At the close of the transaction, the Company recorded approximately $0.9 million as compensation expense related to the excess of the selling price per share paid to the Company\u0092s employees and former employees over the fair value of the tendered shares, and approximately $0.3 million as a deemed dividend in relation to the excess of the selling price per share paid to existing investors over the fair value of the shares tendered. \n \n On January 13, 2014, certain investors participated in a tender offer to purchase up to an aggregate of 14,000,000 shares of common stock and preferred stock (on an as-converted basis) at a price of $5.30 per share (on an as-converted basis) from the Company\u0092s employees and existing stockholders with the maximum aggregate offer price of up to $74.2 million. The terms of the tender offer were limited to a maximum of one-half of an employee\u0092s fully-vested stock and options and warrants to purchase stock and a minimum of one-half of a former employee\u0092s or non-employee\u0092s fully-vested stock and options and warrants to purchase stock. At the close of the transaction, 6,308,440 shares were tendered for a total price of $33.4 million. \n \n Common Stock Issuances \n \n In April 2014, the Company issued 6,603,774 shares of common stock to certain investors at $5.30 per share for an aggregate value of $35.0 million. \n \n Additionally, the Company issued a total of 7,160,952 shares of common stock in connection with the acquisitions of Grand St. and ALM, of which 5,304,797 shares with an aggregate fair value of $27.7 million on the applicable acquisition dates are included in the Company\u0092s purchase price and 1,856,155 shares with an aggregate fair value of $9.7 million on the applicable acquisition dates are tied to continued employment with the Company and are being accounted for as post-acquisition compensation expense. \n \n Stock Repurchases \n \n In 2012, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of 20,000 shares of outstanding common stock at a cost of $0.1 million, 6 shares of outstanding Series B preferred stock at a cost of $297, and 4 shares of outstanding Series C preferred stock at a cost of $126. These repurchased shares were retired and removed from the number of shares issued in the consolidated balance sheet. \n \n In 2013, the board of directors authorized the repurchase and retirement of 47,000 shares of outstanding common stock at a cost of $0.2 million. The repurchased shares were retired and have been removed from both the issued and outstanding number of shares in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of stockholders\u0092 equity. \n \n F-34 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Secondary Transactions \n \n In the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded $0.5 million as compensation expense related to the excess of the selling price per share paid to certain of the Company\u0092s former employees over the fair value of the shares sold to an investor by these former employees in secondary transactions. \n \n Note 9\u0097Stock-based Compensation \n \n The Company maintains the 2006 Stock Plan (the \u0093Stock Plan\u0094). Under the Stock Plan, incentive and nonqualified stock options or rights to purchase common stock may be granted to eligible participants. Options are generally granted for a term of 10 years. Options granted under the Stock Plan generally vest 25% after the first year of service and ratably each month over the remaining 36-month period contingent on continued employment with the Company on each vesting date. At December 31, 2013 and 2014, 43,432,935 and 48,505,935 shares were authorized under the Stock Plan, respectively, and 3,063,945 and 3,036,004 shares were available for future grant, respectively. \n \n The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Since the Company is not publicly traded, the Company utilizes equity valuations based on comparable publicly-traded companies, discounted free cash flows, an analysis of the Company\u0092s enterprise value and any other factors deemed relevant in estimating the fair value of its common stock. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from market comparisons of certain publicly traded companies and other factors. The expected term of stock options granted has been determined using the simplified method, which uses the midpoint between the vesting date and the contractual term. The requisite service period is generally four years from the date of grant. \n \n The fair value of options granted in each year using the Black-Scholes pricing model has been based on the following assumptions: \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 2013 2014 Volatility 42.7% - 43.9% 45.7% - 50.3% 43.0% - 49.0% Risk-free interest rate 0.7% - 1.1% 0.9% - 1.9% 1.7% - 2.1% Expected term (in years) 5.12 - 6.08 5.48 - 6.08 5.46 - 6.08 Dividend rate \u0097% \u0097% \u0097% \n \n F-35 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n The following table summarizes the activity for the Company\u0092s options: \n \n Shares Weighted-Average \n \n Exercise Price Weighted-Average \n \n Remaining Contract \n \n Term (in years) Aggregate \n \n Intrinsic Value Outstanding at January 1, 2012 25,037,740 $ 0.73 Granted 7,717,321 2.33 Exercised (5,889,452) 0.79 Forfeited/Cancelled (2,993,224) 1.15 Outstanding at December 31, 2012 23,872,385 1.18 Granted 6,152,210 2.76 Exercised (2,049,133) 0.65 Forfeited/Cancelled (1,594,527) 1.90 Outstanding at December 31, 2013 26,380,935 1.55 7.42 Granted 6,413,435 5.14 Exercised (8,431,282) 0.94 Forfeited/Cancelled (1,312,494) 3.29 Outstanding at December 31, 2014 23,050,594 2.67 7.57 $ 134,386,069 Total exercisable at December 31, 2014 11,212,671 1.44 6.32 79,212,034 Total vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2014 21,663,138 2.57 7.48 128,508,325 \n \n The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 was $0.97, $1.30 and $2.43, respectively.

As of December 31, 2014, the Company had approximately $6.9 million and $4.3 million of federal and preapportionment New York City NOL carryforwards, respectively, as well as immaterial amounts of NOLs in other states. The federal NOLs will begin to expire in 2031 if unused. The New York City NOLs will expire in 2033 if unused. All of the federal NOLs and most of the other NOL carryforwards are attributable to excess tax deductions from stock option exercises. The benefit of these NOLs will be credited to additional paid in capital when the NOLs are utilized. \n \n As of December 31, 2013 and 2014, the Company had approximately $0.2 million of federal alternative minimum tax credits, which may be carried forward indefinitely. \n \n The utilization of the Company\u0092s NOL carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code due to a change of ownership. However, the Company does not believe such annual limitation will impact its realization of the NOL carryforwards. \n \n The Company assesses the likelihood of its ability to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction by evaluating all relevant positive and negative evidence. To the extent the Company determines that some or all of its deferred tax assets are not more likely than not to be realized, it establishes a valuation allowance. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company determined that the existence of a three-year cumulative loss incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions, inclusive of 2014, constituted sufficiently strong negative evidence to warrant the establishment of a valuation allowance. As a result, a valuation allowance of $1.9 million as of December 31, 2014 has been recorded against certain of the Company\u0092s deferred tax assets. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable is $7.2 million. \n \n The following table summarizes the valuation allowance activity for the periods indicated (in thousands): \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 2013 2014 Balance as of the beginning of period $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ \u0097 Additions charged to expense \u0097 \u0097 3,915 Deletions credited to expense \u0097 \u0097 (1,850 ) Currency translation \u0097 \u0097 (173 ) Balance as of the end of period $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ 1,892 \n \n F-39 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n The Company has not recorded deferred income taxes with respect to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are expected to remain reinvested indefinitely. Upon distribution as dividends or otherwise, such amounts would be subject to taxation in the U.S. However, U.S. tax liabilities would be offset, in whole or part, by allowable tax credits with respect to income taxes previously paid to foreign jurisdictions. The amount of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries at December 31, 2014, as well as the related deferred income tax, if any, is not material. \n \n As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013, the Company had no unrecognized income tax benefits. As of December 31, 2014 the Company had unrecognized income tax benefits of $0.4 million. \n \n The following table summarizes the unrecognized tax benefit activity for the periods indicated (in thousands): \n \n As of December 31, 2012 2013 2014 Balance as of the beginning of period $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ \u0097 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year \u0097 \u0097 398 Additions for tax positions of prior years \u0097 \u0097 \u0097 Reductions for tax provisions of prior years \u0097 \u0097 \u0097 Settlements \u0097 \u0097 \u0097 Balance as of the end of period $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ 398 \n \n The Company files tax returns in the United States, New York and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. \n \n Generally, tax returns filed for 2011 and later years remain open to examination.

The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure the investments fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the investment. Investments recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet are categorized based on the inputs to valuation techniques as follows: \n \n Level 1\u0097These are investments where values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in an active market that the Company has the ability to access. \n \n Level 2\u0097These are investments where values are based on quoted market prices in markets that are not active or model derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets. \n \n Level 3\u0097These are liabilities where values are derived from techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable. \n \n The following are the major categories of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2013 and 2014 using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1), significant other observable inputs (Level 2) and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in

The ePlus Line allows the Company to order equipment from any approved vendor. ePlus purchases the equipment on behalf of the Company and leases it back to the Company. The leases have a 36-month term and are payable in equal monthly installments with a buy-out option of $1 or fair market value at the end of the lease term depending on the equipment.

The leases have a 36-month term, interest rate of 8.25%, and are payable in equal monthly installments. The Company stopped buying equipment under the TriplePoint Line in June 2012 and is paying off the remaining lease obligations in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement. At December 31, 2014, the Company had leased approximately $0.4 million of computer equipment using the TriplePoint Line. \n \n In connection with the execution of the TriplePoint Line, the Company issued TriplePoint a warrant to purchase 4,723 shares of Series E Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $15.88 per share (the \u0093TriplePoint Series E Warrant\u0094). The TriplePoint Series E Warrant was valued at $43,000 on the date of issuance, which \n \n F-45 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n the Company recognized as debt issuance cost and amortized over 36 months from the date of issuance. The warrant was fully vested at issuance. \n \n For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, the accompanying consolidated statement of operations includes charges of approximately $0.4 million, $0.2 million and $0.4 million for interest expense, respectively, related to the equipment leased using the TriplePoint Line and ePlus Lines. \n \n Operating Leases \n \n In 2012, the Company amended its existing lease for office space in Brooklyn, NY to extend its expiration to 2016. The portion of deferred rent liability related to the prior lease of approximately $0.3 million is being amortized and recorded as rent expense over the new lease term. During 2012, the Company also entered into a new lease for office space in San Francisco, CA expiring in 2017. In 2014, the Company entered into a new lease for office space in Dublin, Ireland expiring in 2024. Rent expense for these operating leases is recognized over the term of each respective lease on a straight-line basis. In addition, the Company leases other office facilities under shorter terms and cancellable leases. \n \n Total rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 was $1.7 million, $2.4 million and $3.6 million, respectively. \n \n Build-to-Suit Lease \n \n In May 2014, the Company entered into a 10-year lease agreement for approximately 199,000 rentable square feet of office space in Brooklyn, NY for the Company\u0092s new headquarters, which lease is expected to commence in 2015. Of the total new office space, approximately 172,000 rentable square feet is being accounted for as a build-to-suit lease and approximately 27,000 rentable square feet located in an adjacent building is being accounted for as an operating lease. In connection with the lease agreement, the Company established a $5.3 million collateral account, reflected in the restricted cash balance on the consolidated balance sheet. \n \n F-46 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n The following table represents the Company\u0092s commitments under its current capital, operating, and build-to-suit lease agreements as of December 31, 2014 (in thousands): \n \n Capital Lease \n \n Obligations Operating \n \n Leases Build-to-Suit \n \n Lease Periods ending 2015 $ 2,288 $ 3,870 $ \u0097 2016 2,250 854 529 2017 1,257 1,845 9,155 2018 \u0097 1,756 9,394 2019 \u0097 1,767 9,464 Thereafter \u0097 10,952 61,772 Total minimum payments required $ 5,795 $ 21,044 $ 90,314 Amounts representing interest 892 Present value of net minimum payments 4,903 Current maturities 1,755 Long-term payment obligations $ 3,148 \n \n Tax Contingencies \n \n The Company had a reserve of $2.5 million and $3.5 million at December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, for certain non-income tax obligations, representing management\u0092s best estimate of its liability. In addition, the Company could be subject to examination in various jurisdictions related to income and non-income tax matters. The resolution of these types of matters, giving recognition to the recorded reserve, could have an adverse impact on the Company\u0092s business. \n \n Legal Proceedings \n \n From time to time in the normal course of business, various claims and litigation have been asserted or commenced against the Company. Due to uncertainties inherent in litigation and other claims, the Company can give no assurance that it will prevail in any such matters, which could subject the Company to significant liability for damages. Any claims or litigation, regardless of their success, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u0092s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period the claims or litigation are resolved. As of December 31, 2014, the Company does not believe that there are any material litigation exposures. \n \n Note 15\u0097Revisions to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company determined that its prior years\u0092 annual consolidated financial statements included an understatement in certain non-income tax-related expenses. This understatement \n \n F-47 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n impacts the Company\u0092s consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, balance sheets and statements of cash flows.

Based on quantitative and qualitative factors, the Company determined that the errors were not material to any previously issued annual consolidated financial statements. The Company determined that the correction of the cumulative amounts of the errors would be material to the consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2014 and, as such, has revised its previously issued consolidated financial statements for 2012 and 2013. The adjustments related to years prior to 2012 are reflected as a $0.1 million adjustment to beginning accumulated deficit for fiscal year 2012.

The errors impact the Company\u0092s consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), balance sheets and statements of cash flows in each period. The Company assessed the effect of the errors on prior periods\u0092 financial statements in accordance with SAB No. 99\u0097Materiality and SAB No. 108\u0097Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements and, based on quantitative and qualitative factors, determined that the errors, in combination with the understatement of non-income tax-related expenses described in Note 15, were material to the consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2014, the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014. As such, the Company has restated its interim \n \n F-49 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n consolidated financial statements for these periods.

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Jarvis Labs, Inc., which comprise the balance sheets as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, and the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in convertible preferred stock and stockholders\u0092 deficit and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the period from June 11, 2012 (inception) to December 31, 2012. \n \n Management\u0092s Responsibility for the Financial Statements \n \n Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \n \n Auditor\u0092s Responsibility \n \n Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. \n \n An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Company\u0092s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u0092s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. \n \n F-54 \n \n Opinion \n \n In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Jarvis Labs, Inc. at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2013 and for the period from June 11, 2012 (inception) to December 31, 2012 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n \n /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n \n New York, New York \n \n November 3, 2014 \n \n F-55 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Balance Sheets \n \n As of \n \n December 31, \n \n 2012 As of \n

Organization \n \n Organization and Nature of Business \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. (the \u0093Company\u0094) was incorporated in the state of Delaware on June 11, 2012 (inception). The Company owns and operates Grandst.com, a website that provides a marketplace for creative new technology and merchandise. The Company generates revenue through direct retail sales. The Company is based in New York, NY and operates in the United States. \n \n Unaudited Interim Financial Information \n \n The accompanying balance sheet as of March 31, 2014, the related statements of operations, comprehensive loss and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2014, and the statement of changes in convertible preferred stock and stockholders\u0092 deficit for the three months ended March 31, 2014 are unaudited. The unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary to state fairly the Company\u0092s financial position as of March 31, 2014 and results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2014. The financial data and the other information disclosed in these notes to the financial statements related to these three-month periods are unaudited. \n \n Use of Estimates \n \n The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. The accounting estimates that require management\u0092s most difficult and subjective judgments include the useful life and recoverability of fixed assets, the fair value of options issued for services and the fair value of warrants. The Company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and revises when necessary. Actual results could differ from those estimates. \n \n Revenue Recognition \n \n The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the following four criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. \n \n F-60 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n The Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, the Company is the primary obligor in its sales to customers, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers and maintains inventory risk, and therefore revenue is recorded at the gross sales price. \n \n Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees. Product sales and shipping revenues, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers. \n \n Cost of Sales \n \n Cost of sales consists of the purchase price of products sold, inbound shipping and duty charges and credit card processing fees. Shipping charges to receive products from the Company\u0092s suppliers are included in the Company\u0092s inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to the Company\u0092s customers. \n \n Cash and Cash Equivalents \n \n The Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. \n \n Inventory \n \n The Company\u0092s inventory is comprised of finished goods and are valued at the lower of average cost or market, and are evaluated periodically for product obsolescence, excess balances and other indications of impairment in value. \n \n Property and Equipment \n \n Property and equipment consisting of office furniture, office and computer equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost. Property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term. \n \n Fair Value Measurement \n \n The Company\u0092s financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair value based on inputs and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, management considers the principal or most advantageous market in which \n \n F-61 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n the Company would transact, and also considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of non-performance. \n \n ASC Topic 820 further requires disclosures on the amount and reason for transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 fair value measurements. The standards also require disclosure of activities, including purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements within the Level 3 fair value measurements. The standards also clarify existing disclosure requirements on levels of disaggregation and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques. This pronouncement requires disclosure regarding the manner in which fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a three-tiered value hierarchy into which these assets and liabilities are grouped, based upon significant inputs as follows: \n \n Level 1\u0097Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \n \n Level 2\u0097Observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. \n \n Level 3\u0097Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within Level 3, the determination is based upon the lack of significance of the observable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, the fair value determination for Level 3 financial instruments may consider some observable market inputs. \n \n The lowest level of significant input determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. \n \n The following table reflects the activity for the Company\u0092s major classes of liabilities measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs: \n \n Total Fair \n \n Value at \n \n March 31, \n \n 2014 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Liabilities: Warrant liabilities $ 70,137 $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ 70,137 Total Liabilities $ 70,137 $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ 70,137 \n \n F-62 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n Total Fair \n \n Value at \n \n December 31, \n \n 2013 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Liabilities: Warrant liabilities $ 56,844 $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ 56,844 Total Liabilities $ 56,844 $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ 56,844 \n \n The following table reflects the activity for the Company\u0092s major classes of liabilities measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs: \n \n Liabilities: Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2013 Three Months Ended \n \n March 31, 2014 (Unaudited) Balance at beginning of period $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ 56,844 Level 3 liabilities acquired \u0097 46,098 \u0097 Level 3 liabilities settled \u0097 \u0097 \u0097 Unrealized loss on warrant liability \u0097 10,746 13,293 Included in earnings (unrealized) \u0097 \u0097 \u0097 Balance at end of period $ \u0097 $ 56,844 $ 70,137 \n \n Impairment of Long-lived Assets \n \n The Company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of long-lived assets may require revision, or that the remaining balance of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the long-lived asset group in measuring whether they are recoverable. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, a loss is recorded to the extent the asset group\u0092s carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value would typically be determined based upon the asset group\u0092s estimated discounted cash flows. No assets were determined to be impaired in the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013. \n \n Sales and Marketing \n \n Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of online and offline advertising costs, marketing materials and market research. Advertising costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. The advertising and promotion costs for 2012 and 2013 and for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2014 are $14,758, $217,558, $65,832 and $11,618 respectively. \n \n F-63 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n Product and Technology \n \n Product and technology expenses include facilities costs, technology compensation, stock based compensation and employee benefits, website hosting fees, software licensing costs and certain other allocated costs. \n \n General and Administrative \n \n General and administrative expenses include facilities costs, administrative charges, professional services fees and other general overhead costs. \n \n Stock-based Compensation \n \n The stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is amortized over the requisite service period for the award granted. \n \n Calculating stock-based compensation requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the stock-based awards and stock price volatility. The Company estimates the expected life of stock options granted based on the simplified method, which the Company believes is representative of future behavior. The Company estimates the volatility of the common stock on the date of grant based on the historic volatility of comparable companies in the industry. The Company selected the risk-free interest rate based on yields from United States Treasury zero-coupon issues for a term consistent with the expected life of the awards in effect at the time of grant. The Company estimates the expected forfeiture rate based on historical experience of the stock-based awards that are granted, exercised and canceled. \n \n The Company may, from time to time, grant stock options to non-employees. For non-employee stock options, the Company calculates the fair value of the award on the date of grant in the same manner as employee awards, however the unvested portion of the awards are revalued at the end of each reporting period and the pro-rata compensation expense is adjusted accordingly until such time the non-employee award is fully vested. At the time, the total compensation recognized to date shall equal the fair value of the award as calculated on the measurement date, which is the date at which the award recipient\u0092s performance is complete. \n \n Concentrations of Credit Risk \n \n Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. At times, such amounts may exceed the limits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \n \n F-64 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n The Company\u0092s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, loans receivable, accounts payable, and loans payable. At December 31, 2012 and 2013 and for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2014 the fair values of these instruments approximated their financial statement carrying amounts due to their relatively short-term nature. \n \n Income Taxes \n \n The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the related assets or liabilities for financial reporting, or according to the expected reversal dates of the specific temporary differences if not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. \n \n As of December 31, 2012 and 2013, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. Consequently, the Company has not recognized deferred income tax assets or liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. \n \n The Company\u0092s policy is to recognize interest and penalties expense, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The Company\u0092s uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities. As of December 31, 2013, the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions. \n \n F-65 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n 2.

Loan \n \n In October 2013, the Company entered into a Loan & Security Agreement with Venture Lending & Leasing, which made $500,000 available to the Company, all of which had been drawn down by the Company as of December 31, 2013. The facility is used for working capital purposes and bears interest at the rate of 11%. The agreement also contains restrictive covenants, including financial reporting requirements. The terms and conditions of the loan required repayments to start in April 2014 and shall be repaid in thirty (30) equal monthly payments of principal plus interest. Interest expense related to borrowings under the line of credit \n \n F-66 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n amounted to $13,349 and $12,125 during the year ended December 31, 2013 and the three months ended March 31, 2014, respectively. \n \n In connection with the borrowing, the Company issued warrants to purchase 92,242 and 92,243 shares of Series Seed preferred stock at exercise prices of $0.2918 per share. The warrants expire in October 2023. \n \n At issuance at October 22, 2013, at December 31, 2013 and at March 31, 2014, the warrants were valued at $46,098, $56,844 and $70,137, respectively, using an option pricing model. Key assumptions at October 22, 2013, December 31, 2013 and March 31, 2014 included a remaining term of 10 years, 9.8 years and 9.5 years, respectively, and a volatility of 83.74% based on a group of comparable companies and a risk-free interest rate of 2.54 - 2.98%. \n \n The Company recorded the initial value of the warrants as debt discount of the loan and recorded $4,610 as an expense in 2013 in connection with the debt discount amortization. In addition, $1,123 was incurred as debt issuance costs. As the warrants are exercisable into Series Seed preferred stock, which include certain redemption rights that are considered outside of the control of the Company, in accordance with ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, the warrants are accounted for as a liability and are revalued at each balance sheet date. The warrants were fully vested at issuance. \n \n The fair value of the loan was not materially different from its carrying value as interest rates have not changed materially since the loan was entered into. \n \n Annual maturities of the loan are as follows: \n \n Year Ending December 31, 2014 $ 135,908 2015 199,476 2016 164,616 500,000 Less : Unamortized discount (42,611) Plus : Interest accrued & unpaid 13,348 470,737 Less : Current maturities (135,908) Long term maturities $ 334,829 \n \n 5. Capital Stock \n \n As of December 31, 2012, the Company had been authorized to issue 20,039,629 shares of stock, at a par value of $0.00001 per share, consisting of 15,500,000 shares of common stock and 4,539,629 shares of preferred stock. The Company has 3,391,581 shares of preferred stock and 8,700,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. As of December 31, 2013 and March 31, 2014, the Company had been \n \n F-67 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n authorized to issue 20,416,641 shares of stock, at a par value of $0.00001 per share, consisting of 15,688,486 shares of common stock and 4,728,155 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2013, the Company has 4,419,683 shares of preferred stock and 8,700,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. \n \n Dividend \n \n The holders of shares of preferred stock shall be entitled to receive dividends, out of any assets legally available, prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend on the common stock of this corporation and at the applicable dividend rate, as declared by the board of directors. Such dividends shall not be cumulative. The holders of the outstanding preferred stock can waive any dividend preference that such holders shall be entitled to receive upon the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of preferred stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class and not as a separate series, and on an as-converted basis). The dividend rate is $0.0233 per annum for each share of the Series Seed preferred stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like). The Company has not declared or paid any dividends. \n \n Liquidation \n \n Unless the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of the preferred stock, voting together as a single class and on an as-converted basis, elect otherwise in writing, each of the following transactions shall be deemed a \u0093Liquidation Event\u0094: \n \n a. A merger or consolidation in which the Company is the constituent party or its subsidiary is the constituent party and the Company issues shares of its capital stock pursuant to such a merger or consolidation, with stipulations; \n \n b. The sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition, in one transaction or series of related transactions, by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company of all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, except where such sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition is to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company; \n \n In the event of any Liquidation Event, the holders of each share of preferred stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid, out of the available funds and assets, and prior and in preference to any payment or distribution to the holders of common stock, an amount per share equal to the liquidation amount for each such series of preferred stock plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon. \n \n F-68 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n Conversion \n \n The holders of the preferred stock have the right to convert at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessible shares of common stock as is determined by dividing the original issue price for the preferred stock by the conversion price at the time of the conversion. \n \n The preferred stock will be automatically converted into common stock upon a qualified initial public offering, which will result in at least $30 million of proceeds. \n \n 6. Stock-Based Compensation \n \n The Company has a 2012 Stock and Option Grant Plan (the \u0093Plan\u0094) under which the Company may grant stock options for up to 1,466,488 shares of common stock. Stock options expire either four or ten years from the date of the grant. For initial grants, vesting occurs over either (i) two years, with vesting occurring immediately each month, or (ii) four years, with the first 25% of the awards vesting twelve months after the vesting commencement date and the remaining 75% of the awards vesting monthly over the next thirty-six months. The Company\u0092s policy for attributing the value of stock-based compensation is on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. \n \n During 2013 and 2012 no options were exercised. At December 31, 2013, there were 1,116,360 shares available for grant under the Plan. \n \n The fair value for options and share awards granted under the Plan are estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following range of assumptions were used for grants during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the three months ended March 31, 2014: \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Three Months Ended \n \n March 31, 2014 2012 2013 Risk-free interest rates 0.74% 0.62% \u0096 1.91% 0.80% Expected dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% Expected term 6.25 years 3.03 \u0096 5.75 years 3.25 years Volatility 188.8% 144.0% 143% \n \n F-69 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n The impact on recording stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 and the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2014 was as follows: \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Three Months Ended \n \n March 31, 2012 2013 2013 2014 (Unaudited) Sales and marketing $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ \u0097 Product and technology 1,023 6,249 772 3,988 General and administrative \u0097 \u0097 \u0097 \u0097 Total stock-based compensation expense, net of tax $ 1,023 $ 6,249 $ 772 $ 3,988 \n \n The following table summarizes the stock option activity: \n \n Total \n \n Options \n \n Outstanding Weighted \n \n Average \n \n Exercise \n \n Price Weighted \n \n Average \n \n Remaining \n \n Contractual \n \n Term Outstanding at December 31, 2011 Options granted 100,000 $ 0.0001 Options exercised \u0097 \u0097 Options forfeited \u0097 \u0097 Outstanding at December 31, 2012 100,000 0.0001 8.68 Options granted 250,128 0.10 Options exercised \u0097 \u0097 Options forfeited \u0097 \u0097 Outstanding at December 31, 2013 350,128 0.07 5.41 Options granted 110,220 0.10 Options exercised \u0097 \u0097 Options forfeited \u0097 \u0097 Outstanding at March 31, 2014 460,348 0.08 4.83 Exercisable at December 31, 2013 33,333 $ 0.0001 5.41 Vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2013 350,128 $ 0.07 5.41 \n \n The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the three months ended March 31, 2014 was $25,013, $10,231 and $26,453, respectively. \n \n The stock compensation expense for employee awards was $5,923, $1,023, $3,541 and $772 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

As of \n \n F-70 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n December 31, 2013, there was $28,143 of unrecognized stock compensation expense related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 8.68 years. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $3,333 and $0, respectively. \n \n 7. Commitments and Contingencies \n \n In 2013, the Company entered into a new lease for office space in New York, NY expiring in 2016. Rent expense for the operating lease is recognized over the term of the lease on a straight line basis. Total rent for this lease for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 is $80,411, $0, $19,076 and $6,353, respectively. \n \n Operating 2014 $ 134,400 2015 138,559 2016 52,515 2017 \u0097 2018 \u0097 Total minimum payments required: $ 325,474 \n \n From time to time, the Company is involved in disputes or legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that there is no dispute or litigation pending that could have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \n \n 8. Income Taxes \n \n The significant components of the Company\u0092s deferred tax assets are as follows: \n \n 2012 2013 Net operating loss $ 59,514 $ 479,178 Fixed Assets 139 2,151 Stock based compensation 439 4,098 Other \u0097 \u0097 Deferred tax assets before valuation allowance 60,092 485,427 Less: Valuation allowance (60,092) (485,427) Total deferred tax assets $ \u0097 $ \u0097 \n \n As of December 31, 2012 and 2013, the Company had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $140 thousand and $1.1 million available to reduce future taxable income. \n \n F-71 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n The Company follows ASC 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. As of December 31, 2012 and 2013, there were no uncertain tax positions. As of December 31, 2012 and 2013, the Company was subject to federal and state income tax in the United States. Since the Company is in a loss carry-forward position, the Company is generally subject to U.S. federal and state income tax examinations by tax authorities for all years for which a loss carry-forward is available. It is the Company\u0092s policy to record interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. No amounts of interest or penalties were recognized in the financial statements upon adoption of this guidance as of and for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. \n \n 9. Subsequent Events \n \n The Company has performed an evaluation of subsequent events through November 3, 2014, the date of issuance of these financial statements. \n \n In April 2014, the Company was acquired by Etsy, Inc. \n \n F-72 \n \n Independent Auditor\u0092s Report \n \n To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Incubart SAS: \n \n We have audited the accompanying statements of Incubart SAS which comprise the balance sheets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related statements of income and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements. \n \n Management\u0092s Responsibility for the Financial Statements \n \n Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in France; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \n \n Auditor\u0092s Responsibility \n \n Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. \n \n An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Company\u0092s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u0092s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. \n \n F-73 \n \n Opinion \n \n In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Incubart SAS at December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in France. \n \n Emphasis of matter \n \n Accounting principles generally accepted in France vary in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Information relating to the nature and effect of such differences is presented in Note 12 to the financial statements. \n \n November 3, 2014 \n \n /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit \n \n Neuilly-sur-Seine, France \n \n Pierre Marty \n \n F-74 \n \n Incubart SAS \n \n Assets (all amounts in Euros) \n \n As of December 31, \n \n 2013 2012 Assets Gross Depr.Prov.

Description of business \n \n Incubart SAS (the \u0093Company\u0094) was incorporated in Paris in March 2009. Incubart owns and operates among other websites, alittlemarket.com and alittlemercerie.com, websites that provide a marketplace for the purchase and sale of handmade goods and commercial supplies. The Company generates revenue primarily from commissions on sales and seller advertising fees. \n \n The Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with: \n \n \u0095 PCG 1999, approved by ministerial order on June 22, 1999 \n \n \u0095 Law number 83 353 of April 30, 1983 \n \n \u0095 Decree 83 1020 of November 29, 1983 \n \n \u0095 Accounting standards arising from the Authority de Normes Comptables (ANC) \n \n The financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis. The notes and tables below form an integral part of the annual accounts. \n \n 2. Significant events \n \n In 2012, the Company launched two new platforms: A Little Maman, dedicated to nursery items and A Little Market in Italy. \n \n In 2013, the Company launched one new platform, A Little Epicerie, dedicated to Food. \n \n With regards to product features, the Company has launched two major features: the multishop basket and the installment payment service. \n \n 3. Revenue recognition \n \n Revenue is mainly generated from commissions on sales made by listed sellers and from the sale of advertising on the Company\u0092s website. \n \n The main line of revenue is transaction fees, which include commissions on orders placed by purchasers on the Company\u0092s websites and payment processing fees charged when the buyer pays with a credit card through the Company\u0092s secured system. \n \n F-80 \n \n Incubart SAS \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n In accordance with its terms of business, the Company has no responsibility in the fulfillment of orders placed by buyers and earns a fixed commission per transaction. Based on the aforementioned factors, revenue is recorded net of amounts collected from buyers and remitted to sellers. Seller refunds are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. \n \n Transaction fees\u0097The Company earns a commission on sales made between the seller and their buyer. Revenue from commissions on sales is recognized when the transaction is successfully completed, which occurs when a buyer purchases the item on the website with their credit card or their e-wallet. \n \n Advertising fees\u0097The Company offers search advertising where sellers can advertise their items based on featured search results. The advertising fees are recognized as revenue when purchased by the sellers. \n \n 4. Intangible assets \n \n Intangible assets, consisting principally of website and purchased software, are carried at cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally on a straight-line basis over three years. The Company reviews its identifiable amortizable intangible assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. \n \n 5. Research and development \n \n From the commencement of financial year 2012, development of software for internal use has been expensed as incurred. Prior to 2012, certain development costs, primarily relating to third party developers, had been capitalized. \n \n 6. Property and equipment \n \n Property and equipment, consisting principally of computer equipment and different fittings, are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. \n \n The depreciation rate of the main assets are the following: \n \n \u0095 Website Development Costs: 5 years \n \n \u0095 Computer Hardware: 3 to 5 years \n \n F-81 \n \n Incubart SAS \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n 7. Accounts receivable \n \n The Company\u0092s trade accounts receivable are recorded at amounts billed to customers and presented on the balance sheet net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is determined by a number of factors, including age of the receivable, current economic conditions, historical losses and management\u0092s assessment of the financial condition of customers. Receivables are written off once they are deemed uncollectible, which may arise when customers file for bankruptcy or are otherwise deemed unable to repay the amounts owed to the Company. \n \n 8. Provisions \n \n Provisions for liabilities are made in accordance with rule CRC 2000-06. \n \n Provisions for risks and expenses are recorded to take account of probable future sacrifices or outflows of economic benefits arising from present obligations and which result from past transactions. \n \n These provisions are estimated based on consideration of the best available information known to management at the year-end closing date. \n \n 9. Purchased gift vouchers \n \n The Company recognizes a liability for gift cards purchased on its websites. Under French generally accepted accounting principles (\u0093French GAAP\u0094), the Company records cash received against a liability, which is released to the income statement when the voucher expires or is redeemed. When a customer uses the purchased gift vouchers, the related commission is recognized as revenue. If a purchased gift card expires unused, a gain is recognized in the income statement. \n \n As at December 31, 2013, the liability was estimated at EUR 13,947, compared with EUR 11,306 as at December 31, 2012. \n \n 10. Free gift vouchers \n \n The Company may decide to grant free gift vouchers to buyers on a discretionary basis as sales incentives. These vouchers are not offered in connection with a current transaction, but rather as an incentive for future purchases. The Company records these as a discount on a future sale at the time of redemption. \n \n 11. Cash and cash equivalents \n \n The Company considers all investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. \n \n F-82 \n \n Incubart SAS \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n Short term investments amount to EUR 670,000 as at December 31, 2013 and EUR 1,050,000 as at December 31, 2012. \n \n 12.

Taxes \n \n Deferred taxes are not recognized on the face of the balance sheet in the statutory financial statements. \n \n 16. Competitiveness and employment tax credit (CICE) \n \n This tax credit was enacted from January 1, 2013 and amounts to EUR 15,527 at December 31, 2013. This will be collected by the Company in cash independently of its future taxable result. \n \n 17. Foreign currency translations \n \n The Company\u0092s revenue and expenses are essentially transacted in Euros, and its assets and liabilities are all denominated in Euros, which is the functional currency of the Company. \n \n F-83 \n \n Incubart SAS \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n 18. Stock-based compensation \n \n No stock options, warrants or other equity instruments have been issued to any employees, directors, related parties or other third parties. \n \n 19. Credit agreements \n \n On October 8, 2012, the Company entered into an interest-free credit agreement with OSEO of EUR 450,000, of which EUR 360,000 had been drawn down as at December 31, 2013 (2012: Nil). \n \n The loan is repayable quarterly, at an average of EUR 28,000 per quarter, beginning December 31, 2016, with a minimum of EUR 160,000 to be repaid. There is a clause in the agreement which allows for a penalty-free early repayment, at any time, of the loan in full. \n \n On July 30, 2012, the Company entered into an interest-free agreement with COFACE. The agreement is intended to finance marketing development initiatives undertaken in foreign markets. As at December 31, 2013, the amount drawn down totaled EUR 52,079.

Related party transactions \n \n There are no related party transactions for 2012 and 2013. \n \n 21. Segment reporting information \n \n The Company operates solely in France and in Italy for 2012 and 2013. \n \n 22.

However, tax credits have been recorded by the Company as follows: \n \n \u0095 R&D tax credit 2013: EUR 109,899 and 2012: EUR 185,196 \n \n \u0095 CICE 2013 (Competitiveness and employment tax credit): EUR 15,527 \n \n The amounts of accumulated losses carried forward are EUR 973,780 as at December 31, 2012 and EUR 1,547,358 as at December 31, 2013, respectively. \n \n Note 12\u0097Reconciliation to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles \n \n The Company\u0092s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with French accounting standards, which differ in certain material respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u0093US GAAP\u0094). Such differences involve methods for measuring the amounts in the financial statements. The \n \n F-91 \n \n Incubart SAS \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n principal differences between French accounting standards and US GAAP applicable to the Company are quantified and described below: \n \n Reconciliation of net income (French GAAP\u0097US GAAP) \n \n (all amounts in Euros) \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Note 2012 2013 (in thousands) Loss reported under French GAAP (420.2) (466.5) Software and website development costs A 97.2 104.0 Revenue recognition (advertising fees) B (14.9) (22.0) Debt issuance costs C 11.4 Interest free loan D 6.4 Deferred payment terms E (8.0) Deferred tax effect of US GAAP adjustments F Loss reported under US GAAP (337.9) (374.7) \n \n Reconciliation of equity (French GAAP\u0097US GAAP) \n \n (all amounts in Euros) \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Note 2012 2013 (in thousands) Equity reported under French GAAP 1,310.8 844.3 Software and website development costs A 298.7 402.8 Revenue recognition (advertising fees) B (41.7) (63.7) Debt issuance costs C 11.4 Interest-free loan D 6.4 Deferred payment terms E (8.0) Deferred tax effect of US GAAP adjustments F Equity reported under US GAAP 1,567.8 1,193.2 \n \n A. Software and website development costs \n \n Software and website development is performed by external service providers as well as the Company\u0092s employees. Under French GAAP, the company capitalized only website development fees charged by third-party service providers up until December 31, 2011. Starting in 2012, all software development costs were expensed. US GAAP requires capitalization of certain internal and external costs incurred in the development of websites and software for internal use. \n \n Costs of the preliminary design phase and costs incurred in the operation and maintenance of the software must be expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the development phase must be capitalized. These \n \n F-92 \n \n Incubart SAS \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n same rules apply to upgrades and enhancements made to the platform, to the extent it is probable that they will result in additional functionalities to the platform. \n \n B. Revenue recognition \n \n The Company recognizes fees charged to listed sellers for more prominently displaying their products. Under French GAAP, the fees are recognized upfront in the income statement. \n \n Under US GAAP, this search advertisement revenue is recognized as \u0093impressions\u0094 (i.e., the number of times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of the Company\u0092s website) are delivered. \n \n C. Debt issuance costs \n \n A transaction fee was charged in connection with a financing received in fiscal year 2013. Under French GAAP, the fee is recorded in operating expenses. \n \n Under US GAAP, the fee should be capitalized as debt issuance costs and amortized to the income statement using an effective interest rate method. \n \n D. Government grants in the form of an interest-free loan \n \n In fiscal year 2013, the Company drew down an interest-free loan from a government body. Under French GAAP, the liability is equal to the amount of proceeds received and is not discounted to its net present value. \n \n US GAAP requires the Company to impute interest when the stated interest rate of a note payable or receivable is below market rate in accordance with the substance of the transaction. The substance of this transaction is a government subsidy for an amount equivalent to the difference between proceeds received and fair value of the note (NPV of cash flows using a market interest rate). \n \n E. Deferred payment terms \n \n During fiscal year 2013, the Company began to allow buyers to elect to pay in 3 monthly installments, in which case the Company bears credit risk and charges the buyer an additional fee. Under French GAAP, the fee was recognized upfront in the income statement. \n \n Under US GAAP, the fee is considered, in substance, as interest income and is recognized using an effective interest method over the term of the receivable. \n \n F-93 \n \n Incubart SAS \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n F. Income taxes \n \n Under French GAAP, deferred taxes are not recognized in the statutory financial statements. \n \n Under US GAAP, deferred tax is computed on all temporary differences between the tax bases and book values of assets and liabilities which will result in taxable or tax deductible amounts arising in future years. Deferred taxes are measured at enacted rates. The Company records deferred tax assets, primarily in connection with their net operating losses, up to an amount that is offset by the deferred tax liabilities, primarily associated with the differences between their book and tax basis for capitalized software and website development costs. As a result of the Company\u0092s history of losses, a full valuation allowance is applied against any remaining net deferred tax assets, as the realization of the future benefit is not more likely than not. \n \n Net deferred tax assets prior to the valuation allowance under U.S. GAAP were EUR 85,655 for 2012 and EUR 116,290 for 2013. \n \n Reconciliation of operating expenses \n \n The following table presents the disclosure of costs and expenses based on the caption requirements of Rule 5-03 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Such costs and expenses have been allocated from the French GAAP presentation, and adjusted for US GAAP reconciliation items accordingly. \n \n 2013 2012 (in Euros) Cost of revenue 477,609 269,818 Marketing 530,838 456,961 Product development 543,102 212,645 General and administrative 350,986 318,726 Operating expenses 1,902,535 1,258,150 \n \n Reconciliation of operating expenses from French GAAP to US GAAP \n \n 2013 2012 (in Euros) Operating expenses - French GAAP 2,060,339 1,403,787 US GAAP adjustments: Other operating expense (1) (42,359) (48,427) Software and website development costs (104,022) (97,210) Debt issuance costs (11,423) \u0097 Operating expenses\u0097US GAAP 1,902,535 1,258,150 \n \n (1) These represent other operating income and reversal of provisions and cost recharges that should be reflected within operating expense under U.S. GAAP, but are included in operating income under French GAAP. \n \n F-94 \n \n Unaudited Combined Pro Forma Financial Information \n \n On April 29, 2014, Etsy, Inc. (the \u0093Company\u0094) completed the acquisition of Jarvis Labs, Inc., owners of the \u0093Grand St.\u0094 online technology marketplace. Total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $3.2 million, consisting of $1.0 million in cash and 425,104 shares of the Company\u0092s common stock with a fair value of $2.2 million on the acquisition date. Additionally, the Company issued 657,160 shares of common stock with a fair value of $3.4 million on the acquisition date, which are tied to continued employment with the Company and are being accounted for as post-acquisition stock-based compensation expense over the three-year vesting period. \n \n On June 18, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of Incubart SAS, a societe par actions simplifiee organized under the laws of France, which operates the online marketplace A Little Market (\u0093ALM\u0094). Total consideration for the acquisition was $30.8 million, consisting of $5.3 million in cash, of which $4.2 million was paid at closing, $0.3 million will be paid in March 2015 and $0.8 million in February 2016, and 4,879,693 shares of the Company\u0092s common stock with a fair value of $25.5 million on the acquisition date. The terms of the purchase agreement provide for the sale of put options to certain of the former shareholders of ALM. The put options enable the holders of the options to sell up to all of their shares back to the Company, subject to certain vesting and restrictions, at fair value, but not to exceed $4.13 per share and not less than $2.00 per share. The put right terminates with respect to a share on the earlier of one year from when such share is vested or the liquidation date, as defined in the agreement containing the put option. The holders of the options paid an aggregate of $0.1 million cash to the Company at the date of acquisition and the Company recorded a $0.1 million liability for the fair value of the put option at the time. Additionally, the Company issued 1,198,995 shares of common stock with a fair value of $6.3 million on the acquisition date, which are tied to continued employment with the Company and are being accounted for as post-acquisition stock-based compensation expense over the three-year vesting period. Since the put options relate in part to these shares, these shares will be recorded as liability-classified stock awards as earned. \n \n The historical financial information for Etsy is derived from the Company\u0092s audited consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 2014 contained in this prospectus. The historical financial information of Grand St. and ALM has been derived from the historical audited financial statements and the unaudited financial statements of Grand St. and ALM for the period from January 1, 2014 through April 29, 2014 and the period from January 1, 2014 through June 18, 2014, respectively. The financial statements for Grand St. were prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The financial statements for ALM were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in France (French GAAP) which is a comprehensive basis of accounting different from U.S. GAAP. The historical ALM French GAAP financial statements have been reconciled to U.S. GAAP and, as a result, the historical financial information of ALM included in the pro forma combined statement of operations is presented in U.S. GAAP. \n \n F-95 \n \n The ALM historical EUR denominated financial statement amounts have been translated to U.S. Dollars (USD) using the following exchange rates: \n \n EUR / $ Interim period ended June 18, 2014 Average spot rate 1.3716 \n \n The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 give effect to the acquisitions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2014. \n \n The unaudited pro forma adjustments have been made for informational purposes. The actual results reported by the combined company in periods following the acquisitions may differ significantly from those reflected in these unaudited pro forma combined statements. As a result, the pro forma combined information is not intended to represent and does not purport to be indicative of what the combined company\u0092s financial condition or results of operations would have been had the acquisitions been completed on the applicable dates of this pro forma combined financial information. In addition, the pro forma combined financial information does not purport to project the future financial condition and results of operations of the combined company. \n \n The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are based on various assumptions, including consideration paid and the allocation thereof to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Grand St. and ALM are based on preliminary estimates of fair value. The pro forma assumptions and adjustments are described in the accompanying notes presented on the following pages. Pro forma adjustments are those that are directly attributable to the transactions, are factually supportable and, with respect to the unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations, are expected to have a continuing impact on the consolidated results. The final purchase price and the allocation thereof may differ from that reflected in the pro forma combined financial statements after the final valuation procedures are performed and amounts are finalized. \n \n The unaudited pro forma combined financial information does not reflect any cost savings from operating efficiencies, synergies or other restructuring that could result from the acquisition. \n \n F-96 \n \n Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statement of Operations for the Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2014 \n \n (In thousands except share and per share data) \n \n Etsy, Inc.

Fair value is defined in the guidance as \u0093the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\u0094 This is an exit price concept for the valuation of the asset or liability. In addition, market participants are assumed to be buyers and sellers in the principal (or the most advantageous) market for the asset or liability. Fair value measurements for an asset assume the highest and best use by these market participants. Many of these fair value measurements can be highly subjective and it is possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. \n \n The pro forma adjustments described below have been developed based on assumptions and estimates, including assumptions relating to the consideration paid and the allocation thereof to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Grand St. and ALM based on preliminary estimates of fair value. The final purchase price and the allocation thereof may differ from that reflected in the pro forma combined financial statements after final valuation procedures are performed and amounts are finalized. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations would have been had the acquisition occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations. \n \n The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements do not reflect any cost savings from operating efficiencies, synergies or other restructurings that could result from the acquisition, as such costs are not currently factually supportable. \n \n F-98 \n \n Management performed a review of Grand St.\u0092s and ALM\u0092s accounting policies, based primarily on available historical financial information, to determine whether any adjustments were necessary to ensure comparability in the pro forma combined financial statements. At this time, the Company is not aware of any differences, other than those stated in either in the unaudited pro forma adjustments or identified in the Grand St. or ALM stand-alone financial statements provided elsewhere in this prospectus, which would have a material impact on the pro forma combined financial statements. \n \n Note 2\u0097Purchase Price Allocation \n \n This business combinations resulted in the total purchase price being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed according to their estimated fair values at the date of acquisitions with the remaining unallocated purchase price recorded as goodwill as follows: \n \n Grand St. (in thousands) \n \n Cash paid $ 1,040 Common shares 2,202 Total purchase consideration $ 3,242 Working capital $ 85 Developed technology 2,000 Customer relationships 600 Trademarks 200 Goodwill 991 Deferred tax liability (634) Net assets acquired $ 3,242 \n \n Included in working capital is approximately $0.1 million of cash acquired. \n \n The amounts allocated to developed technology, customer relationships and trademark (the acquired intangible assets) total $2.8 million. The fair value assigned to developed technology was determined primarily using the cost approach, which estimates the cost to reproduce the asset, adjusted for loss due to functional and economic obsolescence. The fair value of Grand St.\u0092s customer relationships was determined primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management. The fair value assigned to trademark was determined using the relief from royalty method, where the owner of the asset realizes a benefit from owning the intangible asset rather than paying a rental or royalty rate for use of the asset. The acquired identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over three years, which approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized. None of the goodwill recorded in the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes. \n \n F-99 \n \n ALM (in thousands) \n \n Cash paid $ 5,290 Common shares 25,521 Total purchase consideration $ 30,811 Working capital $ 625 Property and equipment and other assets 95 Developed technology 1,636 Customer relationships 1,693 Trademarks 775 Goodwill 27,309 Deferred tax liability (757) Other long-term liabilities (565) Net assets acquired $ 30,811 \n \n Included in working capital is approximately $0.5 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired. \n \n The amount allocated to developed technology, customer relationships and trademarks (the acquired intangible assets) total $4.1 million. The fair value assigned to developed technology was determined primarily by using the cost approach, which estimates the cost to reproduce the asset, adjusted for loss due to functional and economic obsolescence. The fair value of ALM\u0092s customer relationships was determined primarily by using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management. The fair value assigned to trademark was determined using the relief from royalty method, where the owner of the asset realizes a benefit from owning the intangible asset rather than paying a rental or royalty rate for use of the asset. The acquired identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over three years, which approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized. Goodwill of $27.3 million, none of which is deductible for tax purposes, was recorded in connection with this acquisition, which is primarily attributed to synergies arising from the acquisition and the value of the acquired workforce. \n \n Note 3\u0097Unaudited Pro Forma Adjustments \n \n (1) Pro forma adjustment to record additional amortization expense related to Grand St. and ALM acquired identifiable intangible assets, net of historical amortization amounts of $11,000, as if the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2014 and amortization of the acquired assets is recorded on a straight-line basis over three years. \n \n Intangible assets acquired are as follows (in thousands): \n \n Grand St. ALM Developed technology $ 2,000 $ 1,636 Trademarks 200 775 Customer relationships 600 1,693 $ 2,800 $ 4,104 \n \n F-100 \n \n Amortization of developed technology and trademark is recorded within cost of revenue. Customer relationship amortization is recorded within marketing expense. \n \n (2) Pro forma adjustment to eliminate acquisition costs relating to the purchase of Grand St. and ALM in 2014. \n \n (3) Pro forma adjustment to eliminate interest expense on debt that was not acquired by Etsy. \n \n (4) For purposes of this unaudited combined pro forma financial information, the 425,104 and 4,879,693 shares of non-compensatory common stock issued to Grand St. and ALM shareholders, respectively, was given effect in the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014 as if the acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2013. \n \n In addition, the conversion of all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock into 106,896,493 shares of common stock is assumed to have occurred on January 1, 2013. \n \n (5) Pro forma adjustment to record stock compensation expense in connection with the issuance of 1,198,995 shares of common stock valued at $6.3 million to certain former shareholders of ALM and 657,160 shares of common stock valued at $3.4 million to certain former shareholders of Grand St. that are tied to continuing employment. \n \n (6) Pro forma adjustment to reflect the effect of the assumed conversions of outstanding warrants exercisable for preferred securities of the Company and Grand St. into warrants exercisable for common stock and the corresponding elimination of the expense included in operating results from the change in the fair value of the warrants. \n \n F-101 \n \n Part II \n \n Information Not Required in Prospectus \n \n Item 13. Other Expenses of Issuance and Distribution \n \n The following table presents the costs and expenses, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, payable in connection with this offering. All amounts are estimates except the SEC registration fee, the FINRA filing fee and Nasdaq listing fee. Except as otherwise noted, all the expenses below will be paid by us. \n \n SEC registration fee $ * FINRA filing fee * Nasdaq listing fee * Printing and engraving expenses * Legal fees and expenses * Accounting fees and expenses * Transfer agent and registrar fees * Miscellaneous fees and expenses * Total $ * \n \n * To be completed by amendment. \n \n Item 14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers \n \n Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law authorizes a court to award, or a corporation\u0092s board of directors to grant, indemnity to directors and officers under certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations. The terms of Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law are sufficiently broad to permit indemnification under certain circumstances for liabilities, including reimbursement of expenses incurred, arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. \n \n As permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, upon completion of this offering, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will contain provisions relating to the limitation of liability and indemnification of directors and officers. The amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that our directors will not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability: \n \n \u0095 for any breach of the director\u0092s duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders; \n \n \u0095 for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; \n \n \u0095 in respect of unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or \n \n \u0095 for any transaction from which the director derives any improper personal benefit. \n \n II-1 \n \n Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that if Delaware law is amended after the approval by our stockholders of the certificate of incorporation to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of our directors will be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. \n \n Our amended and restated bylaws will provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, as it now exists or may in the future be amended, against all expenses and liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with their service for or on our behalf. Our amended and restated bylaws will provide that we shall advance the expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of an action or proceeding, and permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any director, officer, employee or other enterprise agent for any liability arising out of his or her action in that capacity, whether or not Delaware law would otherwise permit indemnification. \n \n We intend to enter into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and officers, a form of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1. The form of agreement provides that we will indemnify each of our directors and officers against any and all expenses incurred by that director or officer because of his or her status as one of our directors or officers, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws. In addition, the form agreement provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, we will advance all expenses incurred by our directors and officers in connection with a legal proceeding. \n \n Reference is made to the underwriting agreement contained in Exhibit 1.1 to this registration statement, indemnifying our directors and officers against limited liabilities. In addition, Section 2(f) of our amended and restated investors\u0092 rights agreement contained in Exhibit 4.2 to this registration statement provides for indemnification of certain of our stockholders against liabilities described in that agreement. \n \n We currently carry and intend to continue to carry liability insurance for our directors and officers. \n \n Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities \n \n The following sets forth information regarding all unregistered securities sold from January 1, 2012 to January 31, 2015, giving effect to a 10-for-1 forward split of our common stock, which occurred on May 5, 2011. \n \n On May 1, 2012, we issued and sold an aggregate of 11,594,203 shares of our Series F preferred stock to 12 accredited investors at $3.45 per share for an aggregate consideration of approximately $40,000,000. \n \n On June 26, 2012, we issued and sold 5,056 shares of our Series C preferred stock to one accredited investor upon exercise of a warrant issued to such investor on November 15, 2007. Pursuant to the terms of the warrant, the exercise price of $2.67 per share was paid through the cancellation of 425 shares of Series C preferred stock otherwise issuable under the warrant. \n \n II-2 \n \n We have granted options to purchase 22,320,456 shares of our common stock to service providers under our 2006 Stock Plan, with per share exercise prices ranging from $1.18 to $8.50. \n \n We have issued and sold an aggregate of 17,216,090 shares of our common stock upon exercise of options issued under our 2006 Stock Plan for aggregate consideration of approximately $14,810,000, with per share exercise prices ranging from $0.01 to $4.13. \n \n On April 1, 2014, we issued and sold an aggregate of 6,603,774 shares of our common stock to two accredited investors at $5.30 per share for an aggregate consideration of approximately $35,000,000. \n \n On January 30, 2015, we issued 376,471 shares of our common stock to Etsy.org for no consideration. \n \n We issued an aggregate of 7,160,952 shares of our common stock in connection with our acquisitions of certain companies or their assets and as consideration to individuals and entities who were former service providers and/or stockholders of such companies. \n \n None of the foregoing transactions involved any underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions, or any public offering. We believe that the offers, sales and issuances of the above securities were exempt from registration under the Securities Act by virtue of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or Regulation D promulgated thereunder as transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering, or in reliance on Rule 701 promulgated under Section 3(b) of the Securities Act because the transactions were pursuant to compensatory benefit plans or contracts relating to compensation as provided under Rule 701. The recipients of the securities in each of these transactions represented their intentions to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof, and appropriate legends were placed upon the stock certificates issued in these transactions. We believe all recipients had adequate information about us or had adequate access, through their relationships with us, to information about us. \n \n Item 16. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules \n \n (a) Exhibits. We have filed the exhibits listed on the accompanying Index to Exhibits, which is incorporated herein by reference. \n \n (b) Financial Statement Schedules. All schedules have been omitted because the information required to be presented in them is not applicable or is shown in the consolidated financial statements or related notes. \n \n Item 17. Undertakings \n \n The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriter at the closing specified in the underwriting agreements certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriter to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser. \n \n II-3 \n \n Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. \n \n The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that: \n \n (1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. \n \n (2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, as amended, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. \n \n (3) In a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: \n \n (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; \n \n (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; \n \n (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and \n \n (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. \n \n II-4 \n \n Signatures \n \n Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Brooklyn, State of New York, on this 4th day of March, 2015. \n \n ETSY, INC. /s/ Kristina Salen Kristina Salen Chief Financial Officer \n \n Power of Attorney \n \n KNOW ALL PERSONS BY THESE PRESENTS, that each person whose signature appears below hereby constitutes and appoints Chad Dickerson, Jordan Breslow and Kristina Salen, and each of them, as his or her true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent with full power of substitution, for him or her in any and all capacities, to sign any and all amendments to this registration statement (including post-effective amendments) and any registration statement related thereto filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) increasing the number of securities for which registration is sought, and to file the same, with all exhibits thereto and other documents in connection therewith, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, granting unto said attorney-in-fact and agent full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in connection therewith, as fully for all intents and purposes as he or she might or could do in person, hereby ratifying and confirming all that said attorney-in-fact and agent, or his or her substitute, may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. \n \n Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, this registration statement has been signed by the following persons in the capacities and on the dates indicated. \n \n Signature Title Date /s/ Chad Dickerson Chad Dickerson President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman (Principal Executive Officer) March 4, 2015 /s/ Kristina Salen Kristina Salen Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer) March 4, 2015 /s/ James W.

But as her business has grown, she has been harshly criticized online and accused of mass-producing goods, of obtaining wares from China. Detractors consider her a blight on Etsy\u2019s hipster cred. \n \n The dispute over how goods are produced and sold on a site that prides itself on feel-good, handmade authenticity underscores the growing pains transforming Etsy as it moves toward a potentially lucrative initial public offering of stock. \n \n As for Ms. Shaffer, she denies the claims that have dogged her business recently but says she understands why questions have arisen about the volume of goods she produces. She says her store strictly adheres to Etsy\u2019s guidelines, including that all items listed are either handmade or \u201cvintage\u201d secondhand, with some new exceptions that allow for approved outside manufacturing. \u201cWe\u2019re a team of dedicated Etsy artisans who have been able to grow a tiny shop into a little machine,\u201d she said.", "I shut down my Etsy store in November. \n \n I'd been a seller since April 2006, less than a year after Etsy first went into beta. I was in my first job out of journalism school, and making cards and journals was a creative outlet and a way for me to score some extra money. I'd been selling stuff on the side at craft shows for a few years at that point, part of a larger wave of modern crafters who met online and inspired each other to start businesses. \n \n Etsy debuted at just the right time: Indie craft shows had started popping up around the U.S. in the early 2000s, but running your own online store was a complicated task. (My \"store\" at the time encouraged buyers to mail me money orders.) Most of the people who joined Etsy in those first few years were like me\u2014independent crafters who were already at least somewhat established IRL\u2014and the quality of the goods on the site was generally high. \n \n Things have changed in the past decade: Indie craft has grown from a close-knit subculture to a giant economy that influences trends in big box stores. And Etsy has grown from a startup built by crafters and for crafters to a juggernaut on the verge of an IPO. The most recent success story of a mom making a million dollars a year isn't what it seems. In practical terms, scaling the handmade economy is an impossibility. So while Etsy maintains a hipster fa\u00e7ade, they lost their indie cred years ago. \n \n Grace Dobush About Grace Dobush is a freelance journalist in Cincinnati, where she writes about design, tech, politics and culture. She also organizes an indie craft show and wrote the Crafty Superstar craft business guides. Follow her gracedobushtogo. \n \n I have to acknowledge this: Modern craft would not be as hot as it is without Etsy or something like it. Like book authors who hate Amazon's policies, crafters who hate Etsy find it hard to leave because of the site's immense traffic and generally positive public reputation. Just before the Christmas rush, I finally put my money where my mouth is and shut down my shop. My reasons for leaving the site aren't unique, even though casual shoppers and potential investors have no idea of the drama going on behind the scenes. Here's my beef with Etsy. \n \n A Bigger Market Isn't a Better Market \n \n There are more than 30 million items listed on Etsy right now. That popularity is, of course, great for Etsy. But new hobbyist sellers, desperate for clicks, often price their products so low as to make real profit an impossible dream. \n \n And that popularity isn't good for shoppers, who have to wade through pages of crap to find what they're looking for. Searching for \"mermaid\" in the wedding gown category of Etsy returns 1,299 results, ranging from a $6,882 gown made by Project Runway's Leanne Marshall to dresses for less than $200, one purportedly handmade lace dress going for $65. (For those who aren't up to date on their fabric prices, the materials to make a wedding dress alone would cost at least $65.) A friend and I recently discovered we both always sort results by highest price when we're searching on Etsy to see only the serious sellers. \n \n What other e-commerce sites can say the same? Etsy needs casual crafters to keep paying the 20-cent listing fees and, if any of the items sell, the 3.5 percent transaction fees and any additional payment processing fees. (See \"She's Making Jewelry Now.\") Etsy doesn't disclose its finances, but it facilitated $1.35 billion in sales in 2013, which adds up to more than $47 million in transaction fees, not counting listing or payment processing fees. \n \n Resellers Are Rampant \n \n That Etsy began allowing manufacturing partners in 2013 underscored the reseller issue that has plagued the site for years. The Marketplace Integrity, Trust & Safety team\u2014which has the unenviable task of policing sellers for adherence to Etsy rules\u2014is unable or unwilling to weed out sellers of mass-manufactured goods. And having sellers who are able to move nearly a million dollars of product a year is great for Etsy's bottom line. \n \n Sellers have been dissatisfied with Etsy's policing of mass-manufactured items posing as handmade for a long time, but the site hasn't seemed receptive to their concerns. An Etsy staffer I met a few years ago dismissed sellers' questions about Chinese resellers as \"kind of racist.\" The snark site Regretsy (RIP) was one of the few big gathering places where sellers and shoppers could voice their frustrations with the marketplace. Any kind of \"calling out\" of accused resellers or bad businesspeople on Etsy's forums is usually acknowledged by an admin shutting down the thread with \"I'm going to close this up now.\" \n \n Etsy Has Homogenized Indie Craft \n \n From the beginning, Etsy has pushed the \"quit your day job\" storyline. The fact is, the majority of the people selling on Etsy aren't running their businesses full-time, and the idea of quitting your day job is a manic pixie fever dream. If you want to make it big on Etsy, you don't necessarily want to make things that fulfill your creative dreams; you just want it to get onto the front page and sell like hand-felted hotcakes. \n \n The Etsy effect on craft trends is striking. At the San Francisco edition of the Renegade Craft Fair in November, I was struck at how most things look like the homepage of Etsy, pinnable, pretty things. (See \"Put A Bird On It.\") It's so incredibly boring. How many pieces of geometric jewelry with a pop of color can the earth bear? Will we ever see hand-drawn logos without antlers and arrows? How much barn wood must we salvage to atone for our crafty sins? \n \n Successful Businesses Leave Etsy \n \n The biggest secret is this: Makers who have what it takes to succeed\u2014good product, a good marketing plan, a pricing structure that compensates everyone in their supply chain fairly\u2014don't really need Etsy for long. \n \n Etsy is the fifth most-visited marketplace site in the U.S., after Amazon, eBay, Walmart and Best Buy. But for that visibility, sellers have little autonomy in the store's design, and are subject to the site's rules, fees and design. A customer complaint can freeze your payment account. An accusation of copyright violation can freeze your store or shut it down entirely. \n \n For a full-time crafter, that's too much of a risk. Successful makers of a certain size eventually move to e-commerce platforms that give them much more flexibility and control for fewer fees. If you're working in high volume or high price points, using a customizable ecommerce platform such as Big Cartel or Shopify massively reduces your fee obligation, as I outlined in a comparison chart. \n \n I see the recent policy changes Etsy has made\u2014allowing third-party manufacturing partners, entering the wholesale space\u2014as last-ditch efforts to keep super-successful sellers using the site. But successful handmade businesspeople weren't waiting for permission from Etsy to hire help or get into wholesaling. They grew out of the site and took their wares elsewhere. \n \n The David Has Turned Into Goliath \n \n At its outset, Etsy was a powerful tool for makers, by makers. We were a bunch of Davids, fighting back against the big-box Goliaths with artisanal slingshots. Founder Rob Kalin came up through the same online craft forums that me and my crafty cohorts did, and we were making a revolution. \n \n In the past few years it's become apparent that Etsy is the Goliath. Indie craft's whole purpose from the outset was to meet your makers and consume conscientiously. Now, when you ask your friend where they got that cool \"Weekend at Bernies\" cross stitch sampler, they'll tell you, \"I bought it from Etsy\"\u2014the maker's identity is secondary, if noted at all. \n \n I'm not pessimistic about handmade culture at large: Maker culture is thriving independently of Etsy, and it's easier than ever for crafters to run independent online stores. I prefer to sell my wares (and buy my presents) at local indie craft markets and in curated bricks-and-mortar shops that reflect the flavor of their communities and encourage real relationships between makers and buyers. \n \n The bottom line is this: Etsy needs crafters more than crafters need Etsy.", "Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Etsy was born in 2005 in a Brooklyn loft as a way for one of its co-founders to sell his handmade wooden goods. \n \n Now the company is seeking to go public in what promises to be one of the more closely watched market debuts of the year. \n \n Etsy filed its first prospectus for an initial public offering on Wednesday, disclosing a preliminary fund-raising target of $100 million. But the online bazaar \u2014 whose wares range from whimsical knit \u201cbeard\u201d hats to vintage jewelry \u2014 will most likely seek much more. \n \n With the filing, Etsy is preparing to market itself to prospective investors in as soon as three weeks and could begin trading on the Nasdaq stock market by mid-April under the symbol ETSY. \n \n Unlike some of the other prominent companies that have gone public over the last six months, like the Alibaba Group of China or the online lender Lending Club, Etsy has quirkiness built into its DNA. Its first chief executive and co-founder, Rob Kalin, barely squeaked into college and came up with Etsy as a way to sell his homemade wares. (Its name, Mr. Kalin has said, arose from a misunderstanding of the Italian phrase \u201ceh, s\u00ec\u201d from the movie \u201c8 1/2.\u201d) \n \n Photo \n \n \u201cSince inception, Etsy has challenged conventional ways of thinking about commerce, business, individuals and communities,\u201d Chad Dickerson, the company\u2019s chief executive, wrote in a letter included in the prospectus. \u201cI intend to keep our unconventional operating philosophy as we become a public company, and I welcome new investors into our community.\u201d \n \n But its path to an initial offering has been rocky at times. Mr. Kalin stepped down as chief executive in 2011 and was succeeded by Mr. Dickerson, the chief technical officer at the time. \n \n And the company has been criticized for failing to adequately clamp down on the sale of counterfeit goods as well as for letting vendors sell products that come from factories instead of vintage finds or goods solely from artisanal workshops. \n \n Still, in its decade of existence, Etsy has become a significant business. It reported $195.6 million in sales last year, up 56 percent from the previous year. And as of Dec. 31, it had 685 employees, most of whom are still based in the Dumbo neighborhood of Brooklyn. \n \n Like other Internet companies that aim to go public, Etsy presents a measure of earnings that differs from that required by generally accepted accounting principles. Etsy\u2019s own metric, known as adjusted Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, says that the company made $23 million last year. But it lost $15 million according to standard accounting principles. \n \n Adjusted Ebitda was positive because in addition to excluding taxes, depreciation and amortization, it did not count the cost of paying employees in stock. \n \n While investors often find such nonstandard measures of profits useful, they may be surprised at some of the items Etsy has left out of its particular metric. The company, for instance, also excluded acquisition-related expenses and foreign exchange losses. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n If those two items are included in the calculation, Etsy\u2019s underlying earnings growth would slow considerably. Specifically, the firm\u2019s adjusted Ebitda increased 36 percent in 2014, from $17 million in 2013. But if acquisition and foreign exchange costs were included, growth would have been only 6 percent. \n \n Other items in the filing may give investors pause. Etsy, for instance, said that it had 19.8 million \u201cactive buyers\u201d at the end of 2014. An active buyer doesn\u2019t have to be using Etsy frequently, though. The only requirement is to have made one purchase in the previous 12 months, according to the filing. \n \n Though the prospectus did not disclose details like how many of its shares are outstanding, it is possible to estimate market value. EBay trades at about 14 times its Ebitda for 2014. Applying that multiple to Etsy\u2019s adjusted Ebitda would give it a value of about $322 million. \n \n In his letter, Mr. Dickerson said that the company would not give quarterly or annual earnings guidance, numbers used by many public companies to steer analysts\u2019 expectations. \n \n Etsy\u2019s biggest existing shareholders include investment firms like Accel Partners, Index Ventures and Union Square Ventures. Together, the three control more than half of the company. The prospectus did not disclose how many shares any of the firms planned to sell. \n \n As part of the offering, Etsy plans to take about $300,000 of its proceeds from the I.P.O. to finance Etsy.org, a nonprofit it established in January to help train female entrepreneurs. \n \n The offering is being led by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley."], "summary": "\u2013 When customers order an heirloom pet teepee, Charles Manson necklace, or vinyl Gorillaz wall clock from Etsy, they expect it to be lovingly handmade or authentically vintage, perhaps even customized and made from ecologically sound materials.

And although execs from the online marketplace didn't grant interviews with the Times ahead of its potential IPO, Etsy CEO Chad Dickerson notes in the IPO prospectus that there have been complaints about sellers working with outside manufacturers and \"diluting our handmade ethos,\" he notes. \"After all, Etsy has always served as an antidote to mass manufacturing.

Now the company has revealed how much the slip-up cost. \n \n Former Google employee Sanmay Ved purchased Google.com for $12 at 1:20 a.m. ET on September 29. He bought the domain name on the Google Domains registration service website after the company somehow lost ownership of it. \n \n He owned Google.com for one minute. The transaction was reversed when Google sent Ved a cancellation order, which returned ownership to the company. \n \n Conflicts over domain ownership aren't always settled amicably or cheaply. So-called domain squatters often try to get ahead of potential, hypothetical products and register domain names -- say, \"Appleflyingcar.com\" -- on the cheap in hopes of netting a big sale to the company that needs the site. Or they may create a website name that combines a celebrity's name and a word like \"naked.\" \n \n In this case, it seems Google may have missed a deadline to renew Google.com, creating an opportunity for someone to slip in and nab it. Neither Google nor Ved has publicly revealed exactly how the domain name became available. \n \n In a security blog post Thursday, the company revealed that it wanted to give Ved $6,006.13. Look at the amount as letters instead of numbers, and it comes close to spelling \"google.\" \"Squint a little and you'll see it!\" Google said. \n \n Google doubled that offer after Ved said he would donate the money to charity, both the company and Ved said, though neither specified the exact figure. \n \n Google's payout ended up going to the Art of Living India foundation, which runs free schools for children in poverty-stricken areas of India. \n \n Now playing: Watch this: Masters of a new domain \n \n Ved, whose LinkedIn account describes him as an MBA candidate at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, detailed the incident in a post there last fall. He noted that Google was able to reverse the transaction because it owned the Google Domains registration service. \n \n Microsoft bumped into a similar issue in 2003 when it lost ownership of the Hotmail.co.uk website, The Register reported at the time.

The new owner - a good hearted soul - then proceeded immediately to contact Microsoft, inform the giant of its slip and arrange to hand back the domain. \n \n However, Microsoft didn't want to know. Despite phone calls and emails - and being fobbed off by Microsoft drones - our man behind this public-spirited deed was completely blanked by the software empire. \n \n Microsoft only took notice when The Register contacted the company yesterday afternoon to enquire why its hotmail.co.uk site was registered to a private individual. \n \n It was then we were told that the matter was under investigation and being \"escalated\". Worryingly, no one in the UK could deal with the matter so it was up to the US to sort things out. \n \n Of course, while Microsoft's spinstresses tried to stall for time, the company was busy scurrying behind the scenes to sort out this embarrassing episode. It managed to contact hotmail.co.uk's new owner, grovel at their mistake and sort out the mess. By all accounts, hotmail.co.uk will be returned in a few days. \n \n A spokeswoman for Nominet UK - the registry for all .uk domains - confirmed that hotmail.co.uk had failed to be renewed and was placed back into pool of available domains. \n \n For Nominet's part, she confirmed that \"all the standard renewal procedures were followed regarding hotmail.co.uk\". \n \n \"I would like to remind companies and their agents that it is their responsibility to renew their domains,\" she said. \n \n Despite repeated attempts to seek comment from Microsoft, the software giant has failed to cobble together any form of statement that might shed light on this situation. \n \n In December 1999, Microsoft forgot to renew the domain name Passport.com, and so rendered its Hotmail service partially crippled.

Other than his wife, none of the victims has yet been publicly identified. In a statement late Friday, Montgomery police said Tordil was \u201ccurrently being interviewed by detectives,\u201d and they indicated that he had not been charged in that jurisdiction. \u00ad \n \n The killing began Thursday afternoon, investigators say, when Tordil approached his estranged wife, Gladys Tordil, as she waited in a parking lot at High Point High School in Beltsville to pick up her two daughters. \n \n When a man tried to intervene, authorities said, Tordil shot him in the shoulder. They say Tordil then pointed his weapon at his wife\u2019s SUV, firing repeatedly until she died. \n \n At that moment, her 16-year-old daughter was walking out of a nearby band room. Hearing the shots, another student pulled her back inside and ran to alert others. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s when the whole school panicked,\u201d said 17-year-old Chris Mejia, High Point\u2019s senior class president. \n \n \n \n \n \n In March, at the behest of his wife, a civil court issued a protective order against Tordil for alleged abuse, according to court documents. In the filing, she claimed that her husband, a black belt in the martial-art form of aikido, subjected her children to \u201cintense-military-like discipline\u201d and that he struck her in 2010. \n \n \u201cHe threatened to harm me,\u201d she said, \u201cif I leave him.\u201d \n \n As a result of the order, his employer, the Federal Protective Service, put him on administrative duties and stripped him of his gun and badge. Authorities say they also confiscated a stockpile of his personal weapons. His wife indicated in the protective order that he owned .40-caliber and .45-caliber handguns, an M4 military carbine, a revolver and a \u201chunting gun.\u201d \n \n Under \u201cfavorite quotes\u201d on Tordil\u2019s Facebook page, it lists a single misspelled line: \u201cYou can ran, but you can\u2019t hide.\u201d \n \n Authorities tried to begin tracking Tordil immediately after the shooting at High Point. \n \n They had little to work with and were contending with a suspect whose career in law enforcement made him even harder to pursue, said Prince George\u2019s County Police Chief Henry P. Stawinski III. \n \n Tordil had turned off his phone 20 minutes before the first shooting and never turned it back on. Video of the shooting was grainy and showed only a silver sedan, but police quickly learned that he had leased the Elantra and knew the Pennsylvania license plate number. \n \n That provided them the only firm nugget of information to track their suspect. \n \n Police didn\u2019t release details about the car to the public Thursday night, fearing Tordil might catch on and abandon it, Stawin\u00adski said. But they did inform other law enforcement officers. \n \n \u201cHe is a police officer, and he would be doing countersurveillance on us and watching the media,\u201d the chief said. \u201cIf he knew we knew that was his car, he would get rid of the car.\u201d \n \n More than 100 undercover officers, homicide detectives and special patrol teams from Prince George\u2019s alone fanned throughout the region. The car\u2019s license tag was spotted around midnight, but Tordil eluded authorities throughout the night. \n \n The violence on Friday began about 11:15 a.m., police said, when Tordil fatally shot one man and wounded another man and a woman in the parking lot of Westfield Montgomery Mall. Police said they think that Tordil shot two of the three as they rushed to help the first victim. As of late Friday night, they said the wounded man was in critical condition and the woman in stable condition with non-life-threatining injuries. \n \n Jose Mauricio Gomez, 54, was eating lunch in his pickup when he heard six to eight shots. When a police officer pulled up next to him, Gomez realized that the crime scene was nearby. \n \n Neither man spotted the shooter, but they did see one victim, a woman with a shoulder wound. \n \n The officer asked the woman, who appeared to be in her 30s, whether she could stand. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s when blood shot out of the hole in her shoulder and he sat her back down,\u201d Gomez said. \n \n The only thing she talked about, he recalled, was how upset her husband was going to be. \n \n While at that scene, officers received a 911 call from the Giant grocery store in Aspen Hill, nine miles away, where a woman had been shot to death in her car. \n \n Soon after, a plainclothes officer spotted Tordil\u2019s car parked across the street from the grocery store, according to McCarthy. Investigators soon realized Tordil was still nearby after showing wanted fliers at area businesses. \n \n Tordil, McCarthy said, first got a cup of coffee at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, then went to Michaels craft store to \u201cbrowse around\u201d before heading to Boston Market, where he quietly ate lunch near a window. \n \n As many as 100 officers kept up surveillance but resisted closing in to avoid a bloody firefight in a bustling shopping area. \n \n \u201cWe needed to make sure the public was safe when we took him into custody,\u201d said Montgomery County Police Chief J. Thomas Manger. \u201cOur fear was he was armed, since he already shot four people today.\u201d \n \n When Tordil returned to his car, officers swarmed. \n \n He was soon led away in handcuffs, with either rain or sweat soaked through his jeans and light-brown polo. \n \n \u201cThe judgments made today by police saved a lot of lives,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThis went down exactly as planned.\u201d \n \n Authorities have no evidence that Tordil knew the people he has been accused of attacking on Friday, leaving investigators to sort through his motivation. \n \n It also remains unclear what led him to allegedly kill his wife, a mother of two teen girls who supported her children and family members in the Philippines. \n \n Gladys Tordil, who taught chemistry at Parkdale High, should have been honored this week \u2014 both for National Teacher Appreciation Week and Mother\u2019s Day \u2014 and not killed in front of her daughter, said Mejia, the student body president. \n \n \u201cMy niece had her as a teacher last year. She said she was a great person,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was always happy, always singing, always dancing.\u201d \n \n On the door of her classroom, more than 100 hand-scrawled sticky notes captured what she had meant to those left behind, a mosaic of memories on squares of pink, blue, green and yellow. \n \n Read one: \u201cTo the reason I\u2019m pursuing Chemistry.\u201d Another: \u201cThank you Mrs. Tordil!

(The Associated Press) \n \n \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on this any further until [congressional] committees have come to a conclusion,\u201d he said, while contrasting the media\u2019s alleged \u201clack\u201d of interest in these revelations with the intense coverage of suspected Trump-Russia links. \n \n When names of Americans are incidentally collected, they are supposed to be masked, meaning the name or names are redacted from reports \u2013 whether it is international or domestic collection, unless it is an issue of national security, crime or if their security is threatened in any way. There are loopholes and ways to unmask through backchannels, but Americans are supposed to be protected from incidental collection. Sources told Fox News that in this case, they were not. \n \n This comes in the wake of Evelyn Farkas\u2019 television interview last month in which the former Obama deputy secretary of defense said in part: \u201cI was urging my former colleagues and, frankly speaking, the people on the Hill \u2013 it was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people, get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can, before President Obama leaves the administration.\u201d \n \n Meanwhile, Fox News also is told that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes knew about unmasking and leaking back in January, well before President Trump\u2019s tweet in March alleging wiretapping. \n \n Nunes has faced criticism from Democrats for viewing pertinent documents on White House grounds and announcing their contents to the press. But sources said \u201cthe intelligence agencies slow-rolled Nunes. He could have seen the logs at other places besides the White House SCIF [secure facility], but it had already been a few weeks. So he went to the White House because he could protect his sources and he could get to the logs.\u201d \n \n As the Obama administration left office, it also approved new rules that gave the NSA much broader powers by relaxing the rules about sharing intercepted personal communications and the ability to share those with 16 other intelligence agencies. \n \n Rice is no stranger to controversy. As the U.S. Ambassador to the UN, she appeared on several Sunday news shows to defend the adminstration's later debunked claim that the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks on a U.S. consulate in Libya was triggered by an Internet video. \n \n Rice also told ABC News in 2014 that Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl \"served the United States with honor and distinction\" and that he \"wasn't simply a hostage; he was an American prisoner of war captured on the battlefield.\" \n \n Bergdahl is currently facing court-martial on charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy for allegedly walking off his post in Afghanistan. \n \n Adam Housley joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in 2001 and currently serves as a Los Angeles-based senior correspondent.", "Eli Lake is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering national security and foreign policy.

Read more opinion SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email \n \n Photographer: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Photographer: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images \n \n White House lawyers last month learned that the former national security adviser Susan Rice requested the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports on dozens of occasions that connect to the Donald Trump transition and campaign, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter. \n \n The pattern of Rice's requests was discovered in a National Security Council review of the government's policy on \"unmasking\" the identities of individuals in the U.S. who are not targets of electronic eavesdropping, but whose communications are collected incidentally. Normally those names are redacted from summaries of monitored conversations and appear in reports as something like \"U.S. Person One.\" \n \n Nunes Says Trump Team Caught in U.S. Surveillance Net \n \n The National Security Council's senior director for intelligence, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, was conducting the review, according to two U.S. officials who spoke with Bloomberg View on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. In February Cohen-Watnick discovered Rice's multiple requests to unmask U.S. persons in intelligence reports that related to Trump transition activities. He brought this to the attention of the White House General Counsel's office, who reviewed more of Rice's requests and instructed him to end his own research into the unmasking policy. \n \n The intelligence reports were summaries of monitored conversations -- primarily between foreign officials discussing the Trump transition, but also in some cases direct contact between members of the Trump team and monitored foreign officials. One U.S. official familiar with the reports said they contained valuable political information on the Trump transition such as whom the Trump team was meeting, the views of Trump associates on foreign policy matters and plans for the incoming administration. \n \n Rice did not respond to an email seeking comment on Monday morning. Her role in requesting the identities of Trump transition officials adds an important element to the dueling investigations surrounding the Trump White House since the president's inauguration. \n \n Both the House and Senate intelligence committees are probing any ties between Trump associates and a Russian influence operation against Hillary Clinton during the election. The chairman of the House intelligence committee, Representative Devin Nunes, is also investigating how the Obama White House kept tabs on the Trump transition after the election through unmasking the names of Trump associates incidentally collected in government eavesdropping of foreign officials. \n \n Rice herself has not spoken directly on the issue of unmasking. Last month when she was asked on the \"PBS NewsHour\" about reports that Trump transition officials, including Trump himself, were swept up in incidental intelligence collection, Rice said: \"I know nothing about this,\" adding, \"I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that account today.\" \n \n Rice's requests to unmask the names of Trump transition officials do not vindicate Trump's own tweets from March 4 in which he accused Obama of illegally tapping Trump Tower. There remains no evidence to support that claim. \n \n But Rice's multiple requests to learn the identities of Trump officials discussed in intelligence reports during the transition period does highlight a longstanding concern for civil liberties advocates about U.S. surveillance programs. The standard for senior officials to learn the names of U.S. persons incidentally collected is that it must have some foreign intelligence value, a standard that can apply to almost anything. This suggests Rice's unmasking requests were likely within the law. \n \n The news about Rice also sheds light on the strange behavior of Nunes in the last two weeks. It emerged last week that he traveled to the White House last month, the night before he made an explosive allegation about Trump transition officials caught up in incidental surveillance. At the time he said he needed to go to the White House because the reports were only on a database for the executive branch. It now appears that he needed to view computer systems within the National Security Council that would include the logs of Rice's requests to unmask U.S. persons. \n \n The ranking Democrat on the committee Nunes chairs, Representative Adam Schiff, viewed these reports on Friday. In comments to the press over the weekend he declined to discuss the contents of these reports, but also said it was highly unusual for the reports to be shown only to Nunes and not himself and other members of the committee. \n \n Indeed, much about this is highly unusual: if not how the surveillance was collected, then certainly how and why it was disseminated. \n \n This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners. \n \n To contact the author of this story: \n \n Eli Lake at elake1@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editor responsible for this story: \n \n Philip Gray at philipgray@bloomberg.net", "The panel on Morning Joe, Tuesday, was understandably befuddled by revelations that former White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice requested the unmasking of names of Trump transition officials. \n \n Hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski began by playing a clip of Rice on PBS denying claims made by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes that Trump and his team were monitored. \n \n \u201cI know nothing about this,\u201d said Rice. \u201cI was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re going to have an investigation of this,\u201d said show mainstay David Ignatius. \u201cWe\u2019ll begin to dig and learn what the facts were.

However, Rice did not spread the information according to this former official, who insisted that there was nothing improper or political involved. \n \n On Fox News\u2019s Special Report, it was a whole different story as they led the program with Rice\u2019s unmasking efforts. \u201cThe surveillance of people close to President Trump, possibly the President himself, now has a name and a face attached to it. And it's one you've seen in major scandals before,\u201d declared fill-in host James Rosen during the opening tease. \n \n \u201cTwo weeks ago, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee announced to the press and President he had uncovered a disturbing trend of intelligence collection on Trump officials, some of which was made public,\u201d reported Chief White House Correspondent John Roberts, \u201cToday, we learn more about the \u2018how\u2019 and \u2018who\u2019 of what's going on.\u201d \n \n The Fox News reporter noted that when it came to statements from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes about Trump aides being swept up in incidental collection, Rice claimed she didn't know anything. \u201cI know nothing about this. I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that count today,\u201d she claimed on PBS NewsHour on March 22. That is now exposed as a lie, just like then she lied about what caused the Benghazi attack. \n \n All of that and more went unreported on the Big Three networks. Ironically during Monday's White House press briefing, Press Secretary Sean Spicer called the media out for doing just that. \u201cI think that it is interesting the level or lack of interest that I've seen in these developments when it goes in one direction,\u201d he declared, referencing when the press rushed to wrongly finger NSC Director Ezra Cohen-Watnik as the source of Nunes\u2019 information.

Photo: Agence France-Presse/Getty Images \n \n Well, what do you know. On the matter of who \u201cunmasked\u201d the names of Trump transition officials in U.S. intelligence reports, we now have one answer: Susan Rice, Barack Obama\u2019s national security adviser. \n \n A U.S. intelligence official confirms to us the bombshell news, first reported Monday by Bloomberg, that Ms. Rice requested the name of at least one Trump transition official listed in an intelligence report in the months between Election Day and Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. \n \n Ms. Rice received summaries of U.S. eavesdropping either when foreign officials were discussing the Trump team, or when foreign officials were conversing with a Trump transition member. The surveillance was legally authorized, but the identities of U.S. citizens are typically masked so they cannot be known outside intelligence circles. Ms. Rice asked for and learned the identity of the Trump official, whose name hasn\u2019t been publicly disclosed and our source declined to share. \n \n Potomac Watch Podcast \n \n Our source did confirm that Ms. Rice also examined dozens of other intelligence summaries that technically masked Trump official identities but were written in such a way as to make obvious who those officials were. This means that the masking was essentially meaningless. All this is highly unusual\u2014and troubling. Unmasking does occur, but it is typically done by intelligence or law-enforcement officials engaged in antiterror or espionage investigations. Ms. Rice would have had no obvious need to unmask Trump campaign officials other than political curiosity. \n \n We\u2019re told by a source who has seen the unmasked documents that they included political information about the Trump transition team\u2019s meetings and policy intentions. We are also told that none of these documents had anything to do with Russia or the FBI investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. While we don't know if Ms. Rice requested these dozens of reports, we are told that they were only distributed to a select group of recipients\u2014conveniently including Ms. Rice. \n \n All of this helps to explain the actions in the last week of House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, the one official in Washington who seems interested in pursuing the evidence of politicized surveillance. Mr. Nunes was roundly criticized by Democrats and the media last week for publicly revealing at least one instance of Obama White House unmasking, albeit without disclosing any names. \n \n Now we know he is onto something. And we know that Mr. Nunes had to go to the White House to verify his information because the records containing Ms. Rice\u2019s unmasking request are held at the National Security Council. \n \n Where are the civil libertarians when you really need them? These columns support broad surveillance powers for national security, but executive officials need to be accountable if those powers are abused. If congressional oversight of U.S. intelligence operations is going to be worth the name, then it should include the unmasking of a political opponent by a senior official in the White House. \n \n Democrats certainly raised a fuss during the Bush years and after Edward Snowden kicked off the debate about \u201cmetadata,\u201d which are merely telephone numbers without names. Oregon Senator Ron Wyden went so far as to introduce a bill in 2013 to strengthen the ban on \u201creverse targeting\u201d\u2014in which intelligence agencies surveil foreigners but with the goal of capturing U.S. citizen communications. \n \n Yet now that there\u2019s evidence that the Obama Administration may have unmasked Trump officials, Democrats couldn\u2019t care less. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on House Intelligence, has spent the past week denouncing Mr. Nunes for revealing that a name was unmasked and for having sources at the White House. But he hasn\u2019t raised a peep about the unmasking itself or who was behind it. \n \n The news about Ms. Rice\u2019s unmasking role raises a host of questions for the Senate and House intelligence committees to pursue. What specific surveillance information did Ms. Rice seek and why? Was this information related to President Obama\u2019s decision in January to make it possible for raw intelligence to be widely disbursed throughout the government? Was this surveillance of Trump officials \u201cincidental\u201d collection gathered while listening to a foreigner, or were some Trump officials directly targeted, or \u201creverse targeted\u201d? \n \n We were unable to locate Ms. Rice Monday to ask for comment, and she hasn\u2019t addressed the unmasking as far as we know.

By all means follow that evidence where it leads. But the media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the Obama Administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes. Americans deserve to know the truth about both."], "summary": "\u2013 Former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice is back in the news again, this time regarding President Trump's wiretapping allegations. On the right, she is being accused of abusing her power while in office to \"unmask,\" for political advantage, the names of Trump associates caught up in intelligence surveillance. Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed\u2014she didn't respond to the story\u2014but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. 'Spied on before nomination.' The real story.\" A post at Slate notes that Trump associates are under FBI investigation over allegedly improper communications with Russians, \"so there may well have been urgent, legal reasons for Rice to have wanted information about the relationships between specific Trump-related figures and foreign individuals.\" But the editorial page at the Wall Street Journal accuses the media and Democrats of hypocrisy. It wants any Trump-Russia ties investigated, but complains that the \"media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the Obama Administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes. Americans deserve to know the truth about both.\" On CNN, Don Lemon accused the \"right-wing media\" of helping the White House try to divert attention from the controversy over Trump's wiretapping claims, adding that his show will not \"aid and abet people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion,\" he said, per Mediaite. The conservative NewsBusters blog accused ABC, NBC, and CBS of covering up the story by failing to report on the \"massive revelation\" Monday in their evening broadcasts. On MSNBC Tuesday morning, frequent Trump critic Joe Scarborough blasted the New York Times for not having the story on its front page. \"What is Susan Rice unmasking names for and spreading them across the government,\" he asked on Morning Joe, per Mediaite. But the Times story on the subject (inside the paper) generally downplayed the significance of Rice's requests: \"Former national security officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the requests as normal and said they were justified by the need for the president\u2019s top security adviser to understand the context of reports sent to her by the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies.\"", "ranking": [3, 0, 4, 2, 1]}

Indeed, Ford says the F-450 Limited 4x4 can tow the equivalent of an F-35 fighter jet, which for those of you outside the aerospace industry means 30,000 pounds. Rather, Ford is adamant \u2013 almost boasting even \u2013 that the Limited starts at $80,835 for the F-250, and can reach $94,455 for a loaded F-450. For the record, that\u2019s enough coin to put you in the driver\u2019s seat of a new Mercedes-Benz S-Class \u2013 a vehicle considered by many to be the pinnacle of luxury and technology. \n \n Other Pickup News: \n \n 2017 Ford F-250 Super Duty Review: Rockin\u2019 the ranch, not the suburbs \n \n Chevy Debuts Heritage Bowtie Badge For Special Edition Silverado \n \n 2018 Ram Works Down On The Farm With New Harvest Edition Pickups \n \n Granted, we\u2019re comparing apples to oranges here, but that\u2019s some serious coin for a pickup truck designed first and foremost to be a workhorse. Ford feels the new Limited series will be the pinnacle of pickup luxury and technology, however, and its list of features is an enviable one at that. Two-tone Camelback leather adorns the seats, of which the front are both heated and ventilated while rear seats are only heated. The headliner is Miko suede, or at least, the parts not affected by a panoramic moonroof. Dark ash wood trim is found throughout the interior, and for those who love numbers, each Limited will have its serial number laser-etched on the center console armrest. \n \n From a technology standpoint, Super Duty Limited models get a host of driving assists as standard equipment, including blind-spot monitoring, adaptive steering and cruise control, lane-keeping alerts, and forward collision warnings with brake support. A 360-degree camera with trailer reverse assistance will help drivers maneuver the rig, and because these trucks are designed to pull things, the blind spot monitoring offers trailer coverage as well. \n \n \u00a9 motor1.com \n \n Outside, the extra bling is relegated a satin-finish twin-bar grille with chrome accents, flanked by quad-beam LED headlamps. The satin look is carried around the back on the tailgate as well. As for power, Ford lists the 6.7-liter Power Stroke V8 diesel as the only engine option across the Limited line. Rated at 440 horsepower and 925 pound-feet of torque, it should be plenty to pull even the largest trailers across the country. \n \n Ford is confident that the luxury-minded Super Duty Limited series will have buyers, saying that it\u2019s a truck for \u201csuccessful ranchers to contractors to RV owners.\u201d To back that up, the automaker points out that Lariat, King Ranch and Platinum trim levels account for over half of its Super Duty sales for 2017. Still, Ford is keen to tell the, um, less successful ranchers that the base-model F-250 XL starts at $32,890. \n \n The new F-Series Super Duty Limited will arrive at Ford dealerships this winter in either single or dual-rear-wheel configurations. \n \n Source: Ford", "Luxury pickup trucks aren't just a fad. Many buyers want that one-car balance that covers both comfort and capability. If that's what you're after, consider Ford's latest, which can run up to nearly $100,000. \n \n The Ford F-Series Super Duty Limited is the cream of the crop of Ford's heavy-duty pickup lineup. It's meant for, as Ford says, \"boat captains to captains of industry,\" and it brings both luxury appointments and outright capability to the table in a way that's hard to top. \n \n This truck even looks fancy, thanks to a special chrome-accented grille, LED headlights and a satin tailgate appliqu\u00e9. Inside, it's like a luxury apartment, with two-tone leather seats, hand-finished dark ash trim and leather-wrapped parts as far as the eye can see. \n \n Enlarge Image Ford \n \n The VIN is also laser-etched into the center console armrest, because when you're spending nearly six figures on a pickup, you want it to feel as special as humanly possible. \n \n The Super Duty Limited is also packed to the gills with Ford's latest truck tech. The infotainment system runs Ford's new Sync 3. A 360-degree camera makes parking a breeze, and there's a dial that makes reversing with a trailer just about the easiest thing ever. It can warn you when you leave the lane, and it even packs forward collision warning, a rarity in the pickup segment. \n \n Equipped with Ford's 6.7-liter Power Stroke diesel V8, the F-Series Super Duty Limited can tow up to 30,000 pounds. Ford points out that this is roughly the weight of the Air Force's F-35 fighter. Odds are, if you can drop this much on a truck, you probably own the plane already. \n \n This truck does not come cheap. The F-250 Limited starts at $80,835 including destination.

He got it.\u201d \n \n After Ali beat Sonny Liston for the heavyweight belt, he faced being drafted to the Vietnam War, and refused \u2013 provoking a three-plus-year absence from the ring and serving as a lightning rod during the height of the civil rights era. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s hard for people 50 or younger to realize what this country was like in the 1950s and \u201860s, how bad it was for African-Americans in this country \u2013 how they fought just to eat at a lunch counter or stay at a hotel,\u201d Arum said. \u201cThere was no opportunity. \n \n \u201cAli spoke out against that in a way that really connected with people, even more than the melodic and philosophical way that Martin Luther King Jr. spoke out. Because Ali was a great sportsman and boxer, he was able to reach people and, I think, had a tremendous effect on bringing change to this country.\u201d \n \n No act was more principled than giving up massive boxing purses to defy the draft, Arum said. \n \n \u201cOnce people saw that he sacrificed his livelihood for what he believed in, that really elevated him in the minds of people to be almost saint-like,\u201d Arum said. \u201cEverybody, myself included, counseled him not to take that step that led him to not fight for three and a half years, but he felt he was doing the right thing. And it ended up that it was the right thing \u2013 for him, the world and the country.\u201d \n \n Ali proceeded to return to the ring against Joe Frazier in an epic 1971 showdown, then recaptured the heavyweight belt by knocking out Foreman in 1974 in Africa. Ali quickly avenged a 1978 loss to Leon Spinks for the third union with the belt. \n \n \u201cHis story and his character and his life will be part of history that will be studied by whoever looks back on the last 50 years,\u201d said Arum, who promoted 26 Ali bouts, including the 1975 trilogy capping \u201cThrilla in Manila\u201d fight with Frazier that is seen as the beginning of the brain damage that plagued his later life. \n \n Foreman remembers learning a few lessons inside and outside the ring from Ali. \n \n \"Back in the time that Joe Frazier, Ali and I were going strong, they called us all great fighters. There's no question the greatest of all was Muhammad Ali,\" Foreman said Friday night. \"I never had any animosity toward him. Never. I always respected him and I learned from him.\" \n \n Foreman said what he learned most was how to get along with reporters and to be more clever in the ring -- an asset that allowed Foreman to recapture a heavyweight belt 20 years after the \"Rumble in the Jungle.\" \n \n Oscar De La Hoya, who fought in front of Ali sitting ringside in the first bout at Staples Center in 2000, said in a prepared statement, \"Muhammad Ali is ... the fighter who ushered in the golden era of boxing and put the sport on the map. He paved the way for professional fighters including myself, elevating boxing to become a sport watched in millions of households around the world. \n \n \"Ali's talent was undeniable ... beyond his incredible talent, he also made boxing interesting. Ali was fearless in the ring, and took on the toughest, most challenging opponents. Ali exemplified courage -- he never took the easy route, something to be admired in and outside of the ring. \n \n \"Let us remember a man who pursued greatness in everything he did and be inspired to hold ourselves to that same standard. Rest in peace, my friend.\" \n \n Former champion boxer Manny Pacquiao weighed in from the Philippines. \n \n \u201cWe lost a giant today,\u201d said Pacquiao, who was inspired by Ali\u2019s devotion to the public and was recently elected to a Senate seat in his country. \u201cBoxing benefited from Muhammad Ali's talents, but not nearly as much as mankind benefited from his humanity. Our hearts and prayers go out to the Ali family. May God bless them.\u201d \n \n Arum witnessed Ali\u2019s standing as the most well-known person in the world when he accompanied the then-retired icon to China to promote a boxing show in the early 1990s, after the country banned the sport during Ali\u2019s reign. \n \n \u201cGoing through customs, there were these massive groups of Chinese that recognized him and went crazy. I was stunned,\u201d Arum said. \u201cHe was a magical person and obviously the most amazing person I\u2019ve had the privilege of being around in my lifetime.\u201d \n \n Lance.pugmire@latimes.com \n \n Twitter: @latimespugmire", "Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Seven weeks after arriving, the patient -- who also spent time in Missouri and Tennessee -- sought treatment and was diagnosed with active tuberculosis. \n \n She has an extensively drug-resistant form of tuberculosis, or XDR-TB, which is a relatively rare form of the disease that is resistant to at least four of the core anti-TB drugs, according to the World Health Organization \n \n Contact tracing is underway, and the CDC is seeking people who may have had prolonged close contact with the woman, including those who sat in the same row or near the woman on the flight. \n \n \"The likelihood that this person transmitted the illness is low, but this is a very serious illness so we can't take any chances, and need to get the close contacts in for testing,\" said Tom Skinner, a spokesperson at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"TB is a very serious illness and the XDRTB version is difficult to treat.\" \n \n Read More", "(PDFCdc-pdf \u2013 421k) \n \n Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR TB) \n \n What is Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR TB)? \n \n Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB) is a rare type of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) that is resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, plus any fluoroquinolone and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). MDR TB is caused by an organism that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, the two most potent TB drugs. \n \n How is XDR TB spread? \n \n Drug-susceptible TB and XDR TB are spread the same way. TB bacteria are put into the air when a person with TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, sneezes, shouts, or sings. These bacteria can float in the air for several hours, depending on the environment. Persons who breathe in the air containing these TB bacteria can become infected. \n \n TB is not spread by \n \n shaking someone\u2019s hand \n \n sharing food or drink \n \n touching bed linens or toilet seats \n \n sharing toothbrushes \n \n kissing \n \n Why is XDR TB so serious? \n \n Because XDR TB is resistant to the most potent TB drugs, the remaining treatment options are less effective, have more side effects, and are more expensive. XDR TB is of special concern for persons with HIV infection or other conditions that can weaken the immune system. These persons are more likely to develop TB disease once they are infected, and they also have a higher risk of death if they develop TB disease. \n \n Who is at risk for getting XDR TB? \n \n Drug-resistant TB (MDR or XDR) is more common in people who: \n \n Do not take their TB medicine regularly \n \n Do not take all of their TB medicines as prescribed by their doctor \n \n Develop TB disease again, after having taken TB medicine in the past \n \n Come from areas of the world where drug-resistant TB is common \n \n Have spent time with someone known to have drug-resistant TB disease \n \n How can I prevent myself from getting TB? \n \n Avoid close contact for a prolonged period of time with known TB patients in crowded, enclosed environments like clinics, hospitals, prisons, or homeless shelters. \n \n Can the TB vaccine (BCG) help prevent XDR TB? \n \n The TB vaccine is called Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), and it is used in many countries to prevent severe forms of TB in children. However, BCG is not generally recommended in the United States because it has limited effectiveness for preventing the most common forms of TB and in preventing TB in adults. The effect of BCG against XDR TB would likely be similar to the effect on drug-susceptible TB. \n \n If I have drug-susceptible TB, how can I prevent getting drug-resistant TB? \n \n The most important thing is for you to continue taking all your TB medicines exactly as prescribed. No doses should be missed and treatment should not be stopped early. You should tell your health care provider if you are having trouble taking the medications or if you have any side effects. If you plan to travel, talk with your health care provider, and make sure you have enough medicine to last while away. \n \n Can XDR TB be treated and cured? \n \n Yes, in some cases. Some TB control programs have shown that cure is possible for an estimated 30% to 50% of affected people. Successful outcomes depend greatly on the extent of the drug resistance, the severity of the disease, whether the patient\u2019s immune system is weakened, and adherence to treatment. \n \n What are the symptoms of XDR TB? \n \n The general symptoms of TB disease include feelings of sickness or weakness, weight loss, fever, and night sweats. The symptoms of TB disease of the lungs may also include coughing, chest pain, and coughing up blood. Symptoms of TB disease in other parts of the body depend on the area affected. If you have these symptoms, you should contact your doctor or local health department. \n \n What should I do if I have been around someone who has XDR TB? \n \n If you think you have been exposed to someone with XDR TB disease, you should contact your doctor or local health department about getting a TB skin test or blood test for TB infection. You should tell the doctor or nurse when you spent time with this person. You should also tell the doctor or nurse where the person with XDR TB is being treated. It will be important to know about this person\u2019s treatment. If your test for TB infection is positive, you will need special follow up. \n \n How long does it take to find out if you have XDR TB? \n \n If TB bacteria are found in the sputum (phlegm), the diagnosis of TB can be made in a day or two, but this finding will not be able to distinguish between drug-susceptible TB and drug-resistant TB. To determine drug susceptibility, the bacteria need to be grown and tested in a specialized laboratory. Final diagnosis for TB, and especially for XDR TB, may take from 6 to 16 weeks. \n \n Is XDR TB a problem in the United States? \n \n The risk of acquiring XDR TB in the United States appears to be low because XDR TB is uncommon in the U.S. However, TB can spread easily. As long as XDR TB exists, the risk to people in the United States is not zero, and the U.S. public health system must address the threat. \n \n How many cases of XDR TB have been reported in the United States? \n \n In the United States, 63 cases of XDR TB have been reported between 1993 and 2011*. \n \n *The National Tuberculosis Surveillance System (NTSS) 1993-2011. \n \n Is it safe to travel to countries where cases of XDR TB have been reported? \n \n Although MDR and XDR TB are occurring globally, they are still rare. HIV-infected travelers are at greatest risk if they come in contact with a person with MDR or XDR TB. \n \n All travelers should avoid high risk settings where there are no infection control measures in place. Documented places where transmission has occurred include crowded hospitals, prisons, homeless shelters, and other settings where susceptible persons come in contact with persons with TB disease. \n \n What can health care providers do to prevent XDR TB? \n \n Health care providers can help prevent MDR and XDR TB by quickly diagnosing TB cases, following recommended treatment guidelines, monitoring patients\u2019 response to treatment, and making sure therapy is completed. \n \n Providers should also ensure proper implementation of infection control procedures to prevent exposure to TB in hospitals or health-care settings where TB patients are likely to be seen. \n \n Why does there seem to be more cases of XDR TB now than there were in the past? \n \n In 2006, CDC, the World Health Organization (WHO), and other global leaders in TB reported the results of a survey regarding drug-resistant TB conducted by 25 reference laboratories comprising the Global Supranational TB Reference Laboratory Network, the National TB Surveillance System in the United States, the national reference laboratory of South Korea, and the national MDR TB patient registry in Latvia. The findings indicated that 20% of M. tuberculosis isolates were MDR, and 2% also were resistant to many additional TB drugs. This highly resistant form of TB was identified in every region of the world where there was lab capacity to identify it. In a report published in 2006, the highly resistant form of TB was named extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB). Since then, more countries have improved their laboratory capacity to test for XDR TB and their ability to report XDR TB. These factors have contributed to an apparent increase in drug-resistant TB because of better diagnosis and better reporting. \n \n What is CDC doing to prevent XDR TB from becoming a bigger problem? \n \n CDC is collaborating with other federal agencies and international partners to raise awareness and enhance strategies for TB prevention worldwide by: \n \n Strengthening TB services for people living with HIV/AIDS; \n \n Guiding preparedness and outbreak investigation responses; \n \n Improving access to TB drugs; \n \n Conducting routine surveillance (including drug susceptibility) and periodic surveys; \n \n Implementing new, rapid diagnostic tests; \n \n Developing and promoting, national and international TB testing standards; \n \n Conducting program evaluation (e.g., National TB Indicators Project [NTIP]); \n \n Building capacity of health care providers to diagnose and treat TB; \n \n Reinvigorating the Federal TB Task Force; \n \n Providing assistance to improve TB program capacity in the U.S. and abroad; and \n \n Developing education, risk, and media communications (Web- and print-based) to aid in preparedness and public awareness of TB prevention and control issues. \n \n Additional Information \n \n CDC.

CDC\u2019s Role in Preventing XDR TB", "Frequently asked questions - XDR-TB \n \n 1. What is XDR-TB? \n \n XDR-TB, an abbreviation for extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), is a form of TB which is resistant to at least four of the core anti-TB drugs. XDR-TB involves resistance to the two most powerful anti-TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin, also known as multidrug-resistance (MDR-TB), in addition to resistance to any of the fluoroquinolones (such as ofloxacin or moxifloxacin) and to at least one of three injectable second-line drugs (amikacin, capreomycin or kanamycin). MDR-TB and XDR-TB both take substantially longer to treat than ordinary (drug-susceptible) TB, and require the use of second-line anti-TB drugs, which are more expensive and have more side-effects than the first-line drugs used for drug-susceptible TB. \n \n 2. How do people get XDR-TB? \n \n People may get XDR-TB in one of two ways. It may develop in a patient who is receiving treatment for active TB, when anti-TB drugs are misused or mismanaged, and is usually a sign of inadequate clinical care or drug management. It can happen when patients are not properly supported to complete their full course of treatment; when health-care providers prescribe the wrong treatment, or the wrong dose, or for too short a period of time; when the supply of drugs to the clinics dispensing drugs is erratic; or when the drugs are of poor quality. \n \n \n \n The second way that people can develop XDR-TB is by becoming infected from a patient who is already ill with the condition. Patients with TB of the lungs can spread the disease by coughing, sneezing, or simply talking. A person needs only to breathe in a small number of these germs to become infected. However only a small proportion of people infected with TB germs develop the disease. A person can be infected by XDR-TB bacteria but not develop the active disease, just as with drug-susceptible TB \n \n 3. How easily is XDR-TB spread? \n \n Studies suggest that there is probably no difference between the risk of transmission of XDR-TB and any other forms of TB. The spread of TB bacteria depends on factors such as the number and concentration of infectious people in any one place together, and the presence of people with a higher risk of being infected (such as those with HIV/AIDS). The likelihood of becoming infected increases with the time that a previously uninfected person spends in the same room as an infectious case. The risk of spread increases where there is a high concentration of TB bacteria, such as can occur in poorly-ventilated environments like overcrowded houses, hospitals or prisons. The risk of spread is reduced if infectious patients receive timely and proper treatment. \n \n 4. How can a person avoid becoming infected with XDR-TB? \n \n While patients with XDR-TB may be as infectious as those with ordinary TB, the chances of a TB infection being XDR-TB is lower due to the rarity of the condition. The measures to be taken are the same as those for the prevention of ordinary TB. Close contact with a patient with infectious TB is to be avoided especially in poorly ventilated spaces. The risk of becoming infected with TB is very low outdoors in the open air. TB patients should be encouraged to follow good cough hygiene, for example, covering their mouths with a handkerchief when they cough, or even, in the early stages of treatment, using a surgical mask, especially when in closed environments with poor ventilation. \n \n 5. How can a person who already has ordinary TB avoid getting XDR-TB? \n \n The most important thing is for the health care workers and community to provide all the means (information, counselling, and material support) that enable patients to continue taking all their treatment as prescribed. No doses should be missed and above all, treatment should be taken right through to the end. If a patient finds that side-effects are a problem, for example, the tablets make them feel sick, then they should inform their doctor or nurse, because often there is a simple solution. If they need to go away for any reason, patients should make sure they have enough tablets with them for the duration of the trip. \n \n 6. Can XDR-TB be cured or treated? \n \n XDR-TB patients can be cured, but with the current drugs available, the likelihood of success is much smaller than in patients with ordinary TB or even MDR-TB. Cure depends on the extent of the drug resistance, the severity of the disease and whether the patient\u2019s immune system is compromised. Patients infected with HIV may have a higher mortality. Early and accurate diagnosis are important so that effective treatment is provided as soon as possible. Effective treatment requires that a good selection of second-line drugs is available to clinicians who have special expertise in treating such cases. \n \n 7. How common is XDR-TB? \n \n XDR-TB is rare, however 77 countries worldwide had reported at least one case by the end of 2011. Information from countries with reliable data suggests that about 9% of MDR-TB cases worldwide have XDR-TB. WHO estimates that there are about 650,000 MDR-TB cases in the world at any one time. Only a small proportion of these cases are detected and treated appropriately given that many low and lower middle-income countries still lack sufficient diagnostic capacity to detect MDR/XDR-TB. \n \n 8. How do countries prevent XDR-TB? \n \n National TB control programmes working with all health services can prevent XDR-TB by ensuring that all practitioners working with people with TB adhere to the International Standards for TB Care. These emphasize providing proper diagnosis and treatment to all TB patients, including those with drug-resistant TB; assuring regular, timely supplies of all anti-TB drugs; proper management of anti-TB drugs and providing support to patients to maximize adherence to prescribed regimens; caring for MDR/XDR-TB cases in services with proper ventilation, and minimizing contact with other patients, particularly those with HIV, especially in the early stages before treatment has had a chance to reduce the infectiousness. \n \n 9. Can the TB vaccine, known as BCG, prevent XDR-TB? \n \n The BCG vaccine prevents severe forms of TB in children, such as TB meningitis, but is less effective in preventing pulmonary TB in adults, the commonest and most infectious form of TB. It is expected that the effectiveness of BCG against XDR-TB is similar as for ordinary TB. Nevertheless, new vaccines are urgently needed, and WHO is actively advocating for the development of new vaccines. \n \n 10. What is the link between XDR-TB and HIV/AIDS? Why in some places is XDR-TB linked with HIV? \n \n People living with HIV are at greater risk of developing TB \u2013 as well as XDR-TB - than people without HIV, because of their weakened immunity. In few places where XDR-TB strains circulate more frequently, people with HIV are therefore more likely to be infected with XDR-TB than elsewhere. To date, in most of the places with high rates of HIV infection, XDR-TB has not been widespread. For this reason, the majority of people with HIV who develop TB will have ordinary TB and can be treated with standard first-line anti-TB drugs. For those with HIV infection, treatment with antiretroviral drugs will likely reduce the risk of developing XDR-TB, just as it does with ordinary TB. Patients with both XDR-TB and HIV who do not receive antiretroviral drugs are at high risk of dying. \n \n 11. How can I tell if I might have TB or XDR-TB? \n \n XDR-TB can only be diagnosed in a well-equipped laboratory. Symptoms of XDR-TB are no different from ordinary TB: a cough with thick, cloudy mucus (or sputum), sometimes with blood, for more than 2 weeks; fever, chills, and night sweats; fatigue and muscle weakness; weight loss; and in some cases shortness of breath and chest pain. If you have these symptoms, it does not mean you have XDR-TB. But it does mean you must go and see a doctor for a check-up. If you are already on treatment for TB, and at least some of these symptoms are not improving after a few weeks of medication, you should inform your clinician or nurse. \n \n 12. How quickly can XDR-TB be diagnosed? \n \n If TB bacteria are found in the sputum, the diagnosis of TB can be made in a day or two. To confirm XDR-TB, however, it may take from 6 to 16 weeks. \n \n 13. Is it safe to travel to places where XDR-TB has been identified? \n \n XDR-TB is still very rare but has been documented in many countries. People who are most at risk, if they do come into contact with someone with XDR-TB, are those with reduced immunity to infectious diseases, such as those with HIV infection or other medical conditions that can weaken a person's immunity. It is also advised that such people should avoid areas where there are no infection control measures in place. Air travel carries only very minimal risks of infection with any kind of TB. Concerned travellers should seek advice before their visit from their doctor, national authorities, or trusted travel web sites such as www.who.int/topics/travel . \n \n 14. What should be done if a person has been in contact with a known or suspected case of XDR-TB? \n \n Anyone who has been in contact with someone known, or suspected of having, XDR-TB should consult their doctor or a local TB clinic and be screened to see if they have TB. This is most important if the person has any symptoms of TB. If they have a cough, they will be asked to provide a sample of sputum, which will be tested for evidence of TB disease. If TB is found, treatment will be started with the drugs to which the person\u2019s TB is most likely to respond. If there is any evidence of infection with TB bacteria but without TB disease, preventive treatment may be given or the person may simply be asked to attend health services periodically for a check up. \n \n 15. Should patients with XDR-TB be isolated while on treatment or after treatment options have failed? \n \n In order to make the diagnosis, patients with suspected TB or XDR-TB are sometimes admitted to hospital. In order to protect other patients and health workers in the hospital, isolation of such patients is part of good quality care. Once the diagnosis is made and treatment begun, for patients who are willing to undergo treatment, isolation is usually neither necessary nor appropriate. Isolation has a very limited role to play in patients in whom treatment has failed. Studies have shown that treating TB patients at home with appropriate infection measures in place generally poses no substantial risk to other members of the household. By the time a diagnosis is made, the household contacts have already been exposed to the patient\u2019s infection. However, in the absence of options for curative treatment, all infection control measures at household should be strengthened. Whenever this is not feasible then options for voluntary isolation and delivery of palliative and end of life care should be offered to the patient. \n \n 16. What risks do health-care workers face with XDR-TB, particularly those who may be HIV-positive themselves? \n \n To protect health-care workers who may come into contact with infectious TB patients, appropriate and strict infection control measures must be implemented in health-care facilities at all times. Health-care workers are also encouraged to make sure that they are aware of their HIV status so that they can restrict putting themselves at risk of exposure. \n \n 18. What is WHO doing to combat XDR-TB? \n \n Firstly, WHO is ensuring that the health authorities responsible for TB care and control receive accurate information about XDR-TB. Latest information on XDR-TB, and related TB issues, are published on the WHO Stop TB website. Secondly, WHO advises that good TB prevention, care and control prevents the emergence of drug resistance in the first place, and that the proper treatment of MDR-TB prevents the emergence of XDR-TB. Thirdly, WHO is regularly updating its guidance to Ministries of Health on the management of drug-resistant TB patients and diagnostic policies. \n \n Further information \n \n Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

{"document": ["By \n \n GQ recently unveiled its list of the 50 Most Powerful People in Washington, a look at who's up in the nation's status-obsessed capital. But power is fluid in Washington, and it's wielded in ever-changing ways, from the city's establishment bosses to its hungry young strivers. So now we're bringing you the most powerful person in D.C. this week (and the least powerful): a mini-guide to the players in American politics and why they matter now. \n \n \n \n Most Powerful Person in Politics: Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State \n \n Those who doubt Hillary's viability in 2016 should take note of the viral meme \"Texts From Hillary.\" It's a Tumblr that pairs a photo of HRC looking like a boss on a C-17 with even more boss quotes, retweeted ad infinitum this week. How much do Washington women love the texts? \"For attribution: omgsomuch,\" EMILY's List spokesperson Jess McIntosh emails. \"It's just the idea that Hillary is a force to be reckoned with, and she is still very relevant among Americans,\" says Stacy Lambe, one of D.C.'s young communications professionals who came up with the idea with a friend over drinks last week. \"We just captured on a simple idea about who she is, this whole 'head bitch, in-charge, badass' image that the photo itself demonstrated and we just had fun with that. It wasn't a commentary on anything, but the success might be due to the fact that there's this appreciation for her that has grown since she took over as Secretary of State. I think people have learned to appreciate who she is and value her again.\" \n \n", "Clinton: Stop talking. \n \n Worried woman: It\u2019s 3 a.m. and I think something\u2019s happening. \n \n Clinton: On it. \n \n Like most Internet sensations, the \u201cTexts from Hillary\u201d took a winding path from artifact to thing. When the photo first appeared last fall, a blogger from Reuters suggested that it made Clinton look bad: stuck on a plane, overloaded with work, falling asleep in her chair. \u201cQuick quiz,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou realize your job may sort of suck if you . . . are trying to read your PDA with your sunglasses on.\u201d \n \n But when the photo turned up, inexplicably, on his Facebook feed last week, Adam Smith saw it differently. Smith, 29, who works for a campaign-finance nonprofit in Washington, D.C., reposted the shot on Twitter with a comment along the lines of, \u201cHave you seen how fierce Hillary is in this picture?\u201d \n \n Last Wednesday at a bar, Smith showed the photo to his friend Stacy Lambe, 26, who works for a D.C. communications firm. \u201cI said, \u2018Have you seen this Hillary picture? I think we could make a meme out of it\u2019 \u201d Smith told me by phone. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Texts from Hillary.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Done.\u2019 \u201d They went home and started a Tumblr blog, and before long, people were sending suggestions of their own. \n \n Nearly every contribution falls along the same theme: Hillary\u2019s not beleaguered, she\u2019s in charge. This is the story the photo tells. The frown makes her seem impatient. The sunglasses make her look aloof, but also glamorous. Gone are the man\u2019s-world accessories, the pantsuit and masculine haircut. Secretary Clinton is a woman, comfortably feminine, with long blonde hair, a chunky necklace, a giant broach. \n \n And, crucially, she\u2019s texting. In an age of impersonal communications, there\u2019s no medium more distant or nonchalant. Texting requires no utterance, no grammar, no coherent thought, and barely any physical effort. (The other day, a friend texted me: \u201ck.\u201d I knew what she meant.) To send a text is to say, \u201cI\u2019m sending you this message with my thumbs. That\u2019s all you get of me.\u201d", "It\u2019s been an overwhelming\u2013and hilarious\u2013week for us here at Texts from Hillary (TFH). What started as a joke at the bar between two friends turned into a national conversation about Secretary Clinton and went as far as talks about 2016. \n \n \n \n After a week that included 32 posts, 83,000 shares on Facebook, 8,400 Twitter followers, over 45K Tumblr followers, news stories around the world, Renee Montagne from Morning Edition saying \u201cROFL,\u201d a Maureen Dowd column, and a tweet from ?uest Love, we think it\u2019s time to stop while we are ahead. \n \n As far as memes go \u2013 it has gone as far as it can go. Is it really possible to top a submission from the Secretary herself? No. But then when you get to text with her in real life \u2013 it\u2019s just over. At least for us. But we have no doubt it will live on with all of you on the Internet. \n \n The site will stay up but we won\u2019t be posting anything new here. You can follow us on Twitter (@ASmith83, @Sllambe) and Tumblr (Stacy at ImWithKanye and Adam\u2019s work account, Public Campaign Action Fund). \n \n \n \n Thanks for all the LOLz. We truly appreciate all the support. \n \n It turns out that memes really do come true. \n \n \n \n -Stacy and Adam", "So it's week two and we're still talking about Texts From Hillary, the simple-yet-brilliant meme started by D.C.-based communications professionals Stacy Lambe and Adam Smith. \n \n Here's why it works: Most memes make fun of their subjects. This one is all about respect. As Peggy Noonan of The Wall Street Journal said yesterday, Hillary Clinton is \"one of the few people who is in the Obama administration whose reputation from her work there has been enhanced as opposed to roughened.\" Where Obama, Biden, Gates, Geithner et al have suffered gray hairs and waning enthusiasm, Clinton \u2014 who entered the administration as Obama's graying runner-up \u2014 has undergone a reinvention and seems more powerful and unflappable than ever. \n \n Two takes from today: \n \n Benjy Sarlin, Talking Points Memo: \n \n Her 2008 campaign, which once seemed a cautionary tale about hubris, looks at least somewhat better with age. Obama touted a unifying national message in his run against Clinton, suggesting that Clinton\u2019s scars from decades of battling Republicans would make it difficult to ever be effective in the White House. Now Obama\u2019s post-partisan vision has given way to a tough dogfight of a general election in which he\u2019s running against the intransigent Republican party\u2019s \u201cthinly veiled social Darwinism.\u201d And Clinton\u2019s popularity \u2014 including with Republicans \u2014 has never been higher, prompting yet another boomlet of interest in a 2016 presidential run. \n \n Marin Cogan, GQ's Death Race 2012:", "What a difference four years makes: When she was running for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton was parodied as drab and calculated, especially compared with young and vigorous Barack Obama and winking and fresh-faced Sarah Palin. Now, she\u2019s fueling Internet jokes based on her own brand of badass cool. \n \n More than just an image rebound, Clinton is enjoying a genuine resurgence. \n \n Her 2008 campaign, which once seemed a cautionary tale about hubris, looks at least somewhat better with age. Obama touted a unifying national message in his run against Clinton, suggesting that Clinton\u2019s scars from decades of battling Republicans would make it difficult to ever be effective in the White House. \n \n Now Obama\u2019s post-partisan vision has given way to a tough dogfight of a general election in which he\u2019s running against the intransigent Republican party\u2019s \u201cthinly veiled social Darwinism.\u201d And Clinton\u2019s popularity \u2014 including with Republicans \u2014 has never been higher, prompting yet another boomlet of interest in a 2016 presidential run. \n \n Part of this is the nature of her position. The secretary of State has traditionally been an apolitical figure and, consequently, those who have held the position have often enjoyed higher approval ratings than their boss. Clinton has held fast to this tradition and avoided injecting herself into the day\u2019s hot-button issues. There are some occasional exceptions \u2014 last month she told MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell that she was glad to see Rush Limbaugh\u2019s screed against law student Sandra Fluke draw widespread condemnation. \n \n Still, given how well established \u2014 and polarizing \u2014 a political figure Clinton was considered prior to her appointment compared to many of her predecessors, the scale of her popularity is impressive. A recent Gallup poll showed her favorability rating reach new heights at 66 percent, including 40 percent of Republicans who view her positively, an astronomical figure for a prominent Democrat these days. From the public\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s settled easily into a behind-the-scenes role as a loyal and competent secretary of State. \n \n Her lower visibility seems to have created some pent-up demand from her fans, though. This week a website \u201cTexts From Hillary\u201d created by two supporters, Stacy Lambe and Adam Smith, exploded on the Internet, generating tens of thousands of links on Facebook and Tumblr in its first 24 hours. The site features several two-panel gags that show Clinton on her Blackberry, clad in shades on a military jet, purportedly texting with various political and pop culture figures, from Condoleezza Rice to Ryan Gosling. \n \n Clinton\u2019s cold, relentless style was considered one of her biggest vulnerabilities, forming the basis for parodies of her on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and attracting a number of sexist jabs from pundits. By the end of her campaign, however, she had drawn considerable respect even from many critics for her toughness and resolve during a long and difficult primary. Lambe told TPM he was hoping to capture this trait in his site. \n \n \u201cThat photo just captures how people tried to make her out to be a bitch when she\u2019s actually the head bitch in charge,\u201d Lambe said. \u201cEver since she was appointed secretary of State there\u2019s been a renewed appreciation for Hillary.\u201d \n \n As for the idea for the initial two-panel gag, \u201cthe alcohol helped,\u201d said Smith. \n \n It\u2019s no accident that the notion of Clinton as the peak of steady competence has proven so resonant. Phil Singer, a spokesman for her 2008 presidential campaign, told TPM Clinton\u2019s recent success follows a consistent trend in which she is best regarded when working on policy instead of politics. Before her 2008 run, for example, Clinton was an extremely popular senator both in New York and among her colleagues. \n \n \u201cWhen people see her doing her job and not getting involved with the back-and-forth, they\u2019re happy,\u201d Singer said, acknowledging that it was \u201cironic\u201d given her highly political roles as First Lady, a tough Senate candidate in 2000 and an even tougher presidential candidate in 2008. \n \n The fact that she\u2019s kept her hands clean during an incredibly tense three-year standoff between the White House and national Republicans may also artificially boost her standing as voters imagine what could have been if she had won the nomination. \n \n \u201cSome people\u2019s views on her may be reflective of the fact people had higher hopes for Obama,\u201d Republican strategist Liz Mair said, \u201cand its sort of evened out so she looks better by comparison.\u201d \n \n Not surprisingly, the 2016 speculation that began even before the 2008 election ended is worming its way back into the press in a major way. Plenty of Democrats are hoping she\u2019ll run again, with Nancy Pelosi declaring just last week that she should consider waging another bid. \n \n Clinton has mostly avoided the topic, though she\u2019s hinted that her political days may be behind her at this point. She would be 69 on inauguration day, 2017. \n \n \u201cI believe that she\u2019s being absolutely honest with you when she says she doesn\u2019t think she\u2019ll go back into politics,\u201d Bill Clinton told ABC News recently. \u201cBut if she comes home and we do this foundation stuff for the rest of our lives, I\u2019ll be happy; if she changes her mind and decides to run, I\u2019ll be happy.\u201d \n \n Were Clinton to run she would almost certainly shed a significant amount of her current popularity with the right as soon as she seized a partisan mantle again. But her impressive tenure as secretary of State in a difficult transition period from the tumultuous Bush era would only boost her core appeal as the party\u2019s most battle-tested heavyweight. One need only look to the equivalent time period in the 2004 presidential cycle to underscore how unpredictable things are in politics \u2014 Barack Obama was a virtually unknown state senator then, and George Allen was widely considered the man to beat on the Republican side. \n \n Benjy Sarlin Benjy Sarlin is a reporter for Talking Points Memo and co-writes the campaign blog, TPM2012.

But civil unrest in parts of the continent has also taken its toll. \n \n \"In these war torn areas, in northern Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia in the border area with South Sudan, essentially the giraffes are war fodder, a large animal, extremely curious that can feed a lot of people,\" said Dr Fennessy. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Habitat loss and war are among the ways humans have caused the big drop in giraffe numbers, says Mike Jordan of Chester Zoo \n \n A study in recent months suggested that the giraffe was actually four different species but for this update of the Redlist, the IUCN have stuck with the traditional definition of one species with nine subspecies. \n \n Of these, five have had falling populations, one has remained stable while three have grown.

The update also reveals a devastating decline for the giraffe, driven by habitat loss, civil unrest and illegal hunting. The global giraffe population has plummeted by up to 40% over the last 30 years, and the species has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. \n \n Today\u2019s IUCN Red List update also includes the first assessments of wild oats, barley, mango and other crop wild relative plants. These species are increasingly critical to food security, as their genetic diversity can help improve crop resistance to disease, drought and salinity. \n \n The update was released today at the 13th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP13) in Cancun, Mexico. The IUCN Red List now includes 85,604 species of which 24,307 are threatened with extinction. \n \n \u201cMany species are slipping away before we can even describe them,\u201d says IUCN Director General Inger Andersen. \u201cThis IUCN Red List update shows that the scale of the global extinction crisis may be even greater than we thought. Governments gathered at the UN biodiversity summit in Cancun have the immense responsibility to step up their efforts to protect our planet\u2019s biodiversity \u2013 not just for its own sake but for human imperatives such as food security and sustainable development.\u201d \n \n Birds: Newly recognised, already threatened \n \n This IUCN Red List update includes the reassessment of all bird species. Thanks to a comprehensive taxonomic review compiled by BirdLife International, working in collaboration with the Handbook of the Birds of the World, the overall number of bird species assessed has reached 11,121. \n \n A total of 742 newly recognised bird species have been assessed, 11% of which are threatened. For example, the recently described Antioquia wren (Thryophilus sernai) has been listed as Endangered as more than half of its habitat could be wiped out by a single planned dam construction. Habitat loss to agriculture and degradation by invasive plants have also pushed the striking Comoro blue vanga (Cyanolanius comorensis) into the Endangered category. \n \n Thirteen of the newly recognised bird species enter the IUCN Red List as Extinct. Several of these have been lost within the past 50 years \u2013 such as the Pagan reed-warbler (Acrocephalus yamashinae), O\u2019ahu akepa (Loxops wolstenholmei) and Laysan honeycreeper (Himatione fraithii). All of these species were endemic to islands, and were most likely wiped out by invasive species. \n \n \u201cUnfortunately, recognising more than 700 \u2018new\u2019 species does not mean that the world's birds are faring better,\u201d says Dr Ian Burfield, BirdLife\u2019s Global Science Coordinator. \u201cAs our knowledge deepens, so our concerns are confirmed: unsustainable agriculture, logging, invasive species and other threats \u2013 such as the illegal trade highlighted here \u2013 are still driving many species towards extinction.\" \n \n IUCN Red List assessments also reveal that some of the world's most popular birds may soon disappear in the wild if appropriate action isn't taken. Iconic species, such as the African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus) \u2013 a prized pet with the ability to mimic human speech \u2013 are facing extinction in the wild due to unsustainable trapping and habitat loss. Native to central Africa, the grey parrot has seen its conservation status deteriorate from Vulnerable to Endangered. A study led by BirdLife International discovered that in some parts of the continent numbers of grey parrots have declined by as much as 99%. \n \n The situation is most pressing in Asia, with the rufous-fronted laughingthrush (Garrulax rufifrons), scarlet-breasted lorikeet (Trichoglossus forsteni) and Straw-headed bulbul (Pycnonotus zeylanicus) among a suite of species being uplisted to higher threat categories as a result of the impacts of illegal wildlife trade. There is now evidence that unsustainable levels of capture for the cagebird trade, largely centred on Java, are driving the deteriorating status of many species. \n \n However, there is good news for some of the rarest and most vulnerable birds on our planet \u2013 those that exist only on small, isolated islands. The Azores bullfinch (Pyrrhula murina), St Helena plover (Charadrius sanctaehelenae) and Seychelles white-eye (Zosterops modestus) are among the island endemic species to move to lower categories in this IUCN Red List update, as their populations recover from the brink of extinction thanks to tireless conservation efforts. \n \n Giraffe \n \n The iconic giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), one of the world's most recognisable animals and the tallest land mammal, is now threatened with extinction. The species, which is widespread across southern and eastern Africa, with smaller isolated subpopulations in west and central Africa, has moved from Least Concern to Vulnerable due to a dramatic 36-40% decline from approximately 151,702-163,452 individuals in 1985 to 97,562 in 2015. \n \n The growing human population is having a negative impact on many giraffe subpopulations. Illegal hunting, habitat loss and changes through expanding agriculture and mining, increasing human-wildlife conflict, and civil unrest are all pushing the species towards extinction. Of the nine subspecies of giraffe, three have increasing populations, whilst five have decreasing populations and one is stable. \n \n A resolution adopted at the IUCN World Conservation Congress in September this year called for action to reverse the decline of the giraffe. \n \n Crop wild relatives \n \n With this update, the first assessments of 233 wild relatives of crop plants such as barley, oats and sunflowers have been added to the IUCN Red List. Habitat loss, primarily due to agricultural expansion, is the major threat to many of these species. The assessments were completed as part of a partnership between Toyota Motor Corporation and IUCN, whose aim is to broaden the IUCN Red List to include the extinction risk of many species that are key food sources for a significant portion of the global population. \n \n Crop wild relatives are a source of genetic material for new and existing crop species, allowing for increased disease and drought resistance, fertility, nutritional value and other desirable traits. Almost every species of plant that humans have domesticated and now cultivate has one or more crop wild relatives. However, these species have received little systematic conservation attention until now. \n \n Four mango species have been listed as Endangered, and the Kalimantan mango (Mangifera casturi) has been listed as Extinct in the Wild. These species are relatives of the common mango (Mangifera indica) and are threatened by habitat loss. Native to South Asia, mangoes are now cultivated in many tropical and sub-tropical countries and they are one of the most commercially important fruits in these regions. \n \n A relative of cultivated asparagus, hamatamabouki (Asparagus kiusianus), which is native to Japan, has been listed as Endangered due to habitat loss caused by urban expansion and agriculture. Loss of habitat is also the main threat to the Anomalus sunflower (Helianthus anomalus) which has been listed as Vulnerable and is a relative of the sunflower (H. annuus). Cicer bijugum, native to Iran and Turkey, is a wild relative of the chickpea (C. arietinum); it has been listed as Endangered due to habitat conversion to agriculture. \n \n \u201cCrop wild relative species are under increasing threat from urbanisation, habitat fragmentation and intensive farming, and probably climate change,\u201d says Mr. Kevin Butt, General Manager, Regional Environmental Sustainability Director, Toyota Motor North America. \u201cTo conserve this vital gene pool for crop improvement we need to urgently improve our knowledge about these species. Toyota is pleased to provide support for the assessment of these and other species on The IUCN Red List.\u201d \n \n Freshwater species \u2013 Lake Victoria \n \n All freshwater molluscs, crabs, dragonflies and freshwater fishes native to Lake Victoria in central Africa are included in this update. Key threats to Lake Victoria \u2013 known as Darwin\u2019s dream pond due to its high biodiversity \u2013 include invasive species such as the Nile perch (Lates niloticus), overharvesting, sedimentation due to logging and agriculture, as well as water pollution from pesticides and herbicides. \n \n For more information or interviews please contact: \n \n Goska Bonnaveira, IUCN Media Relations, m +41 79 276 01 85, e-mail goska.bonnaveira@iucn.org \n \n Ewa Magiera, IUCN Media Relations, m +41 76 505 33 78, e-mail ewa.magiera@iucn.org \n \n \n \n Notes to editors \n \n Birds \n \n This update of birds for the IUCN Red List reflects the second of a two-part comprehensive taxonomic review of birds; this update focussed on passerine birds \u2013 'perching birds' such as flycatchers, thrushes, crows and finches \u2013 and has led to the recognition of 742 new species, many of which were previously treated as subspecies of other species. The new total of 6,649 passerines implies that avian diversity at the species level was previously underestimated by more than 10%. BirdLife now applies a single, consistent taxonomic approach worldwide, across all species. As a result, the number of recognised species rises above 11,000 for the first time to 11,121. Thirteen out of the 742 newly recognised species are already extinct \u2013 all were island endemics \u2013 and likely driven extinct by invasive species (on Hawai'i, Pacific islands, Indian Ocean islands, Gal\u00e1pagos and Bermuda). \n \n First non-English language assessments published \n \n The first non-English language assessments have been published on the IUCN Red List. Assessments for 20 species from the State of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil have been included, with the text in Portuguese. They were provided by CNCFlora (who also serve as the IUCN SSC Brazil Plant Red List Authority). These species are mostly localised endemics from the Mata Atl\u00e2ntica forest which has been substantially reduced by urban and agricultural expansion. \n \n Supporting quotes \n \n \u201cWhilst giraffe are commonly seen on safari, in the media and in zoos, people \u2013 including conservationists \u2013 are unaware that these majestic animals are undergoing a silent extinction. With a decline of almost 40% in the last three decades alone, the world's tallest animal is under severe pressure in some of its core ranges across East, Central and West Africa. As one of the world's most iconic animals, it is timely that we stick our neck out for the giraffe before it is too late,\u201d says Julian Fennessy, co-chair of the IUCN SSC Giraffe and Okapi Specialist Group. \n \n \u201cDespite continuing conservation efforts to protect the immense diversity of life in Lake Victoria from growing threats, we are still seeing alarming declines in species populations, as this Red List update shows. Systematic monitoring at the species level has been lacking so far, and we urgently need to invest in monitoring and more conservation action to protect these species, many of which are critical to the livelihoods of people living around the lake,\u201d says Dr William Darwall, Head of IUCN Freshwater Biodiversity Unit. \n \n Quotes from Red List partners \n \n \"The addition of new species to the IUCN Red List, some of them already threatened with extinction, emphasises the urgency to produce conservation assessments to better prioritise species in need of conservation action as soon as the species are discovered. The first assessments of many crop wild relatives also highlight the need for conservation action, both in situ and ex situ, to ensure our future food security.\" - Botanical Gardens Conservation International (BCGI) \n \n \u201cIt is certainly a concern that iconic species like the loquacious African grey parrot (Endangered) and the giraffe, Giraffa camelopardalis (Vulnerable) are now listed as Threatened,\u201d states Dr. Thomas Lacher, Jr. from Texas A&M University. \u201cIn addition, four wild relatives of the common mango are now Endangered and an additional wild relative Extinct in the Wild. The loss of genetic diversity in the wild relatives of many of our domestic food crops only erodes future options for new crop resources under changing climates.\u201d \n \n The Zoological Society of London (ZSL) supports the management and monitoring of key sites for giraffe in the wild, including the Tsavo Conservation Area in Kenya via the SMART patrol management system, and has also supported the development of Kenya\u2019s first National Giraffe Conservation Strategy. Both ZSL London Zoo and ZSL Whipsnade Zoo are home to giraffes, and ZSL co-hosts the IUCN SSC Giraffe and Okapi Specialist Group with the Giraffe Conservation Foundation. Co-chair of the Specialist Group, ZSL\u2019s Dr No\u00eblle K\u00fcmpel warns, \u201cMost people have no idea that both species of giraffid, the giraffe and its lesser-known Congolese rainforest cousin the okapi, are suffering dramatic declines and are now both threatened with extinction. IUCN recently passed a key resolution calling for greater awareness and efforts to secure the future of these hugely charismatic, iconic and gentle species in the wild, including safeguarding key protected areas.\u201d \n \n \"Several newly recognized bird species have made it to the Red List as Extinct, suggesting that extinction rates for other taxa are likely higher than we think. Yet there are bright spots - many rare and vulnerable birds have shown signs of recovery, providing good evidence that it is not too late to recover extant populations that are balancing on the brink of extinction,\" says Leah Gerber, Director, Center for Biodiversity Outcomes, Arizona State University. \n \n \"It is critical as a global community that we continue to identify, prioritize, and conserve biodiversity, and the diversity of crop wild relatives, as we experience more and more climate driven impacts. These species can help crops and communities become more resilient and adapt to new conditions created by climate change,\" says Daniela Raik, Senior Vice President and Managing Director, Moore Center for Science.", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The giraffe, the tallest land animal, is now at risk of extinction, biologists say. \n \n Because the giraffe population has shrunk nearly 40 percent in just 30 years, scientists put it on the official watch list of threatened and endangered species worldwide, calling it \"vulnerable.\" That's two steps up the danger ladder from its previous designation of being a species of least concern. In 1985, there were between 151,000 and 163,000 giraffes but in 2015 the number was down to 97,562, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). \n \n At a biodiversity meeting Wednesday in Mexico, the IUCN increased the threat level for 35 species and lowered the threat level for seven species on its \"Red List\" of threatened species, considered by scientists the official list of what animals and plants are in danger of disappearing. \n \n The giraffe is the only mammal whose status changed on the list this year. Scientists blame habitat loss. \n \n While everyone worries about elephants, Earth has four times as many pachyderms as giraffes, said Julian Fennessy and Noelle Kumpel, co-chairs of the specialty group of biologists that put the giraffe on the IUCN Red List. They both called what's happening to giraffes a \"silent extinction.\" \n \n \"Everyone assumes giraffes are everywhere,\" said Fennessy, co-director of the Giraffe Conservation Foundation. \n \n But they're not, Fennessy said. Until recently, biologists hadn't done a good job assessing giraffes' numbers and where they can be found, and they have been lumped into one broad species instead of nine separate subspecies. \n \n \"There's a strong tendency to think that familiar species (such as giraffes, chimps, etc.) must be OK because they are familiar and we see them in zoos,\" said Duke University conservation biologist Stuart Pimm, who wasn't part of the work and has criticized the IUCN for not putting enough species on the threat list. \"This is dangerous.\" \n \n Fennessy blamed shrinking living space as the main culprit in the declining giraffe population, worsened by poaching and disease. People are moving into giraffe areas especially in central and eastern Africa. Giraffe numbers are plunging most in central and eastern Africa and are being offset by increases in southern Africa, he said. \n \n This has fragmented giraffe populations, making them shrink in size with wild giraffes gone from seven countries \u2014 Burkina Faso, Eritrea, Guinea, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria and Senegal, said Kumpel of the Zoological Society of London. \n \n The IUCN says 860 plant and animal species are extinct, and another 68 are extinct in the wild. Nearly 13,000 are endangered or critically endangered. The next level is vulnerable, where giraffes were placed, followed by near threatened and least concerned. \n \n The status of two snake species worsened. The ornate ground snake, which lives on the tiny island of Saint Lucia, deteriorated from endangered to critically endangered. The Lacepede's ground snake of Martinique, which was already critically endangered, is now considered possibly extinct, pending confirmation, as is the trondo mainty, a river fish in Madagascar. \n \n But there is also good news for some species. The Victoria stonebasher, a freshwater fish in Africa, went from being considered endangered to least concerned with a stable population. And an African plant, the acmadenia candida, which was declared extinct, has been rediscovered and is now considered endangered. Another freshwater fish, ptychochromoides itasy, which hadn't been seen since the 1960s, has been rediscovered in small numbers in Africa's Sakay River and is now considered critically endangered. \n \n ___ \n \n Online: \n \n International Union for the Conservation of Nature: https://www.iucn.org/ \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Seth Borenstein at http://twitter.com/borenbears and his work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/seth-borenstein"], "summary": "\u2013 No one used to pay much mind to the giraffes that roamed Africa. But new numbers from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature show a significant decline in their population over the past three decades and have conservationists worried that the elegant creature is falling victim to what one IUCN expert calls a \"silent extinction,\" the BBC reports. In 1985, there were between 152,000 and 163,000 giraffes, but that number dropped to 97,000 by 2015\u2014a \"devastating decline\" of nearly 40% that now moves the animal from the \"least concern\" category into the \"vulnerable\" one on the group's Red List. \"While there [has] been great concern about elephants and rhinos, giraffes have gone under the radar,\" says Dr. Fennessy, co-director of the IUCN's Giraffe Conservation arm. The updated Red List, released Thursday at a biological diversity conference in Cancun, Mexico, points to man as the main driver of the declining stats, with poaching, habitat loss, and local unrest all assuming partial blame. A Duke University conservation biologist says the IUCN is partly to blame, too, for not considering more species threatened. \"There's a strong tendency to think that familiar species [such as giraffes, chimps, etc.] must be OK because ... we see them in zoos,\" he tells the AP. \"This is dangerous.\" Some good news, at least for some long-neckers: Of the nine giraffe subspecies, three of them are experiencing increasing populations; one is stable.

{"document": ["\"I hate the children being taken away. The Democrats have to change their law.\" \n \n Evan Vucci / AP \n \n President Donald Trump said Friday morning that his administration was separating immigrant children from their parents at the border because it's \"the law\" and a law created by Democrats \u2014 which is not true. \"I hate the children being taken away. The Democrats have to change their law. That's their law,\" Trump said during an impromptu press conference outside the White House on Friday morning. \n \n Fox News \n \n There is no law that determines children must be taken away from their parents when they cross the border. Crossing the border illegally is a federal misdemeanor, and recrossing illegally is a felony, but there is no law mandating the separation of families that cross the border illegally. Instead, the increase in family separation, which has seen hundreds of immigrant children detained and kept apart from their parents, comes from a zero-tolerance policy introduced by the Trump administration and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \n \n Trump instead blamed Democrats. \"The children can be taken care of quickly, beautifully, and immediately. The Democrats forced that law upon our nation. I hate it. I hate to see separation of parents and children,\" Trump inaccurately said. Previously, the policy of the Homeland Security Department was that children would be removed from parents if the parents were referred for criminal prosecution. The new zero-tolerance policy means everyone crossing the border illegally is being prosecuted. \n \n But with Trump hoping that Democrats will agree to an immigration bill that would include funding to build a wall between the United States and Mexico, he continued to blame Democrats publicly. \"That is a Democrat bill. That is Democrats wanting to do this,\" said Trump. On Thursday, other Trump administration officials also repeatedly declared the administration policy \"the law,\" including Sessions and White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders in a heated argument with reporters. The president crossed the White House lawn on Friday morning for a surprise TV appearance on Fox and Friends. \n \n Donald Trump walking down the White House lawn so he can make a surprise live appearance on his favorite TV show is just completely bonkers https://t.co/3VzN44TlKQ", "(CNN) President Donald Trump blamed Democrats for the separation of families at the US border Friday, a response he's repeatedly made to criticism his administration has faced since it adopted a policy that results in far more children being separated from their parents. \n \n \"The Democrats forced that law upon our nation,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"I hate it. I hate to see separation of parents and children. The Democrats can come to us as they actually are in all fairness, we are talking to them, and they can change the whole border security. We need a wall. We need border security. We've got to get rid of catch and release.\" \n \n The President's comments are significant given how his administration is operating and what Congress is trying to do to address a variety of immigration and border security issues. Just 24 hours ago, House Republicans unveiled legislation aimed at both addressing Trump's priorities on immigration as well as possibly make changes to protocol to address family separation (more on that below). \n \n To add some clarity here given this morning's (and the last few weeks) comments, here's where things stand: \n \n On the 'compromise' GOP legislation, and the 'fix' on separation \n \n Yes, a compromise bill worked out by House GOP leaders, moderates and conservatives addresses the issue of separating parents from their children, through overturning a settlement that stipulates children cannot be detained more than three weeks so that families are kept together but doing so would allow entire families to be detained indefinitely. House Speaker Paul Ryan cited that settlement on Thursday as the reason this was happening in the first place. \n \n But -- and this is a key: the bill does nothing to prohibit the criminal prosecution of parents who cross the border illegally, i.e. the current Trump Administration policy that is driving the separation (children can't be brought into the criminal justice system). \n \n In other words: It does nothing to stop the current policy. It just requires the government to keep them together when in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security. \n \n So here's the bottom line: the bill touches on the issue, but it's hardly a fix. \n \n As one Democratic staffer told CNN: \"The answer to separating families is not to put them behind bars.\" \n \n Where are Democrats on the separation policy and new legislation? \n \n Democrats want the administration to reverse the policy. \n \n House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters on Thursday she sees \"no prospects\" for a legislative fix. Democrats aren't even talking to Republicans about a legislative fix -- neither in the broader immigration bills to be considered next week or in a more targeted manner. \n \n They are going to the border to highlight the issue. They have marched to highlight the issue. This is a very motivating issue for them. But they see the mechanism for addressing it sitting purely with the executive branch. \n \n Is this the fault of Democrats, as Trump has continued to claim falsely for weeks? \n \n No. This was a deliberate policy shift by the Trump administration. They have the power to unilaterally reverse it. It's legal, no question, but it's purely the administration's decision. \n \n The more nuanced point from the administration is that this is something that can and should be addressed by broader immigration legislative efforts, and that Democrats are blocking those efforts. It's correct that Democrats aren't in the room on the current House effort. But this is far more a Republican issue than Democrat one. Here's why: \n \n 1. The President's immigration bill got all of 39 votes in the Senate (the bipartisan effort also fell short of the 60 votes needed to move forward, but received more support.) \n \n 2. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has explicitly said the Senate won't take up any immigration legislation again unless the House passes it and the President is explicit he will sign it (more on that below). \n \n 3. The House Republican effort has been a purely partisan one -- Democrats aren't in negotiations, being consulted, or expected to provide any \"yes\" votes given the conservative turn even the compromise bill has taken \n \n 4. Even the GOP-only effort in the House, which is scheduled to be considered next week, is a long way away from having enough to pass at this point. \n \n 5. The President, in Friday's Fox News interview, said he's opposed to the GOP moderate-negotiated House bill. This is a kill shot to the entire House exercise, whether they manage the scrounge together the votes or not. \n \n Bottom line: The Trump administration implemented the current separation policy. \n \n While it's designed, as Attorney General Jeff Sessions describes it, to have a deterrent effect, it's also a negotiating play to try and force Democrats to the table on immigration legislation the President favors. \n \n But Democrats aren't in the room on those legislative efforts and the President just nuked the lone House GOP effort that had a shot at passage. And the Senate wants no part of this. \n \n So its prospects -- and any effort in the near future to prevent families from being separated at the border -- aren't looking good.", "\u201cWe have to break up families. The Democrats gave us that law. It\u2019s a horrible thing where you have to break up families. The Democrats gave us that law and they don\u2019t want to do anything about it.\u201d \n \n \u2014 President Trump, in a round table on sanctuary cities in California, May 16, 2018 \n \n \u201cYet this administration is separating kids from their parents and unable to account for 1,500 lost children! Shame.\u201d \n \n \u2014 Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), on Twitter, May 27, 2018 \n \n Trump blames Democrats for a law that separates undocumented immigrant children from their families. Some Democrats blame Trump\u2019s administration for losing track of nearly 1,500 immigrant kids. \n \n None of this is accurate. \n \n We\u2019ve fact-checked many claims about the border, and it\u2019s clear that the latest spin from both sides deserves a turn under the microscope. However, since this is a roundup of multiple claims, we won\u2019t be giving Pinocchio ratings. \n \n Let\u2019s dig in. \n \n The Facts \n \n These claims mostly revolve around \u201ccatch and release,\u201d the practice by U.S. authorities of releasing children and asylum seekers into the community while they await immigration hearings. Many fail to show up for their hearings and remain in the country without legal authorization. \n \n The Trump administration says these legal \u201cloopholes\u201d abet the trafficking of children while allowing smugglers and bad actors to profit. Immigration and civil rights groups say that it\u2019s misleading to portray the asylum process as a loophole and that, in recent years, thousands of people legitimately have sought refuge in the United States from the violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. \n \n \u2018We have to break up families. The Democrats gave us that law.\u2019 \n \n Trump says his administration\u2019s policy of separating children from their families can be traced back to a Democratic immigration law. But as we\u2019ve reported, catch and release is not a single law so much as a collection of policies and court rulings spanning Democratic and Republican administrations. We gave the president Three Pinocchios in April when he tweeted that catch and release was a \u201cliberal\u201d and \u201cDemocrat\u201d law. \n \n In a briefing with reporters on May 29, Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser to Trump, explained the president\u2019s rationale for pinning these policies on Democrats. The gist of it is that these laws may or may not be Democratic creations, but Democrats own them because they don\u2019t support Trump\u2019s more-restrictive immigration agenda. \n \n Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the U.S. Catch and Release, Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL! DEMOCRATS ARE PROTECTING MS-13 THUGS. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2018 \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty straightforward issue,\u201d Miller said. \u201cNear-unanimous Republican agreement about the need to change law and policy in order to close those loopholes, and the Democrats are opposing them.\u201d \n \n It\u2019s quite a stretch to say there\u2019s \u201cnear-unanimous Republican agreement\u201d on this agenda or unified opposition by Democrats. The Secure and Succeed Act, sponsored by Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), failed 39 to 60 in the Senate in February. The White House backed this proposal, which got 36 of 51 GOP votes and three Democratic votes, far short of passage. Three other immigration proposals, backed by broader mixes of Republicans and Democrats, each got more than 50 votes \u2014 enough to pass if there had not been a procedural vote requiring 60 votes. \n \n Miller mentioned the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, a law signed by President George W. Bush, a Republican. The TVPRA is meant to give safe harbor to victims of human trafficking and says unaccompanied children \u201care exempt from prompt return to their home country,\u201d unless they come from Canada or Mexico, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Children fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras are covered by this law. \n \n Miller also mentioned the \u201cFlores settlement\u201d from 1997. This legal agreement struck by President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration requires the federal government to release rather than detain undocumented immigrant children, first to their parents if possible, to other adult relatives if not, and to licensed programs willing to accept custody if no relatives are available. As a last resort, U.S. officials may place children in the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d setting available. \n \n A federal judge in California ruled in 2015 that the Flores settlement covered all children in immigration officials\u2019 custody, regardless of whether they were apprehended at the border alone or with family members. The judge\u2019s ruling also covered any accompanying parents. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit reversed the latter part of the ruling and said the Flores settlement required only that children, not parents, be released. Therefore, the government is required to keep immigrant children and their parents together only for a limited time. \n \n But none of these legal developments requires the Trump administration to separate children from their families. Instead, separations are rising in large part because of a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy implemented by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. In April, Sessions directed prosecutors to charge as many illegal entry offenses as possible. \n \n Devin O\u2019Malley, a Justice Department spokesman, said in the May 29 briefing that people charged with these offenses often are sentenced to time served and transferred to the Department of Homeland Security for deportation. \n \n So, on one hand, the Flores settlement and the TVPRA require that children be released. On the other, Sessions\u2019s zero-tolerance policy subjects any accompanying parents to criminal prosecution and eventual deportation. \n \n Laying this on Democrats does not track with reality. The TVPRA was signed by Bush, and the Flores settlement is a court-approved agreement, not a law. Nothing required the Trump administration to separate children from their families until Sessions\u2019s zero-tolerance policy made it a practical necessity. \n \n Miller also mentioned a Supreme Court ruling from 2001, Zadvydas v. Davis. The court ruled that immigrants who were under deportation orders \u2014 but whom no other country would accept \u2014 generally could not be detained by U.S. officials for more than six months. \n \n Congress cannot pass a law that overturns this court ruling. It would require a constitutional amendment or a new Supreme Court ruling overturning Zadvydas. \n \n Republican senators introduced legislation to narrow the scope of the ruling in 2014, allowing the Department of Homeland Security to retain custody of some individuals past the six-month deadline in special circumstances, including when the individual was deemed a threat to national security or had a highly contagious disease. Parts of this bill were folded into the Secure and Succeed Act. \n \n The president asked Congress to allow U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u201cto retain custody of illegal aliens whose home countries will not accept their repatriation,\u201d so long as it is \u201cconsistent with the Constitution,\u201d according to a statement of principles and policies he sent to Congress in October 2017. \n \n \u201cThe administration has repeatedly advocated for the closure to federal immigration loopholes that would allow for the swift, safe, and expeditious return of illegal alien minors, adults, and families at the southern border,\u201d White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said. \u201cHowever, the Democratic Party has repeatedly opposed these loophole closures in favor of preserving \u2018catch-and-release\u2019 policies that make a mockery of national sovereignty.\u201d \n \n A White House official said that \u201cfrom October 2017 to this February, DHS saw a staggering 315 percent increase in illegal aliens using children to pose as family units to gain entry into the country, compared to the same time frame the previous year.\u201d \n \n The official also pointed to a column in the National Review by Rich Lowry. \n \n \u201cSeparation happens only if officials find that the adult is falsely claiming to be the child\u2019s parent, or is a threat to the child, or is put into criminal proceedings,\u201d Lowry wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s the last that is operative here. The past practice had been to give a free pass to an adult who is part of a family unit. The new Trump policy is to prosecute all adults.\u201d \n \n \u2018This administration is separating kids from their parents and unable to account for 1,500 lost children!\u2019 \n \n This startling claim has spread like wildfire online; Kaine is not alone in tweeting it. Did the government suddenly lose track of 1,500 children? \n \n In a word, no. \n \n The Department of Health and Human Services resettled 7,635 children in the United States from October 2017 through December 2017, most of whom were fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. \n \n As I worshipped in Hampton Roads this morning, I couldn\u2019t help but consider how Scripture commands compassionate treatment of migrants and refugees. Yet this administration is separating kids from their parents and unable to account for 1,500 lost children! Shame. https://t.co/oSyMYcS3y3 \u2014 Tim Kaine (@timkaine) May 27, 2018 \n \n As we noted, the Flores settlement requires that these children be placed with parents if they\u2019re available, with other relatives if not, then in licensed programs or \u201cleast restrictive\u201d settings if all else fails. \n \n The HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement will place these children even with family members who themselves may be undocumented. \u201cWe\u2019re not able to deny placement just because parents or family members are in the country illegally,\u201d Steven Wagner, the acting assistant secretary of the Administration for Children and Families at HHS, told reporters in the May 29 briefing. \n \n All 7,635 children were resettled by HHS. After 30 days, the department called the parents or guardians to check up on things. But these calls were not required by law, and in 1,475 cases, the parents or guardians did not respond, perhaps because they feared being targeted for deportation, Wagner said. \n \n Wagner testified in April to a Senate subcommittee that, of the 7,635 children, 6,075 remained where they were placed, 52 had moved, 28 had run away and five were deported. That left 1,475 migrant children.

It\u2019s a sweeping plan that covers everything from border security (including a promise of $25 billion for Trump\u2019s border wall); to a way for immigrants who are facing the loss of their protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to apply for legal status and ultimately (possibly) green cards and citizenship; to cuts to legal family-based immigration that are partially offset by expanding permanent employer-based immigration. \n \n But House Speaker Paul Ryan and others are emphasizing a different aspect of the bill. They claim it would prevent the Trump administration from separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border \u2014 a practice the administration made widespread in early May and that has resulted in the separation of hundreds of families a week. \n \n They\u2019re lying. \n \n The Republican bill doesn\u2019t outlaw family separation. It doesn\u2019t stop the Trump administration from choosing to prosecute asylum seekers who enter the US between ports of entry (official border crossings) for illegal entry, which results in parents being sent into criminal custody without their children. And it doesn\u2019t even force the government not to separate parents who do present themselves legally for asylum from their children \u2014 something that has also been happening, though isn\u2019t as widespread. \n \n What the House bill does is get rid of the extra legal protections that children and families have in immigration detention: a requirement that children be kept in the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d conditions possible, and that they not be detained any longer than necessary. This means that if the family is kept together, their parents must be released with them. The Trump administration calls those protections \u201cloopholes,\u201d and blames them for \u201cforcing\u201d the administration to keep asylum-seekers in custody by separating families. \n \n If the House bill passed, the Trump administration probably would stop separating families. Instead, it would be able to keep children and parents in ICE detention until their cases were resolved \u2014 that is, they could be in held in detention indefinitely. \n \n The House bill allows kids and families to be detained by ICE indefinitely \u2014 which is what Trump has wanted all along \n \n The Republican summary of the new bill (as reported by Leigh Ann Caldwell of NBC) claims that it ends family separation: \u201cAccompanied alien minors apprehended at the border must not be separated from their parent or legal guardian while in DHS custody.\u201d \n \n There is no language like that in the bill. \n \n What exists, however, in a section called \u201cClarification of Standards for Family Detention,\u201d is a provision allowing ICE to detain immigrant children who come to the US with their parents or guardians in the same way it would detain adults: \n \n There exists no presumption that an alien child who is not an unaccompanied alien child should not be detained, and all such determinations shall be in the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security. \n \n That sentence would overrule a court agreement that\u2019s been in place for the past 20 years, called the Flores agreement, that puts strict limitations on when the government can keep children in immigration detention. The Flores agreement requires that kids be released \u201cwithout unnecessary delay,\u201d and that they are kept in the meantime in the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d conditions possible. \n \n Courts have interpreted that agreement to mean that ICE can\u2019t detain families for more than 20 days in most cases. \n \n The Flores agreement doesn\u2019t require the government to separate families. It just requires the government not to indefinitely detain children. But the Trump administration has decided to maximize the detention of asylum seekers, including parents, to prevent people from disappearing into the US as unauthorized immigrants after they\u2019re released. (This is the so-called \u201ccatch and release\u201d policy Trump has railed against.) \n \n Rather than release parents with their children, therefore, the administration is separating families so the parents can be detained while the children (sent to the custody of HHS as \u201cunaccompanied alien children\u201d) are ultimately placed with sponsors. \n \n The House bill allows the administration to keep families in immigration detention indefinitely. It doesn\u2019t even specify that there are any additional conditions on how children can be detained \u2014 there\u2019s nothing preventing the Trump administration from simply putting children in existing ICE detention centers for adults, rather than expanding detention centers designed for families. \n \n Nothing in the bill requires ICE to keep parents and children together in detention. In fact, the mechanism that the Trump administration has generally been using to separate families \u2014 referring parents into the custody of the Department of Justice for prosecution \u2014 isn\u2019t even addressed in the bill. \n \n The only reason the House bill could possibly end the separation of families would be if the Trump administration decided that because they now didn\u2019t have to release children from detention, they would stop prosecuting parents, and they would make an effort to keep families together in ICE detention. \n \n But even then, that just means that children would be held in facilities that are essentially jails with their parents for months, or even years, until they ultimately received legal status \u2014 or, more likely, until they were finally deported.", "President Trump Donald John TrumpJimmy Fallon responds to Trump: I'll donate to pro-immigrant nonprofit in his name South Carolina GOP candidate expected to make full recovery after car accident Official: US to present North Korea with timeline, 'specific asks' MORE on Friday again blamed Democrats for his administration\u2019s policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the border. \n \n In an impromptu interview on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Trump said he \u201chates\u201d the policy, and claimed the Democrats could change the \u201claw\u201d if they voted with Republicans on immigration reform. \n \n \u201cDemocrats forced that law on the nation,\u201d he said. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n Trump\u2019s Attorney General, Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsMigrants told they\u2019ll be reunited with children if they sign voluntary deportation order: report Christie: Trump 'enormously ill-served' by DOJ on 'zero tolerance' policy 'Occupy ICE' protests emerge across the country MORE, enacted a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy at the border last month, mandating that everyone apprehended illegally entering the U.S. will face criminal charges. \n \n The policy is resulting in parents being separated from their children while facing legal prosecution. \n \n Sessions says the measure is necessary to increase border security.

For years, stage folks have decried the regular mid-show disruptions wrought by the advent of the mobile phone. \n \n The issue has reached something of a tipping point recently, with Patti LuPone making headlines earlier this week for snatching away the phone of a texting audience member at the Off Broadway show in which she stars, \u201cShows for Days\u201d \u2014 and doing it without ever breaking character. (The phone was returned to its owner after the show.) \n \n Just a few days before that, Silvestri earned the ire of the theater community when, minutes before a performance of \u201cHand to God,\u201d he leapt onto the stage and plugged his phone into what turned out to be a fake electrical outlet.

It\u2019s a regular occurrence at Broadway shows these days, thanks to the omnipresence of mobile devices, not to mention the increasing presence of tourists and young audiences \u2014 some of whom have never been to a Broadway show. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t go to plays very much, and I didn\u2019t realize that the stage is considered off limits,\u201d Silvestri said. \n \n There\u2019s something of a generational divide, too, between the traditionally older-skewing theatergoing demographic and the younger audiences who have grown up in the digital, mobile era \u2014 for whom mobile device usage is akin to a basic civil right. \n \n The press conference with Silvestri, held in front of the Booth Theater, took advantage of the cell-phone incident (which was not a stunt, Silvestri assured people) to lend a little publicity to \u201cHand to God,\u201d the Broadway comedy that earned strong reviews (and five Tony nominations) but has largely struggled to gain momentum at the box office.

He then gamely read a statement (see text below) but he stumbled over the word \"theatergoer\" and was immediately bombarded with questions from the skeptical press. \n \n \n \n \n \n For instance, were he and Hand to God producers in cahoots to draw attention for the play? Especially considering that it's struggling at the box office? Silvestri seemed confused, and insisted that he wasn't part of a viral marketing stunt, telling reporters, \"Take it as it is. It's fun. It's a joke.\" \n \n And even though he said in his statement that he had been drinking, reporters pointed out that he's underage. He then became vague about the drinking, denying drinking in NYC, and a publicist for the show kept Silvestri from answering our probing questions, such as \"Do you have the phone?\" \n \n It seems possible that a drunken Silvestri was dared to go charge his phone onstage by a friend who then filmed him.

I said, 'Hey, buddy, what's the problem?'\" \n \n Silvestri then asked the guards if he could jump back on the stage and retrieve his phone. \n \n \"They said, 'Are you crazy?,'\" and one of them went up and got the phone. \n \n Silvestri returned to his seat with his smart phone, but the drama wasn't over yet. \"The head guy came down and started yelling at me in front of my family and the whole place.

{"document": ["Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by a parasite. People with malaria often experience fever, chills, and flu-like illness. Left untreated, they may develop severe complications and die. In 2016 an estimated 216 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide and 445,000 people died, mostly children in the African Region. About 1,700 cases of malaria are diagnosed in the United States each year. The vast majority of cases in the United States are in travelers and immigrants returning from countries where malaria transmission occurs, many from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. \n \n CDC\u2019s Malaria Program", "We report that during a recent period of hybridization between two major African malaria mosquitoes, Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii, an island of divergence on chromosome 2 introgressed from the A. gambiae into the A. coluzzii genome and its frequency subsequently increased. This introgression was coincident with the start of a major insecticide-treated bed net campaigns in Mali. These observations suggest that increased insecticide exposure acted as a selective force sufficient to drive introgression of an entire genomic island of divergence across the reproductive barrier separating these two species. This study provides a rare example of adaptive introgression in an animal species and elucidates the dynamics of how insecticide resistance evolved in A. coluzzii. \n \n Abstract \n \n Animal species adapt to changes in their environment, including man-made changes such as the introduction of insecticides, through selection for advantageous genes already present in populations or newly arisen through mutation. A possible alternative mechanism is the acquisition of adaptive genes from related species via a process known as adaptive introgression. Differing levels of insecticide resistance between two African malaria vectors, Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles gambiae, have been attributed to assortative mating between the two species. In a previous study, we reported two bouts of hybridization observed in the town of Selinkenyi, Mali in 2002 and 2006. These hybridization events did not appear to be directly associated with insecticide-resistance genes. We demonstrate that during a brief breakdown in assortative mating in 2006, A. coluzzii inherited the entire A. gambiae-associated 2L divergence island, which includes a suite of insecticide-resistance alleles. In this case, introgression was coincident with the start of a major insecticide-treated bed net distribution campaign in Mali. This suggests that insecticide exposure altered the fitness landscape, favoring the survival of A. coluzzii/A. gambiae hybrids, and provided selection pressure that swept the 2L divergence island through A. coluzzii populations in Mali. We propose that the work described herein presents a unique description of the temporal dynamics of adaptive introgression in an animal species and represents a mechanism for the rapid evolution of insecticide resistance in this important vector of human malaria in Africa.", "Fact sheet on the World Malaria Report 2014 \n \n Malaria is an entirely preventable and treatable mosquito-borne illness.

In 2013, almost half of the population at risk in Africa (49%) had access to an insecticide-treated mosquito net, compared to 3% in 2004. \n \n In 2014, an estimated 214 million long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) were delivered to malaria-endemic countries in Africa, bringing the total number of LLINs delivered to that region since 2012 to 427 million. \n \n In 2013, 124 million people were protected from malaria by indoor residual spraying around the world. In Africa, 55 million people, or 7% of the population at risk, lived in households that were regularly sprayed. \n \n Access to rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and quality-assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) has been increasing around the world. \n \n The volume of RDT sales to the public and private sectors of endemic countries has increased from 46 million in 2008 to 319 million in 2013. \n \n The number of patients tested by microscopic examination increased to 197 million in 2013, with India accounting for over 120 million slide examinations. \n \n Globally, 392 million courses of ACTs were procured by endemic countries in 2013, up from 11 million in 2005. \n \n In 2013, for the first time, the total number of diagnostic tests (RDTs and microscopy combined) provided in the public sector in Africa exceeded the total number of ACTs distributed. This indicates a prominent shift away from presumptive treatment and is thus an encouraging sign. \n \n In Africa, the proportion of women who receive intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) for malaria has been increasing over time, although the levels remain below national targets. An estimated 15 million of the 35 million pregnant women did not receive a single dose of IPTp in 2013. \n \n Progress in adopting and rolling out preventive therapies for children has been even slower. As of 2013, only six of the 16 countries where WHO recommends preventive therapies for children under five have adopted the treatment as national policy. Only one country has adopted the recommended preventive therapy for infants, but has not yet started rolling out the programme. \n \n Drug and insecticide resistance \n \n Emerging parasite resistance to antimalarial medicines and mosquito resistance to insecticides, if left unaddressed, could render some of the current tools ineffective and trigger a rise in global malaria mortality. \n \n In recent years, parasite resistance to artemisinin has been detected in five countries of the Greater Mekong subregion: Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam. In areas along the Cambodia\u2013Thailand border, P. falciparum has become resistant to most available antimalarial medicines, and multi-drug resistance is a major concern. \n \n Between 2010 and 2013, 53 countries globally have reported mosquito resistance to at least one insecticide. Of these, 41 have reported resistance to two or more insecticide classes. The most commonly reported resistance is to pyrethroids, the most frequently used insecticide in malaria vector control. \n \n Progress towards global targets \n \n The malaria-specific Millennium Development Goal (MDG 6 target C: to have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the incidence of malaria) has already been met. \n \n In terms of country-level progress, a total of 64 countries are currently on track to reverse the incidence of malaria nationally by 2015. \n \n Of these, 55 are on track to meet the World Health Assembly and Roll Back Malaria Partnership target of reducing malaria incidence by 75% by 2015. \n \n Funding remains inadequate \n \n International and domestic funding for malaria control and elimination totalled US$ 2.7 billion in 2013. Although this represents a threefold increase since 2005, it is still significantly below the US$ 5.1 billion that is required to achieve global targets for malaria control and elimination.", "Progress \n \n Who needs your help? \n \n We work with our UN partners to protect refugees and families who are most vulnerable to malaria. Some have fled conflict, others have been displaced by natural disasters or political unrest and have left everything behind. After all they have endured, these families shouldn\u2019t have to fear a deadly mosquito bite.", "Interbreeding of two malaria mosquito species in the West African country of Mali has resulted in a \"super mosquito\" hybrid that's resistant to insecticide-treated bed nets. \n \n \"It's 'super' with respect to its ability to survive exposure to the insecticides on treated bed nets,\" said medical entomologist Gregory Lanzaro of UC Davis, who led the research team. \n \n The research, published Jan. 6 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, \"provides convincing evidence indicating that a man-made change in the environment -- the introduction of insecticides -- has altered the evolutionary relationship between two species, in this case a breakdown in the reproductive isolation that separates them,\" said Lanzaro, who is director of the Vector Genetics Laboratory and professor in the Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology in the School of Veterinary Medicine. \n \n \"What we provide in this new paper is an example of one unusual mechanism that has promoted the rapid evolution of insecticide resistance in one of the major malaria mosquito species.\" \n \n Anopheles gambiae, a major malaria vector, is interbreeding with isolated pockets of another malaria mosquito, A. coluzzii. Entomologists initially considered them as the \"M and S forms\" of Anopheles gambiae. They are now recognized as separate species. \n \n Interbreeding of two malaria mosquito species in the West African country of Mali has resulted in a \"super mosquito\" hybrid that's resistant to insecticide-treated bed nets. \n \n \"It's 'super' with respect to its ability to survive exposure to the insecticides on treated bed nets,\" said medical entomologist Gregory Lanzaro of UC Davis, who led the research team. \n \n \"What we provide in this new paper is an example of one unusual mechanism that has promoted the rapid evolution of insecticide resistance in one of the major malaria mosquito species.\" \n \n Anopheles gambiae, a major malaria vector, is interbreeding with isolated pockets of another malaria mosquito, A. coluzzii. Entomologists initially considered them as the \"M and S forms\" of Anopheles gambiae.

The World Health Organization's World Malaria Report indicates that deaths from malaria worldwide have decreased by 47 percent since 2000. Much of that is attributed to the insecticide-treated bed nets. However, it was just a matter of time for insecticide resistance to emerge, medical entomologists and epidemiologist agree. \n \n Now there's \"an urgent need to develop new and effective malaria vector control strategies,\" Lanzaro said. A number of new strategies are in development, including new insecticides, biological agents -- including mosquito-killing bacteria and fungi -- and genetic manipulation of mosquitoes aimed at either killing them or altering their ability to transmit the malaria parasite. \n \n ### \n \n First author on the paper is Laura Norris, a postdoctoral scholar in the UC Davis Department of Entomology and Nematology who was supported by a National Institutes of Health training grant awarded to Lanzaro. She has since accepted a position with the President's Malaria Initiative in Washington, D.C. \n \n Other co-authors include, at UC Davis, Anthony Cornel, Yoosook Lee, Bradley Main and Travis Collier; and Abdrahamane Fofana of the Malaria Research and Training Center at the University of Bamako, Mali. Three grants from the National Institutes of Health funded the research. \n \n Lanzaro has researched mosquitos in Mali for 24 years with Cornel, who is an associate professor in the UC Davis Department of Entomology and Nematology and headquartered at the UC Kearney Agriculture and Research Center, Parlier. Both are graduate student advisors in the department, training medical entomologists of tomorrow."], "summary": "\u2013 For years, campaigns such as Nothing But Nets have been trying to control the scourge of malaria\u2014a blood disease spread by mosquito bites\u2014by sending insecticide-laced nets to hard-hit regions (mostly in Africa). But a University of California-Davis study has some bad news: Researchers have discovered a hybrid \"super mosquito\" that seems to be resistant to the treated nets. The study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences indicates that Anopheles coluzzii mosquitoes in Mali that cross-bred with the A. gambiae variety created the superinsect\u2014\"'super' with respect to its ability to survive exposure to the insecticides,\" says Gregory Lanzaro, the study's lead author, in a press release. Although he's not surprised insecticide resistance is rising, it's still worrisome: \"It is resulting in the failure of the nets to provide meaningful control.\" There were about 584,000 deaths from malaria in 2013, 90% of them occurring in Africa, according to the World Health Organization; every 60 seconds a child there dies from the disease, Nothing But Nets adds. But inroads have been made: Intervention tactics, including insecticide-treated nets, helped cut the mortality rate 54% in Africa between 2000 and 2013, the WHO notes\u2014and in 2013, 49% of all African residents at risk for the disease (up from a mere 3% in 2004) had access to insecticide-laced nets. This new finding could throw a wrench in that progress, and new preventative measures will need to be explored.
