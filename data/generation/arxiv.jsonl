einstein condensates  @xcite , and so on . however , nothing in the principles of quantum mechanics prevents macroscopic systems from attaining entanglement . recently , there has been considerable interest in investigating entanglement in mesoscopic and even macroscopic systems  @xcite . this is due to the fact that such entanglement might provide explicit evidence for quantum phenomena  @xcite and even might possibly help us to clarify the quantum - to - classical transition , as well as the boundary between classical and quantum worlds  @xcite . since mechanical oscillators resemble a prototype of classical systems , they are beginning to be important candidates for the investigation of quantum features at mesoscopic and macroscopic scales . additionally , with the rapid progress of practical technologies in cavity optomechanics , the mechanical oscillators can be cooled down close to the quantum ground state  @xcite . thus they provide a nature platform to explore quantum entanglement in macroscopic systems .    in recent years , based on the optomechanical systems , some schemes have been brought forward to generate entanglement between macroscopic oscillators from many different angles of view : such as entangling two oscillators in a ring cavity  @xcite , entangling two distantly separated oscillators by utilizing the entangled light fields  @xcite , entangling two oscillators via a double - cavity set - up by driving squeezing optical fields  @xcite , entangling a fabry - prot cavity s two moving mirrors by driving an intense classical laser field  @xcite , entangling two dielectric membranes suspended inside a fabry - prot cavity  @xcite , entangling two macroscopic mechanical resonators induced by the radiation pressure of a single photon in a two - cavity optomechanical system  @xcite , and entangling two movable mirrors in an optomechanical cavity in which a kerr - down - conversion crystal consisting of a kerr nonlinear medium and an optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) is placed  @xcite . in these schemes , however , the previous works  @xcite have verified that the injection of the squeezed field is the necessary condition to generate the desired entanglement . huang and agarwal  @xcite proposed a scheme to entangle two separated mechanical oscillators by injecting broad band squeezed vacuum light and laser light into the ring cavity . this scheme showed that the entanglement can be modulated via the squeezing parameter of the input light . in the case of no injection of the squeezed vacuum light , which means that the squeezed vacuum light is replaced by the ordinary vacuum light , there is always no entanglement between the separated oscillators . however , once the incident vacuum light is squeezed , the entanglement exists . et al . _ @xcite also proposed a scheme to generate a stationary entangled state of two movable mirrors if and only if the incident fields are squeezed . in ref . @xcite , even though the entanglement between two mechanical oscillators in an optomechanical cavity can be generated when the injected field is not squeezed , the region of entanglement is discrete and very narrow , so which inevitably brings difficulties to achieve the entanglement in experiment . however , when the injected field is adjusted to the squeezed field , the region of entanglement is continuous and greatly enlarged . in essence , the opa inside the optomechanical cavity can produce various novel effects including improvement of the cooling of the micromechanical mirror  @xcite , affection of the normal - mode splitting behavior of the coupled movable mirror and the cavity field  @xcite , achievement of strong mechanical squeezing  @xcite , and enhancement of the precision of optomechanical position detection  @xcite . the nonlinear interaction processes between light and opa have been demonstrated as important sources of squeezed state of the radiation field  @xcite . agarwal and huang  @xcite have had the opa placed inside the optomechanical cavity so that the squeezing cavity field is generated inside the cavity . via driving the system by the red - detuned laser in the resolved side band limit makes the optomechanical interaction between the movable mirror and the cavity field like a beam - splitter interaction , the state of squeezed photons transfers to phonons with almost 100% efficiency , the strong mechanical squeezing is thus achieved . here we propose a scheme to modulate the entanglement between two oscillators separated in space via the squeezing cavity field generated by the opa instead of directly injecting the squeezing field with the assistance of coulomb interaction . we show that the coulomb interaction between the oscillators is the essential reason for the existence of entanglement and there is competing effect between the radiation pressure interaction and the coulomb interaction for the oscillator which these two interactions act on simultaneously . according to ref . @xcite , the gain of the opa and the phase of the pump driving the opa can simultaneously modulate the squeezing cavity field , so the radiation pressure interaction between the cavity field and the oscillator is modulated accordingly . in this way the modulation of the entanglement between the oscillators separated in space is achieved . in addition , we numerically simulate the critical temperature of such entanglement in experimentally feasible regimes . the results show that the laser driving power and the gain of the opa can improve the critical temperature . compared with previous schemes  @xcite , our scheme has stronger robustness against the temperature of environment . the paper is organized as follows . in sec . , we establish the model and present the equations of motion of the system . in sec . , we give the steady - state mean values , linearize the quantum langevin equations , and introduce the logarithmic negativity to quantify the entanglement between the oscillators . in sec . , we numerically simulate the logarithmic negativity and show the modulation of entanglement . finally we make a conclusion to summarize our results in sec . .", "the system considered consists of a fabry -

( [ e5 ] ) , we can obtain a set of nonlinear algebraic equations for the steady state values and a set of quantum langevin equations for the fluctuation operators  @xcite . through setting all the time derivatives in algebra equations for the steady state value to zero , the steady state mean values of system are given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the effective cavity detuning from the frequency of the input laser in the presence of the radiation pressure . the modification of the detuning by the @xmath55 term depends on the mechanical motion . the @xmath56 represents the new equilibrium position of the oscillator @xmath0 relative to that in the absence of the optomechanical and coulomb interactions and @xmath57 denotes the steady state amplitude of the cavity field .    in order to analyze the oscillator - oscillator steady state entanglement , we need to find out the fluctuations in the oscillators amplitudes . so we are interested in the dynamics of small fluctuations around the steady state of the system . for generating the entanglement , generally , the cavity is intensively driven with a very large input power _ , which means that at the steady state , the intracavity field has a large amplitude , i.e. , @xmath58 . in this strong driving limit , we can ignore some small quantities and get the linearized langevin equations @xmath59    if we choose the phase reference of the cavity field so that @xmath57 is real and introduce the amplitude and phase fluctuations of the cavity field as @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and the position and momentum fluctuations of the thermal noise as @xmath62 and @xmath63 , eq .

( [ e10 ] ) are stable only if all the eigenvalues of the matrix _ m _ have negative real parts . the stability conditions can be derived by applying the routh - hurwitz criterion  @xcite , yielding the constrain conditions on the system parameters . due to their expressions are considerable tedious , we do nt report them here . however , we will satisfy the stability conditions of the system in the following analysis . the solution of the first - order linear inhomogeneous differential eq.([e10 ] ) can be solved as following form @xmath70 where the matrix @xmath71 and the initial condition @xmath72 ( _ i _ is the identity matrix ) . an important type of continuous variable quantum states is the gaussian states , which play a significant role in the foundation of quantum theory and also have potential applications in their relevant experiment  @xcite . the linearized effective hamiltonian which corresponds to the linearized langevin eq . ( [ e9 ] ) ensures that when the system is stable , it always reaches a gaussian state whose information - related properties , such as entanglement and entropy , can be completely described by the symmetric @xmath73 covariance matrix @xmath74  @xcite with components defined as @xmath75 from eqs .

( [ e7 ] ) @xmath78 it is easy to obtain that @xmath77 is diagonal @xmath79 $ ] . from the point of view of describing the dynamics of the system gaussian states , eq . ( [ e15 ] ) is equivalent to the quantum langevin equations eq . ( [ e9 ] ) but is more convenient for studying entanglement evolution .    the reduced @xmath80 covariance matrix @xmath81 for the mechanical oscillators @xmath0 and @xmath1 of interest here can be extracted from the full @xmath73 covariance matrix @xmath74 . if the reduced covariance matrix @xmath81 is written as the block form @xmath82,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 are @xmath84 block matrices , then the entanglement of the two separated mechanical oscillators @xmath0 and @xmath1 quantified by the logarithmic negativity can be readily calculated  @xcite @xmath85,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86^{1/2}\\right\\}^{1/2}$ ] , with @xmath87 . therefore , a gaussian state is entangled if and only if @xmath88 , which is equivalent to simon s necessary and sufficient entanglement nonpositive partial transpose criterion for gaussian states  @xcite .", "[ fig2 ]   as a function of the normalized detuning @xmath89 for three different values of the coulomb coupling strength @xmath90 ( orange diamond line ) , @xmath91 ( blue square line ) , and @xmath92 ( red sphere line ) in the absence of the opa ( @xmath93 ) . here we have set the temperature of environment @xmath94 mk and driving power @xmath95 mw.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in this section , we numerically evaluate the logarithmic negativity @xmath96 between the two separated oscillators @xmath0 and @xmath1 to show the modulation of entanglement under the action of the opa in experimentally accessible parameter regimes . without loss of generality , we assume that all the parameters of the two mechanical oscillators to be the same , i.e. , @xmath97 , @xmath98 . we choose the parameters in our numerical calculations are based on the experiment conditions  @xcite : @xmath99 mhz , @xmath100 hz , @xmath101 mhz , @xmath102 ng , @xmath103 mm , and the wavelength of driving laser @xmath104 nm .    first , we illustrate the effect of the coulomb interaction on the entanglement between the two separated mechanical oscillators in the absence of the opa ( @xmath93 ) . the logarithmic negativity @xmath96 as a function of the normalized detuning @xmath89 for three different values of the coulomb coupling strength @xmath90 ( orange diamond line ) , @xmath91 ( blue square line ) , and @xmath92 ( red sphere line ) at temperature @xmath94 mk and driving power @xmath95 mw in the absence of the opa is shown in fig . as illustrated in previous section , as long as the logarithmic negativity @xmath105 , there is an entanglement between the oscillators , meaning that there is a quantum correlation between them , even though they are separated in space . from fig .  2 , one can clearly see that the larger the coupling parameter @xmath106 is , the stronger the oscillators entangle and the broader the range of the entanglement is . the numerical result shows that if there is no the coulomb coupling , it is not possible to entangle the oscillators which are separated in space . so the coulomb interaction between the oscillators is the essential reason of the entanglement .    in the previous schemes , ref . @xcite proposed a scheme for entangling two separated oscillators by injecting squeezed vacuum light and laser light into the ring cavity . the entanglement between the oscillators can be modulated via the squeezing parameter of the input light . when the squeezed vacuum light is replaced by an ordinary vacuum light , i.e. , the squeezing parameter of the input light is 0 , there is no entanglement between the oscillators . however , on squeezing the injected vacuum light , the entanglement between the oscillators is emerged . when the squeezing parameter of the input light @xmath107 , the entanglement becomes more and more stronger with the increase of @xmath108 , while @xmath109 , the entanglement becomes more and more weaker with the increase of @xmath108 . so in this scheme modulation of the entanglement between the separated oscillators can be achieved by means of the squeezing parameter of the input light . @xcite also proposed a method to coherently control the entanglement between two movable mirrors via placing the kerr - down - conversion crystal consisting of kerr nonlinear medium and opa inside an optomechanical cavity . by the aid of the input squeezed vacuum field , the kerr nonlinear medium can lead to stronger entanglement between the two movable mirrors and extend to wider entanglement region . whereas the effect of the opa on entanglement is completely opposite , it leads weaker entanglement and narrower entanglement region . so modulation of the entanglement between two separated movable mirrors can be achieved via the kerr - down - conversion crystal . the above two schemes have the common point that they all resort to the external squeezed vacuum filed . aa a matter of fact , the nonlinear interaction processes between light and opa have been considered as important sources of squeezed state of the radiation field  @xcite . next we take advantage of the nonlinearity of the opa to generate the squeezed photons inside the optomechanical cavity which can interact directly with the oscillator @xmath0 to modulate the entanglement between the separated oscillators instead of resorting to additional external squeezed vacuum field .

we fix the gain of the opa @xmath114 hz and other parameters are as same as the fig . the logarithmic negativity @xmath96 as a function of the normalized detuning @xmath89 for four different values of the phase of the pump driving the opa @xmath116 ( olive diamond line ) , @xmath118 ( blue pentagon line ) , @xmath119 ( green triangle line ) , and @xmath120 ( red sphere line ) is shown in fig . it can be clearly seen that the entanglement between the oscillators becomes more and more stronger with the increase of the phase @xmath20 when @xmath121 for the fixed gain @xmath19 of the opa . this is due to the fact that the degree of the squeezing of the squeezed photons generated by the opa becomes more and more smaller with the increase of the phase @xmath20 for the fixed gain @xmath19 and the coulomb interaction becomes the dominant factor compared with the radiation pressure interaction for the oscillator @xmath0 . we can also find that when @xmath122 , all curves are intersected in one point . this can be interpreted as driving the system by the red - detuned laser @xmath122 in the resolved sideband limit makes the optomechanical interaction between the cavity field and the

the pump driving @xmath118 is plotted in fig .  5 , wherein in fig .  5(a ) @xmath110 hz while @xmath112 hz in fig . it can be concluded that for the fixed gain @xmath19 of the opa , as the temperature of the environment increases , the amount of entanglement monotonically decreases due to the thermal fluctuation which is as expected . the higher the temperature of the environment becomes , the stronger the thermal noise is . then the entanglement between two oscillators is submerged by the strong thermal noise . the critical temperature of the entanglement is improved with the increase of the laser driving power for the fixed gain @xmath19 of the opa and the numerical simulation results indicate that the robustness is obviously increased compared with previous schemes  @xcite . while for the fixed laser driving power , the critical temperature of the entanglement is higher with respect to the larger gain @xmath19 of the opa . more importantly , it has been verified that the opa inside a cavity can considerably improve the cooling of the oscillator by radiation pressure  @xcite . so the opa not only can improve the robustness of the entanglement , but also can cool the oscillator to its quantum ground state , which is very significant from the experimental point . additionally , the relevant experimental investigation in such temperature requirement can be explored in the circuit cavity electromechanics  @xcite , which is easily cooled to temperatures below 100 mk . methods for detection of entanglement have been discussed in  @xcite and the entanglement properties between the oscillators can be verified by experimentally measuring the corresponding covariance matrix . it can be achieved by combining existing experimental techniques . the mechanical position and momentum can be measured with the setup proposed in  @xcite , in which via adjusting the detuning and bandwidth of an additional adjacent cavity , both position and momentum of the oscillator can be measured by homodyning the output of the second cavity .", "in conclusion , we have shown that the modulation of entanglement between oscillators separated in space can be achieved via the squeezing cavity field generated by the opa instead of directly injecting the squeezing field with the assistance of coulomb interaction . we showed that the coulomb interaction between the oscillators is the essential reason for the existence of entanglement . through modulating the squeezing cavity field by the gain of opa and the phase of the pump driving the opa , the radiation pressure interaction between the cavity field and the oscillator obtains modulation accordingly . with the assistance of coulomb interaction , we showed that under the action of competing effect between the radiation pressure interaction and coulomb interaction , the entanglement between the oscillators can be modulated successfully . moreover , in experimentally feasible regimes , the results of numerical simulation showed that the present scheme has stronger robustness against the temperature of environment compared with previous schemes . this work was supported by the national

separated in space via the squeezing cavity field generated by the optical parametric amplifier instead of injecting the squeezing field directly with the assistance of coulomb interaction . we show that the coulomb interaction between the oscillators is the essential reason for the existence of entanglement . due to the gain of the optical parametric amplifier and the phase of the pump driving the optical parametric amplifier can simultaneously modulate the squeezing cavity field , the radiation pressure interaction between the cavity field and the oscillator is modulated accordingly . we find that there is competing effect between the radiation pressure interaction and the coulomb interaction for the oscillator which these two interactions act on simultaneously . therefore , the modulation of entanglement can be achieved with the assistance of coulomb interaction . the results of numerical simulation show that the present scheme has stronger robustness against the temperature of environment compared with previous schemes in experimentally feasible regimes .", "ranking": [4, 3, 0, 2, 1]}

perturbative system , and makes it difficult to study the physics of the strong interaction . since the early stage of the study of qcd , the mit bag model has been one of popular models of hadrons @xcite . there , the inside of the bag is assumed to be a perturbative space , and the quark dynamics is treated perturbatively with much success @xcite . furthermore by requiring chiral symmetry , the bag model was shown to have a pion cloud @xcite . the chirally symmetric coupling between pions and quarks at the bag surface gives a conservation of the axial vector current . however , the strong pion - quark coupling causes an instability of the bag itself @xcite . in order to avoid this problem , a skyrmion was introduced outside of the bag , whose model setup is called as the chiral bag model . other extensions , such as the cloudy bag model @xcite , the chiral bag model with vector mesons @xcite , are also useful models .    in the qcd vacuum , chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken and the constituent quark mass is induced dynamically @xcite . the non - perturbative structure of the vacuum in the bag is a long standing problem @xcite . contrary to the original expectation , it is interesting to see that the vacuum structure inside the bag may become nontrivial , where quark and gluon condensates may take finite values due to the boundary conditions . in the chiral bag , the pion cloud is also a source for non - perturbative nature inside the bag , since the pions and quarks interact with each other strongly @xcite . for instance , the quark scalar condensate has a finite value @xmath0 in the mit bag model @xcite and also in the chiral bag model @xcite . it is comparable to the observed value @xmath1 as given in the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite and the other approaches . therefore , it would be a natural question whether the non - perturbative vacuum is induced by the boundary conditions or some dynamical interactions such as the njl one .    in this paper , to understand the non - perturbative dynamics in the bag , the njl interaction is introduced as a quark - quark interaction inside the chiral bag @xcite . this approach is justified when the color confinement is caused by long range gluon dynamics at distance @xmath2 fm , while the chiral symmetry breaking occurs at shorter distance scale @xmath3 fm , as suggested by instanton dynamics @xcite . indeed such a separation of the length scales has been considered in the context of the njl model in the hadron dynamics @xcite . in recent approaches based on ads / cft correspondence , it is suggested that there is a window of the gauge coupling where chiral symmetry breaking occurs in a deconfinement phase @xcite . further analysis for the hybrid model of the njl model and the chiral bag model , which may be called as the njl chiral bag model , was given in @xcite . it is well known that the strong pion - quark coupling in the chiral bag causes the chiral vacuum polarization inside the bag @xcite . familiar examples are the conservation of baryon number and the chiral casimir energy @xcite . it was shown that the njl chiral bag with finite quark mass also holds the properties of the vacuum polarization @xcite .    in the previous studies of the njl bag model @xcite , only the scalar condensate was considered . however , this channel causes a divergence of the chiral casimir energy in the limit of zero bag radius . in the present work , we will show that a self - consistent solution can be found with finite quark condensates for the baryon number @xmath4 system by considering not only the scalar channel but also the pseudoscalar channel . the latter channel is required by the hedgehog ansatz in the pion sector . in this way , we can study the quark condensates inside hadrons ( quark bag ) by both quark boundary conditions ( chiral casimir effects ) and the self - consistency condition from the njl interaction . we evaluate the quark condensates as mode sums in the chiral bag model without introducing a cutoff as in the ordinary njl model . we consider this as a counter representation of the long - range dynamics with a cutoff , which is valid inside the chiral bag .    in this paper , in order to avoid numerical complications of the 1 + 3 dimensional model , instead , we consider a 1 + 1 dimensional system with the gross - neveu model @xcite in analogy with the realistic case . in this way , we expect to learn essential non - trivial dynamics of the njl interaction inside the bag . in our model , quarks are confined in a finite segment of the line in a u(1 ) @xmath5 u(1 ) chirally symmetric way . this simplification has an advantage that an analytical calculation can be performed . such a model setup does not modify the qualitative feature of the chiral vacuum polarization in the realistic 1 + 3 dimensional bag . indeed , in the conventional chiral bag model with massless quarks , the 1 + 1 dimensional chiral bag was shown to provide a clear understanding of the quark vacuum polarization properties @xcite . this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , the njl chiral bag model is introduced in the 1 + 1 dimensional system . using the hedgehog ansatz and the mean field approximation for the njl interaction , a self - consistent equation is derived . chiral vacuum polarizations such as the baryon number conservation and the chiral casimir energy are investigated carefully . the self - consistent equation is solved and the total energy of the njl chiral bag is investigated . in section 3 , our results are discussed . the final section is devoted to the conclusion .", "the purpose of this section is to formulate the 1 + 1 dimensional chiral bag with the njl @xcite ( or the gross - neveu @xcite ) interaction . here , we discuss effects of finite quark mass , which are induced by the mean field of the njl interaction , to the vacuum polarization in the chiral bag . we consider the lagrangian @xmath6   \\theta(r-|x| )                -

gordon field with u(1 ) @xmath5 u(1 ) symmetry @xcite @xmath14 which mimics the topological property of the pion field in the 1 + 3 dimensional system in the skyrme model @xcite . the delta function with @xmath15 gives a chirally symmetric interaction between quark and pion at the bag boundary . the last term with @xmath16 is a cosine potential to give a dynamically stable soliton solution , in which @xmath16 plays a role of the  pion mass \" . the pion decay constant is a dimensionless quantity in the 1 + 1 dimensional system , and can be eliminated by rescaling the chiral field and the pion mass . the energy of the sine -

gordon equation except for a phase factor . for instance , if we replace @xmath27 for @xmath28 , we find a continuous solution at @xmath29 satisfying @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    ) .,width=302 ]    for the quark sector inside the bag , we introduce quark condensates not only in the scalar channel but also in the pseudoscalar channel . in the mean field approximation , we take the following ansatz @xmath32 for a self - consistent equation with a dynamical quark mass @xmath33 . the mean field approximation is taken in a basis set of the quark wavefunctions in the bag . here we assume that the quark mass @xmath33 and chiral angle @xmath20 are chosen to be independent of the position @xmath21 inside the bag . we mention that @xmath20 is continuous to @xmath25 at @xmath34 . as a result , we obtain the lagrangian @xmath35 \\psi \\theta(r-|x| )                -

( [ eq : lagrangian2 ] ) induces a bag boundary condition at @xmath38 @xmath39 then , the eigenvalue equation is obtained as @xmath40 for the states with @xmath41 with quark energy @xmath42 and momentum @xmath43 . for @xmath44 , replacing @xmath45 with @xmath46 , we obtain @xmath47 the parity @xmath48 is defined by the parity transformation @xmath49    in fig . [ fig : er_f_mr ] , we plot the quark eigenenergy @xmath50 as functions of the chiral angle @xmath20 for massless quark , @xmath51 , and massive quark , @xmath52 . it is seen that the quark energies are odd functions of @xmath53 . namely the quark spectrum is anti - symmetric under the transformation of @xmath54 . it is also interesting that the energy levels are periodic with the periodicity @xmath55 along with @xmath20 . in particular , the lowest level crosses @xmath56 at @xmath57 regardless the mass value @xmath33 . this is due to the chiral phase in the mass term in eq . ( [ eq : lagrangian2 ] ) ; without the chiral phase this property is not maintained as shown in @xcite . in fig . [ fig : er_f_mr ] , in the small energy region near @xmath56 , we see that the spectrum for massive quark is modified as compared with that for the massless quark . however , the asymptotic behaviors in the high energy region are qualitatively similar to the massless case .     for ( a ) @xmath51 and ( b ) @xmath52 . the solid and dashed lines indicate the parity @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively . , width=377 ]      in the njl chiral bag model , various quark matrix elements have contributions from the vacuum due to the modification of the dirac spectrum by the strong pion field . in this subsection , we discuss the vacuum polarization including the effect of the finite quark mass . in principle , the quark mass @xmath33 is related with the chiral angle @xmath20 and the bag radius @xmath60 through the self - consistent equations , ( [ eq : mean_field1 ] ) and ( [ eq : mean_field2 ] ) . however , in order to understand the finite quark mass effect on the vacuum polarization , we take the quark mass as a constant value irrespective to the chiral angle and the bag radius in this subsection . let us first investigate the baryon number . in the previous studies , the total baryon number was shown to be always conserved , where the contribution of the bag vacuum played an essential role @xcite . here , once again in the present model , the exact conservation of the baryon number can be shown . the expectation value of the baryon number carried by quarks is defined by the symmetric sum over positive and negative energy states . the baryon number is defined by @xmath61 ,      \\label{eq : baryon_number0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the summation converges thanks to the convergence factor @xmath62 . instead of the exponential type , it is much easier to use the strutinsky method in numerical calculations . this method has an advantage that a sufficient convergence is obtained by summing these series up to @xmath63 @xcite , while in the other methods we need more states , typically @xmath64 @xcite . the numerical results agree with the form @xmath65 which is valid for any quark mass @xmath33 . this solution is obtained easily by analytical calculation especially for the massless quark . therefore , containing the valence quarks with the baryon number @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath69 , we obtain the baryon number in the quark sector as @xmath70 which give fractional baryon numbers depending on the chiral angle . the total baryon number in the quark and pion sectors is conserved irrespective to the chiral angle . we define the pion topological current @xmath71 then , the fractional baryon number in the pion sector is @xmath72 then , the total baryon number is given as sum of them in the quark and pion sectors ; @xmath73 . next we consider the chiral casimir energy of the bag vacuum . the chiral casimir energy is defined as the difference of the energies at @xmath20 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 where @xmath76 ,     \\label{eq : chiral_casimir_energy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath77 . especially for massless quarks , an analytical result is obtained as @xmath78 in general , the numerical results for the chiral casimir energies are shown as functions of the chiral angle for several quark masses in fig . [ fig : ecr_f_mr ] . it is a remarkable point that the chiral casimir energy vanishes at the chiral angle @xmath79 , not only for massless quarks , but also for massive quarks . this is because the chiral phase in the quark mass term in eq . ( [ eq : lagrangian2 ] ) conserves the chiral symmetry in quark sector . indeed , the chiral phase guarantees the periodic structure of the quark spectrum and the energy spectrums coincide at @xmath74 and @xmath79 except for parity as shown in fig . [ fig : er_f_mr ] . this result ensures a continuity from the bag model to the skyrmion , as we discuss later . we mention that , without the chiral phase , the chiral casimir energy takes an infinite value at @xmath79 and the continuity is not maintained for massive quarks , as discussed in @xcite .     as a function of the chiral angle @xmath20 . the solid , long - dashed and short - dashed lines indicate the quark masses @xmath51 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively.,width=302 ]      now , we consider the self - consistent equations ( [ eq : mean_field1 ] ) and ( [ eq : mean_field2 ] ) . we regard the quark mass and the chiral angle as averaged values inside the bag , since they are assumed to be independent of the position . correspondingly , we also consider that the quark scalar and pseudoscalar densities for each eigenstate @xmath82 are defined as values averaged over the bag volume , @xmath83_{\\rm v } & \\equiv & \\frac{1}{v } \\int_{-r}^{r } \\bar{\\psi}_{n } \\psi_{n } { \\rm d}x ,   \\\\   \\left [ \\bar{\\psi}_{n } i \\gamma_{5 } \\epsilon(x ) \\psi_{n } \\right]_{\\rm v } & \\equiv & \\frac{1}{v } \\int_{-r}^{r } \\bar{\\psi}_{n } i \\gamma_{5 } \\epsilon(x ) \\psi_{n } { \\rm d}x,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with bag volume @xmath84 . here , @xmath85 is multiplied in eq .

( [ eq : quark_density_2 ] ) . here the bag radius @xmath60 is multiplied in the both sides to make them dimensionless . by setting @xmath112 , we compare the left and right hand sides of the self - consistent equation ( [ eq : self2 ] ) for several chiral angles @xmath20 and quark masses @xmath33 . the quark condensate , @xmath113 , in the left hand side is shown as a function of the quark mass for each chiral angle @xmath74 , @xmath57 and @xmath79 by the thick solid , long - dashed and short - dashed lines , respectively , in fig .

[ fig : f_r_m ] . the chiral angle approaches @xmath55 in the limit of the small bag radius . consequently the skyrmion and the mit bag is connected smoothly by changing the bag radius . in fig . [ fig : e_r_m ] , we show the total energy @xmath50 ( solid line ) , pion energy @xmath125 ( dashed line ) , quark energy @xmath126 ( dot - dashed line ) as functions of the bag radius @xmath60 . here @xmath112 and 0 are represented by thick lines and thin lines , respectively . as seen in the conventional chiral bag model ( @xmath127 ) , the pion energy is dominant rather than the quark energy for small bag radius , and vice versa for large bag radius . the former gives the skyrmion , and the latter gives the mit bag . the dominance of each contribution is clearly seen as the njl coupling constant is switched on ; the pion dominates for @xmath128 fm and the quark dominates for @xmath129 fm . note that the total energy becomes rather independent of the bag radius @xmath60 when the volume term @xmath130 with a suitable value of the bag constant @xmath131 . therefore , the skyrmion and the mit bag are smoothly connected by varying the bag radius , consistent with ceshire cat picture , which is well known in the conventional chiral bag model .    in fig . [ fig : m_r ] , we show the dynamical quark mass as a function of the bag radius for @xmath112 . the quark mass approaches zero in the large bag radius , which is consistent with the condition of the mit bag . on the other hand , the quark mass is dynamically generated for finite bag radii . therefore , we find that the njl interaction induces the dynamical quark mass in the chiral bag . although the quark mass becomes too large for small bag radii , @xmath132 fm , it should not be taken too seriously . for small bag radii , the four point quark interaction @xmath10 may decrease , hence the quark mass approaches a finite value in the small bag radius limit . consequently our model serves a description that confined quarks in a finite size bag behave as constituent quarks . the fact that the finite dynamical quark mass is induced inside a finite size bag may persist for the realistic situation of 1 + 3 dimensions , implying spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .

( [ eq : massless1 ] ) . although the direct comparison of the coefficients does not make much sense , qualitative agreement between the two results indicates that we can proceed further discussions about quark condensates in a formalism of the njl chiral bag model . previously , it was discussed by kunihiro to employ the njl model inside the chiral bag @xcite . there the strong @xmath135 field is considered to cause the chiral symmetry breaking in the bag . in our discussion , the dynamical quark mass in the empty bag takes a maximum value at the chiral angle @xmath74 and @xmath55 as shown by the dashed line in fig . [ fig : mr_f_g ] ( b ) . this means that the quark mass becomes maximum when the point on the chiral circle approaches the sigma axis . therefore the idea of refs . @xcite is supported by the present analysis in the njl chiral bag model .", "we discuss the quark condensate in the chiral bag with the njl interaction inside the chiral bag . we employ the 1 + 1 dimensional model in order to avoid numerical complication . in the outside region of the bag , the sine - gordon field is introduced for topological properties as a pion cloud to mimic the skyrmion in the 1 + 3 dimensional system .    considering the strong correlation between the quarks and pions , the hedgehog ansatz is employed for the mean fields of the quarks and pions . the scalar and pseudoscalar densities are defined as mean fields with the chiral angle in a self - consistent way . these quark condensates are then computed explicitly as mode sums in the chiral bag . solutions of the mean field equation leads to the generation of the dynamical quark mass . as a chiral vacuum polarization , conservation of baryon number is shown to be valid for finite quark condensate . the chiral casimir energy is also shown to be well defined without divergence . there it is important that the symmetry of the single quark spectrum is conserved by the chiral phase . consequently , the njl chiral bag connects smoothly the finite size bag and the skyrmion as the cheshire cat picture implies . we emphasize that , without the chiral phase , the smooth behavior is not obtained for massive quarks @xcite . the generation of dynamical quark mass in a bag supports the previous conjectures that the non - perturbative dynamics of quarks and gluons remain inside the bag @xcite . it suggests us to reconsider the original picture of the mit bag model in which a perturbative space is assumed inside the bag . it would be interesting to consider the relevance to the recent observation in the rhic experiments which indicate strong quark correlation with finite mass at temperature higher than @xmath136 . in order to have clear picture for non - perturbative dynamics of the bag , it will be an interesting subject to study the realistic 1 + 3 dimensional njl chiral bag , and discuss physical observables , which can be compared with experimental data .", "we express thanks to prof . t.  kunihiro for comments and discussions . this work is partially supported by a grant - in - aid for scientific research for priority areas , mext ( ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ) with no . 17070002 . g.  e.  brown and m.  rho , _ phys . lett . _ * b82 * , 177 ( 1979 ) . g.  e.  brown , m.  rho and v.  vento , _ phys . lett . _ * b84 * , 383 ( 1979 ) . v. vento , m. rho , e. m.nyman , j. h. jun , and g. e. brown , _ nucl . phys . _ * a345 * , 413 ( 1980 ) . y. nambu and g. jona - lasinio , _ phys . rev_. * 122 * , 345 ( 1961 ) , * 124 * , 246 ( 1961 ) ; u.  vogl and w.  weise , _ prog . part . * 27 * , 195 ( 1991 ) ; s.  p.  klevansky , _ rev . * 64 * , 649 ( 1992 ) ; t.  hatsuda and t.  kunihiro , _ phys . _ * 247 * , 221 ( 1994 ) . o.  kiriyama and a.  hosaka , _ phys . rev . _ * d67 * , 085010 ( 2003 ) . s.  yasui , a.  hosaka and h.  toki , _ phys . rev . _ * d71 * , 074009 ( 2005 ) . s.  yasui and a.  hosaka , _ int . phys . _ * e15 * , 595 ( 2006 ) . s.  yasui and a.  hosaka , _ phys . rev . _ * d74 * , 054036 ( 2006 ) . g. e. brown and m. rho , _ commnets nucl . phys . _ * 18 * , 1 ( 1988 ) . a. hosaka and h. toki , _ prog . suppl . _ * 109 * , 137 ( 1992 ) . g. e. brown , a. d. jackson , m. rho , and v. vento , _ phys . _ * b140 * , 285 ( 1984 ) . a. hosaka and h. toki , _ phys . lett . _ * b167 * , 153 ( 1986 ) ."], "summary": "we discuss the quark condensate of the vacuum inside the baryon . we analyze the 1 + 1 dimensional chiral bag in analogy with the realistic 1 + 3 dimensional one . the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) type interaction is used to investigate the quark condensate in the chiral bag . considering the strong meson - quark coupling , we solve the mean field solution to the scalar and pseudoscalar channels . extracting the finite values of the chiral casimir energy and the quark condensate by proper regularization , the resulting self - consistent equation allows a generation of a finite dynamical quark mass inside the bag .", "ranking": [3, 2, 1, 0, 4]}

back time . younger objects tend have built up less metal abundance which in turn lowers the luminosity of objects like cepheid variables . if intrinsic redshifts of younger material is operative , galaxies like the perseus cluster would need low particle masses@xmath5 to explain their apparent association with ngc 891 . the smaller elementary particle masses would give smaller luminosities of objects in those galaxies . all of these effects would combine in the direction of making the hubble constant appear lower in the past and lead to the impression that it was speeding up at present . ironically , if we move sn2006gy to this closer distance it could reinstate supernovae i as , at least , approximate distance indicators .", "n. smith et al . j. and http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0612617 ( version 3 ) ."], "summary": "a recent supernova has been reported as exceeding `` the light output of an ordinary supernova by at least two orders of magnitude '' . it is noted that it falls in a minor galaxy in the perseus cluster . some evidence indicating a ten times closer distance for the perseus cluster than its redshift distance is discussed here .", "ranking": [0, 3, 1, 2, 4]}

[ fig:2-loop ] , although dominated by a soft gluon , is infrared finite . in fact , even the contribution of the transverse gluon is finite in this particular calculation , due to kinematical constraints . indeed , it is trivial to see that the two delta functions corresponding to the cut quarks @xmath6 become @xmath7 in the limit of vanishing @xmath8 , and that the latter pair of delta functions do not have a common support if @xmath9 : for the bremsstrahlung process we are considering here the energies @xmath10 and @xmath11 have the same sign and hence @xmath12 and @xmath13 can not vanish simultaneously , whatever the value of @xmath14 . it is therefore kinematics , via the _ fermion _ thermal mass , that prevents infrared singularities in this particular topology by providing a natural cutoff of order @xmath15 on the gluon momentum @xmath8 . this statement was tested in @xcite by studying the limit @xmath16 . a stronger divergence was found in the transverse gluon contribution , indicating that @xmath17 played a role in the regularization of this potentially dangerous contribution . but this kinematical cut - off does not apply to additional soft gluons one may insert in the quark loop , like in the diagram of fig . [ fig:3-loop ] for instance . indeed , in topologies involving more than one exchanged gluon , the kinematical argument given above constrains only the _ sum _ of the momenta of the cut gluons . therefore , we know that @xmath18 can not vanish , which tells us that ( for instance ) @xmath8 has a lower bound at the scale @xmath15 , but @xmath19 can still become arbitrary small is of order @xmath15 and @xmath8 can become arbitrary small . ] and this leads to an infrared divergence for the cut depicted on fig .  [ fig:3-loop ] when the ultra - soft gluon is transverse . indeed when compared to the 2-loop diagram , the additional gluon provides ( i ) two coupling constants , ( ii ) two quark propagators , ( iii ) a set of gluon spectral density and statistical weight and ( iv ) the phase - space of the additional gluon . collecting everything , we can estimate by a crude power counting : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the spectral function of the additional gluon , where @xmath22 is introduced as a regulator on the integral over @xmath23 . we used the fact that the quarks are hard , and mostly on - shell because of the cut crossing the quark loop . it is important to stress here that each fermion propagator brings an extra factor @xmath23 in the denominator thus contributing to the infrared sensitivity of the above expression . the conclusions of this naive power counting are the following :    * if the additional gluon is longitudinal , its cutoff is a thermal mass of order @xmath15 , and the corresponding contribution is suppressed by one power of @xmath5 compared to the 2-loop one . * if the additional gluon is transverse it is natural to assume the regulator to be the magnetic mass @xmath24 , and we have @xmath25 . therefore , it seems that if we keep adding transverse gluons in the quark loop , we generate contributions that are all of the same order of magnitude . this fact is very similar to the argument given by linde for the breakdown of perturbation theory in thermal qcd , although in the different context of the calculation of the free energy @xcite . there is nevertheless one reason why this power counting may be too naive . one should indeed keep in mind that this estimate is valid only for a given cut through the 3-loop diagram . it does not take into account potential compensations that may occur when one is summing all the possible cuts . in this paper , we are going to study in more detail this possibility , and its interplay with a magnetic mass at the scale @xmath2 .", "an important feature of the above example is the fact that the _ quark propagators _ participate in the overall infrared divergence of the diagram . in fact , if some quark propagators were not becoming singular in the ir limit , the diagram would have been finite by power counting . this can be generalized to a topology with an arbitrary number of exchanged gluons ( but without 3- and 4-gluon vertices ) . indeed , for these topologies , the number of loops @xmath8 is related to the number of gluons @xmath26 by : @xmath27 one of the @xmath8 loop integrals is an integration @xmath28 over the quark momentum which is hard , and is not concerned by the ir problem . the remaining @xmath29 integrals are over the momenta of the @xmath26 soft gluons . the fact that @xmath30 tells that even if each gluon comes with the singular factor @xmath31 , it is accompanied by a phase space @xmath32 which is enough to make the integral finite . for these topologies , it is the quark propagators which are ultimately responsible for the ir divergences . indeed , it is trivial to see that if one quark propagator is cut , then some other quark propagators become infinite when the gluon momenta go to zero . this is the reason why we are going to focus on the quarks , and do not care about the gluon propagators . it is rather easy to show that there are cancellations at the level of the quark propagators occuring in the calculation of the imaginary part of @xmath33 . let us illustrate that in the reasonably general situation where we have a single quark loop to which are connected the two external photons , and an arbitrary number of internal gluons ( but without non - abelian couplings , see fig . [ fig : kln - generic ] ) . to simplify , we detail only the lower fermion line , and hide the details of the upper line in a complicated function we do not need to specify .    , running from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , indicates which quark propagator is cut on the lower fermion line . _ ]    since we are going to demonstrate cancellations among the various contributions to the dispersive part of the photon polarization tensor , it is convenient to work in the r / a formalism @xcite , in which cutting rules exist that are both very simple and very close to the @xmath1 ones @xcite . therefore , all the contributions to the imaginary part of @xmath36 can be obtained by cuts dividing the diagram into two connected pieces , each of these parts containing at least one external leg . by summing over the index of the cut quark on the lower fermion line , the contribution of the diagram of fig . [ fig : kln - generic ] can be written as . failing to do this , we would get a contribution suppressed compared to the 2-loop result . ] @xmath37 f(p^0,p,\\{l_i\\})\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\times\\sum_{i=0}^{n } \\delta((p+k_i)^2-m^2_\\infty)\\prod_{j\\not = i}{1\\over{(p+k_j)^2-m^2_\\infty}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath38 hides all the details about the denominators on the upper quark line ( as well as the fermionic statistical factors , which do not play any role in the following ) , and where we have defined @xmath39 we can now use the @xmath40 functions to perform explicitly the integral over @xmath41 , which gives after splitting the propagators into positive and negative energy terms @xmath42\\prod_{j=0}^n{1\\over{2\\omega_j } } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\times \\sum_{\\build{i=0}\\over{\\epsilon=\\pm 1}}^{n } \\!f(\\alpha_i^\\epsilon , p,\\{l_i\\ } ) \\prod_{j\\not = i}\\!\\big[{1\\over{\\alpha_i^\\epsilon-\\alpha_j^+ } } -{1\\over{\\alpha_i^\\epsilon-\\alpha_j^-}}\\big ] \\label{eq : kln-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we denote @xmath43 and @xmath44 . according to this definition , all the @xmath45 become equal to @xmath46 when the gluon momenta go to zero . we see that denominators where both @xmath47 s carry the same sign vanish in this limit . the ir singularities therefore show up in the vanishing denominators @xmath48 . only the second line in eq . ( [ eq : kln-1 ] ) is relevant in the following discussion , and it can be compactly rewritten as @xmath49 one can simply observe that for every denominator @xmath48 with numerator @xmath50 appears a denominator @xmath51 with a numerator @xmath52 ( all the other denominators being the same ) . the simple poles therefore cancel trivially . this can be extended to the more complicated situation where more than two @xmath47s tend to a common value , which amounts to prove that these denominators appear in a combination that remains finite for any configuration of the @xmath47s . for that purpose , let us consider an expression like since the compensations occur in fact for each given set of @xmath53s . ] @xmath54 and show that such a quantity is always finite provided some regularity property of the function @xmath38 . the shortest way to see that is to notice that @xmath55 is the leading coefficient of the lagrange polynomial of degree @xmath35 that interpolates between the points @xmath56 : @xmath57 as such , @xmath55 is finite for every values of the @xmath47 s if the function @xmath38 is @xmath35 times differentiable . indeed , if several points @xmath56 collapse into a single point of multiplicity @xmath58 , the lagrange polynomial has a finite limit , and coincides with @xmath38 and its first @xmath59 derivatives at this point . one can note that this argument also applies to insertions of self - energies on the quark line . indeed , the only peculiarity of self - energy insertions is that they force several @xmath47s to have the same value even if the @xmath60 do not tend to zero ; and the above proof works for any configuration of the @xmath47s , whatever the cause that makes them equal is . although the above argument has been presented in the case of a 2-point function , it still works for the dispersive part of any @xmath35-point function ( just attach more photons or gluons to the shaded part of fig . [ fig : kln - generic ] ) .", "the result of the previous section is that the product of all the quark propagators remains finite in the ir sector when the sum over the cuts has been performed . when considering the imaginary part it shows that , for a fixed cut on the upper line , there is no singularity in the propagators of the lower line . the argument should be repeated for the upper line , which is made finite by summing over all the ways of cutting it . these cancellations between different cuts occur within a given topology , and correspond to compensation between real and virtual corrections . they can therefore be seen as a form of the kln theorem . we point out some differences with the usual version of the kln theorem at zero temperature where the exchanged gluons are bare gluons . at finite temperature we deal with resummed gluons and the most dangerous divergences arise when cutting space - like transverse gluons which are shielded by a `` small '' magnetic mass . the time - like gluons are shielded with a `` large '' thermal mass of order @xmath15 and do not lead to any infra - red problems in the context of this study . we are now going to apply the above considerations to study explicitly the 3-loop example already presented in fig . [ fig:3-loop ] . as we have already seen in the introduction , one of the gluon momenta has a lower bound thanks to kinematics , while the other gluon is not constrained in the ultra - soft limit . let us choose the gluon on the right ( momentum @xmath19 ) to be ultra - soft while momentum @xmath8 remains soft . this kinematical constraint prevents the propagators of the lower quarks to become infinite when @xmath61 : they always remain off - shell by some amount controlled by @xmath62 . the constraint also simplifies the pattern of cancellation of infrared divergences in the upper line since the propagators of momentum @xmath63 when @xmath64 can not diverge for the same reason . in consequence we need only the two cuts depicted on fig . [ fig:3-loop - cuts ] to get rid of all the zeroes in the denominators soft and @xmath8 ultra - soft which is easily done by multiplying the final result by a factor @xmath65 . ] . it turns out to be convenient to perform the change of variable @xmath66 in the second contribution , as indicated on fig . [ fig:3-loop - cuts ] . moreover , we neglect @xmath19 in front of @xmath8 whenever these two impulsions appear together ( like in @xmath67 ) . with these notations and approximations , one can readily see that the additional ultra - soft gluon brings the following factors , to be multiplied by the 2-loop integrand ( i.e. the integrand for the diagram of fig . [ fig:2-loop ] ) , respectively for the cuts @xmath68 and @xmath69 : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the transverse projector , and @xmath72 is the transverse spectral function of the gluon ( only the transverse mode of the ultra - soft gluon is relevant , the other gluon can be transverse or longitudinal , as in the 2-loop calculation ) . the factors of form @xmath73 come from the fermion propagators in the hard momentum approximation . we can further simplify these factors by evaluating them at @xmath74 since they are to be multiplied by the 2-loop integrand which contains a @xmath75 . noticing that ( see eq . ( 46 ) in @xcite ) @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the angle between the vectors @xmath78 and @xmath79 , it is easy to perform the angular integral explicitly , which gives : @xmath80 \\ln\\big|{{2rl_1(x+1)\\pm\\delta}\\over{2rl_1(x-1)\\pm\\delta}}\\big| -\\!1 \\big ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad \\pm{{\\pi(1-x^2)}\\over{pl_1\\delta}}\\big[\\ln\\big|{{x+1}\\over{x-1}}\\big|\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\quad -\\ln\\big|{{2rl_1(x+1)\\pm\\delta}\\over{2rl_1(x-1)\\pm\\delta}}\\big|\\big]\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we denote @xmath81 and @xmath82 . the general result established in the previous section says that the sum over the cuts for this quantity should have a finite limit when @xmath83 at fixed @xmath84 ( i.e. when the 4 components of @xmath19 tend to zero ) . one can see that this is not the case on the contributions of the individual cuts , since we have : @xmath85 ( where we have neglected terms regular in @xmath23 ) but occurs trivially for the sum of the two cuts since the singular ( @xmath86 ) part drops out . the interesting quantity is in fact the scale at which this cancellation occurs . the only dimensional quantity to which @xmath23 can be compared with in the above expressions is @xmath87 . carrying out the integration on @xmath88 we find the following finite result : @xmath89    when we add a magnetic mass @xmath22 into the game , we have two regularization mechanisms in competition , and we must compare the scales at which they operate , the most efficient being the one that has the largest scale . a convenient way to introduce , which is a definition analogous to that of the debye screening mass . ] the magnetic mass is via the following sum rule @xmath90 which is a reasonable approximation if @xmath91 is not singular at @xmath92 and does not increase too much when @xmath84 becomes large . adding the two cuts and approximating @xmath93 , we find that the 2-loop integrand is to be multiplied by the factor @xmath94 \\big\\}\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can now give analytical limits for this factor in two cases . if the magnetic mass dominates over the scale @xmath95 defined above , we have @xmath96 while in the opposite limit ( @xmath97 ) we recover eq . ( [ muequ0 ] ) . @xmath98 let us mention that if the additional gluon in fig . [ fig:3-loop - cuts ] is longitudinal a similar calculation as above goes through where @xmath22 is to be replaced by the debye mass of order @xmath15 , so that the factor @xmath99 is of order @xmath100 . the conclusion is therefore the following :    * if the magnetic mass @xmath22 is the relevant regulator , then the 3-loop diagram gives a  correction \" of order one to the prefactor of the 2-loop result , and this is likely to be the case for higher loop corrections also . in this regime , the photon production rate is sensitive to the magnetic mass , and one must resum an infinite series of diagrams . * if on the contrary , the scale @xmath101 dominates or if the regulator on the gluon propagator is the debye mass , then the 3-loop diagrams lead to a negligeable correction to the 2-loop result , and it is expected that this hierarchy will be valid between 4-loop and 3-loop , ... @xcite . it remains now to make a bit more explicit the comparison between @xmath101 and @xmath22 . for that purpose , let us recall that the expression of @xmath102 can be taken from the 2-loop calculation@xcite : @xmath103\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath104 is the angle between @xmath78 and @xmath105 , and where has been extended here to hold for hard slightly virtual photons @xcite . ] @xmath106 due to the extremely singular nature of the integral over @xmath104 @xcite , the order of magnitude of @xmath107 is @xmath108 . taking into account the fact that @xmath109 and @xmath110 , we divide the @xmath111 plane in two regions where respectively @xmath22 or @xmath101 dominates ( see fig .  [ fig : q - plane ] ) .    in region i , _ i.e. _ roughly the region of small virtuality , the magnetic mass is the most important regulator and , as seen above , the 3-loop contribution is as large as the 2-loop contribution : the production mechanism becomes non - perturbative and resummations should be considered . increasing the virtuality @xmath14 of the photon increases @xmath107 ( see eq . ( [ eq : meff ] ) ) which eventually becomes the dominant cut - off and one enters region ii where the infrared sensitivity of 3-loop ( and higher loop diagrams ) becomes subdominant .    in region ii - b , the production mechanism receives a contribution from large gluon momentum and the approximations done in the previous calculations may become incorrect . however , it was found by an explicit calculation @xcite that the expressions valid in region ii - a could be safely extrapolated to the case of soft virtual photon at rest ( @xmath112 ) in region ii - b . however , there is the possibility that 3-loop diagrams give important contributions in region iii due to hard gluon exchanges , but this is a different story .", "in this paper , we have considered higher order corrections to photon production by a quark - gluon plasma , with emphasis on the infrared singularities due to ultra - soft transverse gluons . when one sums over all the possible cuts through a given abelian topology , there are cancellations that prevent the quark propagators from becoming infinite , making the higher - loop corrections infrared finite . the generalization of this result to non - abelian topologies is not straightforward . indeed , the above argument is flawed already at the stage of counting the number of gluon propagators . loosely speaking , because of the 3- and 4-gluon couplings , the number of gluons can be larger than the number of independent momenta . the loop counting for qcd gives for the number of gluon integrations @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are respectively the number of 3- and 4-gluon vertices . as a consequence , unlike in the abelian topologies for which @xmath30 , the gluon propagators play an active role in the kln compensations ( if any ) , and much more elaborate arguments are required . as a side note , it is also impossible to apply in the thermal case the heuristic power counting argument of poggio and quinn @xcite , since some gluons have an infrared count of @xmath116 ( instead of @xmath117 at @xmath1 ) because of the bose - einstein statistical weight . we have also considered the possible competition of this mechanism of regularization with a hypothetical magnetic mass of order @xmath2 . the result is that there exists a region in the @xmath111 plane ( roughly speaking , for photons of small invariant mass ) where the magnetic mass is the dominant regulator , and where the higher - loop corrections are as large as the two - loop result , and should be resummed . further extensions of this work include the treatment of non - abelian topologies , the study of resummations in the region where the magnetic mass dominates , the extension of the 2-loop calculation for hard massive photons , and also the study of how the finite lifetime of quarks in a plasma affects the collinear singularities found at 2-loop .", "we thank r.d . pisarski , f. guerin and e. braaten for useful discussions and comments . f.g . was supported by doe under grant de - ac02 - 98ch10886 . 10 , university of cape town preprint uct - tp-91/1987 , nov 1987 ; z. phys . * c * * 42 * , 133 ( 1989 ) . r. baier , b. pire , d. schiff , phys . rev . * d * * 38 * , 2819 ( 1988 ) . t. altherr , p. aurenche , t. becherrawy , nucl . phys . * b * * 315 * , 436 ( 1989 ) . t. altherr , t. becherrawy , nucl . * b * * 330 * , 174 ( 1990 ) . t. grandou , m. le bellac , j.l . meunier , z. phys . * c * * 43 * , 575 ( 1989 ) . t. grandou , m. le bellac , d. poizat , phys . lett . * b * * 249 * , 478 ( 1990 ) ; nucl . phys . * b * * 358 * , 408 ( 1991 ) . m. le bellac , p. reynaud , nucl . phys . * b * * 380 * , 423 ( 1992 ) . a. niegawa , phys . * 71 * , 3055 ( 1993 ) . a. niegawa , mod . * a * * 10 * , 379 ( 1995 ) .        , * b * * 337 * , 569 ( 1990 ) . e. braaten , r.d . pisarski , nucl . phys . * b * * 339 * , 310 ( 1990 ) . j. frenkel , j.c . taylor , nucl . phys . * b * * 334 * , 199 ( 1990 ) . e. braaten , r.d . pisarski , phys . rev . * d * * 45 * , 1827 ( 1992 ) . j. frenkel , j.c . taylor , nucl . phys . * b * * 374 * , 156 ( 1992 ) ."], "summary": "we study the infrared singularities associated to ultra - soft transverse gluons in the calculation of photon production by a quark - gluon plasma . despite the fact that the kln theorem works in this context and provides cancellations of infrared singularities , it does not prevent the production rate of low invariant mass dileptons to be sensitive to the magnetic mass of gluons and therefore the rate to be non perturbative .    1 .   laboratoire de physique thorique lapth , + umr 5108 du cnrs , associe  luniversit de savoie , + bp110 , f-74941 , annecy le vieux cedex , france 2 .   brookhaven national laboratory , + physics department , nuclear theory , + upton , ny-11973 , usa    lapth756/99 , bnl - nt99/5", "ranking": [3, 0, 2, 1, 4]}

infrared emission @xmath52 arcmin southeast of wd2 . this ridge is especially bright in the 4.5 micron band , which is dominated by the hydrogen recombination line br , indicating the presence of highly ionized gas ( c04 ) . the co emission shows signs of localized velocity perturbation coincident with this ridge , with the peak velocity offset to @xmath519 km s@xmath3 ( illustrated in figure [ fig1]b ) . this strongly suggests a physical association between the molecular gas and rcw 49 . in addition , the 16 km s@xmath3 cloud as a whole shows some sign of depleted emission towards wd2 itself , consistent with the presence of the evacuated region within 1 @xmath5 2 of the cluster . figure [ fig1]c shows the co distribution between 1 and 9 km s@xmath3 , corresponding to the @xmath54 km s@xmath3 cloud identified in d07 . emission at this velocity range is entirely absent within a radius of @xmath53 of wd2 . at larger distances from the cluster , molecular gas fans out to the north and south , showing an excellent large - scale correlation with extended shape of the ir nebula . we also note the close correspondence between the edge of the co emission and the curved rim of filamentary ir emission at around ( 284.22 , @xmath25 ) . figure [ fig1]d shows the co distribution between @xmath1 and 0 km s@xmath3 . this emission contains components with peak velocities between @xmath16 and 0 km s@xmath3 . the brightest clump in this velocity range is centered on ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) @xmath5 ( 284.23 , @xmath26 ) , @xmath53 southwest of wd2 , at a peak velocity of @xmath27 km s@xmath3 , and is coincident with a region of ongoing massive star formation in the nebula ( w04 ) . to the northwest , co emission neatly skirts the edge of the evacuated region around the stellar cluster . emission in this velocity range is newly identified here as associated with rcw 49 and wd2 , however , it is not distinctly separated from the 4 km s@xmath3 cloud . we hereafter refer to all emission in the range @xmath1 to @xmath2 km s@xmath3 as the 0 km s@xmath3 cloud , based on the intensity - weighted mean velocity of the entire complex . the velocities of the associated components allow us to obtain kinematic distances . using the rotation curve of @xcite , we obtain of distances of 6.5 , 5.2 and 4.0 kpc , for velocities of 16 , 4 and @xmath27 km s@xmath3 respectively . the intensity - weighted mean velocity of all associated emission is 6 km s@xmath3 , which corresponds to a distance of 5.4 kpc . in light of the large velocity spread and associated uncertainty , we adopt a conservative distance estimate of @xmath28 kpc . in the interests of consistency this value is used for all emission components throughout this paper . the mass of the associated molecular gas is estimated from @xmath13co(@xmath11 ) data from the nanten galactic plane survey @xcite . although the resolution is lower that the present dataset ( @xmath54 ) , the relevant components are readily identified . we adopt a conversion factor ( x factor ) of @xmath29 @xmath30 k km s@xmath3 . this results in molecular hydrogen masses , @xmath31 , of @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the 16 and 0 km s@xmath3 clouds , where the uncertainties propagate through from the distance estimate . the higher resolution co ( @xmath0 ) data were also used to derive a virial mass for the 16 km s@xmath3 cloud ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , which was found to be almost identical to the luminosity - based value . we did not attempt to derive virial masses for the 0 km s@xmath3 cloud , since its velocity distribution is complex and apparently un - relaxed . d07 argues that the 16 km s@xmath3 cloud lies behind rcw 49 and the 4 km s@xmath3 component in front , based on an analysis of hi absorption spectra seen against the bright continuum background . we concur with his reasoning and note that the absorption spectrum also shows an additional peak at around @xmath5 - 4 km s@xmath3 , corresponding to the brightest concentration of gas in our most blue - shifted velocity range , placing it too in front of the nebula ( see figure 2 of d07 and related discussion ) . this result is confirmed on inspection of optical data from the eso digitized sky survey . good agreement is seen between optical obscuration and the 0 km s@xmath3 cloud , whereas the 16 km s@xmath3 cloud shows no obvious correlation with dark features .", "in the above we have demonstrated the association of wd2/rcw 49 with a significant mass of molecular gas spanning almost 30 km s@xmath3 , consisting of a foreground component at @xmath50 km s@xmath3 and a background component at @xmath516 km s@xmath3 . this velocity dispersion is an order of magnitude too large for the clouds to be gravitationally bound . yet their physical association with rcw 49 implies that their spatial separation must be no more than @xmath540 pc ( the linear dimension of the nebula at 5.4 kpc ) . an obvious interpretation is that the molecular gas is expanding away from the central cluster , presumably driven by the energy output of the massive stars within it . this is favored by d07 , and is consistent with the placement of the various velocity components along the line of sight . however , while it is true that the molecular gas towards the ir nebula does show some signs of localized perturbation due to the cluster s influence , we are cautious about interpreting the global gas configuration according to this scenario .    figure [ fig2 ] shows a co(@xmath0 ) velocity - latitude diagram . the 16 and 0 km s@xmath3 clouds are well separated in @xmath20-@xmath34 space . gas located directly in the line of sight of the ir nebula shows a velocity signature that is consistent with expansion around the central cluster . this is especially true of the 0 km s@xmath3 cloud , which shows the fastest approaching material located in the direction of the bright central regions , surrounded by gas with less extreme line - of - sight velocities . the top of the 16 km s@xmath3 cloud also shows evidence for interaction , localized to the immediate vicinity of the bright ir ridge , and far less pronounced . however , the majority of the cloud remains at a constant velocity of 16 km s@xmath3 , and extends as far as 12 ( @xmath520 pc ) outside the outer boundary of rcw 49 ; presumably well outside the range of influence of the cluster . it is therefore difficult to explain the entire 16 km s@xmath3 cloud as a velocity - perturbed clump of the extended 11 km s@xmath3 gmc , as originally suggested by d07 . furthermore , we may show that any scenario that attempts to explain the entire cloud velocity spread by cluster - driven expansion alone is energetically problematic . considering the line - of - sight velocity difference of the 0 and 16 km s@xmath3 clouds relative to a systemic velocity of 6 km s@xmath3 , and using the cloud masses estimated above , we obtain an estimated k.e . of @xmath51.2 @xmath35 erg . significantly changing the underlying assumptions in this simplistic calculation ( e.g. varying the systemic velocity , limiting the included mass to gas within the boundary of rcw 49 , considering a 3d expansion velocity based on the measured @xmath36 extremes , etc . ) does not greatly affect this value , which remains @xmath510@xmath37 erg . the @xmath38 dependence of k.e . combined with the large velocity spread of the associated material ensures this . the total mechanical luminosity available from stellar winds in wd2 is estimated by @xcite as @xmath39 erg . ( the authors note that no supernova should yet have occurred in the cluster s lifetime ) . the required kinetic energy is therefore at least several % of the total available energy from the cluster . although in ideal adiabatic wind bubbles 20% of the wind luminosity is transferred to the expanding neutral shell @xcite , more realistic numerical models suggest that no more than a few % of the initial wind energy ends up as neutral gas ke @xcite . in addition , the small solid angle ( @xmath40 ) subtended by the clouds reduces the energy available to them . we therefore conclude that while it is not impossible that stellar wind - driven expansion is responsible for the entire velocity separation of the molecular clouds , the energy requirements are uncomfortably tight . the implication is that a certain proportion of the cloud velocities are systemic : i.e. unrelated to the dynamical interaction of the complex with wd2 and rcw 49 . we of course only have information on a single velocity component , and the fact that the 0 and 16 km s@xmath3 clouds are receding from each other along the line of sight does not necessarily imply that they were once spatially coincident . nevertheless , rather than postulating a non - interactive close approach between the two clouds , we may consider whether direct interaction between them might have played a role in the formation of a cluster as rich as wd2 . collisions between molecular clouds can lead to gravitational instability in the dense , shocked gas , resulting in triggered star formation ( see * ? ? ? * and reference within ) . such collisions between molecular clouds are presumably rare . very roughly , the average time between collisions is @xmath5@xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the cloud number density , @xmath43 is the cross sectional area and @xmath34 is the cloud - cloud r.m.s . velocity dispersion . assuming that the milky way contains @xmath54000 giant molecular clouds with @xmath44 pc@xmath45 , @xmath46 km s@xmath3 , distributed in a 100 parsec - thick ring between @xmath47 kpc , this value is @xmath56 @xmath48 10@xmath49 yr . however , this interval will be considerably smaller in the spiral arms where the cloud density is higher , and non - random motions may increase the cloud collision rate . for a relative velocity of @xmath510 km s@xmath3 the time taken to cover a distance of 40 pc ( the assumed separation of the clouds ) is @xmath54 myr , which is highly consistent with the estimated age of wd2 of 2 - 3 myr . we therefore conclude that triggered formation of the wd2 cluster via cloud - cloud collision is a viable - and intriguing - scenario . we also note that the star formation efficiency , defined as the ratio of the cluster mass to the molecular mass of the 16 and 0 km s@xmath3 clouds , is @xmath55% , which is consistent with typical galactic values . we finally return briefly to the question of whether wd2/rcw 49 and the molecular clouds presented here may also be associated with the larger 11 km s@xmath3 gmc , as suggested by d07 . the gmc extends almost a degree to the east and west of wd2/rcw 49 , and with the exception of a small sub - component at ( 284.42 , @xmath50 ) , does not fall directly along the line of sight of the nebula . as described above , the 16 , and 0 km s@xmath3 clouds of this study are not well explained as clumps accelerated from an original systemic velocity of @xmath511 km s@xmath3 . the required energy input is uncomfortably large , and the large offset between much of the 16 km s@xmath3 cloud and rcw 49 argues against acceleration of the entire cloud by the cluster . the new identification of associated gas with negative velocities also drags the intensity weighted mean velocity from 11 km s@xmath3 to 6 km s@xmath3 . finally we also note that the mass of the directly associated components seems to be sufficient to form such a rich cluster , even without invoking the larger reservoir of gas contained in the 11 km s@xmath3 gmc . nevertheless , we do not completely rule out a loose association with the molecular clouds presented here . we also note that the revised distance estimate of 5.4@xmath51 kpc presented in this study is consistent with d07 s value of 6.0 kpc . finally , we note that presence of the tev gamma ray source hess j1023 - 575 suggests that the present clouds are good candidates for gamma ray production via interaction with cosmic ray protons , and deserve further detailed scrutiny .", "1 .   we have identified molecular gas associated with wd2 and rcw 49 based on strong correlations between co(@xmath0 ) emission and mid - infrared data from the _ spitzer space telescope _ glimpse survey . the molecular gas spans an unusually wide velocity range of @xmath530 km s@xmath3 , with two distinct complexes with mean velocities of 16 and 0 km s@xmath3 . the intensity weighted mean velocity of the entire mass of associated gas is @xmath56 km s@xmath3 , and this is used to obtain a new kinematic distance estimate to the cluster and hii region , of 5.4@xmath51 kpc . this value is unavoidably crude due to the large velocity dispersion of the system . the total molecular hydrogen mass of the associated gas is estimated as @xmath52 . 3 .   the molecular gas velocity structure shows evidence for expansion around wd2 and the central parts of rcw 49 . however , consideration of the energetics , and also the extent of the 16 km s@xmath3 cloud well outside of the region of influence of rcw 49 , argues against the observed velocity dispersion arising entirely as a result of this interaction . we suggest that a collision between the two molecular clouds may have triggered the formation of wd2 @xmath54 myr ago . the clouds presented in this study are viable as a target for tev gamma ray production via interaction with cosmic ray protons . we are grateful to tom dame for his feedback and comments , which have led to a significant improvement of this manuscript . nanten2 is an international collaboration between 10 universities , nagoya , osaka prefecture , cologne , bonn , seoul national , chile , new south wales , macquarie , sydney and zurich . this work is financially supported in part by a grant -

inclusive processes , gpds can in principle provide essential information for determining the missing component to the nucleon longitudinal spin sum rule , which is identified with orbital angular momentum . a complete description of nucleon structure requires , however , also the transversity ( chiral odd / quark helicity - flip ) gpds , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 @xcite . just as in the case of the forward transversity structure function , @xmath7 , the transversity gpds are expected to be more elusive quantities , not easily determined experimentally . it was nevertheless suggested in ref.@xcite that deeply virtual exclusive neutral pion electroproduction can provide a direct channel to measure chiral - odd gpds so long as the helicity flip ( @xmath8 ) contribution to the quark - pion vertex is dominant . this idea was borne amidst contrast , based on the objection that the @xmath9 coupling should be subleading compared to the leading twist , chiral - even ( @xmath10 ) contribution . it was subsequently , very recently , endorsed by qcd practitioners @xcite . furthermore , experimental data from jefferson lab hall b @xcite are now being interpreted in terms of chiral - odd gpds . what caused this change and made the transversity - based interpretation be accepted ?    within a qcd framework at leading order the scattering amplitude factors into a nucleon - parton correlator described by gpds , and a hard scattering part which includes the pion distribution amplitude ( da ) . keeping to a leading order description , the cross sections four - momentum squared dependences are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , for the longitudinal and transverse virtual photon polarizations , respectively . it is therefore expected that in the deep inelastic region @xmath13 will be dominant . experimental data from both jefferson lab @xcite and hera @xcite on meson electroproduction show exceedingly larger than expected transverse components of the cross section . clearly , an explanation lies beyond the reach of the leading order collinear factorization that was first put forth , and more interesting dynamics might be involved . in ref.@xcite it was noted that sufficiently large transverse cross sections can be produced in @xmath0 electroproduction provided the chiral odd coupling is adopted . since all available data are in the few gev kinematical region it should not be surprising to find such higher twist terms to be present . what makes it more difficult to accept is that the longitudinal components of the cross section should simultaneously be suppressed . also , given the trend of the hera data , why is this canonical higher twist effect seemingly not disappearing at even larger @xmath1 values ? in order to answer this question , in this paper we carefully address , one by one , the issues of the construction of helicity amplitudes and their connection with the cartesian basis ( section [ sec2 ] ) , the @xmath1-dependence ( section [ sec3 ] ) , the role of @xmath14-channel spin , parity , charge conjugation and their connection to the gpds crossing symmetry properties ( section [ sec4 ] ) , finally giving our conclusions in section [ sec5 ] .    . notice that differently from refs . @xcite , we adopt the symmetric scheme of kinematics where @xmath15 ( see ref.@xcite for a review ) . right : hard scattering contribution to the dvmp process , where @xmath16 is the outgoing meson distribution amplitude . , title=\"fig : \" ] . notice that differently from refs . @xcite , we adopt the symmetric scheme of kinematics where @xmath15 ( see ref.@xcite for a review ) . right : hard scattering contribution to the dvmp process , where @xmath16 is the outgoing meson distribution amplitude . , title=\"fig : \" ]", "the amplitude for deeply virtual meson production ( dvmp ) off a proton target is written in a qcd factorized picture , using the helicity formalism , as the following convolution over the quark momentum components @xcite , @xmath17 where the variables @xmath18 are @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ; the particles momenta and helicities , along with the hard scattering amplitude , @xmath22 , and the quark -

quarks , @xmath162 from this expression one defines @xmath163 where @xmath164 is identified with the flavor non singlet , valence quarks distributions , and @xmath165 with the flavor singlet , sea quarks distributions . similarly , @xmath166 the c - parity odd values that connect with @xmath167 are in @xmath168 and @xmath169 . in the former , contributions begin with @xmath154 . this is the lowest of the non - singlet , chiral even @xmath14-channel contributions to the @xmath94 production . now @xmath170 contributes significantly to the longitudinal asymmetry in the nucleon pdfs . for the process here , however , the @xmath171 will suppress the non - singlet contribution for small @xmath50 and @xmath172 . the considerably smaller value of the longitudinal cross section for @xmath94 corroborates this conclusion . the @xmath173 is known to receive a large contribution from the @xmath174 pole , although that pole does not enter the neutral @xmath174 production . after the pion pole is removed the values of @xmath173 are expected to be much smaller . these observations suggest the importance of the chiral odd contributions . we continue with the same logic for the chiral odd decompositions in table  [ ttgpd ] . the two sequences of @xmath175 and @xmath176 contribute equally to the chiral odd gpds and couple to the @xmath94 production . these sequences correspond to the @xmath177 ( vector ) and @xmath178 ( axial - vector ) mesons with even @xmath117 excitations . the decomposition into the @xmath14-channel of the matrix elements of the non - local quark correlators into the two distinct series of local operators lead us to distinguish two different dependences on @xmath1 of the @xmath0 coupling , @xmath179 ( @xmath177 series , lower left in table [ ttgpd ] , and @xmath180 ( @xmath178 series , lower right in table [ ttgpd ] ) as discussed in section [ sec3 ] .", "exclusive pseudo -

matter interaction is resonant , in which case however absorption typically plays a detrimental role . a great deal of attention has thus been devoted to a variety of schemes based on the regime of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite in which this counterbalance can be overcome . in a typical eit configuration , a strong control field , coupling two unpopulated levels of a @xmath0 system , creates a transparency window for a weak probe beam . this basic scheme was extended by including additional atomic levels coupled by laser or microwave fields in the double-@xmath0 @xcite , tripod @xcite , @xmath1 @xcite or inverted-@xmath2 @xcite configurations , just to name a few . under eit - like conditions the weak interaction between two photons ( or weak classical pulses ) may become largely enhanced . in particular , very large cross nonlinear effects have been predicted leading to new types of polarization phase gates in an optically dressed medium in the @xmath3 @xcite , tripod @xcite or inverted-@xmath2 @xcite configuration . relevant experimental work has very recently been reported in ref . @xcite . in these instances , a significant change of the phase of one of the propagating pulses is achieved due to the cross - kerr effect induced by the other pulse . analogous effects have recently been studied , both theoretically and experimentally , for an inverted-@xmath2 system @xcite , as well as for a four - level @xmath1-type @xcite and five - level system @xcite . important developments concern also the dynamic control of the process leading , e.g. , to light slowdown , storage and release @xcite . these results are expected to pave the way towards constructing all - optical logical devices . unlike most typical eit configurations employing a running wave coupling field , using a control standing wave coupling beam opens the possibility of creating an all - optically tunable bragg mirror . in such a novel kind of dynamically tunable metamaterial @xcite an incoming probe light encounters a spatially periodic optical structure and is subject to bragg scattering . for specific frequency ranges transmission and stop bands appear , the properties of which can be steered by a proper choice of the control field . the field - induced dispersion of the medium and the transmission and reflection spectra have been analyzed , e.g. , in refs . @xcite , including the case of a quasi - standing wave coupling field @xcite . it was also possible to stop and store a pulse inside the medium , and then retrieve it in the form of a stationary light pulse which could not leave the medium due to the standing wave character of the releasing control beam @xcite . it has also been shown that high nonlinearities can be achieved for stored light pulses @xcite . an all - optical dynamic cavity for the confinement of light pulses based on standing wave eit bragg mirrors has recently been proposed @xcite . very recently , we have pointed out that in the presence of a trigger beam in a tripod configuration , a probe partially reflected from the periodic structure induced by a strong standing wave eit coupling field undergoes large cross - kerr nonlinear phase shifts . such a novel configuration is specifically apt for developing a phase - tunable beam splitter in which both the amplitudes and the phases of the trasmitted and reflected beam can be controlled . we have given some illustrative results valid in a narrow range of frequencies owing to the restrictive assumption that the atomic population is symmetrically distributed between the two lower levels that are coupled with the upper level respectively by the probe and trigger pulses @xcite . here , we provide a comprehensive theoretical study of the problem , including a proper treatment of the population redistribution . the latter point turns out to be crucial to extend the range of possible probe detunings and , thus , optimize the control possibilities . our approach combines analytical methodologies used to describe propagation effects in both nonlinear and spatially periodic media , and allow us to numerically examine the phase shifts of the reflected and transmitted probe field induced by the trigger s presence over a wide range of probe detunings as well as their dependence on various parameters characterizing both the atomic medium and the three laser fields . our results indicate that the tripod standing wave eit configuration makes control over the cross - kerr effect more versatile than for a running wave eit configuration @xcite in which no reflected beam appears . the paper is organized as follows . in section ii , we present the basic theoretical approach to calculate the cross - kerr effect in a medium additionally dressed by a quasi - standing wave eit coupling field , based on expanding the medium susceptibility into a power series with respect to the probe and trigger fields and into a fourier series appropriate to the spatial periodicity imposed by the coupling field . in appendix a we derive in detail the formulae for the susceptibility s expansion coefficients , while in appendix b we present the way to evaluate the population redistribution . in section iii , we present and discuss the numerical results for the trigger induced nonlinear phase shifts of the reflected and transmited probe fields as functions of the probe detuning for various combinations of control field intensities , relaxation rates and sample length . finally , we draw our conclusions .", "we consider a tripod system driven by a strong control field ( @xmath4 ) coupling the ground level @xmath5 and the upper level @xmath6 , and by two weaker laser fields called probe ( @xmath7 ) and trigger ( @xmath8 ) , coupling @xmath6 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , as shown in fig . we express the fields through their complex amplitudes @xmath11 slowly varying in time : @xmath12 each of the couplings is detuned by @xmath13 , @xmath14 . here @xmath15 stands for the energy of the state @xmath16 and @xmath17 denotes the frequency of the @xmath16-th field . all the fields propagate along the @xmath18 axis . in general the control wave is allowed to have two counter - propagating components of arbitrary ratio . in the case of a running control wave , the component antiparallel to the incoming probe and trigger fields is zero . in the case of a perfect standing wave , both components are equal . thus , the control field provides a spatial lattice of period @xmath19 , @xmath20 being the field s wave number . in the configuration proposed below @xmath20 may be slightly different from the probe and trigger fields wave vectors @xmath21 , but that can be corrected by tilting both components of the control field by an angle @xmath22 with respect to the @xmath18-axis so that @xmath23 @xcite . such a configuration can be realized in a cold gas of @xmath24rb atoms . the states @xmath9 and @xmath10 may correspond , e.g. , to zeeman sublevels @xmath25 , state @xmath5 to @xmath26 , and the upper state @xmath6 to the level @xmath27 . the scheme could be used as a polarization phase gate , as was first proposed in ref . each of the two pulses interacts with the medium when it has the proper circular polarization : right for the probe and left for the trigger . when both pulses are properly polarized the nonlinear interaction between them gives rise to a cross - phase modulation . the bloch equations for the atom + field system in the rotating wave approximation read : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the density matrix of the atoms in the schrdinger picture , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 . the rabi frequencies are defined by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the electric dipole moment matrix element . the simplified model of relaxations adopted in the above equations takes into account spontaneous emission from the upper state @xmath6 to a lower state @xmath40 , described by the relaxation rates @xmath41 and @xmath42 with @xmath43 , as well as deexcitation and decoherence between the lower levels @xmath44 , @xmath45 , due to atomic collisions . the relaxation rates for the coherences @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and those for the collision - induced population relaxations were taken equal for simplicity ( cf . @xcite ) . the propagation equation for the positive frequency part of the probe field , slowly varying in time , i.e. when @xmath48 , reads in the fourier picture , with the fourier frequency variable identified with the probe detuning @xmath49 \\epsilon_p(z,\\delta_1 ) = -\\frac{\\omega_1 ^ 2}{c^2}\\chi_p(z,\\delta_1 ) \\epsilon_p(z,\\delta_1 ) , \\label{tr}\\ ] ] with the medium susceptibility for the probe given by @xmath50 where @xmath1 is the number of atoms per unit volume . the time limit means that we need to find the steady state solutions to the bloch equations . the assumption that the probe and trigger are weak with respect to the control field @xmath51 allows us to expand the susceptibility into the taylor series : @xmath52 the explicit form of the taylor expansion coefficients can be found in appendix a. the term @xmath53 corresponds to the linear susceptibility , while the third - order terms @xmath54 and @xmath55 represent the self- and cross - kerr effect , respectively . the latter is of particular importance , as we are interested in the cross - phase modulation . we now write the control field as : @xmath56 where @xmath57 of constant values are its forward and backward propagating parts . as the field is periodic in space , so are the medium optical properties . therefore we expand the susceptibilities for both probe and trigger into the fourier series : @xmath58 e^{2ink_2z}. \\label{chip}\\ ] ] the pulses propagating in a periodic medium acquire their reflected components . in the two - mode approximation ( for details see @xcite ) we write : @xmath59 where @xmath60 are slowly varying in space . we now insert eqs . ( [ chip],[2 m ] ) into eq . ( [ tr ] ) and drop terms rapidly oscillating in space . to write the propagation equations in the final form we make use of the relation @xmath61 and set @xmath62 . for the probe we find : @xmath63 where @xmath64 with @xmath65 . the trigger equations are obtained by interchanging the indices @xmath66 . explicit formulae for the susceptibilities fourier components as well as their detailed deriviation can be found in appendix a.    as we will change the probe detuning @xmath67 in a wide range while keeping the trigger detuning @xmath68 constant , we introduce an asymmetry in the populations @xmath69 and @xmath70 even for @xmath71 . additionally , the symmetry may be spoiled by the fact that @xmath72 ( the energy of the state @xmath9 ) is slightly smaller than @xmath73 , and in a cold medium transitions from @xmath10 to @xmath9 are possible while those from @xmath9 to @xmath10 are not . in previous works ( see refs . @xcite ) the probe and trigger fields were only allowed detunings such that @xmath74 . in that case the stationary population distribution was assumed to be @xmath75 . such an approach is simple , but it is well justified only in the resonance region of frequencies . as we show in the section [ results ] , for a wider range of pulse detunings it is necessary to make a better estimation of the population distribution . in appendix b we present the way to evaluate the populations in the case of a quasi - standing coupling beam ( @xmath76 , as in ref.@xcite ) .", "in this section we present numerical results illustrating the cross - kerr effect in our system and its dependence on the system parameters . in particular , we discuss how the cross - phase modulation is affected by the population redistribution . we have solved the propagation equations ( [ epsplus],[epsminus ] ) with the boundary conditions corresponding to both probe and trigger originally propagating towards positive @xmath18 : @xmath77 where @xmath78 describes the amplitude of the incoming probe / trigger pulse and @xmath79 is the sample length . we have used the susceptibilities fourier components as presented in appendix a. the level populations have been evaluated as described in appendix b , using the initial amplitudes of the probe and trigger fields as input data . note that , strictly speaking , the populations in the standing wave case are also modulated in space . however , as discussed below , the latter effect should not play a very important role in the case of an quasi - standing wave . the equations are solved iteratively until self - consistency is achieved , alternately for the probe and trigger , with the susceptibilities calculated using the fields obtained in the preceding step . in the first iteration for the probe the initial constant value of the trigger has been used . the numerical task in each step is thus solving a linear equation . we find two independent solutions with one - point boundary conditions and combine them to obtain the solution with the proper two - point boundary conditions given by eqs . ( [ bound ] ) . the transmission and reflection coefficients for the probe and trigger beams are defined by : @xmath80 while the phases of the transmitted and reflected fields are given by : @xmath81    unless otherwise specified , we use the following set of input data which are of order of those of typical atomic systems : @xmath82 mhz , @xmath83 mhz , @xmath84 mhz , @xmath85 mhz , @xmath86 mhz , @xmath87 mhz , @xmath88 mhz , @xmath89 mhz , @xmath90 mm , @xmath91 c@xmath92 m , @xmath93 @xmath94 . our choosing a quasi - standing wave is connected with the fact that for a perfect one the steady state population in the node regions is trapped in the state @xmath5 due to relaxation effects and the medium becomes transparent to both probe and trigger . therefore , it is reasonable to only consider the cases in which the control field at the quasinodes is still strong enough to pump the population from the level @xmath5 . we first calculate the corrected values of the populations which are shown in fig . [ 2 ] in a narrow ( plot ( a ) ) and wide ( plot ( b ) ) ranges of the probe detunings . note that the populations @xmath69 and @xmath70 may significantly differ from @xmath95 . they may vary rapidly within the transparency window and the maximum value of @xmath70 may be close to unity which apparently occurs when the frequency of the probe suits the energy interval between @xmath96 and the energy of one of the lower states dressed by @xmath97 and @xmath98 . between the maxima there is a deep minimum of @xmath70 due to the population trapping in the state @xmath9 . the populations of @xmath99 and @xmath100 are negligible , which is consistent with our assumption .    if there are no relaxations in the system , then the steady state solution for the no - trigger case is trivial : @xmath101 , @xmath102 due to spontaneous emission from the upper level to all the lower levels . there is no mechanism yet pumping the population out from @xmath10 . the nonnegligible relaxations provide such a mechanism and the plot illustrating the @xmath70 dependence on the probe detuning is of a similar shape as in the trigger - present case ( not shown ) . the phase shifts for a running control field ( @xmath103 mhz , @xmath104 , the other parameters unchanged ) are shown in fig . we compare the results for the transmitted probe beam in the cases of equal or corrected values of the populations @xmath69 and @xmath70 and for the trigger pulse present or absent . the values of the obtained phase shifts @xmath105 differ significantly for the two approximations concerning the populations , except for three points : when the calculated population distribution is almost exact : @xmath106 and within the resonance region @xmath107 . the trigger - induced ( kerr ) phase shifts ( the differences between the values given by pairs of curves ) in the two cases are also different and there are frequency intervals in which the kerr shifts are significantly larger in the case in which the populations have been calculated according to eqs . ( [ diag1 ] ) . in this way the results of ref . @xcite can be generalized for a wider range of the probe detunings .    in fig . [ 3]b we make a similar comparison for a reflected beam in the case of a quasi - standing control field ( @xmath108 mhz , @xmath83 mhz , the other parameters unchanged ) . again taking into account the population redistribution ( lower plot ) caused a qualitative change of the behaviour of the phase shifts as well as of their differences ( the kerr shifts ) compared with the case of equal populations . the results are in agreement at the same three points as before . however , at @xmath109 , due to a numerical instability in the algorithm used to find the solutions of eq . ( [ diag1 ] ) , the calculated density matrix is no longer positive definite and our results in this very narrow spectral region are unphysical ( see the sharp spikes appearing in fig . [ 2 ] ) .    in fig . [ 4 ] we show the cross - kerr phase shifts @xmath110 due to the trigger s presence for both the transmitted and reflected probe beams defined as @xmath111(trigger on)@xmath112(trigger off ) . one can see that the shifts may be of order of one radian and there is a frequency range in which they do not change rapidly . the narrow minima or maxima in fig . [ 4 ] correspond to the situation in which the phases @xmath113 vary rapidly . the present results show how our system behaves as an all - optically controlled kerr medium . in particular , it may serve as a tunable beam splitter for the probe beam in which the phases of the reflected and/or trasmitted beam are significantly affected by the trigger beam . for example , for detunings of @xmath114 mhz or of @xmath115 mhz at which both the transmission and reflection coefficients are large ( see fig . [ 6 ] ) , the trigger induced phase shift of the trasmitted and reflected probe beams are both appreciable . on the contrary , for a detuning of @xmath116 mhz at which both the transmission and reflection coefficients are considerable ( see fig . [ 6 ] ) , while the trigger induced phase shift for the transmitted probe beam is significant , that of the reflected beam is negligible . this beam splitting action accompanied by a trigger induced phase shift of the reflected and/or transmitted probe components is a unique feature of the tripod standing wave eit configuration with respect to others previously considered . taking into account the redistribution of the population among the atomic levels is however crucial . if the redistribution were ignored the phase shifts could only be estimated within rather limited ranges of frequencies . in particular , while for @xmath114 mhz the approximation @xmath117 is still reasonable as shown in fig . [ 2 ] , for @xmath115 mhz or @xmath118 mhz it fails . in the following , in order to illustrate the dependence of the kerr effect on various parameters , we discuss several numerical results obtained over a large detuning range using the method here developed to calculate the population redistribution . we now check how the phase shifts of both the transmitted field and reflected one depend on how much standing the control field is . we change the right - propagating part of the control field @xmath119 while keeping the left - moving part constant : @xmath83 mhz . all the other parameters remain unchanged . the results are shown in fig . [ 5]a for the transmitted beam and fig . [ 5]b for the reflected one . all the plots cross in the resonance region where the phase shift is small . the phase shift @xmath120 reaches a maximal value for some @xmath67 which depends on @xmath119 . the more intense is the control field the flatter is the plot and the larger is the peak s shift towards higher frequencies , which provides a way of controlling the phases . we find the same effect of the peak moving to the right when decreasing the left - propagating part of the control field @xmath121 while keeping @xmath119 constant ( not shown ) . the more intense is the control field the smaller is the trigger - induced phase shift . around the resonance the reflected phase shift @xmath122 shows an oscillatory dependence on the probe detuning . the width of the frequency range where the oscillations are present grows with @xmath119 but the number of peaks remains constant - again the phase shift s plot becomes flatter when the control field is increased . the curves are complicated now but roughly we can say that the trigger - induced phase shift decreases when the control field becomes stronger . the extrema of the kerr phase shifts @xmath123 in the intervals in which @xmath122 vary rapidly become less prominent and the distance between them increases for growing control fields . in general a too strong control field is not advantegous for generating considerable trigger - induced phase shifts . then the results gradually turn into those typical of the usual eit case .    as expected , the transmission coefficient ( see fig . [ 6]a ) grows with @xmath119 and so does the width of the transparency window . again the plots corresponding to the reflection are more complex , as shown in fig . in general the reflection coefficient decreases when @xmath119 is increased , but there are some frequency ranges where the dependence is more complicated . yet if both parts of the control field are increased simultaneously , so that @xmath124 is constant , then not only the transmission but also the reflection coefficient increases for most of the probe frequencies . this is due to the absorption cancellation by a strong control field . we have also checked how our results depend on the relaxation rates @xmath125 , @xmath126 , due to interatomic collisions . the main observation is that the trigger - induced phase shift decreases for growing @xmath125 . on the other hand , as the relaxation rates grow , the frequency range where the reflected field s phase dependence is oscillatory becomes wider and the number of oscillations increases . as expected , the transmission and reflection coefficients decrease in general when the relaxation rates grow , but there are some frequency ranges where the reflection coefficient is a nonmonotonic function of @xmath125 . populations @xmath99 and @xmath100 are negligible except for very large values of the relaxations ( @xmath127 mhz ) when they are of the order of a few percent . for increasing @xmath125 the phase shifts become less steep and an approximation consisting in adopting constant values of the populations @xmath69 and @xmath70 may be better justified . increasing the length of the sample leads to increasing the trigger - induced phase shift of the transmitted field . for the considered lengths of the sample the nonlinear phase shift increases for growing @xmath79 . however , for an extended sample both pulses become partially absorbed and their mutual impact is smaller . elongating the sample leads to no significant change in the amplitude of oscillations in the reflected field s phase but it does influence the reflection coefficient in a nonmonotonic way , which provides another way of controlling the cross - kerr effect . thus , in order to have a considerable phase shift the coupling field can not be too strong and the relaxation rates between the lower tripod states should not be too large ; also the length of the sample should be appropriately optimized .", "we have presented a comprehensive study of the cross kerr effect in the propagation of two weak laser fields , a trigger and a probe , in a medium of four - level atoms in the tripod configuration , dressed by a third strong coupling field in the quasi - standing wave configuration . this has been done by taking into the proper account the population redistribution . using the relevant terms of the fourier expansion of the linear and nonlinear susceptibilities , we have numerically solved the propagation equations for the right- ( incoming ) and left- ( reflected ) running components of the two weak fields . in particular , the phase shifts of the transmitted and reflected probe induced by the trigger turn out to be as large as one radian . we have further shown that the population redistribution significantly affects the phase shifts of the transmitted and reflected beams unless very specific values of probe detuning are used . over a wide range of probe detunings , on the contrary , we find that the trigger induced phase shifts for the reflected and transmitted probe can be flexibly and independently changed . we have finally characterized the kerr effect s dependence on the strength of the coupling field , the relaxation rates and the sample s length .    in summary , by using a quasi - standing wave configuration the amplitudes of the transmitted and reflected parts of the probe beam and their respective trigger - induced phase shifts can be controlled and optimized by acting on various parameters , and especially on the probe detuning . while previous work has shown the usefulness of the tripod configuration in a running wave eit regime to achieve a large cross - kerr effect on the transmitted probe beam , our results extend such findings to the standing wave eit regime in which both the reflected and transmitted probe beams can be separately controlled . k. sowik is grateful to g. c. la rocca and scuola normale superiore in pisa for their kind hospitality . the work of k. sowik was sponsored by the scholarship for doctoral students zporr 2008/2009 of the marshal of the kuyavian - pomeranian voivodeship . financial support from grant azione integrata it09l244h5 of miur is also acknowledged . appendix a    the medium susceptibilities can be written as : @xmath128 and can be calculated with the use of the steady state solutions of the bloch equations .    from the last three of eqs .

[ fig : rms ] ; the rms noise at the center of each field is @xmath63jy per @xmath48  km  s@xmath4 channel . each spectrum was tested for gaussianity , via both the kolmogorov - smirnov rank-1 ( k - s ) and anderson - darling ( a - d ) tests ; 11 spectra found to have p - values @xmath64 in the a - d test were excluded from the stacking ( note that retaining these spectra does not significantly affect our results ) . the hi  21 cm  spectrum for each retained galaxy was next shifted to its rest frame and then interpolated onto a single velocity axis , before the spectra of each field were optimally co - added with weights determined from their rms noise values ( after the primary beam correction ; see fig .  [ fig : rms ] ) to produce the final stacked spectrum for each field . these four spectra were then co - added , again with appropriate weights based on their rms noise values , and a second - order baseline subtracted out from the result , to produce the final stacked hi  21 cm  spectrum . this is shown in fig .

[ fig : spc][b ] shows the spectrum smoothed to , and resampled at , a resolution of @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 ; this has an rms noise of @xmath67jy and shows no evidence for hi  21 cm  emission . the @xmath1 upper limit on the strength of hi  21 cm  emission in the final spectrum at a resolution of @xmath3  km  s@xmath4  can be used to derive a limit on the average hi  mass of the 857 stacked galaxies . however , our estimate of the rms noise on this spectrum is based on only 10 points . we hence used a bootstrap approach to obtain a more reliable estimate of the rms noise on the stacked spectrum , by stacking the 857 spectra after randomizing the galaxy redshifts ; this was done for 100 independent realizations and yielded an average rms noise of @xmath68jy per @xmath3  km  s@xmath4  channel . this estimate of the rms noise will be used in the later analysis .", "plotted as a function of redshift . the filled triangles are from hi  21 cm  emission surveys @xcite , the open squares from hi  21 cm  emission stacking at low redshifts @xcite , and the filled circles from absorption - selected galaxies , mgii absorbers at @xmath69 @xcite and damped lyman-@xmath11 absorbers at @xmath12 @xcite . the open star shows our new gmrt result , for blue star - forming galaxies at @xmath70 ; it is clear that this is significantly lower than the @xmath10 estimates at both @xmath71 and @xmath12 [ see also @xcite ] .

[ naoeof ] . it is known that the nao is associated with anomalous weather patterns in the eastern us and northern europe including scandinavia @xcite . such dominant modes need not always have to be a teleconnection . for example , the pattern in fig [ ceof ] can be identified with the annual trade wind fluctuations in the equatorial pacific region ; obtained as a dominant eigenmode from the analysis of the pseudo wind stress vectors . in subsequent sections , we will perform statistical analysis on the spectra of atmospheric correlation matrices , whose dominant modes display correlation patterns discussed above . atmospheric correlations are interesting to study from a rmt perspective because they arise naturally from known physical interactions and offers instances to verify two ( orthogonal and unitary ) of the three gaussian ensembles of rmt . the empirical orthogonal function ( eof ) method , also called the principal component analysis , is a multivariate statistical technique widely used in the analysis of geophysical data @xcite . it is similar to the singular value decomposition employed in linear algebra and it provides information about the independent modes of variabilities exhibited by the system .    in general , any atmospheric parameter @xmath2 , ( like wind velocity , geopotential height , temperature etc . ) , varies with space@xmath3 and time@xmath4 and is assumed to follow an average trend on which the variations ( or anomalies , as referred to in atmospheric sciences ) are superimposed , _ i.e. _ , @xmath5 . the wind vectors can be represented as a complex number , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the wind speed and @xmath8 the direction . thus , in general , @xmath9 could be a complex number . the mathematical treatment of complex correlations and eofs is given in ref @xcite . in further analysis , the standardised anomaly @xmath10 will be used which will have zero mean ( @xmath11 ) and is rescaled such that its variance @xmath12 is unity . if the observations were taken @xmath13 times at each of the @xmath14 spatial locations and the corresponding anomalies @xmath15 assembled in the data matrix @xmath16 of order @xmath14 by @xmath13 , then the spatial correlation matrix of the anomalies is given by , @xmath17 note that the elements of the hermitian matrix @xmath18 , of order @xmath14 , are just the pearson correlation between various spatial points . the eigenfunctions of @xmath18 are called the empirical orthogonal functions since they form a complete set of orthogonal basis to represent the data matrix @xmath16 . in the geophysical setting , the eofs can be plotted as contour maps by associating each component with its corresponding spatial location as shown in fig [ naoeof ] . if the eigenvalue corresponding to the @xmath19th eigenmode is @xmath20 , then the percentage variance associated with the mode is given by , @xmath21 then , the dominant mode would correspond to the eof with the largest eigenvalue . in the last few decades , several variants of this basic eof technique have been used to suit varied requirements @xcite . we will show that the spectrum of @xmath18 displays random matrix type spectral statistics .", "computing reliable correlation matrices depend on the availability of sufficiently long time series of data . generally , the requirement is to have @xmath22 , as otherwise the computed covariances could be noisy and correlations could be regarded as random . reliable records of monthly averages for weather and climate parameters of interest exist for the last 50 years . in our study , we use both the daily as well as the monthly averaged data available from ncep reanalysis archives @xcite . further in this direction , we study three cases ; ( i ) monthly mean sea level pressure ( slp ) for the atlantic domain @xmath23 from 1948 to 1999 . ( ii ) monthly mean global sea surface temperatures ( sst ) @xcite and ( iii ) surface level pseudo wind - stress vectors in the equatorial pacific ocean @xmath24 . the first case identifies many northern hemisphere teleconnections and its climatic effects and eof aspects are documented @xcite . wind - stress is an important quantity in studies on coupled ocean - atmosphere models that simulate the air - sea interaction and the feedback mechanism . the pseudo wind - stress is defined as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the zonal and meridional wind components , and this leads to complex correlation matrix . its eofs exhibit signatures of the mean annual signal and elnino oscillations @xcite . note that the eigenmodes of complex correlation matrix are determined only up to a complex factor of unit modulus . this allows the freedom to choose a phase angle to rotate the eigenvectors . the atmospheric data is on an uniform spatial grid of @xmath28 along both the latitude and longitude . to ensure that @xmath29 , in the calculations with monthly mean data , the spatial resolution was reduced to @xmath30 thus , for the case(i ) of monthly mean slp correlations , p=434 and n=624 . in the case ( iii ) of monthly mean wind stress analysis over equatorial pacific ocean , the land points were removed from the calculations using land - sea mask and it results in p=494 and n=624 . since a longer time - series of monthly mean data was not available , another experiment was performed with daily averaged time - series from 1990 to 1999 with much improved ratio for @xmath31 in the range 2.5 - 3.5 . the required means and anomalies were computed from which matrices of orders ranging from 500 to 1200 is constructed and diagonalised using standard lapack routines @xcite .    3.0 in    first we look at the structure of eigenvalue density . the integrated level density @xmath32 , can be written as , @xmath33 , a sum of an average part and the fluctuating part . the eigenvalues @xmath34 are unfolded by fitting an empirical function to the average part of the integrated level density such that the unfolded eigenvalues @xmath35 have mean spacing unity @xcite . all the analysis reported further were performed on @xmath36 . [ dos ] shows , for empirical correlation matrices , the spectrum is dense at the lower end . this is typical of the spectrum of correlation matrices formed from the data matrix @xmath16 through eq ( [ cmat ] ) @xcite . in contrast to this , for a generic quantum system , the level density increases with energy and is dense at the higher end of the spectrum . one of the celebrated results of the random matrix theory is the nearest - neighbour eigenvalue spacing distribution ; _ i.e. _ the distribution of @xmath37 . it gives the probability for finding the neighbouring levels with a given spacing @xmath7 . in the context of this work , the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) is appropriate for the mean sea - level pressure correlations and gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) for pseudo wind - stress vectors . the spectra of these classes exhibit universal fluctuation properties and the spacing distributions are given by @xcite , @xmath38 the analytical forms above indicate level - repulsion , a tendency against clustering , as evident from low probability for small spacings . the level repulsion is linear for goe and quadratic for gue .    3.0 in    in fig . [ evalgoe ] , we show the spacing distribution for the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix of the monthly mean slp . the inset in this figure shows the cumulative spacing distribution for the spectra obtained from the analysis of monthly and daily averaged slp data . we observe a general agreement with the rmt predictions . in fig . [ evalgue ] , the spectra from the monthly mean wind - stress correlation data is shown . if the spacings , @xmath7 , were uncorrelated then we would expect a poisson distribution , @xmath39 @xcite . in all the cases we studied , the empirical histograms do not follow the poisson curves at all . as would be expected , a better agreement between the theoretical curves and the empirical distributions is observed in the analysis of daily averaged data , in both the cases of slp and pseudo wind - stress correlations , since they provide about 1000 eigenvalues for the statistics . for instance , a kolmogrov - smirnov test at 65% confidence level could not reject the hypothesis that goe is the correct distribution for the eigenvalues of monthly mean slp correlation matrix , whereas a similar test for the daily averaged slp data could not reject the hypothesis at 99% confidence level . the monthly mean sst correlation matrix analysis ( not shown here ) also supports rmt spacing distribution . the eigenvalue spacing distribution for the equatorial pacific pseudo wind - stress vector correlation matrix also indicates a good agreement with the gue prediction given by eq ( [ evs2 ] ) ( see fig [ evalgue ] ) .    3.0 in      beyond the nearest - neighbour spacing distribution , we study the long - range correlations . we compute the following spectral fluctuation measures @xcite which are based on the two - point correlation function . ( a ) the spectral rigidity , the so - called @xmath40 statistic , measures the least - square deviation of the spectral staircase function @xmath41 from the straight line of best fit for a finite interval @xmath42 of the spectrum , @xmath43 ^ 2 \\;\\ ; d\\epsilon\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are obtained from a least - squares fit . average over several choices of @xmath46 gives the spectral rigidity @xmath47 . ( b ) the number variance @xmath48 is also a function of two - point correlation function . let @xmath49 be the number of eigenvalues in the spectral interval @xmath42 . then , for a choice of @xmath46 , @xmath48 is given by , @xmath50 averaging @xmath51 over @xmath46 gives the number variance @xmath52 . the asymptotic results , for large @xmath42 , from random matrix considerations , is given by @xcite , @xmath53 where @xmath54 corresponds to goe and gue respectively ; @xmath55 and @xmath56 are also dependent on the ensemble . 3.0 in    fig [ del3 ] shows the @xmath47 statistic for the slp and wind - stress correlation matrix spectrum , computed using the method given by bohigas and giannoni @xcite . generally , a good agreement is observed with the rmt predictions . in all the cases , for small @xmath42 the agreement is good and small deviations begin to be seen for larger values indicating a possible breakdown of universality . in general , this should indicate system specific features that can not be modelled by assumptions based on randomness . once again , we notice that the correlation matrix spectra obtained from daily data show better agreement with rmt predictions , primarily due to larger orders of correlation matrix involved and hence more eigenvalues for the analysis . fig [ sig2 ] shows the number variance @xmath52 for all the cases . we observe a fairly good agreement with rmt predictions . the results for slp and sst correlations are in broad agreement with the similar analysis performed on the financial correlation matrices @xcite , both of which are modelled by the orthogonal ensemble of rmt . this , in itself , demonstrates the breadth of applications of rmt .    3.0 in", "with the eigenvalue statistics , it is not straightforward to obtain detailed system specific information , unless there are significant deviations from random matrix predictions . the distribution of eigenvector components , on the other hand , reveals fine - grained information , at the level of every eigenvector . in this section , we show that almost all the eofs follow the rmt distribution . however , a few eofs that have physical significance , like the ones shown in figs [ naoeof ] and [ ceof ] , deviate strongly from rmt . broadly , the variability captured by an eof is seen to be reflected in its deviation from rmt predictions . let @xmath57 be the @xmath58th component of the @xmath19th eigenvector . assuming that these components are gaussian random variables with the norm being their only characteristic , it can be shown that the distribution of @xmath59 , in the limit when the matrix dimension is large , is given by the special cases of the @xmath60 distribution @xcite , @xmath61 the case @xmath62 can be identified with goe and gives the well - known porter - thomas ( pt ) distribution . the distribution of complex eigenvectors correspond to gue class with @xmath63 . the general understanding is that if the eigenvectors are sufficiently irregular in some sense , then its components are @xmath60 distributed and deviations occur if they show some symptoms of regularity .    3.0 in    in further analysis , we will use the modulus square of the eof components , _ i.e. _ @xmath64 , normalised to unit mean . for the monthly mean slp correlation matrix , fig [ evecgoe ] shows the cumulative distribution of eof components . since eofs form an optimal basis to represent the data , most of the variability is carried by a small number of eofs ; in this case about 91% of the variability is captured by just 12 dominant eofs . the rest 9% is accounted for by the bulk of the rest 422 eofs . the central result of this section is that the bulk of these eofs , accounting for a small fraction of the variability , follow the cumulative porter - thomas ( pt ) distribution given by , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the standard error function . this strengthens the conclusion that the empirical correlation matrices can be modelled as a random matrix . as an example from a large number of such eofs , the distribution of 294th eof is shown ( denoted by dark circles ) in fig [ evecgoe ] , and it practically falls on the pt curve . we observed that the distribution of the all such eofs follow rmt and this is also confirmed by a kolmogrov - smirnov test .    3.0 in however , interesting cases arise from a small number of dominant eofs which deviate strongly from rmt predictions . the first two dominant eofs shown in fig [ evecgoe ] ( as dotted lines ) , representing about 30% and 22% of the entire variability , show significant deviations from cumulative pt curve . the spatial structure of both these eigenmodes , shown in fig [ naoeof ] , jointly capture the essence of north - atlantic pattern . this scenario , of most dominant of the eofs deviating from the pt distribution and lesser significant ones showing agreement with it , is repeated in the analysis of sst ( not shown here ) and daily averaged slp correlations as well . at this point , we stress that these deviations are exceptions that arise in about 1% of the eofs . fig [ evecgue ] shows the cumulative distribution for the eofs obtained from the analysis of the monthly mean wind - stress correlation . note that in this case , the appropriate prediction follows the unitary ensemble since the eof components are complex . the dominant 20 eofs explain nearly 90% of the variability in the wind stress data . the rest of the large number ( about 400 ) of eofs show good agreement with cumulative gue curve for eigenvector distribution given by @xmath67 . one such case , 370th eof , is shown in fig [ evecgue ] denoted by dark circles . in general , eofs show good agreement with rmt except for the few dominant eofs . the dominant eof , whose spatial pattern is shown in fig [ ceof ] , represents the mean annual pacific trade - wind fluctuations and explains 38% of the variability and shows pronounced deviation from the cumulative gue curve . next few dominant eofs also exhibit significant deviations . legler @xcite has performed eof analysis on the pacific ocean wind - stress vectors and attributed physical significance to the top three dominant eofs . thus , eofs that have physical significance , can not be modelled by rmt ensembles . an analogy with quantum eigenstates seems inevitable . studies on the distribution of the eigenfunctions of low - disorder tight - binding systems and chaotic quantum systems show that a small fraction of the eigenstates , which display quantum localisation , deviate from random matrix predictions @xcite , while most others show rmt - like behaviour . there are two interesting observations in this study . firstly , we notice that there are few eofs , occurring at irregular intervals , which do not carry much of a significance in terms of the variability but deviate strongly from rmt predictions . it is not immediately clear if they carry any significant information . secondly , a surprising observation is that the eofs , corresponding to first few eigenvalues at the lower end of the spectrum , most often regarded as least dominant and random , devoid of any system specific information , show marked deviations from rmt ( see also ref @xcite ) . one such example for each of goe and gue case is shown in figs [ evecgoe ] and [ evecgue ] .", "this work shows that the random matrix predictions are of considerable interest in the study of the correlation matrices that arise in atmospheric sciences . previous work on the correlations of stock market fluctuations has come to similar conclusion @xcite . this is despite the following basic difference ; rmt assumes that the quantum hamiltonian matrix is part of an ensemble of random matrices whose entries are independent random numbers drawn from a gaussian distribution . in the correlation matrix formalism , the elements of data matrix are independent gaussian distributed random numbers . then , the correlation matrix in eq . [ cmat ] follows wishart structure @xcite , a form of generalised @xmath60-distribution .    in the application of eofs in various disciplines an important question is the truncation of eofs while opting for a low - dimensional representation for a given data matrix . the earlier approaches to this problem were based on monte - carlo techniques or asymptotic theories @xcite . it would be interesting to evolve a truncation criteria , for using eofs as empirical basis , from random matrix techniques since the results here suggest that rmt could be potentially applied to separate the random modes from the physically significant modes of the correlation matrix . even as we have documented evidence for rmt like behaviour from the atmospheric correlation matrices , there is also a need to look at the limits of rmt description . for instance , a correlation matrix which shows perfect correlation will obviously not behave like rmt . can correlation matrix spectra display poisson spacing distribution ? such limits of rmt in the context of correlation matrix is yet to be explored .    in summary , we have analysed atmospheric correlation matrices from the perspective of random matrix theory . the central result of this work is that they can be modelled as random matrices chosen from an appropriate rmt ensemble . the eigenvalue statistics exhibits short and long - range rmt - type behaviour . most of the eigenmodes also follow the rmt type eigenvector distribution . few dominant eigenmodes that have physical significance deviate from rmt predictions . we have verified our conclusions with examples of correlation matrices that belong to goe and gue universality classes of random matrix theory . the atmospheric data used in this work is the ncep reanalysis data provided by noaa - cires climate diagnostics center , boulder , colorado , usa , from their web site at http://www.cdc.noaa.gov . ncep / noaa - cires is thankfully acknowledged for the same . we thank dr . abhinanda sarkar for clarifications on the nuances of statistics . @xmath68 msanthan@in.ibm.com + @xmath69 now at atmospheric composition research programme , frontier research system for global change , yokohama 236 - 0001 , japan . t. guhr , a. muller - groeling and h. a. weidenmuller , phys . rep . * 299 * 189 ( 1999 ) . t. zimmermann _ et . lett . * 61 * 3 ( 1988 ) ; a. kudrolli _ et . e * 49 * r11 ( 1994 ) o. bohigas , m. j. giannoni and c. schmidt , phys . * 52 * 1 ( 1984 ) . k. efetov , _ supersymmetry in disorder and chaos _ ( cambridge univ . press , 1997 ) . verbaarschot , nucl . b ( proc . suppl . ) * 53 * 88 ( 1997 ) . e. abdalla , lecture notes in physics * 20 * ( springer , berlin , 1994 ) . l. laloux _ et . lett . * 83 * 1467 ( 1999 ) ; v. plerou _ et . lett . * 83 * 1471 ( 1999 ) . r. n. hoffman and d. w. johnson , ieee trans . remote sensing * 32 * 25 ( 1994 ) and references therein . r. w. preisendorfer , ( _ ed . _ c. d. mobley ) _ principal component analysis in meteorology and oceanography _ , ( elsevier,1988 ) ; daniel s. wilks , _ statistical methods in atmospheric sciences _ ( academic press , london , 1995 ) . e. j. elton and m. j. gruber , _ modern portfolio theory and investment analysis _ ( john wiley , new york , 1995 ) ; h. markowitz , _ portfolio selection : efficient diversification of investments _ ( john wiley , new york , 1959 ) r. w. preisendorfer , f. w. zweirs and t. p. barnett , _ foundations of principal component selection rules _ , scripps inst . of oceanography , series 81 - 4 ( ntis pb83 - 146613 ) . j. m. wallace and gutzler , mon . wea . rev . * 109 * 784 ( 1981 ) . p. j. lamb and r. a. peppler , bull . * 1218 ( 1987 ) ; h. van loon and j. c. rogers , mon . wea . rev . * 106 * 296 ( 1978 ) ; j. c. rogers , mon . wea . rev . * 112 * 1999 ( 1984 ) . j. w. hurrell , science * 269 * 676 ( 1995 ) . d. m. hardy and j.j . walton , j. appl . met . * 17 * 1153 ( 1978 ) . the data is taken from the ncep 50-year reanalysis archives of noaa - cires at http://www.cdc.noaa.gov . the daily and monthly mean data and its derivatives are available from 1948 onwards . t. m. smith _ et . _ , j. clim . * 9 * 1403 ( 1996 ) . d. m. legler , bull . 64 * 234 ( 1983 ) . http://www.netlib.org/lapack o. bohigas and m .- j . giannoni in _ mathematical and computational methods in nuclear physics _ , vol 209 of _ lecture notes in physics _ , edited by j. s. dehesa , j. m. g. gomez and a. polls ( springer , 1984 ) . a. m. sengupta and p. p. mitra , phys . e * 60 * 3389 ( 1999 ) . m. l. mehta , _ random matrices _ academic press , ( 1991 ) . f. haake , _ quantum signatures of chaos _ ( springer - verlag , 1991 ) . k. muller _ et . . lett . * 78 * 215 ( 1997 ) . s. s. wilks , _ mathematical statistics _ ( john wiley , new york , 1962 ) ."], "summary": "for a large class of quantum systems the statistical properties of their spectrum show remarkable agreement with random matrix predictions . recent advances show that the scope of random matrix theory is much wider . in this work , we show that the random matrix approach can be beneficially applied to a completely different classical domain , namely , to the empirical correlation matrices obtained from the analysis of the basic atmospheric parameters that characterise the state of atmosphere . we show that the spectrum of atmospheric correlation matrices satisfy the random matrix prescription . in particular , the eigenmodes of the atmospheric empirical correlation matrices that have physical significance are marked by deviations from the eigenvector distribution .    2", "ranking": [4, 0, 3, 1, 2]}

puget et al . @xcite ) where the source detection has been based on the analysis of the detector signal as a function of time . our analysis is therefore independent of and complementary to previous results .", "the observations were performed with the isophot ( lemke at el . @xcite ) aboard iso ( kessler et al . the maps were made in the pht22 staring raster map mode ( see table  [ table : maps ] ) . the area covered is @xmath11.5 square degrees . the fields have low surface brightness and in some cases there is some redundancy i.e. the observed pixel rasters partly overlap each other . the data were processed with pia ( pht interactive analysis ) versions 7.1 and 7.2 . the flux density calibration was made using the fcs ( fine calibration source ) before and after each map . the accuracy of the absolute calibration is expected to be better than 30% ( klaas et al . @xcite ) . data reduction from the erd ( edited raw data ) to scp ( signal per chopper plateau ) was performed using the pairwise method ( stickel @xcite ) . instead of making linear fits to the ramps consisting of the detector read - outs one examines the distribution of the differences between consecutive read - outs . the mode of the distribution is estimated with myriad technique ( kalluri & arce @xcite ) and is used as the final signal for each sky position . the pairwise method is robust against glitches and the analysis was based on the data reduced with this method .", "the source detection was performed in two steps using data processed to the aap ( astrophysical applications data ) level with pia and the pairwise method . the data consists of surface brightness values with error estimates . flat fielding was performed with custom routines . each surface brightness value was compared with the mean of the region within a radius of @xmath1three times the size of the detector pixel . values more than 0.7@xmath5 above the local background were considered as potential point sources . a model consisting of a point source and a constant background was fitted into each region surrounding a candidate position . footprint matrices were used to calculate the contribution of the point source to the observed surface brightness values . the free parameters of the fit were the source flux density , the two coordinates of the source position , and the background surface brightness . the formal errors are used to calculate the probability , @xmath6 , that the detection is not caused by background noise . the completeness of the source detection and the number of false detections were studied with simulations . the results were used to adjust the probability level that was used for discarding uncertain detections . the ratio @xmath7 between the source flux density and the background rms noise , @xmath8 , was used as a criterion to discard uncertain sources . since @xmath7 is not directly related to the probability obtained from the footprint fit it can be used as an additional safeguard against false detections . the actual source list consists of sources detected at two or three wavelengths with a spatial distance between detections of less than 80 . the expected number of co - incidental associations is no more than @xmath110% and does not significantly affect the source counts .", "the surface density of sources is estimated by dividing the number of detected sources at a given flux density level with the corresponding ` effective ' map area .    as the first approximation the effective area corresponding to a given flux density level was taken to be the sum of those maps where sources with equal or lower flux densities were detected . the cumulative source densities obtained at 90@xmath0 m , 150@xmath0 m and 180@xmath0 m are shown as histograms in fig . [ fig : allcounts1 ] . two sets of sources were used . the first set consists of all detections ( dotted line ) while in the second set there are only sources detected at more than one wavelength ( solid line ) . the results are similar for 150@xmath0 m and 180@xmath0 m and significant differences are seen only at 90@xmath0 m . this is expected , since sources seen at 150@xmath0 m are likely to be seen also at 180@xmath0 m ( and vice versa ) while more of the 90@xmath0 m sources remain unconfirmed at the longer wavelengths .    a third estimate for the cumulative source densities ( dashed lines in fig . [ fig : allcounts1 ] ) was obtained by selecting sources based on the ratio @xmath7 ( see sect .  [ sect : procedure ] ) . for each flux density level sources with @xmath9 were selected and no confirmation at other wavelengths was required . the effective area was obtained by integrating the total area where the rms noise was below 1/@xmath10 times the source flux density . the values of @xmath11 were selected based on simulations . at the bright end the results agree with earlier histograms since no sources are rejected and the corresponding areas converge towards the total area mapped .    at very low flux density levels the small number of sources leads to large uncertainties . the values obtained below 150mjy for 150@xmath0 m and 180@xmath0 m are probably only indicative .", "we have checked the probability that some of the sources detected are small scale cirrus structures ( cirrus knots ) . results of herbstmeier et al . @xcite show that at the scale of the c100 beam size , @xmath12 , the expected cirrus fluctuation amplitude is below 10jysr@xmath13 for all our 90@xmath0 m maps . according to gautier et al . @xcite this corresponds to a flux density of 4mjy which is clearly below the flux densities of the faintest 90@xmath0 m detections . therefore , cirrus is not likely to be a significant contaminant in the source counts although , because of the non - gaussian nature of the cirrus fluctuations ( gautier et al . @xcite ) , our source list may still contain a few cirrus knots .      in fig . [ fig : lisenfeld ] we compare the average of the source spectra with the spectra of the galaxies arp193 and ngc4418 . in the sample of luminous infrared galaxies presented by lisenfeld , isaak & hills @xcite arp193 has the lowest and ngc4418 the highest estimated dust temperature .    in the rest frame the seds of luminous infrared galaxies reach maxima between 60@xmath14 m and 100@xmath14 m ( silva et al . @xcite ; devriendt , guiderdoni & sadat @xcite ; lisenfeld , isaak & hills @xcite ) . the spectra of our fir sources are flat in the observed wavelength range and the emission peak is typically above 90@xmath14 m . this is consistent with most sources being at redshifts 0.5@xmath15@xmath16@xmath151 . the fir emission maximum of normal spiral galaxies is also located close to 100@xmath14 m ( e.g. silva et al . however , in the case of a spiral galaxy a fir detection at the level of 0.1jy would correspond to a visual magnitude brighter than 16 and the optical counterpart should be readily visible . the lack of clear visual counterparts indicates that most of our sources are likely to be more distant and luminous infrared galaxies .        from fig .

[ fig : allcounts1 ] . linden - vrnle et al . @xcite have performed source counts in a 0.4 square degree field at 60@xmath0 m and 90@xmath0 m . at 90@xmath0 m the results are at 100mjy level similar to the elais counts but are lower at other flux density levels . also in their re - analysis of the lockman hole field they found significantly lower source densities than reported by kawara et al . @xcite . puget et al @xcite have published source counts based on 175@xmath0 m isophot observations of the marano field covering @xmath10.25 square degrees . the source densities ( e.g. @xmath14@xmath2310@xmath19sr@xmath4 at 120mjy ) are slightly higher than our counts . the source counts obtained in these different isophot studies are mainly within a factor of @xmath12 from each other but direct comparison is made difficult by the differences in the source flux calibration adopted by the different authors . we have found a @xmath130% difference between the dirbe surface brightness values and our data calibrated with pia version 7.3 ( juvela et al . this uncertainty is indicated in fig .  3 by the horizontal lines that are used to represent our source counts . at 90@xmath0 m the dirbe calibration results in lower flux densities and at 150@xmath0 m and 180@xmath0 m in higher flux densities . these values are better for the comparison with e.g. the results of oliver et al . @xcite at 90@xmath0 m since they used dirbe as the basis of their calibration . the source counts at 150@xmath0 m and 180@xmath0 m are much higher than predicted by no - evolution models ( e.g. franceschini et al . @xcite ) . at 180@xmath0 m the difference is a factor of five and these models can be safely rejected . our results indicate that the luminosity or the number of galaxies must evolve strongly with @xmath16 . guiderdoni et al . @xcite have presented semi - analytic models for the galaxy evolution . in their model e ( which predicts the highest source counts ) both the ` burst ' mode of star formation rate and the relative number of ultraluminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs ) increase with @xmath16 ; at @xmath24 half of all galaxies are ulirgs . the model is in good agreement with extragalactic background light measurements in both optical and infrared . the model predicts source counts of @xmath11.7@xmath1710@xmath19sr@xmath4 and @xmath11.8@xmath1710@xmath19sr@xmath4 for sources brighter than 100mjy at 150@xmath0 m and 180@xmath0 m , respectively . the number of sources found in this study clearly exceeds these predictions . franceschini et al . @xcite have presented similar models which include contributions from two galaxy populations : dust - enshrouded formation of early - type galaxies and late - type galaxies with enhanced star - formation at lower redshifts . the predicted source counts at 170@xmath0 m are higher than in the model of guiderdoni et al . @xcite and thus in better agreement with our results . m , 150 @xmath0 m and 180@xmath0 m . the dotted line gives all sources detected and the solid line sources detected at more than one wavelength . areas were estimated according to the faintest source detected in a map . the dashed curves represent cases in which both the the source selection and the area determination were based on the local background fluctuations ( see text ) . + * comparison with other isophot counts and models of galaxy evolution . our source counts at 100mjy and 200mjy are shown together with the results of puget et al . @xcite ( circles ) , kawara et al . @xcite ( triangles ) , oliver et al . @xcite ( diamonds ) and linden - vrnle @xcite ( stars ) . we present our results as horizontal lines that indicate the difference between the dirbe calibration and the adopted isophot calibration ( see text ) . the predictions of model e of guiderdoni et al . @xcite are shown with solid lines and the evolutionary model of franceschini et al . @xcite with a dashed line . dotted lines show predictions of no - evolution models ( 90@xmath0 m : guiderdoni et al . @xcite ;

( [ eq_u_fene ] ) and ( [ eq_u_morse ] ) . in each monte carlo update , a monomer is chosen at random and one attempts to displace it randomly by displacements chosen uniformly from the intervals @xmath58 . the attempted move is accepted or rejected according to the conventional metropolis criterion by comparing the transition probability @xmath59 ( where @xmath60 is the energy difference between the configurations after and before the trial move ) with a random number uniformly distributed between zero and unity . if @xmath61 exceeds this random number , the attempted move is accepted , otherwise it is rejected . time is measured in monte carlo steps ( mcs ) per monomer whereby a single mcs is elapsed after @xmath5 monomers are picked at random and given the chance to perform a trial move . since our potentials are constructed such that the membrane can not intersect itself in the course of random displacements of monomers , one does not need to check separately for entanglement restrictions during the simulation . thus the algorithm is reasonably fast . nevertheless , the simulation takes quite a long time for large self - avoiding membranes to equilibrate and then move a substantial distance in space . this and the necessity to attain very good statistical accuracy have limited our investigations to sizes @xmath62 . eventually , we would like to note that the interactions used in the present off - lattice model , albeit somewhat more refined and complicated than the simple potential used in earlier simulations on a cubic lattice  @xcite , do not change the physics of the problem and lead qualitatively to the same results .", "before we focus on the subdiffusive dynamics of our membranes , we show in fig .

( [ beta ] ) . we believe that a possible explanation of this sluggishness of flat membranes at early times @xmath152 may be found if one assumes that in this interval only the most loosely bound monomers ( those at the membrane periphery , or rather , those at the six vertices of the hexagonal sheet ) actually contribute to a displacement of the membrane center of mass while all monomers with six - fold coordination in the bulk of the membrane are virtually blocked by their neighbors and for this short time hardly move . as far as the membrane retains its flat shape and does not fold , the maximal displacement of these loosely bound monomers can not exceed the effective thickness @xmath153 . indeed , a comparison of fig . [ gyration ] and fig . [ g1 ] shows that the msqd , performed by a membrane of linear size @xmath14 during the time @xmath154 ( the latter is given by the intersection point of the tangent @xmath155 to @xmath144 , and @xmath156 ) amounts to @xmath157 . one can , therefore , estimate the characteristic time @xmath154 if , in analogy to eq . ( [ g3 ] ) , one considers @xmath158 in case that _ only _ the membrane periphery of length @xmath159 contributes to the center of mass displacement . thus during @xmath160 the diffusion coefficient of the membrane becomes @xmath161 reflecting the slow displacement of the center of mass . ( [ periphery ] ) therefore suggests @xmath162 . with @xmath163 one obtains then the broken exponent for a _ periphery - driven _ membrane @xmath164 . in contrast , if only a finite number of loosely bound monomers at the vertices effect the net displacement of the center of mass , one obtains then @xmath165 and therefore temporarily @xmath166 so that @xmath167 . in this case one gets the exponent for anomalous diffusion of a _ vertices - driven _ membrane @xmath168 . thus we obtain two estimates which may be considered as the lower and upper bounds of the anomalous diffusion exponent , @xmath169 , depending on the particular mechanism involved in the diffusive motion . the measured value of @xmath10 lies indeed within these limits . of course , one should bear in mind that most probably neither mechanism of diffusion ( vertices - driven , or periphery - driven ) takes place alone and the real process involves a mixture of both . moreover , at this point we can not rule out the possibility that at times @xmath170 _ all _ membrane segments eventually get the chance to perform an elementary move and thus contribute to the center of mass motion . such a possibility would imply that during this time interval of subdiffusive motion one observes a msqd @xmath171 with an exponent @xmath151 , cf . ( [ beta ] ) . we have indicated such a behavior in fig . [ g1 ] by a dashed line with slope @xmath172 and it appears compatible with the course of @xmath105 in between @xmath154 and @xmath0 for our largest membranes @xmath173 . if such a diffusive regime really exists , it would underline the multiscaling character of tethered membranes @xcite . it is clear , however , that larger micelles need to be simulated with satisfactory statistics before an unambiguous conclusion in this respect can be drawn .", "in the present work we have studied the stochastic dynamics of flat self - avoiding tethered membranes which are assumed to be completely permeable to the surrounding good solvent and are thus expected to display typical rouse behavior . by means of extensive monte carlo simulations we find that the static properties of our tethered membranes are described by scaling exponents which agree very well with the appropriate theoretically predicted values . thus the radius of gyration scales with membrane linear size @xmath14 as @xmath174 with @xmath81 , and the membrane thickness , @xmath175 with roughness exponent @xmath176 while the membrane asphericity vanishes asymptotically as @xmath177 with @xmath178 . in the regime of rouse diffusion we find with good accuracy that the diffusion coefficient @xmath4 , as predicted , whereas the typical relaxation time of such polymerized membranes grows as @xmath179 with the linear dimension @xmath14 . a comparative study , involving linear polymers too , reveals also that the diffusion coefficient of permeable self - avoiding tethered membranes , containing @xmath5 segments , is three times smaller than that of linear polymer chains with the same number of segments .    our main concern in this study , however , is with the subdiffusive motion of the membranes central segment at times @xmath180 . our numeric studies reveal several regimes of anomalous diffusion whereby the central node msqd grows as @xmath181 for @xmath182 , then @xmath183 for @xmath184 , further , with @xmath185 at time @xmath186 , before turning eventually to normal diffusion with @xmath187 for @xmath29 . we use simple scaling arguments to interpret our observation and suggest that the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath188 which we find in agreement with recent studies @xcite most probably reflects several particular mechanisms of membrane motion . these mechanisms involve different groups of loosely bound membrane monomers whose random hops predominantly contribute to the center of mass motion of the whole membrane at times when most of the inner monomers are mutually blocked by their nearest neighbors and , therefore , remain rather immobile . the particular geometry of the membrane sheet ( e.g. , square , hexagonal , or rhombic ) is expected to enhance the role of either periphery , or vertex monomers , and therefore slightly modify the observed value of the anomalous exponent @xmath8 according to eqs . ( [ periphery ] ) and ( [ vertices ] ) . this would explain some small deviations of our data from that of earlier measurements  @xcite . we believe that our results shed some light and provide insight into the complex dynamics of polymerized membranes . it is , however , clear that further work is needed before the nature of the membrane stochastic dynamics is definitely established and understood .", "the authors are indebted to the max - planck institute for polymer research in mainz , germany for hospitality during the stay of one of us ( a.m. ) as well as for the possibility to use the computational facilities of the institute . 99 g. gompper and d. m. kroll , j. phys . : condens . matter * 9 * , 8795 ( 1997 ) . c. f. schmidt , k. svoboda , n. lei , i. b. petsche , l. e. berman , c. r. safinya and g. s. grest , science * 259 * , 952 ( 1993 ) . t. hwa , e. kokufuta , and t. tanaka , phys . a * 44 * , r2235 ( 1991 ) . m. s. spector , e. naranjo , s. chiruvolu , and j. a. zasadzinski , phys . lett . * 73 * , 2867 ( 1994 ) . a. sinsawat , k. l. anderson , r. a. vaia , and b. l. farmer , j. polym . sci . , part b : polym . phys . * 41 * , 3272 ( 2003 ) . , ed . r. krishnamoorti and r. a. vaia , acs symposium series 804 , washington d. c. , 2002 . y. kantor , m. kardar , and d. r. nelson , phys . a * 35 * , 3056 ( 1987 ) . le doussal , j. phys . a : math . gen . * 25 * , l469 ( 1992 ) . d. liu and m. plischke , phys . a * 45 * , 7139 ( 1992 ) . y. kantor and k. kremer , phys . rev . e * 48 * , 2490 ( 1993 ) . l. radzihovsky and j. toner , phys . rev . lett . * 75 * , 4752 ( 1995 ) . m. plischke and d. boal , phys . a * 38 * , 4943 ( 1988 ) . d. boal , e. levinson , d. liu , and m. plischke , phys . rev . a * 40 * , 3292 ( 1989 ) . f. f. abraham , w. e. rudge , and m. plischke , phys . lett . * 62 * , 1757 ( 1989 ) . c. mnkel and d. w. heermann , phys . lett . * 75 * , 1666 ( 1995 ) . s. mori and s. komura , j. phys . a : math . gen . * 29 * , 7439 ( 1996 ) . b. y. drovetsky , j. c. chu , and c. h. mak , j. chem . phys . * 108 * , 6554 ( 1998 ) . kownacki and h. t. diep , phys . e * 66 * , 066105 ( 2002 ) . h. koibuchi , z. sasaki , and k. shinohara , phys . e * 70 * , 066144 ( 2004 ) . g. s. grest and i. b. petsche , phys . e * 50 * , r1737 ( 1994 ) . g. gompper and d. m. kroll , j. phys . : condens . matter * 12 * , a29 ( 2000 ) . e. frey and d. r. nelson , j. phys . i france * 1 * , 1715 ( 1991 ) . k. j. wiese , eur . j. b * 1 * , 269 ( 1998 ) . r. b. pandey , k. l. anderson , and b. l. farmer , phys . e * 75 * , 061913 ( 2007 ) . r. b. pandey , k. l. anderson , h. heinz , and b. l. farmer , j. polym . sci . , part b : polym . phys . * 43 * , 1041 ( 2005 ) ; * 43 * , 3478 ( 2005 ) ; * 44 * , 2512 ( 2006 ) . r. b. bird , c. f. curtiss , r. c. armstrong , and o. hassager , dynamics of polymeric liquids , 2nd ed . , vol . 2 ( wiley , new york , 1987 ) . h. popova and a. milchev , j. chem . phys . * 127 * , 194903 ( 2007 ) . k. binder , a. milchev , and j. baschnagel , annu . rev . mater . * 26 * , 107 ( 1996 ) ."], "summary": "using a continuum bead - spring monte carlo model , we study the anomalous diffusion dynamics of a self - avoiding tethered membrane by means of extensive computer simulations . we focus on the subdiffusive stochastic motion of the membrane s central node in the regime of flat membranes at temperatures above the membrane folding transition . while at times , larger than the characteristic membrane relaxation time @xmath0 , the mean - square displacement of the center of mass of the sheet , @xmath1 , as well as that of its central node , @xmath2 , show the normal rouse diffusive behavior with a diffusion coefficient @xmath3 scaling as @xmath4 with respect to the number of segments @xmath5 in the membrane , for short times @xmath6 we observe a _ multiscale dynamics _ of the central node , @xmath7 , where the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath8 changes from @xmath9 to @xmath10 , and then to @xmath11 , before diffusion turns eventually to normal . by means of simple scaling arguments we show that our main result , @xmath12 , can be related to particular mechanisms of membrane dynamics which involve different groups of segments in the membrane sheet . a comparative study involving also linear polymers demonstrates that the diffusion coefficient of self - avoiding tethered membranes , containing @xmath5 segments , is three times smaller than that of linear polymer chains with the same number of segments .", "ranking": [3, 0, 2, 1, 4]}

[ dmvspth ] is less reliable than the large @xmath69 portion . in using the @xmath69 dependence of the mass shift to constrain the higgs width , the theoretical accuracy will benefit from using a wide first bin in @xmath60 . one could take the difference between apparent higgs masses for @xmath20 events in two bins , those having @xmath60 above and below , say , 40  gev . higgs mass shift as a function of the higgs width . the coupling @xmath71 has been adjusted to maintain a constant signal strength , in this case @xmath72.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    finally , we allow the higgs width to differ from the sm prediction . the higgs couplings to gluons , photons , and other observed final states should then change accordingly , in order to maintain roughly sm signal yields , as is in reasonable agreement with current lhc measurements . in particular , for the product @xmath73 entering the dominant gluon fusion contribution to the @xmath20 yield , we solve the following equation , @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the ratio of the experimental signal strength in @xmath76 to the sm prediction ( @xmath77 ) . for higgs widths much less than 1.7  gev , the mass shift is directly proportional to @xmath78 . on the right - hand side of , the two - loop imaginary interference term @xmath28 is negligible ; the fractional destructive interference in the sm is @xmath79 . for @xmath80  mev , it is a good approximation to also neglect @xmath28 on the left - hand side . then the solution for @xmath71 is simply @xmath81 . [ dmvsgam ] plots the mass shift , assuming @xmath72 . it is indeed proportional to @xmath82 for the widths shown in the figure , up to small corrections . if new physics somehow reverses the sign of the higgs diphoton amplitude , the interference is constructive and the mass shift is positive .    in principle , one could apply the existing measurements of the higgs mass in the @xmath1 and @xmath20 channels in order to get a first limit on the higgs width from this method . however , there are a few reasons why we do not do this here . first of all , the current atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite measurements are not very compatible , @xmath83 where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic . second , the experimental resolution differs from bin to bin and has non - gaussian tails . third , the precise background model can influence the apparent mass shift . what we can say is that taking @xmath84  mev and neglecting the latter factors would result in a mass shift of order 1  gev , in the same range as . this is a considerably smaller width than the first direct bound from cms , @xmath85  gev at 95% confidence level  @xcite . a measurement of @xmath86 using two @xmath69 bins in the @xmath20 channel is currently limited by statistics . at the high luminosity lhc , with 3  ab@xmath87 of integrated luminosity at 14  tev , the statistical error on @xmath86 will drop to 50  mev or less . the extrapolation of the systematic error is still somewhat uncertain , but should result in a total error of 100  mev or less  @xcite . from , this corresponds to a bound on the higgs width at 95% c.l . that is within a factor of 15 of the sm value of 4  mev .", "in this letter , we have studied the interference of the sm higgs boson with the lhc diphoton continuum background at nlo in qcd . the mass shift is largely stable for moderate jet veto @xmath60 cuts . in addition , we provide a slightly more precise prediction for the mass shift at finite higgs @xmath60 , by including the contribution from quark - gluon scattering via quark loops . the strong @xmath60 dependence of the mass shift may allow its measurement without reference to the @xmath1 channel . furthermore , we consider a scenario in which new physics modifies the higgs width without altering event rates in the diphoton channel . the mass shift increases rapidly with the higgs width , which could lead to a more direct bound on the higgs width than is presently available .", "we are grateful to florian bernlochner , glen cowan , daniel de florian , dag gillberg , louis fayard , tom junk , narei lorenzo , steve martin , jamie saxon and reisaburo tanaka for helpful comments . we thank stefan hche for useful discussions and help with the numerical implementation . this research was supported by the us department of energy under contract de  ac0276sf00515 . s.  chatrchyan _ et al . _ [ cms collaboration ] , phys . b * 716 * , 30 ( 2012 ) [ arxiv:1207.7235 [ hep - ex ] ] . g.  aad _ et al . _ [ atlas collaboration ] , phys . b * 716 * , 1 ( 2012 ) [ arxiv:1207.7214 [ hep - ex ] ] . d.  a.  dicus and s.  s.  d.  willenbrock , phys . d * 37 * , 1801 ( 1988 ) . l.  j.  dixon and m.  s.  siu , phys . lett .   * 90 * , 252001 ( 2003 ) [ hep - ph/0302233 ] . s.  p.  martin , phys . d * 86 * , 073016 ( 2012 ) [ arxiv:1208.1533 [ hep - ph ] ] . d.  de florian , n.  fidanza , r.  j.  hernndez - pinto , j.  mazzitelli , y.  r.  habarnau and g.  f.  r.  sborlini , eur . j.  c * 73 * , 2387 ( 2013 ) [ arxiv:1303.1397 [ hep - ph ] ] . s.  p.  martin , phys . d * 88 * , 013004 ( 2013 ) [ arxiv:1303.3342 [ hep - ph ] ] . f.  richard and p.  bambade , hep - ph/0703173 [ hep - ph ] . m.  e.  peskin , arxiv:1207.2516 [ hep - ph ] . t.  han and z.  liu , phys . d * 87 * , 033007 ( 2013 ) [ arxiv:1210.7803 [ hep - ph ] ] . a.  conway and h.  wenzel , arxiv:1304.5270 [ hep - ex ] . b.  a.  dobrescu and j.  d.  lykken , jhep * 1302 * , 073 ( 2013 ) [ arxiv:1210.3342 [ hep - ph ] ] . a.  djouadi and g.  moreau , arxiv:1303.6591 [ hep - ph ] . s.  chatrchyan _ et al . _ [ cms collaboration ] , cms pas hig-13 - 005 ( 2013 ) , unpublished . g.  aad _ et al . _ [ atlas collaboration ] , atlas - conf-2013 - 011 . a.  djouadi , m.  spira and p.  m.  zerwas , phys . b * 264 * , 440 ( 1991 ) ;

( 1 ) we propose a new residual transfer network for domain adaptation , where both classifiers and features are adapted . ( 2 ) we explore a deep residual learning framework for classifier adaptation , which does not require target labeled data . our approach is generic since it can be used to add domain adaptation to almost all existing feed - forward architectures .", "this work is related to domain adaptation , a special case of transfer learning @xcite , which builds models that can bridge different domains or tasks , explicitly taking the cross - domain discrepancy into account . transfer learning is to mitigate the burden of manual labeling for machine learning  @xcite , computer vision @xcite and natural language processing @xcite . it is a consensus that the domain discrepancy in probability distributions of different domains should be formally reduced , either by shallow learning or deep learning methods . deep neural networks can learn abstract representations that disentangle different explanatory factors of variations behind data samples @xcite and manifest invariant factors underlying different populations that transfer well from original tasks to similar novel tasks @xcite . thus deep neural networks have been explored for domain adaptation @xcite , multimodal and multi - task learning @xcite , where significant performance gains have been witnessed relative to prior shallow transfer learning methods . however , recent advances show that deep neural networks can learn abstract feature representations that can only reduce , but not remove , the cross - domain discrepancy @xcite . dataset shift has posed a bottleneck to the transferability of deep features , resulting in statistically unbounded risk for target tasks @xcite . some recent work addresses the aforementioned problem by deep domain adaptation , which bridges the two worlds of deep learning and domain adaptation @xcite . they extend deep convolutional networks ( cnns ) to domain adaptation either by adding one or multiple adaptation layers through which the mean embeddings of distributions are matched @xcite , or by adding a fully connected subnetwork as a domain discriminator whilst the deep features are learned to confuse the domain discriminator in a domain - adversarial training paradigm @xcite . while performance was significantly improved , these state of the art methods may be restricted by the assumption that under the learned domain - invariant feature representations , the source classifier can be directly transferred to the target domain . in particular , this assumption may not hold when the source classifier and target classifier can not be shared . as theoretically studied in @xcite , when the combined error of the ideal joint hypothesis is large , then there is no single classifier that performs well on both source and target domains , so we can not find a good target classifier by directly transferring from the source domain . this work is primarily motivated by he et al .  , the winner of the imagenet ilsvrc 2015 challenge . they present a residual learning framework to ease the training of very deep networks ( up to 152 layers ) , termed _ residual nets_. the residual nets explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions @xmath0 with reference to the layer inputs @xmath1 , instead of directly learning the unreferenced functions @xmath2 as in traditional plain nets . the method focuses on standard deep learning in which training data and test data are drawn from identical distributions , hence it can not be directly applied to domain adaptation . in this paper , we propose to bridge the source classifier @xmath3 and target classifier @xmath4 by the residual layers such that the cross - domain classifier mismatch can be explicitly modeled by the residual functions @xmath0 in an end - to - end deep learning architecture . note that the idea of adapting source classifier to target domain by adding a perturbation function has been studied by @xcite . however , these methods require target labeled data to learn the perturbation function , which can not be applied to unsupervised domain adaptation , the focus of this study . another crucial distinction is that their perturbation function is defined in the input space @xmath1 , while the input to our residual function is the target classifier @xmath4 , which can better capture the mismatch between the source and target classifiers . finally , their source classifiers should be pre - learned in a separated step , and the prediction phase will be inefficient using nonlinear kernel functions .", "in unsupervised domain adaptation , we are provided with a _ source _ domain @xmath5 of @xmath6 labeled examples and a _ target _ domain @xmath7 of @xmath8 unlabeled examples . the source domain and target domain are sampled from probability distributions @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively , and note @xmath11 . the goal of this paper is to craft a deep neural network that enables learning of transfer classifiers @xmath12 and @xmath13 to bridge the source - target discrepancy , such that the target risk @xmath14 $ ] is minimized by leveraging the source domain supervision . the challenge of unsupervised domain adaptation arises in that the target domain has no labeled data , while the source classifier @xmath15 trained on source domain @xmath16 can not be directly applied to the target domain @xmath17 due to the distribution discrepancy @xmath18 . the distribution discrepancy may give rise to mismatches in both features and classifiers , i.e. @xmath19 and @xmath20 . both mismatches should be fixed by the adaptation of features and classifiers to enable effective domain adaptation . classifier adaptation is more difficult than feature adaptation because the target domain is fully unlabeled . note that current state of the art deep feature adaptation methods @xcite generally assume shared classifier on their adaptive deep features . this paper assumes @xmath21 and presents an end - to - end deep learning architecture for joint adaptation of classifiers and features . we will extend from the breakthrough alexnet architecture @xcite that comprises five convolutional layers ( @xmath22@xmath23 ) and three fully connected layers ( @xmath24@xmath25 ) , where @xmath22@xmath26 are feature layers and @xmath25 is the classifier layer . specifically , each fully connected layer @xmath27 will learn a nonlinear mapping @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the @xmath30-layer hidden representation of example @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the @xmath30-layer weight and bias parameters , and @xmath34 is the @xmath30-layer activation function , taken as rectifier units ( relu ) @xmath35 for the feature layers or softmax units @xmath36 for classifier layer . denote by @xmath37 the set of network parameters ( @xmath38 layers in total ) . the empirical error @xmath39 of source - classifier @xmath15 on source data @xmath40 is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the conditional probability that cnn assigns point @xmath43 to label @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the cross - entropy loss function @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the number of classes , and @xmath48 is the softmax function defined on the @xmath49-layer activation @xmath50 that computes the probability of predicting point @xmath43 to class @xmath51 . based on the quantification study of feature transferability @xcite , the convolutional layers @xmath22@xmath23 can learn generic features transferable across domains @xcite . hence , when adapting the pre - trained alexnet model from the source domain to the target domain , we opt to fine - tune @xmath22@xmath23 such that the efficacy of feature co - adaptation can be preserved . as we perform residual transfer and distribution matching only for fully connected layers and pooling layers , we will not elaborate the computational details of convolutional layers . although the source classifier and target classifier are different , @xmath20 , they should be related to ensure the feasibility of domain adaptation . hence it is reasonable to assume that @xmath52 and @xmath53 differ only by a small perturbation function @xmath54 . previous works @xcite assume that @xmath55 , where the perturbation @xmath56 is a function of input feature @xmath1 . unfortunately , these methods require target labeled data to learn the perturbation function , which can not be applied to unsupervised domain adaptation , the focus of this study . we argue that the difficulty arises because no constraint is imposed to the perturbation function @xmath56 , therefore it is independent on the source labeled data and source classifier @xmath52 so that it must be learned from target labeled data . how to bridge @xmath52 and @xmath53 in a tight way such that the perturbation @xmath54 can be constrained and learned effectively is a critical challenge for unsupervised domain adaptation . we are motivated by the deep residual learning framework presented by he et al . to win the imagenet ilsvrc 2015 challenge . consider fitting @xmath57 as an original mapping by a few stacked layers ( convolutional layers or fully connected layers ) in figure  [ fig : reslayer ] , where @xmath1 denotes the inputs to the first of these layers . if one hypothesizes that multiple nonlinear layers can asymptotically approximate complicated functions , then it is equivalent to hypothesize that they can asymptotically approximate the residual functions , i.e. @xmath58 . thus rather than expect stacked layers to approximate @xmath57 , one explicitly lets these layers approximate a residual function @xmath59 , with the original function becoming @xmath60 . the operation @xmath60 is performed by a shortcut connection and an element - wise addition , while the residual function is parameterized as @xmath61 by residual layers within each building block . although both forms are able to asymptotically approximate the desired functions , the ease of learning is different . in reality , it is unlikely that identity mappings are optimal , but it should be easier to find the perturbations with reference to an identity mapping , than to learn the function as new . the residual learning is the key contributor to the successful training of very deep networks @xcite .     and target classifier @xmath4 by @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 . ]    as elaborated above , the deep residual learning framework bridges the inputs and outputs of the residual layers by the shortcut connection ( identify mapping ) such that @xmath2 , which eases the learning of residual function @xmath0 ( similar to the perturbation function across the source and target classifiers ) . based on this observation , we extend the cnn architecture ( figure  [ fig : rtn ] ) by plugging in the residual block ( figure  [ fig : reslayer ] ) . we formulate the residual block to bridge the source classifier @xmath3 and target classifier @xmath4 by @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 . note that @xmath3 is the outputs of the source - classifier layer @xmath65 and @xmath4 is the outputs of the target - classifier layer @xmath25 , both before softmax activation @xmath66 , hence @xmath67 . we can bridge the source and target classifiers ( before activation ) by the residual block as @xmath68 where we have used the unactivated classifiers @xmath69 and @xmath70 to ensure the final classifier @xmath15 and @xmath71 will output well - defined probabilities as the softmax classifier in deep neural networks . both residual layers @xmath72@xmath65 are fully connected with @xmath73 units , where @xmath47 is the number of classes . we set the source classifier @xmath69 as the outputs of the residual block to guarantee that it can be trained from the source - labeled data by the deep residual learning framework . in other words , if we set @xmath70 as the outputs of the residual block , then we will be unable to learn it successfully as we do not have target labeled data and standard back - propagation will not work . the deep residual learning @xcite ensures to output valid classifiers @xmath74 . note that , the residual learning framework will make the perturbation function @xmath75 dependent on both the target classifier @xmath4 ( the functional dependency ) as well as the source classifier @xmath3 ( thanks to back - propagation ) . although we cast the classifier adaptation into the residual learning framework , while the residual learning framework guarantees that the target classifier @xmath71 can not deviate much from the source classifier @xmath15 , we still can not guarantee that @xmath71 will fit the target - specific structures well . to address this problem , we further exploit the entropy minimization principle @xcite for classifier adaptation , which favors the low - density separation between classes by minimizing the conditional - entropy @xmath76 of the class probability @xmath77 on target data @xmath17 as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the conditional probability that cnn assigns unlabeled - point @xmath80 to pseudo - label @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is the conditional - entropy loss function defined as @xmath83 , @xmath47 is the number of classes , and @xmath84 is the probability of predicting point @xmath80 to class @xmath51 . by minimizing the entropy penalty  , the target classifier @xmath71 is made directly accessible to target - unlabeled data and amend itself to pass through the target low - density regions . as classifier adaptation does not necessarily undo the mismatch in the feature distributions , we further perform feature adaptation to make domain adaptation more effective . the literature has revealed that the deep features learned by cnns can disentangle the explanatory factors of variations underlying data distributions and facilitate knowledge transfer @xcite . but deep features can only reduce , but not remove , the cross - domain distribution discrepancy @xcite , which thus motivates the state of the art deep feature adaptation methods @xcite . as feature adaptation has been addressed quite well , we adopt the deep adaptation network ( dan ) @xcite to fine - tune cnn on labeled examples and require the feature distributions of the source and target to become similar under feature representations of fully connected layers @xmath85 , which is realized by minimizing a _ multi - layer _ mk - mmd penalty as @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are @xmath30-layer hidden representations of the source and target points respectively , @xmath89 is the mk - mmd between source and target evaluated using the @xmath30-layer hidden representations , and @xmath90 is the indices of layers where mk - mmd penalty is active . let @xmath91 be the reproducing kernel hilbert space ( rkhs ) with kernel @xmath92 . the multi - kernel maximum mean discrepancy ( mk - mmd ) between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is @xcite @xmath93 - { { \\mathbb{e}}_q}\\left [ { \\phi \\left ( { { { \\mathbf{x}}^t } } \\right ) } \\right ] } \\right\\|_{{\\mathcal{h}_k}}^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the nonlinear feature mapping . an important property is @xmath95 iff @xmath96 @xcite . characteristic kernel @xmath97 is defined as the convex combination of @xmath98 psd kernels @xmath99 , @xmath100 where the kernel coefficients @xmath101 can be simply set to @xmath102 or can be learned by multiple kernel learning @xcite .      based on the aforementioned analysis , to enable effective unsupervised domain adaptation , we propose the _ residual transfer network _ ( rtn ) to be an integration of deep feature learning , classifier adaptation  , and feature adaptation in an end - to - end deep learning framework as @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the tradeoff parameters for the entropy penalty   and multi - layer mk - mmd penalty   respectively . the proposed rtn model is able to learn both adaptive classifiers and transferable features . as classifier adaptation proposed in this paper and feature adaptation studied in @xcite are tailored to adapt different layers of the deep networks , they are well complementing to each other to establish better performance and can be combined wherever necessary .    as training deep cnns requires a large amount of labeled data that is prohibitive for many domain adaptation applications , we start with the alexnet model pre - trained on imagenet 2012 data and fine - tune it as @xcite . the training of rtn mainly follows standard back - propagation , including the residual layers for classifier adaptation @xcite . but the optimization of mk - mmd penalty requires carefully - designed algorithm as detailed in @xcite for linear - time training with back - propagation . * discussion : * the proposed idea of residual transfer is quite general and can be readily extended in several scenarios . in heterogeneous domain adaptation where the feature representations are different across domains @xcite , the residual transfer can be applied to the feature layers ( e.g. @xmath24@xmath26 ) of the deep network to bridge the source and target representations .

regularized kernel pca . gfk is a widely - adopted manifold learning method that interpolates across an infinite number of intermediate subspaces to bridge the source and target . ddc is the first method that maximizes domain invariance by adding to alexnet an adaptation layer using linear - kernel mmd . dan learns more transferable features by embedding deep features of multiple task - specific layers to reproducing kernel hilbert spaces ( rkhss ) and matching different distributions optimally by multi - kernel mmd . revgrad boosts domain adaptation by making source and target indistinguishable for a discriminative domain classifier through adversarial training @xcite . to go deeper with the efficacy of _ residual transfer _ with _ entropy minimization _ , we evaluate several variants of rtn : ( 1 ) * rtn -

caltech _ are shown in table [ table : office - caltech ] . note that the results of revgrad under the sampling protocol @xcite are directly reported from @xcite , as the original paper only provided results under the full - sampling protocol @xcite . the rtn model based on alexnet ( figure  [ fig : rtn ] ) outperforms all comparison methods on most transfer tasks . in particular , rtn substantially improves the classification accuracy on hard transfer tasks , e.g. * a @xmath106 w * and * a @xmath106 d * , where the source and target are substantially different , and achieves comparable classification accuracy on easy transfer tasks , * d @xmath106 w * and * w @xmath106 d * , where source and target are similar @xcite . the encouraging results suggest that rtn is able to learn more adaptive classifiers as well as more transferable features for effective domain adaptation .    from the results , we can make insightful observations . ( 1 ) standard deep - learning methods ( alexnet ) perform comparably with traditional _ shallow _ transfer - learning methods with deep decaf@xmath107 features as input ( tca and gfk ) . the only difference between these two sets of methods is that alexnet can take the advantage of supervised fine - tuning on the source - labeled data , while tca and gfk can take benefits of their domain adaptation procedures . this result confirms the current practice that supervised fine - tuning is important for transferring source classifier to target domain @xcite , and sustains the recent discovery that deep neural networks learn abstract feature representation , which can only reduce , but not remove , the cross - domain discrepancy @xcite . this reveals that the two worlds of deep learning and domain adaptation are not compatible with each other in the two - step pipeline , which motivates carefully - designed deep adaptation architectures to unify them . ( 2 ) deep - transfer learning methods that reduce the domain discrepancy by domain - adaptive deep networks ( ddc , dan and revgrad ) substantially outperform standard deep learning methods ( alexnet ) and traditional shallow transfer - learning methods with deep features as the input ( tca and gfk ) . this confirms that incorporating domain - adaptation modules to deep networks can improve domain adaptation performance . by adapting source - target distributions in multiple task - specific layers using optimal multi - kernel two - sample matching , dan performs the best in general among the prior deep - transfer learning methods . ( 3 ) the proposed residual transfer network ( rtn ) method performs the best and sets a new state of the art record on these datasets . different from all the previous deep - transfer learning methods that only adapt the feature layers of deep neural networks to learn more transferable features , rtn further adapts the classifier layers to bridge the source and target classifiers in an end - to - end residual learning framework , which can correct the classifier mismatch effectively .    to go deeper into the modules of rtn , we show the results of rtn variants : rtn - res ( no residual transfer ) , rtn - ent ( no entropy penalty ) , and rtn - mmd ( no mmd penalty ) . the results in tables  [ table : office31 ] and [ table : office - caltech ] well validate our motivation . ( 1 ) rtn - res achieves much better results than revgrad and dan , but substantially underperforms rtn . this highlights the importance of the _ residual transfer _ of classifier layers for learning more adaptive classifiers . this is critical as in practical applications , there is no guarantee that the source classifier and target classifier can be safely shared . ( 2 ) rtn - ent also achieves much better results than dan and revgrad , but substantially underperforms rtn . this highlights the importance of _ entropy minimization _ for low - density separation , which exploits the cluster structure of target - unlabeled data such that the target - classifier can be better adapted to the target data . otherwise , the residual function may tend to learn a useless zero mapping such that the source and target classifiers are nearly identical @xcite . ( 3 ) rtn - mmd performs comparably with the best baseline dan , but substantially underperforms rtn . this evidence suggests the residual transfer of classifiers devised in this paper is as effective as the mmd adaptation of features @xcite . since these two methods are tailored to adapt different layers of the deep networks , they are well complementing each other to establish better performance as witnessed by the best performance of rtn . * visualization of predictions : * we illustrate the adaptivity of classifiers by visualizing in figures  [ fig : dan_s][fig : rtn_t ] the t - sne embeddings @xcite of the predictions made by the classifiers of dan and rtn for transfer task * a * @xmath106 * w * , respectively . we can make the following observations . ( 1 ) the predictions made by dan in figure  [ fig : dan_s][fig : dan_t ] show that the target categories are not well discriminated by the source classifier , which implies that target data is not compatible with the source classifier . hence the source and target classifiers should not be assumed to be identical , which , whatsoever , has been a common assumption made by all prior deep domain adaptation methods @xcite . ( 2 ) the predictions made by rtn in figures  [ fig : rtn_s][fig : rtn_t ] show that the target categories are discriminated much better by the target classifier , which suggests that residual transfer of classifiers proposed in this paper is a reasonable extension to the previous deep domain adaptation methods . rtn learns more adaptive classifiers as well as more transferable features to enable effective deep domain adaptation . * analysis of layer responses : * we illustrate in figure  [ fig : response ] the average magnitudes and standard deviations of the layer responses @xcite , which are the outputs of @xmath4 ( @xmath25 layer ) , @xmath117 ( @xmath65 layer ) , and @xmath3 ( sum operator ) before other nonlinearity ( relu / addition / softmax ) , respectively . for the residual transfer network , this analysis exposes the response strength of the residual functions . the results reveal that the residual functions @xmath117 have generally much smaller responses than the shortcut functions @xmath4 . these results support our original motivation that the residual functions might be generally closer to zero than the non - residual functions , since they characterize the small gap between the source classifier and target classifier . the small residual function can be learned more effectively through the residual learning framework @xcite . * parameter sensitivity : * besides the mmd penalty parameter @xmath105 as dan @xcite , the rtn model involves another entropy penalty parameter @xmath104 . we perform sensitivity analysis for it on transfer tasks * a * @xmath106 * w * ( 31 classes ) and * c * @xmath106 * w * ( 10 classes ) by varying the parameter of interest in @xmath118 . the results are shown in figures  [ fig : sensitivity ] , with the best results of the baseline shown as dashed lines . we observe that the accuracy of rtn first increases and then decreases as @xmath104 varies and demonstrates a desirable bell - shaped curve . this justifies our motivation of jointly learning deep features and adapting classifiers using residual layers and entropy penalty in deep nets , as a good trade - off between them can promote transfer performance .", "this paper presented a novel approach to unsupervised domain adaptation of deep networks , which enables simultaneous learning of adaptive classifiers and transferable features . similar to many prior domain adaptation techniques , the feature adaptation is achieved through matching the distributions of features across domains . however , unlike all previous techniques , the proposed approach also supports classifier adaptation , which is accomplished through a new residual transfer module to bridge the source classifier and target classifier . this new ingredient makes the approach a good complement to existing techniques . the approach can be trained by standard back - propagation , which is scalable and can be implemented by any deep learning package . we will constitute further evaluations on larger - scale tasks and semi - supervised domain adaptation settings as future work ."], "summary": "the recent success of deep neural networks relies on massive amounts of labeled data . for a target task where labeled data is unavailable , domain adaptation can transfer a learner from a different source domain . in this paper , we propose a new approach to domain adaptation in deep networks that can simultaneously learn adaptive classifiers and transferable features from labeled data in the source domain and unlabeled data in the target domain . we relax a shared - classifier assumption made by previous methods and assume that the source classifier and target classifier differ by a residual function . we enable classifier adaptation by plugging several layers into the deep network to explicitly learn the residual function with reference to the target classifier . we embed features of multiple layers into reproducing kernel hilbert spaces ( rkhss ) and match feature distributions for feature adaptation . the adaptation behaviors can be achieved in most feed - forward models by extending them with new residual layers and loss functions , which can be trained efficiently using standard back - propagation . empirical evidence exhibits that the approach outperforms state of art methods on standard domain adaptation datasets .", "ranking": [4, 2, 0, 1, 3]}

( 2000b ) demonstrate that black holes with reverberation mapping mass estimates also fall on the same relation . the tightness of this new correlation greatly increases confidence in the accuracy of the observed black hole mass estimates . it also strengthens theoretical arguments that spheroid formation and the growth of black holes are closely linked ( richstone et al . 1998 ; cattaneo , haehnelt & rees 1999 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ( kh2000 ) ; monaco , salucci & danese 2000 ; cavaliere & vittorini 2000 ) . cattaneo et al . ( 1999 ) and kh2000 demonstrated that the @xmath6 relation and the scatter reported by kormendy & richstone ( 1995 ) and magorrian et al . ( 1998 ) is well reproduced in phenomenological models of galaxy formation in hierarchical cosmogonies . in this letter , we analyze the relation between black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion in the kh2000 model . we assume a @xmath7cdm cosmology with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 throughout .", "in cold dark matter ( cdm)-like cosmologies , galaxies form in a hierarchy of merging halos ( e.g. white & rees 1978 ; white & frenk 1991 ) . the formation and evolution of galaxies in such a picture has been studied in considerable detail using monte - carlo realizations of the hierarchical growth of structure , which include simple prescriptions to describe gas cooling , star formation and supernova feedback ( see kauffmann et al 1999 ; somerville & primack 1999 ; cole et al 2000 for a selection of recent results ) .    below we summarize the main features of the model described by kh2000 , who constructed a unified model for the formation and evolution of galaxies , supermassive black holes and qsos . in their model , the quiescent accretion of cooling gas from a halo results in the formation of a disk . the fraction of cold gas in the disk that forms stars over one dynamical time is assumed to scale with redshift as @xmath12 . this assumption was required in order to fit the observed decline in the total content of cold gas in galaxies towards low redshift inferred from observations of damped lyman - alpha systems ( storrie - lombardi et al . if two galaxies of comparable mass merge , a spheroid forms and the remaining gas is transformed into stars in a `` starburst '' . the same major mergers are responsible for the formation and fuelling of black holes in galactic nuclei . during the merger the central black holes of the progenitors coalesce and a fraction of the available cold gas is accreted by the black hole . the accreted fraction is assumed to scale with the circular velocity @xmath13 of the surrounding dark matter halo as @xmath14 ( this scaling was adopted in order to fit the slope of the @xmath15 relation of magorrian et al ( 1998 ) . ) the only change in this letter compared to kh2000 is a reduction by a factor of three in the fraction of gas assumed to accrete onto the black hole . this is needed because the mass estimates of black holes from the new data are significantly smaller than those of magorrian et al ( 1998 ) . in the kh2000 model , black holes grew in mass only during major mergers . as pointed out previously , it is certainly possible that supermassive black holes have more complicated accretion histories ( see haehnelt , natarajan & rees 1998 and haehnelt & kauffmann 2000 for a detailed discussion ) . other accretion modes could easily be incorporated into the model . we note , however , that the recent reduction in the estimated total mass density in black holes makes arguments for accretion modes other than those traced by optical- and infrared - bright qsos less compelling .", "fig . 1a shows scatterplots of black hole mass versus bulge velocity dispersion in our models . we do not have a dynamical model for computing @xmath1 for the bulges in our simulations . for simplicity , we have assumed a constant ratio @xmath16 , where @xmath13 is the circular velocity of the halo in which the bulge found itself after its last major merger . it is easy to show that any well - mixed population of stars orbiting within an isothermal potential must satisfy @xmath17 . following kauffmann & charlot ( 1998 ) , we choose the ratio of @xmath18 to reproduce the zero point of the observed faber - jackson relation ( see fig . 2 ) . to fit the observations , we require @xmath19 .    the thick solid line in fig . 1a ( @xmath20 ) shows the relation derived by gebhardt et al . ( 2000a ) , which is reproduced very well . in the models , the total mass of gas that cools in a halo scales roughly as @xmath21 . feedback effects steepen the relation to approximately @xmath22 , but feedback would have to be more extreme in order to obtain a correlation as steep as @xmath23 ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) . the scatter in the relation is 0.2 dex , somewhat smaller than the 0.3 dex reported by gebhardt et al . which include measurement errors . 1b shows the black hole mass  bulge luminosity correlation compared with the observed relation in the gebhardt et al . sample . for the simulated galaxies , the scatter is about a factor two larger and again agrees well with the observational data . the large scatter in the relation in fig . 1b is a consequence of the large dispersion in the relation between the luminosities and velocity dispersions of bulges . this is illustrated in in fig 2a where we plot the @xmath24 ( faber - jackson ) relation for the elliptical galaxies in our model . elliptical galaxies are defined as those objects with a ratio of bulge to total luminosity greater than 0.4 in the b - band . in the next section , we study the origin of the scatter in these relations and explain why the scatter in the @xmath2 relations is significantly smaller than that of the @xmath25 or @xmath26 relations .", "previous work has demonstrated that hierarchical galaxy formation models succesfully reproduce the faber - jackson ( @xmath28 ) and the magorrian ( @xmath15 ) relations ( kauffmann & charlot 1998 , kh2000 ) . the slopes of these correlations are determined by how much gas is able to cool and forms stars or is funneled to the centre in a dark matter halo of given mass or circular velocity . this is set by the assumed balance between gas cooling , star formation , supernova feedback and accretion in the halos . the correlations are tight for bulges that form at fixed epoch , but the scatter increases substantially if the galaxy population as a whole is considered . this is demonstrated by fig . 2b , where we plot the residuals in our `` faber - jackson '' relation as a function of the age of the bulge . age is defined as the time elapsed since the bulge had its last major merger . as can be seen , the residuals in the faber - jackson relation correlate strongly with age : young bulges of fixed velocity dispersion are brighter than old bulges . our results are in good agreement with those of forbes & ponman ( 1999 ) , who study residuals in the faber - jackson relation for a sample of 88 nearby ellipticals with ages determined from absorption line spectroscopy . kh2000 showed that a similar effect is expected for the @xmath15 relation . young bulges of fixed luminosity contain less massive black holes than older bulges . this prediction was recently confirmed by merrifield , forbes & terlevich ( 2000 ) . why does the @xmath2 relation exhibit such small scatter ? in fig . 3a , we show how the gas and the stellar masses of bulge progenitors vary as a function of the formation redshift of the bulge . results are shown for bulges with @xmath29 km s@xmath30 and @xmath31 km s@xmath30 . the cold gas masses of the progenitors of bulges of given velocity dispersion _ are essentially independent of redshift _ , whereas their stellar masses decrease at high redshift . as discussed by kh2000 , this decrease in the ratio of gas mass to stellar mass in galaxies is crucial for explaining the observed rapid decline of the qso activity at late times , as well as the decrease in the total content of cold gas in galaxies inferred from damped ly@xmath32 systems ( storrie - lombardi et al . 1996 ) .    in our model the amount of gas available for accretion onto a black hole during a major merger depends only on the velocity dispersion of the bulge and not on redshift . this together with our assumption that a fixed fraction of this gas is accreted by the black hole accounts for the small scatter in the @xmath2 relation for bulges forming in gas - rich mergers . what about gas - poor mergers , where gas accretion contributes little to the growth of the black hole ? such gas - poor mergers are important for massive bulges forming at late times ( kh2000 ) . figure 3b shows `` evolutionary tracks '' in the @xmath33 plane for 20 black holes in our model with masses @xmath34 . these black holes typically form in 3 - 5 merging events spaced quite widely in redshift . at late times , the host galaxies of these black holes have rather small cold gas fractions . nevertheless , it is clear from our plot that black holes always move along the correlation as they merge , even for massive systems at late times . the latter can be understood as follows . let us consider the case where black holes grow only by merging and therefore have masses that scale in proportion to those of their host halo . for halos of constant characteristic density , the velocity dispersion @xmath1 scales @xmath35 . with decreasing redshift the characteristic density decreases and the velocity dispersion grows more slowly with increasing mass : @xmath36 . in cdm - like cosmogonies the characteristic mass of typical dark matter haloes scales as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the effective slope of the dm fluctuation spectrum . at galaxy scales @xmath39 . this gives a scaling @xmath40 .", "we have demonstrated that the model of kh2000 where supermassive black holes are formed and fuelled during major mergers produces a tight correlation between black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion very similar to that observed by gebhardt et al . ( 2000a ) . the model also reproduces the observed relation between black hole mass and bulge luminosity , as well as the relation between bulge luminosity and bulge velocity dispersion .    in the model , the slopes of these relations are determined by how much gas cools , forms stars or is funneled to the centre in dark matter halos of different mass / velocity dispersion . adopting simple , but physically plausible prescriptions to describe these processes , we are able to fit all three relations simultaneously . note that the only change we have made compared to kh2000 is an overall reduction of the accreted gas fraction . the large scatter in the @xmath15 and the @xmath41 relations is primarily a consequence of the wide range in redshift over which bulges and supermassive black holes form . the stellar mass of a bulge of fixed velocity dispersion depends strongly on when the bulge formed . bulges that form early are less massive than bulges that form late . note that the same is true of disk galaxies in our model . these predicted correlations with age appear to be supported by the available data . nevertheless , the scatter in the @xmath27 relation is small . there are two reasons for this . * the amount of gas accreted by a black hole during the formation of a bulge of fixed velocity dispersion does not depend on redshift . in our model , disk galaxies of given circular velocity contain about the same amount of gas at all redshifts . this is a further prediction of the model to be tested by future observations . * the frequent merging of galaxies in hierarchical cosmogonies moves galaxies along the correlation in the @xmath2 plane , even when galaxies are gas - poor and their black holes grow mainly by the merging of pre - existing black holes . the model of kh2000 is a supply - limited model for the accretion history of supermassive black holes . we note that the model does not allow for any dependency in the amount of gas accreted by the black hole on the orbital parameters of the merger . we have also assumed a fixed scaling between the velocity dispersion of a bulge and the circular velocity of the halo in which it resides . these are all potential sources of additional scatter . detailed numerical simulations will be needed to decide whether a physical mechanism that depends on the bulge potential and that limits the growth of supermassive black holes is required to keep the correlation tight . from our present analysis , we conclude that the tightness of the observed correlation is in apparent agreement with a scenario in which merging events produce supermassive black holes and bulges over a wide range in redshift . cattaneo , a. , haehnelt , m.g . & rees , m.j . , 1999 , 308 , 77 cavaliere , a. , vittorini , v. , 2000 , apj , in press , astro -

{"id": "1007.4453", "section_names": ["introduction", "model", "results", "conclusion", "references"], "document": ["in recent years , there has been a growing interest in the topic of consensus decision making in several fields including animal behaviour @xcite , social sciences @xcite and control theory @xcite . in this paper we use the paradigm of animal groups but we would like to stress already at this point that there is a considerable analogy between the decision - making processes in very different systems and we expect that our simple model should be applicable to a wider range of systems . our object of study is the phenomenon during which the animals moving in groups , seemingly make unanimous decisions on the choice and time of performing activities even in the absence of global leaders . it is expected that because of the heterogeneity in the attributes like the age , sex and social status of the animals in a group or the differences in their perception of external stimuli there will be differences in the motivations of the members at the time of making choices . however , in spite of the differences , synchronization is seen to take place . examples include takeoff of swarm of honeybees from nest sites @xcite , activity synchronization in sheep @xcite , collective movement in monkeys @xcite , group departures of domestic geese @xcite and departure of ants from a feeding site @xcite . the study of collective opinion formation in physics has mainly focused on human societies @xcite . parallels have been drawn between phase transitions in magnets and the opinion dynamics in populations . alternatively , the subject of collective motion of animal groups has been extensively modelled @xcite . here point - like particles , representing animals , move with constant speed , each tending to align with its immediate neighbours , for low noise levels , giving rise to a globally ordered state replicating the motion of flocks where all animals move in the same direction .    in this report we model the process of landing of bird flocks performing foraging flights as a typical example of collective decision making . we view this phenomena as a shift of the average opinion of the flock from that of continuing horizontal flight about some preferred altitude to that of descent towards the surface below . we model the fact that birds land almost synchronously even in the presence of heterogeneity in motivations , along the lines of the random field ising model ( rfim ) @xcite . our approach is similar to that used in @xcite where the authors analyze ( among other cases ) the manner in which people in concert halls , initially joining the applause , stop clapping almost at the same time . in a very recent model @xcite for collective landing , birds are assumed to move under the action of different _ social _ forces . in addition , the internal state of each bird is characterized by a continuous variable called _ landing intent _ such that the internal state of each bird is directly coupled to the internal state of its neighbours . in contrast we allow motivation of individual birds to be influenced by only the observable variables of their neighbours , like position and velocity . in addition as a part of the model we introduce a method which enables us to work in open boundary conditions where the birds in flight move cohesively and do not spread out in the horizontal plane even in the presence of perturbations . with this model we investigate the level of synchronicity in collective landing across time and space and explore the nature of fluctuations close to the point in time when landing occurs .", "below we describe the two aspects of the model , _ viz . _ collective decision making and collective motion in detail . the birds in our model are represented by particles characterized by the dynamical variables of position @xmath0 and velocity @xmath1 in three dimensional space . the only _ natural _ boundary that we allow in the system is the @xmath2 plane which we consider to be the landing surface . the @xmath3-coordinate of a flying bird gives its height above the ground . we assign to each particle @xmath4 a variable @xmath5 such that we refer to a bird in the flying state as active ( @xmath6 ) and a bird in the landed state as inactive ( @xmath7 ) . this variable is updated at discrete times @xmath8 according to the condition : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the time increment . once a bird @xmath4 has landed we keep its position unchanged till the end of the simulation . also , from here on we use the words `` bird '' and `` particle '' synonymously . first we focus on the variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 governing the cruising motion of the birds parallel to the landing surface . this motion is assumed to be essentially decoupled from the motion in the vertical direction and is modelled in the spirit of @xcite . a particle @xmath4 is assumed to move , with some uncertainty , in the average direction of motion of all neighboring particles @xmath13 whose separation @xmath14 from @xmath4 is less than a interaction radius @xmath15 . from now on we refer to the set of particles in this neighbourhood as @xmath16 with respect to a particle @xmath4 such that , the inactive particles and the particle @xmath4 are included as well . the expression for updating velocity at a time @xmath8 is given by @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the magnitude of the velocity , @xmath19 is the rotation matrix in two dimensions representing a random perturbation by an angle @xmath20 and @xmath21 denotes the unit vector @xmath22 . here @xmath20 is chosen with a uniform probability from the interval @xmath23 $ ] , where @xmath24 is the amplitude of the noise . we describe the force - like term @xmath25 below . we follow the standard version @xcite of the original spp model @xcite for the updating of positions : @xmath26    we mention here that it is a well - known problem with existing models of collective motion to maintain the cohesiveness of a moving flock in the presence of a finite amount of noise @xmath24 and with finite ranged ( as @xmath15 ) interaction between the members . a flock tends to break up into smaller sub - flocks which eventually move in independent directions . a periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) is used to prevent the flock from spreading out perpendicular to the direction of motion . however , in the problem of landing we find that the imposition of a pbc would be unrealistic in the sense that there will be a possibility of a particle that has become inactive and hence ceased to move , to continually exchange information with the rest of the moving flock . therefore , we introduce a new kind of `` comoving boundary '' condition where we imagine the motion of the particles on the @xmath27-plane to be governed by a circular bounding region with radius @xmath28 and the centre lying on the centre of mass ( _ com _ ) of all active particles ( mass of each assumed to be unity ) . this boundary therefore translates with the flock as the _ com _ is put into motion due to collective motion of the particles . when a particle which is inside the region tries to leave it , the particle is subjected to an attraction proportional to the distance from the boundary . the direction of this attraction is along the resultant of the direction towards the location of the _ com _ and the direction of motion of the _ com _ itself . for a particle located at @xmath29 at an instant of time , the attraction @xmath30 is given by : @xmath31\\mathbf{c}\\big(\\mathbf{x^{\\shortparallel}}\\big )          & \\mbox { if $ |\\mathbf{x}^{\\shortparallel}-\\mathbf{\\overline{x}}^{\\shortparallel}| > r_\\mathrm{b}$ } \\\\        0 & \\mbox { otherwise , }      \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] with @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the strength of the attraction , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the position and the velocity of the _ com _ , respectively , parallel to the @xmath27-plane at that instant and @xmath36 is a parameter . the _ com _ and its velocity are calculated with respect to the active particles . in the figure [ field ] we plot @xmath25 when the motion of the _ com _ is in a direction parallel to the y - axis . similarly , we assume that the boundary adjusts itself to keep average separation between active particles constant . thus , in general @xmath28 is a function of time , given by , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the fraction of the active particles at time @xmath8 and @xmath39 is the number of particles , initially active , per unit area of the @xmath27-plane .     on the @xmath27-plane , defined through ( [ bound-1 ] ) for the value of @xmath40 . the direction of motion of the _ com _ is assumed to be along the y - axis , indicated by the arrow at the centre of the circle . the length of a vector is directly proportional to the distance from the boundary . , width=340 ]    now we explain how the collective decision making process takes place in the flock and how it is related to the cohesion and eventual landing along the vertical direction . we characterize the decision of an individual bird as a binary choice problem @xcite . to each bird @xmath4 we assign an internal state variable @xmath41 such that when @xmath42 the bird continues to cruise above ground and when @xmath43 the bird decides to land . for the cruising state we assume that a bird likes to fly about an altitude @xmath44 on average without deviating too far above or below . however , we expect the elevation of a bird to fluctuate with time pertaining to factors like the noise in the medium and collision avoidance . thus when @xmath42 we consider the vertical motion of the particle to be essentially a random walk bounded by imaginary walls at @xmath45 and @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the thickness of the flock . in case the bird decides to land the vertical motion is directed towards the landing surface at @xmath2 . formally we define , @xmath48 & \\textrm{if $ s_i(t)=1 $ and $ |\\delta(t-\\delta t)|>\\delta z_0/2 $ } \\\\ -v &   \\textrm{if $ s_i(t)=-1 $ , } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath49 takes values @xmath50 with equal probability and @xmath51 , is the amount of deviation from the height @xmath44 at time @xmath52 .    to model the motivational differences in birds we assign to each bird @xmath4 , an inherent switching time @xmath53 @xcite such that if the bird begins an isolated flight at time @xmath54 , it would decide to land at time @xmath55 . we assume that the value of @xmath53 for the bird @xmath4 will in general depend on its energy reserves @xcite and thus in general will be different for different birds . we choose @xmath53 s from a gaussian distribution with a given standard deviation @xmath56 . the value of @xmath56 allows us to control the level of heterogeneity in a flock . although we assign _ a priori _ values of @xmath53 to birds , due to the randomness in the choice of these switching times , they can be thought to be additionally include the effect of the environment such as quality of foraging patches over which the flocks fly .    for a particle in the flock , it will have a finite number of particles in its neighbourhood and therefore will be influenced by their actions while taking a decision . hence the internal state of a particle will be a function of two competing factors , ( i ) its inherent switching time and ( ii ) the internal state of the neighbours , which we assume to be reflected by the nature of their motion . in an approach similar to that of the rfim at zero temperature @xcite we write down : @xmath57\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the propensity of a particle to follow the decision of its neighbours and @xmath59 is the _ local mean field _ through which the bird @xmath4 senses the average decision in its neighbourhood @xmath16 . we expect that the inclination of a bird @xmath4 to land will be enhanced by a resultant motion of birds in @xmath16 towards the landing surface , and also by the number of birds that have already landed . we define @xmath59 at a time @xmath8 as : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the average value of @xmath3-component of velocity of active particles and fraction of active particles , respectively , in the neighbourhood @xmath16 at time @xmath8 . at times @xmath63 , the birds on average have no inclination to land and therefore we expect them to maintain a height around @xmath64 without any resultant vertical motion towards the landing surface . in this regime we expect for any particle @xmath4 , @xmath65 and also , @xmath66 , implying that @xmath67 . on the other hand a resultant vertical motion in negative @xmath3-direction would imply @xmath68 . thus in a regime when majority move towards the landing surface at @xmath2 and eventually reach inactive states , we expect @xmath69 . we now move on to characterize the resulting collective landing as a function of different states of collective motion . _ we would like to emphasize at this point that although the detailed description of our model involves specifying nine expressions , the essential concept and the ingredients of the model are rather simple ( spp + rfim ) and the number of independent parameters is low ( @xmath24 , @xmath15 , @xmath70 , @xmath58)_.", "we note that in our model , the shape of a coherently moving flock , far from the landing regime , is roughly cylindrical with a radius of cross section @xmath71 and thickness @xmath47 . we argue that from the point of view of our model for large flocks @xmath47 will have in general weak or no dependence on the number of birds . we choose the thickness of the flock @xmath47 as the unit to measure distances ( @xmath72 ) . we choose the projected density @xmath73 , the interaction radius @xmath74 and the preferred altitude of flying @xmath75 . in our simulations we take @xmath76 , unless mentioned otherwise , the order of which is typical for moderately large flocks @xcite . also the ratio @xmath77 would be typical in these flocks which have thickness of order @xmath78 m and fly at altitudes of around @xmath79 m. at the time @xmath54 in ( [ rfim ] ) we expect the flock to be already in the steady state of collective motion . so before we switch on time as in ( [ rfim ] ) we evolve a flock to its steady state of motion according to equations ( [ eom - xy ] ) , ( [ eq_snm_pos ] ) and ( [ spin ] ) where each particle @xmath4 has @xmath42 . it is known @xcite that the nature of the collective motion depends on the amplitude of the noise . we find that for sufficiently low values of @xmath24 , all the particles align their directions and the flock as a whole translates in some spontaneously chosen direction parallel to the @xmath27-plane . as the value of @xmath24 is increased , the tendency of alignment is gradually lost leading to weak or no translation . however , the actual nature of this transition is not known precisely enough and its detailed investigation is outside of the scope of the present paper . we make an observation that there are two independent time scales in the problem - the time scale of motion and the time scale over which the inherent switching times are distributed . the former is given by @xmath80 which is the time required to move one unit of length ( or half interaction radius @xmath81 ) . in presence of finite amount of noise @xmath24 , this time scale would also govern the mixing between particles . the width of the distribution of @xmath53 s ( @xmath82 ) gives a measure of the time over which the energy reserves of the majority in the flock are exhausted . therefore , when @xmath83 , there is hardly any motion during the collective decision making . when @xmath84 the flock actually translates ( at low values of @xmath24 ) over a long distance during the process . we call the ratio of these two time scales as @xmath85 , where @xmath86 , and we investigate the nature of landing at its different values . we set the time scale for choosing values of @xmath18 and @xmath56 as the time increment @xmath87 . the value of magnitude of velocity @xmath18 is kept around and below @xmath88 so that change in the set of neighbours @xmath16 of any bird @xmath4 is gradual . we choose the value of the parameters for the comoving boundary described by equations ( [ bound-1 ] ) and ( [ bound-2 ] ) to be @xmath89 and @xmath90 . we also observe that parameter @xmath36 controls the degree of asymmetry of the vector field @xmath91 ( [ bound-2 ] ) outside the comoving boundary . for @xmath92 the system enters into a rotating phase @xcite , and for @xmath93 the flock has a tendency to accumulate at the boundary .      the role played by the coupling @xmath58 in ( [ rfim ] ) is well known @xcite and has also been the matter of investigation . however , in our model we fix @xmath58 to an optimal value for which we find the desired behaviour , as explained below . in the figure [ trans - land](a ) we compare the process of landing across time for different values of the coupling . for a flock with inherent switching times @xmath94 chosen with a fixed @xmath56 we monitor the fraction of active particles @xmath95 with time @xmath8 for different values of @xmath58 . we observe that when @xmath96 the particles become inactive independent of each other at their own switching times as seen from the curve @xmath97 which falls smoothly with time . on choosing @xmath98 the behaviour is quite opposite . a very sharp fall occurs in the curve @xmath99 implying that there is indeed a collective decision making taking place when a large number of particles reach inactive states within a short period of time . however , comparing the two curves @xmath97 and @xmath99 it appears that in the latter case , the collective landing occurs at point in time which is much larger than ( by an amount of order @xmath56 ) than the switching times of most of the birds . we find that a much lower value of @xmath100 is relevant biologically . the curve @xmath101 sharply falls indicating collective behaviour and the fall occurs near at a time when about half of the birds have just crossed their inherent switching times .    in the figure [ trans - land](a ) we also plot @xmath102 which is the fraction of birds which have a momentary intention to land at time @xmath8 _ i.e. _ , the fraction of particles with @xmath43 . unlike @xmath101 , the quantity @xmath102 is seen to fluctuate before becoming equal to the maximum value unity . this shows that before finally deciding to land , birds may intermittently change their decision . this is caused by the fluctuations in the vertical motion ( [ spin ] ) of neighbours as well as the changing neighbourhood due to finite value of @xmath24 . however , these fluctuations become only important near the landing regime . we explore an aspect of these fluctuations later . in the figure [ trans - land](b ) we plot the velocity field of a typical flock when the majority has decided to land . denotes the fraction of birds not landed yet as the time @xmath8 progresses . the curves @xmath97 , @xmath101 and @xmath99 correspond to values of coupling @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively . also , @xmath102 shows the fraction of birds in state @xmath43 at time @xmath8 for @xmath100 .

( b ) the variation of the spread of the landed flock over the @xmath27-plane , relative to the spread at time @xmath54 , as a function of noise . , width=566 ]      below we quantify the extent to which the presence of the coupling affects the collectiveness in landing as we vary the scaled value of the heterogeneity ( @xmath85 ) . we define a measure of the sharpness of the decrease in the fraction of active particles @xmath112 ( figure [ trans - land ] ) . during the process of landing , we record the times at which individual particles become inactive . then we calculate the standard deviation @xmath70 of the distribution of these landing times . finally , we divide @xmath70 by @xmath56 to get the normalized measure . the dimensionless quantity @xmath113 averaged over different realizations of @xmath114 s , provides a measure of the extent to which the landing of the flock is coherent in time such that @xmath115 implies the complete absence of collective decision making . in the figure [ t2080-r](a ) we plot @xmath113 versus @xmath24 for different values of @xmath85 . we make the following observations . for @xmath116 the flock reaches consensus almost in the absence of any motion . as a result there is no variation of @xmath113 with the magnitude of noise . in this regime the value of @xmath70 is governed by the spread of the flock in the steady state along the vertical direction _ i.e. _ , @xmath47 . therefore we expect that @xmath117 . in the inset ( a ) of the figure [ t2080-r](a ) we plot the ratio @xmath118 against @xmath24 . it is worth mentioning that the quantity @xmath109 provides an alternate normalization of @xmath70 with respect to the other independent time scale @xmath108(@xmath119 ) . we find that for @xmath85 close to unity , @xmath120 asserting that the landing is coherent and the separation between landing times is due to the width @xmath47 . for larger values of @xmath85 the value of @xmath113 also becomes large signifying gradual loss of coherence . we also observe that in general @xmath113 has a maximum for intermediate values of the noise . we find that if we choose to ignore the particles which become inactive either too early or too late , then the level of temporal coherence appears better . for a particular landing we measure the times @xmath121 and @xmath122 at which @xmath111 and @xmath123 of the particles , respectively , in the flock has just become inactive . thus we define , @xmath124 as the width of the time window in which a majority _ i.e. _ , @xmath125 of the particles become inactive . we normalize @xmath126 by the corresponding time window ( @xmath127 ) for a flock with the coupling @xmath96 . in the inset ( b ) of the figure [ t2080-r](a ) we plot @xmath110 versus @xmath24 for different values of @xmath85 . the average behaviour reveals a level of coherence such that two birds originally having their inherent switching times separated by @xmath127 land within a period of around @xmath128 of @xmath127 . we investigate the degree of collectiveness as a function of the distance over which a flock lands in figure [ t2080-r](b ) . we calculate the following quantity : @xmath129 this quantifies the spread of the flock across the landing surface . we normalize the value of this spread ( @xmath130 ) when all particles become inactive by the corresponding value ( @xmath131 ) calculated with the positions of the active particles at time @xmath54 . in the figure [ t2080-r](b ) we plot @xmath132 as function of noise varying values of @xmath85 . for low and moderate values of @xmath85 , the value of @xmath132 is of the order of unity . the landing occurs over a region whose dimensions are comparable to dimensions of the flock .    we observe that in the regime of large @xmath85 , the value of noise plays a major role in deciding the overall nature of landing . for very low values of @xmath24 the flock translates over large distances . due to this translation , the particles reaching inactive states early are unable to influence the decision of the active particles in the flock as the _ com _ moves away from these particles . in this case the landing occurs in few large clusters separated in space and time . in case of higher values of the noise there is weak or no translation of the _ com_. however , the scale of the difference in inherent switching times _ i.e. _ , @xmath56 being very slow as compared to the scale of motion , it provides the scope for a particle with a low value of @xmath53 to diffuse to the boundary . as a result , temporarily the influence of the neighbourhood is weakened . this allows the particle to switch its state and become inactive . initially , the excursions of the particles to the comoving boundary becomes the reason behind independent landings . the shrinking of the boundary ( [ rb ] ) effectively screens ( depending upon the interaction radius @xmath15 ) the active particles from the inactive particles . for moderate values of @xmath24 the path of the _ com _ becomes tortuous . however , the effect of segregation of inactive particles from the active particles still persists . the landing occurs in large number of smaller clusters . we further characterize the above behaviour by the following definition . after the landing we calculate the _ com _ of the particles positioned on the @xmath27-plane . we define the measure of spatial coherence @xmath133 as the fraction of particles that lie within a distance @xmath134 from the _ com_. formally , @xmath135 where , @xmath136 is the position of the @xmath4-th inactive particle , @xmath34 is the position of the _ com _ and @xmath137 is the heaviside step function . we expect from the above observations that @xmath133 is close to unity for a spatially coherent landing and zero in the opposite case .

land](a ) ) we find that birds originally moving towards the landing surface sometimes return back to the cruising altitude . we characterize these fluctuations by the maximum depth @xmath160 to which a bird makes an excursion before returning to an altitude greater than @xmath169 . in the figure [ aval - dcm](a ) we plot the probability density @xmath170 . we find that the distribution of @xmath160 is a power - law decay bounded by a minimum and maximum governed by the magnitude of velocity @xmath18 and the maximum possible depth @xmath44 , respectively . we also study the jumps that occur in position of the _ com _ ( on the @xmath27 plane ) of flying birds once the landing process starts . as is seen from the figure [ com - psi](a ) the trajectory of the _ com _ becomes irregular near the end . the _ com _ actually jumps from a cluster which ceases to move to a cluster which continues moving . we construct the probability density @xmath164 for the separation @xmath165 between the centres of mass at two consecutive time steps . we find that @xmath164 has a fat tail during the landing process . in the figure [ aval - dcm](b ) we plot the tail of @xmath164 after binning . the plots reveals power law decays with close by exponents . the power law has a cut - off which governed by @xmath138 .", "in this paper we have investigated the interplay between the dynamics of collective motion and collective decision making . in particular we have presented a model for landing of bird flocks . we have identified the relevant scales in such a problem and we have worked in the coupling regime which is expected to be biologically relevant . it appears that higher values of the coupling delays the process of the global opinion shift . we have characterized the degree of the resulting collective behaviour by different measures . we found that  as a function of the few parameters of our model  the collective switching from the flying to the landing state is indeed much sharper than the distribution of the individual ( inherent ) landing intentions . among the several interesting features of the model we proposed , we showed that if the flock is subject to larger fluctuations , the spatial spreading of the fully landed flock becomes smaller due to a better mixing of the information about the momentary landing intentions of the birds . we also find that there is a characteristic value of heterogeneity which scales with the size of the flock . below this value of heterogeneity , flocks remain spatially coherent in the process of landing and above this value , the coherence is lost . in addition we have formulated a boundary condition which is pertinent to models of flocking . we believe that the approach we proposed is also relevant for many other systems where abrupt behavioural changes are observed . possible applications include various kinds of animal or even robotic groups in which an almost instantaneous global switching to a new desired state takes place .", "99 conradt l and roper t j 2005 _ trends ecol . evol . _ * 20 * 449"], "summary": "most of us must have been fascinated by the eye catching displays of collectively moving animals . schools of fish can move in a rather orderly fashion and then change direction amazingly abruptly . there are a huge number of further examples both from the living and the non -

scales of the molecular solvent is much faster than that of the diffusive motion of the colloidal particles . in concentrated suspensions , a dragged colloidal particle influences the motion of another particles via the solvent flow field . these so - called hydrodynamic interaction is typically long - ranged . while it can be neglected in colloidal suspensions of very small volume fractions , it induces significant corrections in the equilibrium and nonequilibrium dynamics of colloidal suspensions @xcite . the equilibrium structures and phase boundaries , on the other hand , are unaffected by hydrodynamic interactions .    in the past years a simple nonequilibrium phase transition @xcite has been discussed in a binary mixture of colloidal particles which are driven by a constant external field @xcite . the drive is different on the two particle species and could arise from gravity and from an external electric field in the case of charged colloidal suspensions . brownian dynamics computer simulations with neglected hydrodynamic interactions strongly support the scenario that - as a function of the driving strength - the mixtures undergoes a transition from a mixed steady - state with anisotropic correlations towards a steady - state where macroscopic lanes are formed . the transitions has been found for oppositely driven repulsive mixtures @xcite in two and three spatial dimensions and it seems to be a first - order nonequilibrium transition with a significant hysteresis in an order parameter which detects laning @xcite . the general scenario occurs also in pedestrian dynamics @xcite and in granular matter @xcite . recently , lane formation was observed in real - space experiments by leunissen et al @xcite . equimolar mixtures of oppositely charged colloidal particles were prepared which form binary ionic crystals @xcite . these crystals were exposed to a strong external electric field and the dynamics of lane formation was watched by confocal microscopy . subsequently extensive brownian dynamics simulations were carried out to map the nonequilibrium phase diagram @xcite . these simulations assumed a yukawa pair interaction between the particles and neglected hydrodynamic interactions completely . a wealth of different steady - state structures was detected . in particular different orderings were found in the plane perpendicular to the drive including a square , triangular or rhombic crystalline lattice of lanes , a network structure with a finite structural length and intermediate chain formation of lanes @xcite . a rough estimate of the experimental parameters used in ref.@xcite reveals that the laned state observed experimentally indeed falls into the region where laning is expected to occur by brownian dynamics computer simulations .    in this paper we address the question how hydrodynamic interactions influence the scenario and the steady - state diagram of lane formation . our motivation to do so is twofold : first , the experiments , of course , contain hydrodynamic interactions in their full glory , and therefore an inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions is needed for a quantitative comparison . second , there is a principal need to understand in which direction hydrodynamics influence lane formation . in particular it is known @xcite that the leading long - ranged term in the mobility pair tensor is screened if an electric field is applied since a charged colloidal particles is surrounded by counterions of opposite charge . that makes the hydrodynamic interaction significantly different from e.g. sedimentation induced by different buoyant masses of oppositely charged colloids where the action of gravity on the microions can safely be neglected . in the latter case , the leading part in the mobility tensor at large interparticle separation is the _ unscreened _ oseen tensor . it would be interesting to explore how far the steady - state is affected by hydrodynamic interactions in both cases of sedimentation and electrophoresis . we use brownian dynamic computer simulations and include hydrodynamic interaction by using mobility tensors on the rotne - prager level . both cases of sedimentation and electrophoresis are studied separately with an unscreened resp .  screened version of the mobility tensor . the steady - state phase diagrams and the drift velocity are simulated . the simulation data are compared to that obtained by simple brownian dynamics where hydrodynamic interactions are neglected . for sedimentation , we find that hydrodynamic interactions strongly disfavor laning . in the steady - state of lanes , a macroscopic phase separation of lanes is observed , i.e.  the sickness of the lanes are of the system size . this is in marked contrast to the simple brownian case where a finite size of lanes was obtained in the steady - state . for strong coulomb interactions between the colloidal particles a lateral square lattice of oppositely driven lanes is stable similar to the simple brownian dynamics . in an electric field , on the other hand , the behavior is found in qualitative and quantitative accordance with the case of neglected hydrodynamics . all lateral structures are reproduced and the topology of the steady - state phase diagram is unchanged . the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we describe our model and simulation scheme for sedimentation and electrophoresis . brownian dynamics simulation results are presented in section iii . we conclude in section iv .", "we perform brownian dynamic simulations to study an equimolar binary mixture of @xmath0 oppositely charged colloidal particles of diameter @xmath1 dissolved in a solvent fluid of shear viscosity @xmath2 at temperature @xmath3 and volume fraction @xmath4 exposed to an external driving field , where @xmath5 is the dimension of a cubic simulation box having periodic boundary conditions . henceforth , @xmath1 serves as the unit of length and @xmath6 , the thermal energy , as the energy unit of the system . to mimic the experiments by leunissen et al @xcite the particles interact with an effective screened coulomb potential ( or yukawa potential ) plus a steric repulsion @xmath7 : @xmath8 with @xmath9 the strength of the interaction potential and @xmath10 the sign of the charge of particle @xmath11 . @xmath12 denotes the distance between particle @xmath11 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the coordinate vector . the inverse screening length @xmath15 governs the range of the interaction and is determined by the salt concentration of the solution . the steric repulsion between the particles , that prevents the system from collapsing , is approximated by a repulsive ( shifted and truncated ) lennard -

( [ eq : f_ext ] ) may in both cases be identical , if the charges and/or buoyant masses are chosen accordingly , the hydrodynamic interactions are not . the algorithm used to simulate the diffusive brownian motion of the colloidal particles was proposed by ermak and mccammon @xcite . here , the translational displacements of the particles are deemed to occur in time steps of fixed length @xmath22 and the update algorithm is given by @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the diffusion tensor field depending on the positions of the particles at time @xmath25 . the random displacements @xmath26 are chosen from a joint gaussian distribution with mean and covariant matrix @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the average over the gaussian noise distribution . @xmath29 , @xmath30 , comprises the nonhydrodynamic forces due to interparticle interactions , determined by the gradient of the interaction potentials in eq .

( [ eq : rotne_prager_tensor ] ) is given by @xmath42 which is of the order of @xmath43 for large distances . however , when regarding the electrophoresis the mobility tensor has to be altered since forces induced by the surrounding counterions into the solvent are in sum equal to the force induced by a colloidal particle . thus , the solvent flow stemming from the drag on the counterions can not be neglected as is done in the sedimentation case . it results in an effective screening of the leading far - distance term of the hydrodynamic interactions between the colloidal particles as long and ajdai have shown @xcite . their mobility tensor @xmath44 reads as @xmath45.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the leading order term is @xmath46 which decays as @xmath47 . to account for the polymer coating on the colloidal particles that gives rise to the steric repulsion we choose @xmath48 throughout this paper . more sophisticated simulation techniques for spherical particles in an unbounded space including lubrication approximation for particles in close proximity and multipolar expansion methods are available @xcite . however , in the electrophoresis where the hydrodynamic interactions of the counterions become important explicit simulations of all colloidal particles and their counterions  @xmath49 per colloidal particle in the experiments by leunissen et al  are still beyond computational means . therefore , we adopted the calculations of long and ajdari to our simulations and compare it to the sedimentation problem on the same level of accuracy , i.e.  the rotne - prager level . to our best knowledge this is the first brownian dynamic simulations with the long and ajdari mobility term [ eq : long_tensor ] . both mobility tensors [ eq : rotne_prager_tensor ] and [ eq : long_tensor ] are long - ranged and thus require an ewald - like summation in simulations analogous to coulomb and dipole - dipole interactions . details on the summation and discussions about appropriate boundary conditions to the system can be found elsewhere @xcite . we applied the scheme suggested by beenakker @xcite and adapted it for @xmath44 accordingly . the square root of the diffusion tensor , needed when calculating the random displacements in eq .

[ fig : phasediagram1].,width=302 ]     but for sedimentation with hydrodynamic interactions taken into account through @xmath73 in eq . ( [ eq : rotne_prager_tensor ] ) . the phase diagram shows significant changes as compared to fig . [ fig : phasediagram1 ] and fig . [ fig : phasediagram2].,width=302 ]    what can be seen at first sight is that the qualitative behavior of situation ( a ) and ( b ) in figures [ fig : phasediagram1 ] and [ fig : phasediagram2 ] is almost identical with only subtle differences , while on the other hand the phase behavior changes drastically for situation ( c ) , figure [ fig : phasediagram3 ] . in the latter the whole phase diagram is altered and the diversity of phases found is reduced compared to the first two cases .      in this subsection we briefly describe the two phase diagrams in figures [ fig : phasediagram1 ] and [ fig : phasediagram2 ] and their differences , beginning at low volume fractions and ending at high ones , and then dwell on the third diagram , fig.[fig : phasediagram3 ] , thereafter in subsection [ sec : sed ] . a more ample discussion on how different phases are identified and what structural correlations they exhibit can be found in a previous work of the authors on the same system with hydrodynamic interactions neglected but for a slightly different driving strength and larger systems @xcite . here , we find for situation ( a ) virtually the same results as in the previous work with only one difference , namely that we do not encounter a rhombic phase for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .    for very low volume fraction , @xmath76 , in both systems the correlations between the particles are not sufficient to form lanes at all . thus , the systems are in a phase of no - lanes . only for very low salt concentration , i.e.  small @xmath70 , where the electrostatic coupling between the colloidal particles is strong , we find a coexistence region between lanes and no - lanes . here , the region with no - lanes consists of voids , where hardly any particle is found . the structure of the lane region , on the other hand , is different in the two situations . for situation ( a ) the corresponding snapshot in fig.[fig : phasediagram1 ] reveals fixed lattice points while the snapshot in fig . [ fig : phasediagram2 ] situation ( b ) shows a network - like structure . for situation ( a ) , an initial configuration with lanes placed on a square lattice separated from a completely depleted region is stable in simulations , as well . thus , we assume that in situation ( a ) the lanes / no - lanes phase is a transient state toward a complete square lattice and no - lane phase separation . hydrodynamic interactions destroy the coexistence phase for @xmath77 . it only occurs in a denser system with @xmath78 whereas in situation ( a ) this state shows already up at @xmath77 . additionally , the voids are more pronounced in the latter case compared to situation ( b ) . upon increasing @xmath79 for @xmath78 in both situations we find a network - like structure whose characteristic spacing is increasing with increasing @xmath70 . for situation ( a ) there is also a small coexistence region between network and square lattice at @xmath80 .    to obtain a quantitative measure of the characteristic spacing in the network structure we determine a structure factor perpendicular to the driving field of like - charged particles . the steady - state partial structure factor has been calculated by evaluating the expression @xmath81 with @xmath82 the number density and the wave vector @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 are integers . @xmath87 is the fourier transform of the total correlation function @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes dirac s delta - distribution .     of like - charged particles perpendicular to the driving field for @xmath92 and @xmath78 for hydrodynamics neglected and electrophoresis . the pre - peak at @xmath93 indicates an additional length scale of the structure in the network - like phase . the inset shows the position @xmath94 of the pre - peak as a function of the inverse screening length @xmath70 for a fixed volume fraction of @xmath78.,width=302 ]    an example of the steady - state partial structure factors for @xmath92 and @xmath78 for both situation , ( a ) and ( b ) , is shown in fig . [ fig : sk ] . one clearly observes a pronounced pre - peak at the wave number @xmath95 in both cases . a pre - peak in the structure factor is an indication of an additional mesoscopic length scale as typical for bicontinous networks , such as e.g.  microemulsions @xcite . in the inset we additionally present the position @xmath95 of the pre - peak as a function of the inverse screening length . it is evident from the picture that the characteristic spacing is indeed growing with increasing @xmath70 . we find hardly any difference between situation ( a ) and ( b ) .    for @xmath96 an additional phase for small inverse screening length shows up in both phase diagrams . oppositely driven lanes are placed on a square lattice with an alternating charge pattern . the formation of this lattice structure can be qualitatively understood from an effective interaction between oppositely charged driven lanes which has a short - ranged repulsive and a long - ranged attractive interaction . the former stems from the friction between oppositely driven particles while the later results form the coulomb interaction . the square lattice then reduces the electrostatic energy of the system because each particle has only oppositely charged neighbors . for increasing salt concentrations we encounter a coexistence region between the square lattice and the network - like phase and finally end up in a pure network - like phase . the phase diagram is in both situations very similar , only the borders of the transitions are slightly shifted . in the electrophoresis case the network - like structure is preferred to the square lattice .    for a higher volume fractions of @xmath97 a coexistence regime between a triangular lattice and a network - like structure is found . the lattice - points in the triangular phase are rather randomly decorated with different charges . here , the short range repulsion plays the dominant role compared to the electrostatic interaction . it enforces a triangular lattice due to packing effects although electrostatically it is strongly disfavored because like - charged particles necessarily occupy lattice points next to each other . again , hydrodynamic interactions slightly shift the phase boundaries towards the network - like structure . for the highest volume fraction studied , @xmath74 , both phase diagrams show exactly the same behavior . here , the short range repulsions dictates the phase behavior for nearly all salt concentration but for @xmath98 and enforces lanes to be placed on a triangular lattice . only for @xmath98 , where electrostatic interactions are prominent , a square lattice is preferred . in principle a square lattice is possible up to the packing of a simple cubic lattice of @xmath99 .    in summary we observe very similar behavior in both situations . the observed differences can be qualitatively explained by the fact that hydrodynamic interactions disfavor lanes driven oppositely past each other .      regarding sedimentation , fig . [ fig : phasediagram3 ] , the whole phase diagram exhibits _ only _ three different phases . for volume fractions @xmath100 we do not find lane formation for all inverse screening length studied . for increasing volume fractions and strong electrostatic interactions , @xmath101 , first the square lattice at @xmath102 , that is also present in the previous two situations , is recovered and then the system reenters a region with no - lanes for @xmath74 . this behavior nicely illustrates the competition between hydrodynamic interactions disfavoring lanes driven oppositely past each other and the electrostatic interactions favoring a square lattice . only for the small regime around @xmath102 the electrostatics succeeds the hydrodynamic interactions and enforces a square lattice . for all other volume fractions laning is destroyed . however , for stronger salt concentrations , where the coulombic coupling is reduced , we discover a situation that is not present in the previous situations ( a ) and ( b ) , namely a region in which only two big completely separated lanes . we call this state _ phase separated_. in that case the long ranged hydrodynamic interactions prescribe the structure and the short ranged yukawa interaction plays its role only at the rough interface of the two phases . from our simulations we conclude the lanes are separated by half of the box length . now , we study the influence of hydrodynamic interaction on the drift velocity along the field direction that is defined as follows @xmath103^{2}\\right\\rangle }    { t^{2}}.\\ ] ] this entity measures the mean - square displacement of each particle in the nonequilibrium steady - state . a study on the effect of hydrodynamics on the drift velocity of like charged colloidal particles was carried out by watzlawek and ngele @xcite . we study two cases , first we fix the volume fraction at @xmath97 and vary the inverse screening length and afterward vice versa for @xmath98 .    in fig . [ fig : v ] we display @xmath104 for a fixed volume fraction @xmath97 as a function of the inverse screening length @xmath70 for all three situations .     in drive direction as a function of the inverse screening length @xmath70 at @xmath97 for brownian dynamic simulations with hydrodynamic interactions neglected , taken into account through @xmath72 , and @xmath73.,width=302 ]    for all cases the drift velocity increases with decreasing coulomb coupling because oppositely charged colloids attract each other while driven in opposite direction and lanes mutually retard each other . for very strongly screened particles where this friction is less important all three curves reveal approximately the same value of @xmath105 . accordingly , this value is close to the drift velocity of @xmath106 for a system of infinite dilution subjected to the same driving force . while in ( a ) and ( b ) @xmath107 grows gradually , in the sedimentation curve we encounter a jump in the drift velocity between @xmath108 and @xmath109 . this coincides with the transition from the no - lane regime to the phase separated regime , see the phase diagram fig . [ fig : phasediagram3 ] . on the other hand for @xmath101 , where we find a square lattice , the drift velocity is similar to @xmath108 . from that we conclude that the phase separated state of lanes supports particle transport while lanes placed on a square lattice enforced by strong coulombic interactions slows down particle transportation . a further interesting feature is that curves for ( a ) and ( b ) intersect between @xmath98 and @xmath80 and that the screened hydrodynamic interaction enhance the drift velocity for larger inverse screening length . the same is true for the unscreened hydrodynamic interactions in the sedimentation for @xmath110 .     in drive direction as a function of the volume fractions @xmath56 at @xmath98 for brownian dynamic simulations with hydrodynamic interactions neglected , taken into account through @xmath72 , and @xmath73.,width=302 ]    when studying the drift velocity for a fixed inverse screening length but for varying volume fractions in fig . [ fig : v2 ] we find again an intersection point of the curves for situations ( a ) and ( b ) . here , the drift velocity in the electrophoresis reaches an approximately constant value of @xmath111 for @xmath112 whereas it gradually decreases when hydrodynamic interactions are neglected . for the sedimentation the drift velocity decreases monotonically . in contrast to the case of varying salt concentration we do not encounter a jump in the sedimentation drift velocity when entering the square lattice at @xmath97 and reentering the no - lane regime at @xmath74 .", "in conclusion the influence of hydrodynamic interactions on lane formation of opposite charged colloids driven by an electric field or by gravity was investigated by brownian dynamics computer simulations . hydrodynamic interactions were included on the rotne - prager level . for an electric field , the leading oseen term is screened due to the presence of counterions . the latter fact has lead to very similar steady state phase diagrams for an electric field as a driving source than that in the simple case of neglected hydrodynamic interactions . various steady state were obtained as a function of the colloidal density and the range of the interaction . they can qualitatively be understood in terms of a competition of the mutual coulomb attraction and friction of sliding lanes . at high densities the lateral structure is crystalline , the crystal is either triangular as dictated by packing at high densities and high screening or square - like at low - screening which minimizes the coulomb attractive energy . on the other hand , in sedimentation where the two colloidal species have the same buoyant mass up to a relative sign , friction of sliding lanes is strongly enhanced leading to macroscopic separation of lanes . the steady - state phase diagram can in principle be verified in real - space experiments of charged suspensions which are driven in an electric field or sedimenting @xcite . it would be interesting to construct a microscopic theory for the lane transitions which includes the lateral crystalline structure . the instability analysis within a dynamical density functional theory as applied to the case of equal charges in two spatial dimensions @xcite should in principle be generalizable to the case of oppositely charged particles . finally more sophisticated simulations schemes are needed in order to go beyond the rotne - prager level of approximation used in this paper . among the various promising approaches are the stochastic rotation dynamics code @xcite , a lattice boltzmann theory including hydrodynamics @xcite and counterion flow or the recently developed fluid particle dynamics methods @xcite .", "we thank m. leunissen , a. van blaaderen , r. yamamoto , a. louis , and j. padding for helpful remarks and the dfg ( sfb tr6 , project section d1 ) and the graduiertenfrderung of the heinrich - heine - universitt dsseldorf for financial support ."], "summary": "the influence of hydrodynamic interactions on lane formation of oppositely charged driven colloidal suspensions is investigated using brownian dynamics computer simulations performed on the rotne - prager level of the mobility tensor . two cases are considered , namely sedimentation and electrophoresis . in the latter case the oseen contribution to the mobility tensor is screened due to the opposite motion of counterions . the simulation results are compared to that resulting from simple brownian dynamics where hydrodynamic interactions are neglected . for sedimentation , we find that hydrodynamic interactions strongly disfavor laning . in the steady - state of lanes , a macroscopic phase separation of lanes is observed . this is in marked contrast to the simple brownian case where a finite size of lanes was obtained in the steady - state . for strong coulomb interactions between the colloidal particles a lateral square lattice of oppositely driven lanes is stable similar to the simple brownian dynamics . in an electric field , on the other hand , the behavior is found in qualitative and quantitative accordance with the case of neglected hydrodynamics .", "ranking": [3, 2, 0, 1, 4]}

[ sec : loclight ] , the spatial nucleon localization measure is discussed for cluster configurations in light nuclei using a simple harmonic oscillator scheme and skyrme - dft . the results for fissioning heavy nuclei are presented in sec . [ sec : heavynuclei - hfb ] . finally , the summary and outlook are given in sec . [ summary ] .", "in superfluid nuclear dft , the binding energy is expressed through the general density matrix @xcite . by applying the variational principle to s.p . wave functions ( kohn - sham orbitals ) , the self - consistent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) equations are derived . nuclear dft has been successfully used to describe properties of ground states and selected collective states across the nuclear landscape @xcite .    in this work , we use skyrme energy density functionals which are expressed in terms of local nucleonic densities and currents . for light nuclei discussed in sec . [ sec : lightnuclei - hf ] , where pairing can be neglected , we solve the constrained hartree - fock ( hf ) problem with the functional unedf1-hfb @xcite . in the discussion of fissioning heavy nuclei in sec . [ sec : heavynuclei - hfb ] , pairing correlations are important . therein , we solve the constrained hfb problem with the unedf1 functional optimized for fission @xcite in the presence of pairing treated by means of the lipkin - nogami approximation as in ref . @xcite . the dft solvers used in this work are hfbtho @xcite and hfodd @xcite . they are both based on the expansion of s.p . wave functions in a deformed harmonic oscillator basis . the solver hfbtho assumes axial symmetry of the mean field potential while the general - purpose hfodd solver employed in our fission studies is symmetry - unconstrained . the spatial localization measure was originally introduced in atomic and molecular physics to characterize chemical bonds in electronic systems . it also turned out to be useful in visualizing cluster structures in light nuclei @xcite . it can be derived by considering the conditional probability of finding a nucleon within a distance @xmath7 from a given nucleon at @xmath8 with the same spin @xmath9 ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) and isospin @xmath12 ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) . as discussed in @xcite , the expansion of this probability with respect to @xmath7 can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the particle density , kinetic energy density , current density , and density gradient , respectively . they can be expressed through the canonical hfb orbits @xmath20 :    @xmath21 , \\\\ { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$}}\\rho_{q\\sigma}({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}})&=&2\\sum_{\\alpha\\in q}v^2_{\\alpha}\\mathrm{re}[\\psi^*_\\alpha({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}\\sigma){\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$}}\\psi_\\alpha({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}\\sigma)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath22 being the canonical occupation probability . thus , the expression in the parentheses of eq . ( [ eqn : probability ] ) can serve as a localization measure . unfortunately , this expression is neither dimensionless nor normalized . a natural choice for normalization is the thomas - fermi kinetic energy density @xmath23 . considering that the spatial localization and @xmath24 are in an inverse relationship , a dimensionless and normalized expression for the localization measure can be written as @xmath25^{-1}.\\ ] ] in this work , time reversal symmetry is conserved ; hence , @xmath18 vanishes . a value of @xmath26 close to one indicates that the probability of finding two nucleons with the same spin and isospin at the same spatial location is very low . thus the nucleon s localization is large at that point . in particular , nucleons making up the alpha particle are perfectly localized @xcite . another interesting case is @xmath27 , which corresponds to a homogeneous fermi gas as found in nuclear matter . when applied to many - electron systems , the quantity @xmath26 is referred to as the electron localization function , or elf . in nuclear applications , the measure of localization ( [ eqn : localization ] ) shall thus be called the nucleon localization function ( nlf ) . the above definition of the nlf works well in regions with non - zero nucleonic density . when the local densities become very small in the regions outside the range of the nuclear mean field , numerical instabilities can appear . on the other hand , when the particle density is close to zero , localization is no longer a meaningful quantity . consequently , for finite nuclei , we multiply the nlf by a normalized particle density @xmath28 $ ] .", "( in nucleons/@xmath29 ) for prolate configurations in @xmath1be and @xmath2ne with @xmath30 , and for oblate configuration in @xmath31c with @xmath32 . right : corresponding masked nlfs as described in sec . [ model : localization ] . white dotted lines are the contour lines @xmath33 of the original definition ( [ eqn : localization ] ) . ] since the average potential in light nuclei can be fairly well approximated by that of the deformed harmonic oscillator ( ho ) @xcite , many properties of these systems can be characterized in terms of ho shell structure . quantum mechanically , the unusual stability of cluster states in light nuclei can be attributed to strong shell effects that are present in the ho potential at deformed shapes . indeed , in the deformed ho model the strongest level degeneracy occurs when the ratio of oscillator frequencies is a rational number ; this results in the appearance of supershells @xcite . consequently , the deformed ho model can serve as a rough guidance to describe cluster states @xcite . to this end , we first study the nlfs using the wave functions of the axial ho with frequencies @xmath34 and @xmath35 . for integer values of @xmath36 ( prolate shapes ) , a supershell structure appears that is associated with the @xmath37-fold su(3 ) dynamical symmetry of the rational ho @xcite . for instance , for @xmath30 , the superdeformed magic numbers are @xmath38 , etc . for oblate shapes , the degeneracy pattern of rational ho is different @xcite . for instance for @xmath32 the magic numbers are @xmath39 @xcite . in the examples below for @xmath40 nuclei , we only show densities and nlfs for one combination of spin and isospin as time - reversal and isospin symmetries are conserved .    in fig . [ fig : ho - localization ] we show particle densities and nlfs for superdeformed configurations in @xmath1be and @xmath2ne with @xmath30 , and for an oblate configuration in @xmath31c with @xmath32 . all of these configurations correspond to closed shells of deformed ho . in the case of @xmath1be , both the density and the nlf reveal two clear centers . the nlf values at these centers are close to one , which means that the nucleons are highly localized , implying the presence of @xmath0 clusters . for @xmath2ne , the cluster structure is difficult to see in the particle density plot . however , the nlf clearly demonstrates the presence of two @xmath0 clusters at the tips and a ring structure around @xmath41 associated with an oblate - deformed @xmath31c nucleus . figures  [ fig : ho - localization](e ) and ( f ) indeed show that the @xmath32 configuration in @xmath31c exhibits a very similar localization pattern , except that the localization level is higher . this is easy to understand as the wave functions of @xmath0 clusters in @xmath2ne have a non - zero overlap with the ring ( @xmath31c ) structure , and this decreases the level of localization .      in order to compare the deformed ho results with a realistic nuclear model , we carry out nuclear dft calculations for @xmath1be and @xmath2ne . for light nuclei with @xmath40 , results for neutrons and protons are very similar as the coulomb contribution is small . therefore , we only consider neutron spin - up densities and nlfs . figures  [ fig : be8 ] and  [ fig : ne20 ] show results of constrained hf calculations with unedf1-hfb assuming good parity . here , the quadrupole and octupole deformations are defined through the corresponding axial multipole moments @xmath42 : @xmath43 figure  [ fig : be8 ] depicts @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the ground - state configuration of @xmath1be . both quantities are very similar to the ho results of fig .

[ fig : ho - localization](c ) and ( d ) . again , the particle density does not show any pronounced cluster structure , while the spatial localization shows the presence of the @xmath0-@xmath31c-@xmath0 structure . as the quadrupole deformation increases , the localization of the three clusters becomes more pronounced . ne versus quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath49 . the neutron densities ( in nucleons/@xmath29 ) at the two local minima i and ii are shown in panels ( b ) and ( d ) , respectively , and the corresponding nlfs are plotted in panels ( c ) and ( e ) . ] our results for @xmath1be and @xmath2ne compare well with the hf - ski3 calculations of ref .  @xcite . in both cases , unmasked nlfs exhibit numerical artifacts in the low - density region , because the numerator and denominator in eq . ( [ eqn : localization ] ) are both close to zero . if parity is not constrained in hf calculations , the ground state of @xmath2ne is expected to be reflection - asymmetric @xcite . in refs . @xcite , the @xmath50 configuration in @xmath2ne is predicted to have a cluster - like structure with a large octupole deformation , while the @xmath51 ground state is situated between cluster - like and spherical configurations . to illustrate this special case , we used hfodd to perform a constrained hfb calculation for @xmath2ne at the octupole deformation @xmath52 @xcite . as seen in fig . [ fig : ne20-parity ] , the intrinsic configuration of @xmath2ne has a rather compact shape . a clear dip in the nlf at the center manifests a region where all wave functions overlap . a slight enhancement of the spatial localization near the tip is visible . while the ground - state of @xmath2ne shows a faint trace of an @xmath0-@xmath53o structure , the localization is rather low ; hence , the quasimolecular picture does not apply . but for the reflection - asymmetric ground state of @xmath2ne at @xmath54 and @xmath55 .", "based on the examples shown in last section , we conclude that the nlf is an excellent tool for visualizing cluster structures in light nuclei . in this section , we will apply this tool to monitor the development and evolution of fission fragments in @xmath3th and @xmath4pu . since the coulomb interaction is significant in heavy nuclei , both neutron and proton results will be discussed here . figure  [ fig : pes ] shows the potential energy curves of @xmath3th and @xmath4pu along the most probable fission pathway predicted , respectively , in refs . @xcite and @xcite . the calculations are performed with the unedf1 functional and lipkin - nogami pairing . both curves show secondary minima associated with the superdeformed fission isomers . for @xmath3th , a pronounced softness is observed at large quadrupole moments @xmath56b . in this region of collective space , a hyperdeformed third minimum is predicted by some skyrme functionals @xcite . in the next step , we consider five configurations along the fission pathway to perform detailed localization analysis . th and @xmath4pu calculated with unedf1 along the fission pathways @xcite . the configurations further discussed in figs .

[ fig : pes ] . ]    figure  [ fig : th232 ] shows neutron and proton densities and nlfs for @xmath3th along the fission pathway . the first column corresponds to the ground - state configuration where the densities do not show obvious internal structures . however , the neutron nlf shows three concentric circles and the proton nlf exhibits two maxima and an enhancement at the surface . the second column corresponds to the fission isomer . here two - center distributions begin to form in both nlfs . as discussed in @xcite , the distributions shown in the third column can be associated with a quasimolecular  third - minimum \" configuration , in which one fragment bears a strong resemblance to the doubly magic nucleus @xmath5sn . the forth column represents the configuration close to the scission point , where two well - developed fragments are present . as seen in the last column , at larger elongations the nucleus breaks up into two fragments , one spherical and another one strongly deformed shape .    ) and spatial localizations for the ground state of @xmath5sn ]    . [ fig : sn132 ]    , but for @xmath6zr . ]    to study the evolution of fission fragments , we perform hfb calculations for the presumed fission products @xmath5sn and @xmath6zr . the results are shown in figs .  [ fig : sn132 ] and [ fig : zr100 ] , respectively . th ( blue thick line ) , @xmath6zr ( green line ) , and @xmath5sn ( red line ) along the @xmath60 axis ( @xmath61 ) . the first , second , and third panel correspond to the configurations in the third , fourth and fifth columns of fig . [ fig : th232 ] , respectively . ] the nucleus @xmath5sn is a doubly - magic system with a characteristic shell structure . except for a small depression at the center of proton density in fig . [ fig : sn132](c ) , the nucleonic densities are almost constant in the interior . on the other hand , the nlfs show patterns of concentric rings with enhanced localization , in which the neutron nlf exhibits one additional maximum as compared to the proton nlf ; this is due to the additional closed neutron shell . as one can see , unlike in atomic systems @xcite , the total number of shells can not be directly read from the number of peaks in the nlf , because the radial distributions of wave functions belonging to different nucleonic shells vary fairly smoothly and are poorly separated in space . nevertheless , each magic number leaves a strong and unique imprint on the spatial localization . for @xmath6zr , the calculation is performed at the prolate configuration with @xmath62b , which corresponds to the lighter fission fragment predicted in @xcite . again , while the particle densities are almost constant in the interior , the neutron nlf shows two concentric rings and the proton nlf exhibits two centers in the interior and one enhanced ring at the surface . the characteristic patterns seen in the nlfs of fission fragments can be spotted during the evolution of @xmath3th in fig . [ fig : th232 ] . to show it more clearly , fig . [ fig : loc - line ] displays the nlfs of the three most elongated configurations of @xmath3th along the @xmath60-axis in fig . [ fig : th232 ] and compares them to those of @xmath5sn and @xmath6zr . to avoid normalization problems we present nlfs given by eq . ( [ eqn : localization ] ) , i.e. , without applying the density form factor . in figs . [ fig : th232](a ) and ( b ) , neutron and proton localizations at the center are around 0.5 , which is close to the fermi gas limit . this is expected for a fairly heavy nucleus . in the exterior , the localizations of two developing fragments match those of @xmath6zr and @xmath5sn fairly well . in panels ( c ) and ( d ) , the nlfs of @xmath3th grow in the interior ; this demonstrates that the nucleons become localized at the neck region . finally , in panels ( e ) and ( f ) , the fission fragments are separated and their nlfs are consistent with the localizations of @xmath6zr and @xmath5sn . but for the configurations of @xmath4pu indicated in fig . [ fig : pes ] . ] finally , let us consider the important case of @xmath4pu . recently , a microscopic modeling of mass and charge distributions in spontaneous fission of this nucleus was carried out in ref . @xcite . to give an insight into the evolution of @xmath4pu along its fission pathway , in fig . [ fig : pu240 ] we illustrate the nlfs of @xmath4pu . the transition to the reflection - asymmetric pathway begins at @xmath63b . it is seen that two nascent fragments start developing at this configuration . at larger elongations internal parity is broken and two fragments are formed with distinct shell imprints in the corresponding nlfs . in the last column , the rings of enhanced localization are almost closed , and the fragments are nearly separated . both examples , @xmath3th and @xmath4pu , show in a rather dramatic fashion that the nlfs can serve as excellent fingerprints of both the formation and evolution of cluster structures in fissioning nuclei .", "in this work , we presented mean - field developments pertaining to the theoretical description of nucleonic clustering in light and heavy nuclei using the concept of nucleon localizations . following a schematic ho analysis , we carried out self - consistent dft calculations for light @xmath40 nuclei and heavy fissioning systems . we demonstrated that the nucleon spatial localization is a superb indicator of clustering in light and heavy nuclei ; the characteristic patterns of nlfs can serve as fingerprints of the single - particle shell structure associated with cluster configurations . in particular , the nlfs of @xmath46be,@xmath31c , and @xmath2ne can serve as excellent indications of @xmath0 clustering . here , we found that realistic hf calculations are not that far from the results of the deformed ho model . in fissioning nuclei , shell effects of nascent fragments leave a strong imprint on the localization . our dft analysis of fission evolution of @xmath3th and @xmath4pu demonstrates that the fragments are formed fairly early in the evolution , well before scission . future applications of nlfs will include studies of @xmath0 clustering in medium - mass nuclei as well as the identification of fission yields . another interesting use of nlfs will be in the description and visualization of collective rotational motion , where spin - up and spin - down localizations are different due to the breaking of time - reversal symmetry . such a study will provide insights into the angular momentum dynamics in atomic nuclei . useful discussions with p .- reinhard and a.s . umar and the help of e. olsen are gratefully acknowledged . this work was supported by the u.s . department of energy , office of science under award numbers doe - de - na0002847 ( the stewardship science academic alliances program ) , de - sc0013365 ( michigan state university ) , and de - sc0008511 ( nuclei scidac-3 collaboration ) . an award of computer time was provided by the institute for cyber - enabled research at michigan state university . we also used computational resource provided by the national energy research scientific computing center ( nersc ) . 61ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ]  + 12$12  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty @noop _ _ , vol .

{"id": "nlin0304045", "section_names": ["introduction", "description of the model", "nontwist maps", "dynamical properties of the poincar map", "conclusions"], "document": ["during the past twenty years there has been increasing interest in the study of the coexisting regular and chaotic motions in hamiltonian systems with few degrees of freedom . a basic problem of study was the transition to chaos in two degrees of freedom hamiltonian systems which are slight perturbations of an integrable system , whose hamiltonian is nondegenerate . in order to ease this task , most of the results on the dynamics of such hamiltonian systems were obtained exploring the behaviour of a poincar map associated to a cross section in a fixed energy surface . a poincar map is an area preserving map ( apm ) defined on an annulus , that is , depending on @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a momentum  like coordinate and @xmath2 is an angular variable . considering the lift of such a map , namely computing the angle without the restriction modulo @xmath3 , one associates to an orbit @xmath4 the rotation number which is the limit :    @xmath5    if it exists . if @xmath6 is an irrational number , then the orbit densely fills an invariant circle ( kam circle ) , while an orbit of rational rotation number @xmath7  with @xmath8 coprime integers , @xmath9  is a @xmath10periodic orbit .    typical questions of mathematical and physical interest include the persistence of the kam circles after perturbation and determination of the threshold at which a circle of a given rotation number breaks up . the main results which answer these questions , such as the kam theorem , the poincar  birkhoff theorem , and the moser twist theorem , are based on the validity of the twist property of the area preserving map transforming @xmath11 , namely :    @xmath12    the twist condition implies the monotonic change of the rotation number @xmath6 with @xmath1 . the apm satisfying this condition is called monotonic twist map or simply a twist map . during the last twenty years the monotonic twist apms were studied extensively @xcite . consequently , their dynamics has gained almost complete understanding . in particular , this statement is a consequence of the late understanding that hamiltonian systems have universal behaviour which can be revealed by studying explicit symplectic maps of the plane . recently , due to the increasing number of physical phenomena that are modeled by nontwist maps , this class of dynamical systems has finally captured the attention of the scientific community . the few studies on nontwist maps existent in the literature have revealed an unexpected variety of local and global bifurcations : dimerized island chains , periodic orbits collision , separatrix reconnection , vortex islands @xcite .    in the present paper we study the poincar map associated to a periodic perturbation , both in space and in time , of a linear hamiltonian system . the dynamical system originates from a model of stellar pulsations previously introduced in @xcite for low mass stars ( @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the solar mass ) and extended to intermediate mass stars ( @xmath15 $ ] ) in @xcite . the latter work included some preliminary results concerning the nontwist character of the map . here , we show that this map is an apm with an oscillating rotation number function . in spite of the system being a perturbation of a linear hamiltonian , we argue that due to both the acquired nontwist character and the periodic character of the perturbation , the map presents the typical features of a generic class of nontwist apms , such as reconnection and meandering , with the nongeneric scenario of creation of vortices . the nonmonotonic property due to the triplication bifurcation is shown to be different from that exhibited by the cubic hnon map , which can be considered as the prototype of apms , and which undergoes a triplication followed by the twistless bifurcation . our study exploits the reversibility property of the initial system , which induces the time - reversal symmetry of the poincar map . the paper is organized as follows . in  2 we introduce our model of stellar pulsations . before getting into the detailed analysis of it , we consider worth recalling the most important features of nontwist maps . this is done in  3 . in this section we will also emphasize the consequences of both the triplication bifurcation and of the symmetry properties . later , in  4 we study the dynamics of our simple model of stellar pulsations . finally in section 5 we summarize our major findings and we draw our conclusions .", "pulsating stars are perfect tests of the theory of stellar evolution since the comparison between the theoretical pulsational characteristics ( periods , amplitudes , and growth time scales ) and the observed ones can help substantially in the fine tuning of the stellar models . low- and intermediate - mass stars are prone to experience recurrent thermal instabilities and substantial mass loss during certain intervals of their evolution . moreover , a substantial amount of pulsating stars in the galaxy shows irregular behaviour and this makes them interesting targets in the field of dynamics systems . the present model embodies the essential of stellar oscillations by assuming an oscillatory driving originating in the stellar interior in the form of sinusoidal pressure waves . this model belongs to the family of the so - called one - zone models which treat the star as a rigid core surrounded by a dynamic , homogeneous gas shell . the pressure waves propagate through a transition zone characterized by a certain transmission coefficient until they hit the stellar envelope and dissipate . no back reaction of the outer layers on the inner ones is considered . the dissipation of the pressure waves induces a fluctuation in the radius and velocity of the outermost layer and this variability makes the object of our study . the variation of the interior radius , @xmath16 , around an equilibrium value , @xmath17 , is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the time in years and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the fractional amplitude and the frequency of the driving , respectively . in absence of any driving force , the equation of motion is    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the stellar mass and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the radius and pressure in the shell of mass @xmath26 , respectively . for convenience , we introduce the nondimensional variables @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the equilibrium stellar radius and    @xmath30 is the characteristic frequency of the star .    considering that the additional perturbative acceleration is proportional to the driving acceleration with a proportionality coefficient @xmath31 we obtain    @xmath32    and after some algebraic manipulation @xcite the final equation of motion reads    @xmath33    where the characteristic frequency of the system , @xmath34 results from the use of the dimensionless time unit and from the assumption that @xmath17 encompasses almost the entire stellar mass . it is defined as    @xmath35    in the action - angle coordinates @xmath0 resulting from the change @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the hamiltonian of the system is    @xmath38    the parameters of the system are @xmath39 , the total driving amplitude , @xmath20 , the fractional driving amplitude and @xmath34 , the characteristic frequency of the system . from the point of view of the parametric study , we take @xmath34 to be the most important parameter fixing the type of star to be studied and its evolutionary status . it is a measure of the ratio between the internal radius where the driving is produced and the equilibrium stellar radius . from the astrophysical perspective , we are interested in the dynamics of the system from eq.([eq : motion2 ] ) corresponding to @xmath40 , more exactly @xmath41 . this low value of @xmath34 is associated with evolved stages of intermediate mass stars , as it results from stellar evolutionary models @xcite . since we are interested in modeling the evolution of this type of stars , we fix @xmath34 during our simulations . we have performed a thorough parametric study in the space ( @xmath39,@xmath20 ) as it assures a fine tuning of the strength of the perturbation . as in @xcite , we are interested in @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which allow the perturbative approach .", "the prototype of nontwist area preserving maps is the quadratic standard map @xcite :    @xmath44    the twist condition is violated along the curve @xmath45 . for @xmath46 we get an integrable map , whose orbits lie on the circles of constant @xmath1 . the rotation number function is @xmath47 . the circle @xmath48 has the maximum rotation number @xmath49 . it is called the twistless circle or shearless circle . a slight perturbation leads to the persistence of the twistless circle and nearby circles having a diophantine rotation number  that is , an irrational number badly approximated by rationals @xcite . hence , the nontwist standard map , defined above , has an invariant circle of maximum rotation number among the rotation numbers of the nearby orbits . for a fixed perturbation parameter @xmath50 and for @xmath34 chosen in such a way that the map has a pair of poincar  birkhoff chains containing @xmath7-type periodic orbits , as @xmath34 varies the two chains approach each other and at a threshold @xmath51 the hyperbolic points of the two chains enter the twistless circle . this is called the reconnection threshold @xcite . at the reconnection threshold the two distinct hyperbolic orbits , of rotation number @xmath7 , are connected by heteroclinic arcs . there are many ways in which the monotonic twist condition can be violated . the vertical lines @xmath52 can be mapped into curves having a single extremum  quadratic twist @xcite  or multiple extrema  cubic @xcite , quartic @xcite or sinusoidal twist @xcite . moreover , it has been proved @xcite that whenever the elliptic fixed point of an apm of the plane passes through a triplication , a twistless bifurcation occurs or , equivalently , the rotation number as a function of the distance from the elliptic fixed point becomes a nonmonotonic function . the triplication of the elliptic fixed point of an apm @xmath53 of the plane , occurs at the value @xmath54 at which the multipliers of the elliptic point cross the values @xmath55 . at the triplication threshold @xmath56 an unstable period3 orbit emerges from the elliptic fixed point in both directions , that is for @xmath57 and for @xmath58 . as @xmath59 increases the elliptic point crosses the @xmath60 resonance and the triangular shape figure changes side after shrinking to elliptic fixed point ( figure [ tripl ] ) . the symmetry properties are very useful for the explanation of the behaviour exhibited by the system under study . we next recall some notions and results concerning time  reversal symmetry of a dynamical system @xcite . a system of differential equations    @xmath61    or equivalently , the vector field @xmath62 is called reversible if there is a smooth involution @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) such that @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the differential of the map @xmath24 . @xmath24 is called the reversor of the vector field @xmath62 . if @xmath67 is the flow of the vector field @xmath62 , then the reversibility means that @xmath68 . this is tantamount to say that the reflection of the trajectory @xmath69 is also an orbit of the system . a diffeomorphism @xmath70 is called reversible with respect to a smooth involution @xmath24 of @xmath71 if @xmath72 . if @xmath73 is an @xmath24-reversible diffeomorphism then @xmath74 is also an involution @xmath75 , and @xmath76 . this factorization of the map @xmath73 is very useful for the study of its dynamical properties . it can be shown that @xmath77 is a @xmath24-reversible map , too , @xmath78 . denote by @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and by @xmath81 the fixed point set of the involution @xmath82 . @xmath81 are called symmetry lines of the map @xmath73 . a point in the intersection @xmath83 is a periodic point of the map @xmath73 , whose period divides @xmath84 . the symmetry lines @xmath85 are transformed by @xmath77 into other symmetry lines in the following way :    @xmath86    in order to interpret the nontwist  type dynamics which will be encountered in our system when studying the triplication of the elliptic fixed point , we consider necessary to illustrate the twistless bifurcation in the case of the cubic hnon map    @xmath87    which has an elliptic fixed point @xmath88 that can be easily found . at @xmath89 this point undergoes a triplication , while at @xmath90 the saddle center collision occurs . in figure [ hentripl ] , we show that as @xmath59 increases beyond @xmath91 , the elliptic and hyperbolic period-3 orbits collide and disappear in a saddle  center bifurcation at @xmath92 . in order to better identify the twistless bifurcation  the birth of a twistless circle  in figure [ henrot1 ] we show the rotation number @xmath93 as a function of the points @xmath94 lying on the symmetry line @xmath95 of the cubic hnon map , which is a reversible map with respect to the reversor @xmath96 . more precisely , the rotation number is computed at the points @xmath97 and satisfying @xmath98 . figure [ henrot1 ] shows that between the triplication threshold and saddle  center collision threshold of the two period3 orbits , the twistless circle is the circle of rotation number @xmath99 ( the maximum points from right to left correspond to @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 ) . observe that as @xmath59 increases up to @xmath103 , the twistless circle moves away from the elliptic fixed point . much more important ( and difficult ) is to detect the location of the twistless circle after the collision  annihilation of the two period3 orbits . in order to get some insight into the manifestation of the twist propertiy beyond the threshold @xmath104 , we have computed numerically the rotation numbers for points starting near the elliptic fixed point of the cubic hnon map and on the symmetry line @xmath105 . the rotation number functions @xmath93 are plotted for @xmath106 , and some parameter values obtained varying @xmath59 in the direction given by the vector @xmath107 ( figure [ henrot2 ] ) . note that the cubic hnon map has a twistless circle of maximum rotation number among the rotation numbers of nearby orbits . varying the parameter @xmath59 as specified above , @xmath108 decreases as a result of the collision  annihilation of the orbits @xcite , and at some value , @xmath109 , the rotation number becomes decreasing . at this point the map is no longer nontwist . this is the reason why @xmath110 was called the threshold of the twistless bifurcation in @xcite where the above presented scenario was first presented although in the reverse order .", "due to the the complexity of the perturbative term of the hamiltonian of eq.([eq : ham ] ) , the associated system in eq.([eq : motion2 ] ) is analytically intractable . in order to get some insight into its dynamical behaviour , we study the poincar map ( in fact the stroboscopic map ) associated to this time - periodic hamiltonian system . the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath111 is globally degenerate , which means that @xmath112 . the dynamical consequence of this degeneracy is that all the orbits are periodic having the same period . this is in contrast to kam theory , where the unperturbed system is nondegenerate . we will show that after a periodic perturbation ( periodic in time and in space ) the corresponding poincar map exhibits local and global bifurcations which in some cases are typical of the class of nontwist apms which are perturbations of locally degenerate integrable apms of an annulus , while in other cases are not . since the system given in eq.([eq : motion2 ] ) is time - periodic of period @xmath113 , we define the function @xmath114 , @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the circle identified with the interval @xmath117 . hence , we have the autonomous system of differential equations :    @xmath118    we denote by @xmath119 its flow . @xmath119 associates to each triplet @xmath120 the position at the time moment @xmath121 of the orbit starting at @xmath122 from @xmath123 . the plane    @xmath124    is transversal to the flow and the map @xmath125 defined by @xmath126 is the associated poincar map . it is a classical result in dynamical systems theory that the poincar map associated to a one degree of freedom periodic time  dependent hamiltonian system is an apm . in order to interpret the dynamics displayed by the numerically computed poincar map , let us deduce some geometrical properties of this map . the vector field @xmath62 , associated to the system from eq.([eq : motionf ] ) ,    @xmath127    with ( @xmath128 ) , is reversible with respect to the involution @xmath129 , @xmath130 , that is :    @xmath131    the reversibility property ( [ revvf ] ) is equivalent to @xmath132 , @xmath133 , which means that @xmath134 the diffeomorphism @xmath119 is @xmath135reversible , because @xmath136 . the poincar map associated to the vector field @xmath62 is @xmath24reversible , with respect to the involution @xmath137 , @xmath138 . actually , notice that the reversor of the vector field @xmath62 is related to the involution @xmath24 by :    @xmath139    it is clear that the definition of reversible maps is fulfilled by @xmath140 :    @xmath141    the symmetry line useful in the analysis of the dynamical behaviour of the poincar map is @xmath142 , having the equation @xmath143 .    the poincar map @xmath144 has the elliptic fixed point @xmath145 . after a slight perturbation the fixed point persists as a symmetric elliptic fixed point of the reversible map @xmath146  it is a point @xmath147 . in order to reveal the nontwist property of the map @xmath140 we compute and visualize the effect of the map on different semi - lines emanating from the elliptic fixed point ( figure [ semilines ] ) . as it results from eq.([eq : rotation ] ) , the rotation number for the map @xmath144 is negative , more exactly @xmath148 . note that unlike the standard  like nontwist maps , here a line of constant @xmath2 is not mapped onto a parabola , that is a curve with a single extremum , but onto an oscillating curve , having many minima and maxima . this fact will lead to a different behaviour of our nontwist map , in comparison to the dynamical properties of nontwist standard  like mappings .

in figure [ selfrot ] . hence our map @xmath140 is a nontwist apm , whose rotation number function @xmath158 is oscillating , having more than one extremum , that is , more than one invariant circle whose rotation number is a local extremum . note that for the fixed parameter @xmath41 of the hamiltonian system of eq.([eq : motion2 ] ) , the associated poincar map @xmath140 has an elliptic fixed point which undergoes triplication . in figure [ bifcurve ] we represent the triplication curve @xmath159 .    in order to emphasize the significant differences in the phase portraits before and after the triplication point , we add that in figure [ tripl ] we illustrated the triplication bifurcation of the elliptic fixed point of the poincar map for @xmath41 , @xmath160 and @xmath161  panel _ ( a ) _  @xmath162  panel _ ( b ) _  and @xmath163  panel _ ( c)_. from the physical point of view it is only of interest the case in which @xmath20 is constant and equal to @xmath164 , and @xmath39 varies . thus , the considered pairs @xmath165 are located above the triplication curve . according to @xcite for this case a twistless circle can exist . comparing the rotation number associated to the cubic hnon map ( figures [ henrot1 ] and [ henrot2 ] ) and our poincar map ( figure [ selfrot ] ) , we conclude that the poincar map has an oscillating rotation number with a larger amplitude near the elliptic fixed point . this could be interpreted as a superposition of the nontwist property induced by triplication on the nontwist behaviour due to the periodic perturbation of the initial hamiltonian system . near the elliptic fixed point , the poincar map has a negative twist . the apparent discontinuities of the rotation number are due to the distance chosen between the points on @xmath105 whose rotation number is computed . while on the branch @xmath166 , a period3 orbit has no point , it has one on the other branch , @xmath167 . the orbit of a point on @xmath168 encircling the homoclinic loops of the hyperbolic period3 orbits can lead to an apparent discontinuity of the rotation number , although this function is continuous . the successive changes in the monotonicity of the map lead to a distinct nontwist behaviour in comparison with the known results reported for standard  like nontwist maps @xcite .      in our parametric study , we first considered the cases in which @xmath39 is small , in order to study in detail the departure of the system from the simple harmonic oscillator as this parameter is increased . we restricted the study of the poincar map to a rectangle limited by initial conditions close to physically reasonable values of the radius and velocity of the outer stellar layers . we focused on the creation of a typical phase - space structure of nontwist maps : a pair of dimerized island chains . this characteristic scenario of creation of new orbits in nontwist maps is illustrated in figure [ dimerized ] . panel _ a _ exhibits the phase portrait of the near  to  integrable map , where the elliptic fixed point is surrounded by invariant circles . at @xmath169 the poincar map has an invariant curve with three cusps ( figure [ dimerized]_b _ ) . each cusp is a point of a new periodic orbit created through a saddle - center bifurcation for @xmath170 : a stable and an unstable fixed point emanate from each cusp ( figure [ dimerized]_c _ ) . the homoclinic loop of every hyperbolic point surrounds the corresponding elliptic one . between two successive hyperbolic points ( in cyclic order ) there is a heteroclinic connection . this separatrix structure called dimerized island chain appears in red in figure [ dimerized]_c_. in figure [ selfrot]_d _ we have shown the self - rotation number @xmath171 for the case whose poincar map appears in figure [ dimerized]_c_. in the former figure , the plateau @xmath172 corresponding to @xmath173 represents the constant rotation number due to the newly created elliptic fixed point on @xmath168 . the dimerized island chain is also responsable for the minimum of @xmath171 around @xmath174 . generically , dimerized island chains of the same period exist in pairs and are born in stages . the second period3 dimerized island chain is created through the same bifurcation process at a higher value of @xmath39 ( figure [ dimerized]_d _ ) . in figure [ selfrot]_f _ , the small plateau of @xmath171 around @xmath175 explains the birth of the second dimerized island chain . between the two island chains the invariant circles are meanders , that is , the radius along such a circle is not a univoque function of the angle .    around the last born period3 dimerized island chain , a sequence of local and global bifurcations occurs . this is illustrated in figure [ global ] , where it can be seen that two independent orbits of the same period3 are created by saddle - center bifurcation . they evolve in such a way that , finally , they interact with the orbits which belong to the first dimerized island chain . as @xmath39 increases the newly born elliptic points approach the hyperbolic points of the dimerized chain . when @xmath39 reaches a value of 0.11725 a global bifurcation occurs : the newly created orbits interfere , and the hyperbolic points of the dimerized island chain become hyperbolic points with homoclinic eight - like orbits encircling the newly created elliptic points .    in order to show the successive births of period3 orbits as @xmath39 increases with @xmath176 fixed , we compute and visualize @xmath177 and @xmath178 , @xmath179 . this process was first illustrated in figure [ semilines]_a _ where @xmath168 and @xmath180 were represented . we show in figure [ symlines ] the connection between the symmetry properties of the map and the creation of periodic orbits . a saddle - center bifurcation occurs at the value of the parameter @xmath39 at which @xmath181 has a tangential contact with @xmath182 . the corresponding poincar map has for such an @xmath39 an invariant curve with cusps which represent the points of tangency . increasing the perturbation , the two symmetry lines intersect at two points , one being elliptic and the other , hyperbolic . a global bifurcation which is generic of nontwist maps is the so - called reconnection process , which is illustrated in figure [ multiham ] for the nontwist multi - harmonic standard map @xcite :    @xmath183,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath184 , @xmath185 and different values of @xmath34 . on the two sides of a twistless circle , two poincar  birkhoff chains ( necklaces of consecutive elliptic and hyperbolic points ) , having the same rotation number , approach each other ( figure [ multiham]_a _ ) . at a given threshold , which is called the reconnection threshold , their hyperbolic points are connected by heteroclinic arcs ( figure [ multiham]_b _ ) . varying the parameter of the system further , two dimerized island chains emerge from the configuration created by the reconnection ( figure [ multiham]_c _ ) . these chains are separated by meanders .    in our case , we witness the creation of the nongeneric vortices or dipoles @xcite . figure [ vortices1 ] displays the birth of the first chain of vortices . as @xmath39 increases , either @xmath186 or @xmath187 intersects tangentially at a new point located at a radius larger than in the previous cases . as a consequence , new period3 dimerized island chains are created after @xmath39 crosses the value of tangential contact . however , each second dimerized island chain has a different creation mechanism . unlike the previous case , the hyperbolic point of the first dimerized island chain bifurcates into two hyperbolic points in the transversal direction . in this process , a new elliptic point is born on the symmetry line . these hyperbolic points are connected by three heteroclinic arcs : one surrounding the previously existing elliptic point , another surrounding the new elliptic point , and the third one separating the two elliptic points . thus , a pair of vortices is created .    as @xmath39 increases , the process of formation of chains of vortices continues for larger radii ( figure [ vortices2 ] ) . note that if the elliptic orbits of one chain of vortices intersect @xmath168 , then the next one , which is created external to it , has a pair of elliptic points on the symmetry line @xmath188 . the invariant rotational circle interpolating the hyperbolic points of the chain of vortices is the twistless circle . in figure [ vortices2 ] it can be seen that such circles pass almost through the extremum of the symmetry lines @xmath181 . as already said , the formation of vortices is not generic and therefore the twistless circle that appears between them is not either . our system is a clear example of weak chaos , where the perturbation itself creates a separatrix network at a certain @xmath189 ( the dimerized island chains and the vortices chains ) and then destroys it as @xmath39 increases by producing regions of chaotic dynamics . the case of strong chaos implies that the unperturbed hamiltonian intrinsically has separatrix structures and the perturbation just clothes them in thin stochastic layers . in both cases , the merging of the stochastic layers in the phase space may give rise to a single chaotic network called stochastic web . the larger @xmath39 is , the wider is the stochastic web . inside the cells of the web , there exists a set of islands of regular motion called invariant web - tori @xcite whose dimensions are inversely proportional to the perturbation strength : for strong perturbations , they are engulfed by the stochastic sea . our system presents this kind of behaviour , which is presented in figure [ chaotic ] . it has long been known ( and not yet well understood ) that the boundaries of the islands of regular motion can be `` sticky '' , meaning that chaotic orbits can spend a long time close to the islands and then escape in the chaotic sea . this phenomenon was observed already in @xcite and was later called _ stickiness _ @xcite . in general , it can be explained by the transformation of the web - tori into web - cantori as the perturbation is increased . contrary to the absolute barriers constituted by the invariant tori , the cantori are only temporary barriers . that is , the orbits close to the main islands can reach the chaotic sea when they encounter the gaps in the cantori , which happens after an indefinite time interval . recent works @xcite also suggest that the stickiness is due to the formation of higher - order resonant islands in the transition region between the main island and the chaotic sea ( figure [ particular ] ) . the presence of these so - called _ dynamical traps _ appears to be generic for hamiltonian systems and therefore their existence critically determines the large - timescale behaviour of such systems . in this context , a behaviour extremely similar to sticky orbits has been shown to result from simulations of stellar variability using full hydrodynamical codes carried on significantly long time - intervals . in the absence of a better explanation , it was attributed to long - term ( secular ) nonlinear effects in the stellar envelopes . in a previous work @xcite , we have shown that our simple model recovers such a behaviour as it is generic of hamiltonian systems . we also presented clear examples of sticky orbits together with an extensive discussion of their implications in the framework of the classification of variable stars . therefore , we mention here only the fact that if a hamiltonian approach is intrinsic to the phenomenon of stellar variability , we can expect that different categories of variable stars ( classified according to their amplitude , frequency , irregularity ) may be viewed under a more unifying perspective than it is presently considered . moreover , considering that the sporadic excursions of the sticky orbits to the chaotic sea translate into high velocities of the outer layers , mass loss is very likely to occur , again in accordance with the observations . another important and distinctive feature of the phase portrait of nontwist maps is the existence of _ meanders _ , as it was mentioned before when discussing figure [ dimerized]_d_. meanders are created between two successively born dimerized island chains or between two chains of vortices . in nontwist standard  like maps they become usual invariant curves after the reconnection of the two chains . for the sake of clarity , we illustrate next the relationship between the meanders and the reconnection process for our map . in figure [ meander ] we show the creation of meanders from the reconnection of the poincar - birkhoff chains of period 34 . in the case of the standard nontwist map @xcite , in the reconnection of poincar - birkhoff chains of even periodic orbits , periodic points of the chains having the same stability type are aligned in phase . in other words , to an elliptic ( hyperbolic ) point of one chain corresponds below or above also an elliptic ( hyperbolic ) point . due to this alignment , the reconnection is nongeneric and corresponds to a hyperbolic - hyperbolic collision leading to the formation of vortices . in our case , the two poincare - birkhoff chains of even period ( period 34 ) have periodic points of opposite stability type which approach each other in their way to reconnection ( figure [ meander]_a _ ) . therefore , the reconnection is generic and in the subsequent dimerized islands chains , hyperbolic - elliptic collision occurs . moreover , after the reconnection , the twistless circle turns from a graph of a function of the angular variable to a meander ( figure [ meander]_b _ ) . this meander is slightly visible in figure [ chaotic]_b_.    meanders appear to be robust invariant circles acting also as separatrices between distinct regions of chaotic dynamics . for stronger perturbations , their destruction allows the chaotic orbits to reach other stochastic regions previously separated by the meander . this behaviour was observed in nontwist standard - like maps @xcite , but until now there is no explanation for this robustness .", "in the present work we have extended the preliminary results of ref . @xcite concerning the dynamics of a forced oscillator as a model of irregular stellar pulsations . the driving is characterized by two parameters , the fractional amplitude of the internal perturbation @xmath20 and the total amplitude of the driving @xmath39 . our aim was to undertake a more detailed analysis of the transition to the nontwist property in the associated poincar map . we have demonstrated that for a given @xmath190 there exists an @xmath159 that corresponds to a triplication of the central elliptic fixed point of the map . as we were interested in values of the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath39 above the triplication curve , the nontwist character of the map was undoubtly present @xcite . special attention was devoted to the process of formation of periodic orbits and to periodic - orbits collision . the reversibility of the poincar map and consequently , the symmetry properties allowed a clear identification of the structure of the periodic points . more precisely , the evolution and the intersections of the symmetry lines of the system provided good tracers of the steps of creation of dimerized island chains and vortex chains . we strongly argued in favor of these particularities of the map being entirely due to the superposition of two factors : the nonmonotonicity of the rotation number function induced by the triplication of the elliptic fixed point and the nonmonotonicity of the same function due to the oscillating perturbation . the latter feature admits alternative occurrence of maxima and minima , where the twist condition is violated . this translates into the minima and maxima of the symmetry lines which transform the invariant curves passing through them into twistless circles . using these elements , we have followed the local and global bifurcations until the formation of stochastic layers around separatrices together with the associated sticky orbits . we have proved that the reconnection of even periodic orbits is generic by following the reconnection of two poincar - birkhoff chains of period 34 . from the astrophysical point of view , we have dwelled on the implications of the sticky regions and of the interplay between stochastic and regular regions in the framework of the analysis of stellar variability . in order to provide quantitative characterization of sticky orbits in the framework of stellar variability , we shall concentrate in the future on the causes and probabilistic estimates of the stickiness mechanism . _ acknowledgements . _ this work has been

ray - tracing techniques were applied to cosmological n - body simulations to analyze the magnitude of the effects of the inhomogeneities and found small deviations @xcite , implying that the inhomogeneities are compensated along the line of sight . if this assumption is relaxed , very different results are achieved . if light travels preferentially through an underdense medium , as it seems to be the case in the web structure we see , different distances are derived . this point was raised by bolejko @xcite and meures & bruni @xcite . moreover , in the case that some lines of sight are blocked due to opaque structures of high density , underdense lines would be preferred @xcite . the size of the light beam is the key issue . for beams with sizes on arcminute scales , the dispersion in the hubble diagram due to matter fluctuations can be corrected @xcite due to the shearing of images . as a supernova beam has an angular size of @xmath1 @xmath2 arcsec at a redshift @xmath3 , this correction can not be applied , since shear maps are smoothed on arcminute scales @xcite . furthermore , the typical size of a beam in an n - body simulation is around hundreds of kiloparsecs , while a supernova has 1 a.u . size ( @xmath4kpc ) . non - linear terms in the mean magnification must be considered , which can shift the mean by a non - negligible amount . this is extremely dependent on the matter distribution along the line of sight on scales not covered by perturbation theory or in n - body simulations . in particular , perturbation theory predicts a variance which diverges as the beam size becomes small which means it loses predictive power  @xcite . it was shown in  @xcite that narrowing the beam size in n - body simulations shifts the probability distribution function dramatically , implying that most narrow beams probe very underdense lines of sight which are compensated by relatively few of high density . of course , these simulations can only probe beam sizes which are many of orders of magnitude larger than required , so one can only speculate as to the actual probability distribution function .    given this uncertainty in knowing the correct distribution function to use , there is uncertainty in modelling the magnification of such narrow beams , which relies on the matter density and expansion rate along the beam . in this paper we follow an observational approach . we choose four different approximations to probe inhomogeneities with observations @xcite . three of them can change the cosmological parameters by several percent : the dyer  roeder ( dr ) approximation @xcite , the weak lensing approximation with uncompensated density along the line of sight @xcite , and the flux - averaging approximation @xcite . we also propose a new approximation which takes into account the different expansion rates along the line of sight .    in our analyses we use two samples of sne ia . the first is the union2.1 compilation data @xcite , comprising 580 sne ia calibrated with the salt2 light curve fitter @xcite . in this sample we add a high - redshift supernova scp-0401 detected at @xmath5 by rubin _ _ @xcite . for convenience , we call the set of 581 sne as the union2.1 compilation data . the second sample comprises 288 sne ia of the first - year sloan digital sky survey ii @xcite , where we consider the data calibrated with the mlcs2k2 light curve fitter @xcite . we call this sample the sdss compilation data .    a possible way to disentangle the effects of the inhomogeneities is to consider joint analyses with a sample with a different degeneracy in the parameter space . so , we also consider 19 @xmath6 measurements from differential age of passively evolving galaxies @xcite . in order to deal with a tension between different measurements of the hubble constant @xmath7 , we also consider two measurements for @xmath7 : @xmath8 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 @xcite , where the latter is in agreement with the latest measurement from _ planck _ @xcite . the paper is organized as follows . in sec . [ sec_lp ] we give a brief overview of light propagation in a general spacetime . in sec . [ sec_th ] the different approximations to deal with the light propagation are presented . in sec . [ sec_res ] we present the samples used and the results obtained from the statistical analyses . we finish the paper in sec . [ sec_conc ] with the conclusions .", "in this section we give a brief overview of light propagation in a generic spacetime . the idea is to derive the sachs optical equations @xcite used in the derivation of the approximations discussed in the next section . we refer the reader to @xcite for detailed explanations .    to describe light propagation the geometric optics approximation @xcite is assumed . light rays are bundles of irrotational null geodesics @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the affine parameter and @xmath13 labels the geodesics , so the tangent vector @xmath14 obeys    @xmath15}=0 . \\label{nullgeod}\\ ] ]    the connecting vector @xmath16 which links neighbouring geodesics and gives the physical shape of the bundle satisfies the geodesic deviation equation    @xmath17    we can project the above equation in a screen space orthogonal to the ray direction as    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the screen projection of the riemann tensor , and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) are unit vectors spanning the screen space . @xmath22 can be decomposed in the following way    @xmath23    with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . @xmath26 is called the ricci focusing and @xmath27 is called the weyl focusing . the former is generated by matter inside the beam while the latter is generated by matter outside the beam that induces a non - vanising weyl tensor inside the beam . we can manipulate eq . ( [ eq_eta ] ) and express it as a function of the optical scalars @xmath28 and @xmath29 , called the null expansion and the null shear respectively , which gives the sachs equations @xcite    @xmath30    the null expansion is related to the cross - sectional area @xmath31 of the light rays as @xcite    @xmath32    since the angular diameter distance @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath34 , we obtain    @xmath35    a last step is needed before we move to particular approximations , which is the transformation of the affine parameter @xmath12 to the observable redshift @xmath36 . for observers with four - velocity @xmath37 , the redshift is given by    @xmath38    this implies that @xcite    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the observed expansion rate along the line of sight and @xmath41 is the spatial direction of observation . from these equations we see that assumptions must be specified about the matter distribution and the expansion rate along the line of sight .", "we now focus our attention to four approximations that try to take into account the effects of the inhomogeneities . as they have different premisses it is interesting to see how cosmological parameters are affected by them . let us describe them starting with the dr approximation . the dr approximation @xcite assumes that light can propagate preferentially by underdense lines of sight . this fact , first noted by zeldovich @xcite , is incorporated in the model through the introduction of the smoothness parameter @xmath42 in @xmath43 . for @xmath44 we have the same amount of matter as in the homogeneous case , so it is called the filled beam . in the other extreme , if light propagates in vacuum we have @xmath45 , which is the empty beam . therefore , for a partial clumping , the smoothness parameter varies between 0 and 1 . the approximation also requires that the shear is zero and the expansion along the line of sight is the same as in the homogeneous case ( @xmath46 ) . in short , the dr approximation states that light propagates in a homogeneous universe with less matter inside the beam which is redistributed to clumps . it is based in the fact that the probability of a typical line of sight to encounter a high - mass halo is low and if this happens strong lensing can occur , and the supernova would be removed of the statistical analysis , or the supernova is blocked and we would not see it . so , it is a simple way to quantify a possible bias in the statistical analyses using sne ia .    adopting these assumptions and restricting our attention to a flat @xmath0cdm model ( see @xcite for the influence of a quintessence fluid ) , we derive the dr equation    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the matter density parameter today and the redshift dependence of @xmath42 encodes the fact that we expect the universe to be more homogeneous in the past @xcite .    in order to compare this approximation with the sne ia data , the relation between the luminosity distance and the angular diameter distance @xmath49 is used , which is known as the etherington principle @xcite . writing in terms of the adimensional luminosity distance @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the speed of light , we have    @xmath52    which satisfies the initial conditions @xmath53 the terms @xmath54 , @xmath55 end @xmath56 are functions of the cosmological parameters , expressed in terms of the redshift by    @xmath57\\omega_{\\rm m }   + 2(1-\\omega_{\\rm m})(1+z)^{-3}. \\\\ \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the dr approximation has been criticized by some authors . the first came from photon flux conversation put forward by weinberg @xcite , where divergence from underdense regions are compensated by convergence of clumpy regions . the question remains open , since following works arrived at different conclusions @xcite . more recently , rsnen @xcite questioned the dr approximation , but relied that the density along the line of sight is compensated and there are no selection effects , which are not necessarily the case @xcite . in fact , a method was developed in @xcite to take into account the blocked lines of sight , where halos above a minimum threshold do not allow light beams to cross them . as a result , one ends up with a specific form for @xmath58 given by the matter not locked in clumps . as the universe was more homogeneous in the past , a smaller deviation compared to the standar dr model is derived . therefore , we will keep our attention to the standard , and most extreme , dr approximation . the weak lensing approximation considers perturbations to a homogeneous background where the line element in newtonian gauge is    @xmath59,\\ ] ]    @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the bardeen potentials . the angular diameter distance in this case is @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the homogeneous angular diameter distance and @xmath64 is the negative of convergence given as an integral of the homogeneous distance and the perturbed potentials . recently , bolejko @xcite found out a relation between the weak lensing and dr approximations , firstly discussed by futamase and sasaki @xcite . they provide the same results when the smoothness parameter has the following form    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the mean of density fluctuations along the line of sight .    in this formulation , the standard weak lensing approach predicts that the inhomogeneities are compensated along the line of sight and @xmath66 is of order @xmath67 . however , that is not necessarily the case , since the density fluctuations are not randomly distributed but form a cosmic web . in this case the value of @xmath66 can be much higher and very different distances would be derived . from now on we consider light travelling in an underdense medium so that @xmath68 , and we constrain the modulus of it . note that light travelling in overdense medium is possible and was preferred by union2 compilation data @xcite as shown in @xcite for an extended dr approximation , but a correspondence with weak lensing is not available yet . the flux - averaging approximation was developed by wang and collaborators @xcite and it is based on the flux conservation of gravitational lensing as emphasized by weinberg @xcite . the idea is that considering a large number of standard candles in the same redshift , the average magnification is one . in this way , the process should reduce the bias produced by gravitational lensing . however , note that effects due to blocked lines of sight or uncompensated lines of sight in average are not contemplated in this method .    in this method the errors are suposed to be gaussian in flux , not in magnitudes . the flux - averaging method minimizes the @xmath69 in a model - dependent way . here , we present how to flux - average for uncorrelated errors . first , one needs to convert the observed magnitude into `` fluxes '' @xmath70    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the observed magnitude and @xmath73 is the measured distance . the next step is to remove the redshift dependence , for a set of cosmological parameters @xmath74 , by defining the `` absolute luminosities '' \\{@xmath75 }    @xmath76    for each redshift bin @xmath77 , the flux - average for the absolute luminosities @xmath78 in the mean redshift @xmath79 is    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the number of bins . therefore , the binned flux in the @xmath77-th redshift bin is    @xmath82    the statistical analysis is done now with    @xmath83 ^ 2}{\\sigma_{f , i}^2},\\ ] ]    where the errors @xmath84 are the root mean square of the unbinned errors divided by the square root of the number of points in each bin . one criticism to the standard dr approach is that the change in the focusing due to less matter inside the beam must be compensated to curvature and shear terms in order to provide the same local expansion rate as in the homogeneous case @xcite , what is not expected physically . thus , one way to improve the modelling is to allow a different expansion rate along the line of sight . there are several possibilities to implement that , but for simplicity we use only one function , a modified smoothness parameter @xmath85 , to describe the effect . we write the hubble parameter along the line of sight as    @xmath86 ^\\frac{1}{2 } ,    \\label{hubblezfrw2}\\ ] ]    where an extra curvature term appears because light propagates in an underdense medium which expands faster . we consider a constant smoothness parameter which provides the highest difference from the standard flat @xmath0cdm case . for different approaches see @xcite . note that eq . ( [ hubblezfrw2 ] ) is considered only for the sne light beams propagating on average in an underdense medium . observations which infer the averaged @xmath6 , as it is the case for the cosmic chronometers data , must be compared to the usual homogeneous hubble parameter .", "+   +   +    in this section we perform statistical analyses to constrain the parameters of the models described above . in order to have a broad coverage of different observational probes , two samples of sne ia are considered calibrated with different light curve fitters . the first is constituted of 581 sne ia from @xcite , the union2.1 compilation data calibrated with salt2 @xcite . the second sample has 288 sne ia calibrated with the mlcs2k2 fitter @xcite called the sdss sample .    except for the flux - averaging scheme , the set of parameters @xmath87 are constrained by maximizing the posterior probability , which is equivalent , for gaussianly distributed measurements , to minimize the @xmath69 function @xmath88 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the theoretical distance modulus , @xmath90 is the observed distance modulus and @xmath91 its respective uncertainty . we treat @xmath7 as a nuisance parameter and we marginalize over it . we also consider 19 @xmath6 measurements from differential age of passively evolving galaxies , also called the cosmic chronometers data @xcite . this sample was used to constrain several cosmological parameters in @xcite , and in addition with @xmath6 from bao measurements to investigate dark energy models @xcite . we do not use the @xmath6 from bao measurements since it is not clear how the inhomogeneities can affect such measurements . although expected to be small due to the inference from large scales where the effects may average out , we decided to be more conservative . the statistical analyses follow as the same for sne ia , with the @xmath69 given by    @xmath92 ^ 2,\\ ] ]    where @xmath93 is the theoretical hubble parameter , @xmath94 is the observed hubble parameter , and @xmath95 its respective uncertainty . again , we marginalize over @xmath7 with a gaussian prior following ref . @xcite .    in order to deal with a tension between measurements of @xmath7 , two values are used in the analyses . the first is based on _ hubble space telescope _ measurements : @xmath96 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 @xcite . the second is based on a median statistics analysis of 553 values for @xmath7 : @xmath97 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 @xcite . the last value is in agreement with the latest measurement from _ planck _ @xcite .      in fig . [ fig1](a)-(c ) we display the results of the statistical analyses considering 581 from the union2.1 compilation data @xcite , 19 @xmath6 measurements @xcite and @xmath7(cr ) @xcite for a flat @xmath0cdm model . it is shown that the smoothness parameter is weakly constrained with sne ia data and the addition of the @xmath6 measurements do not improve the limits due to the degeneracy of the data in the parameter space . for the sne ia data only , the parameters are constrained to be in the intervals within the 95.4% confidence level @xmath98 : @xmath99 and @xmath100 . as expected , the @xmath6 can only improve the constraints through a joint analysis @xcite , since the expansion rate in the dr approximation is the same of a homogeneous model . the restrictions obtained in the joint analysis are : @xmath101 and @xmath102 @xmath98 .    in fig . [ fig1](d)-(f ) it is shown the results when a higher value for @xmath7(r ) @xcite is considered . in this case the @xmath6 constraints are slightly shifted to the left allowing better constraints to @xmath42 in the joint analysis , which provides @xmath103 and @xmath104 @xmath98 .    at this point it is interesting to compare these results with previous analyses . our results are fully compatible with constraints based on analyses involving sne ia , compact radio sources , gamma - ray bursts and @xmath6 measurements @xcite . the same trend noticed in @xcite remains , where a larger sample of sne ia weakens the constraints over the smoothness parameter . shortly , the dr approximation can handle with all observations so far . on the other hand , the results are not in agreement with a recent analysis involving sne ia , gamma - ray bursts and @xmath6 measurements @xcite . so , it is necessary to understand the difference between their results and ours . first of all , our sne ia constraints are very different , although we added only one high - redshift supernova . we ascribe this difference possibly by a lack of convergence in their mcmc analysis , which is in general problematic when the best fit is near the borders of the considered interval . note that @xmath44 is only allowed at @xmath105 ( their table iii ) , which is the cosmic concordance model . second , as emphasized in @xcite , the @xmath6 measurements are completely independent of @xmath42 , since in the dr approximation light propagates in a universe with local density @xmath106 , but the same expansion rate of a perfectly homogeneous universe . thus , their equation ( 22 ) is not valid . actually , it is the breakdown of this equation which turns possible to use consistency tests @xcite to see whether the effects of the inhomogeneities in light propagation are significant @xcite . to finish , although the use of gamma - ray bursts may give a lever arm in the hubble diagram to discern among cosmological models , caution is needed , since the understanding of the phenomenological relations used to calibrate them is still incipient . .limits to @xmath42 and @xmath48 in the dr approximation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      now we compare how the different approximations impact other cosmological parameters , in our case @xmath48 . figure [ fig5 ] shows the results for the four different approximations and also when the inhomogeneities are neglected , the standard case . in fig . [ fig : first_fig15 ] the results for the union2.1 compilation data @xcite are shown . the behavior for the dr , the weak lensing , and the modified dr approximations are expected . we see that all of them allow higher values for @xmath48 . as the combination @xmath107 is constrained , considering values such that @xmath108 implies higher values for @xmath48 . on the other hand , the flux - averaging approximation prefers lower values for @xmath48 . in general , regardless the approximation considered , the posteriors are broader , which implies larger errors in @xmath48 . these errors are not negligible , but do not put a severe problem to the standard model at this moment . however , they can have a larger impact in joint analyses , since the intersection in the parameter space may be different . figure [ fig : second_fig15 ] shows the comparison for the different approximations with the sdss compilation data @xcite . the dr , the weak lensing , and the modified dr approximations showed the same pattern , where higher values for @xmath48 are compatible with the data compared to the standard case . in the case of the flux - averaging approximation , much lower values were derived compared to the union2.1 compilation data @xcite . it is this shift which turns possible that this approximation to be compatible with the @xmath6 measurements @xcite .    while the effects discussed here can not change our whole view about the way cosmological data are interpreted , the trend is they become more and more important due to several planned and ongoing surveys which will discover thousands of supernovae", "we have investigated the effects of small - scale inhomogeneities in light propagation of narrow beams in different approximations . we have studied four approximations , the dr approximation @xcite , the weak lensing approximation @xcite , the flux - averaging approximation @xcite , and a modified dr approximation . we used the 581 sne ia from the union2.1 compilation data @xcite , 288 sne ia from the sdss compilation data @xcite , 19 @xmath6 measurements and two values for @xmath7 @xcite .    for the union2.1 compilation data @xcite all approximations are in agreement with observational data . basically , the approximations incur in higher errors for the matter density parameter @xmath48 . although the difference from the perfectly homogeneous case is not catastrophic , the effects must be important in order to achieve accurate results . on the other hand , the 288 sne ia from the sdss compilation data @xcite prefers more exotic models compared to @xmath0cdm @xcite . so we have analyzed the effects of the inhomogeneities in this sample together with @xmath6 measurements @xcite and two values for @xmath7 @xcite in order to see whether a better agreement between different samples can be obtained . for the dr , the weak lensing , and the modified dr approximations the tension remains , although it can be slightly alleviated for higher values for @xmath7 . however , as the flux - averaging approximation provides lower values for @xmath48 , the tension disappears irrespective of the value of @xmath7 considered in the marginalization . in summary , the non - linear effects of the inhomogeneities in narrow beams , in addition to bias and selection effects may play an important role in the estimation of cosmological parameters , as well as the determination of the nature of dark energy or a need to introduce a different gravitational theory on large scales . therefore , efforts in modelling such effects together with observational scrutiny are vital to build a consistent picture of the universe . l. amendola and s. tsujikawa , _ dark energy  theory and observations _ ( cambridge university press , cambridge , england , 2010 ) ;

maxwell s equations and their inability to handle a lot of situations that in the common practice are instead considered trivial . the main criticism is that the system is overdetermined , i.e. , solutions must satisfy too many constraints without enjoying the necessary degrees of freedom . the discovery of these inconsistencies was made about ten years ago , when i started a review process of the theory of electromagnetism . the underlying motivation was based on some unsatisfactory marginal aspects . nevertheless , in the development of the analysis , these aspects became much more relevant . the result was a renewed model ( see @xcite , @xcite ) that strictly includes the solutions to maxwell s equations , thus providing the description of a wider range of events . in particular , non - dissipating compact - support electromagnetic waves , travelling straightly at the speed of light , are very easily modelled by the new set of equations . the importance of this fact is high if we realize that one of the reasons for the split of physics into the classical and the quantum versions is actually the impossibility to represent photons via maxwell s equations in vacuum . indeed , an initially localized wave - packet , whose fields are successively modelled by maxwell s equations , is soon destroyed , diffusing all around .    it is not my intention to further self - celebrate here the potentiality of my extension and the possible implications in the study of the quantum world by a classical approach . for further insight the reader is referred to @xcite .    criticizing maxwell s equations is dangerous . one is immediately relegated as heretic . on the other hand , the power of mathematical reasoning can not be ignored . after publishing my first report ( @xcite ) , i was contacted by dr . w. engelhardt ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . he was puzzled by the excessive number of constraints that a maxwellian solution has to satisfy . by trying to impose all of them one inevitably comes to contradictions . usually , engineers follow a certain computational path in order to come out with solutions mimicking as much as possible reality . when a reasonable output is obtained they do not feel it is necessary to check if further restrictions apply . it is like storing all of @xmath1 objects inside @xmath2 boxes ( one object per box ) . there are several paths one can follow , but none is going to be resolutive . a dirty trick is to hide the last object ( whatever it is ) and show to the public one of the allowed combinations .    due to its linearity , it is easy to prove that the maxwell s system must have , under very mild assumptions , at most one solution ( uniqueness ) . the work of engelhardt shows that there may be different solutions to the same given problem . how can this happen ? in reality , the problem imposes @xmath1 constraints and turns out to be impossible ; however , by applying @xmath2 steps of the solution process one can actually get something meaningful . that `` something '' depends on the constraint that has been discarded . engelhardt writes the electromagnetic unknowns in terms of the potentials @xmath3 and @xmath4 and notes that different conclusions are reached according to the choice of the _ gauge _ , notwithstanding that the gauge has no influence on the expression of maxwell s equations . the conclusion that there are different solutions contradicts uniqueness . this nonsense can only be justified by deducing that none of the solutions proposed is correct , not because of a mistake in the computation , but because they result from an incomplete procedure and that a full resolution does not exists . this observation casts dark clouds on the maxwellian theory .    in this short note i would like to study in the easiest possible way a very simple problem : the charge of a capacitor . solving the wave equation for the electric field i get a solution incompatible with ampre s law . a similar question was examined in @xcite via retarded potentials . there the author points out inconsistencies between the wave equation and the faraday s law . hence , the analysis of the distribution of an electromagnetic field inside a capacitor depends on the way the problem is presented . in the quasi - stationary regime ( current flow is relatively slow ) the magnetic contribution is usually neglected . if higher modes are invoked , the full system of maxwell s equations must be involved . in this fashion , according to the nature of the phenomenon , one picks up the right tool to operate , consisting of @xmath2 relations chosen on purpose . very often the outcome is convincing . if little troubles emerge they are attributed to some unavoidable inaccuracy dictated by the limits of the model . however , the question is deeper : the model itself is not mathematically correct when taken with all its constraints . one could find rigorous mathematical outcomes by getting rid of one constraint at the time , but at this point there is no a unique theory of electromagnetism .    in @xcite , the limit of the maxwellian theory is attributed to the presence of nonhomogeneous terms . in my opinion , as rigorously analyzed in @xcite , even homogeneous maxwell s equations in vacuum are not trouble free , displaying an extremely reduced space of solutions . the equations in this case are affected by an almost total lack of initial displacements satisfying both the conditions @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( see my viewpoint in @xcite , chapter 1 ) . it must be honestly pointed out however that the solution s space of maxwell s equations is far from being empty . there are in fact remarkable situations where the model has mathematical meaning and matches reality . solutions seem however to belong to a kind of _ meagre set_. this set looks closed , connected and with zero measure ( with respect to standard topologies in functional spaces ) , though i have no rigorous proof of these statements . common applications , as the one studied here , belong to the _ complementary set _ and can not be approximated by maxwellian solutions . my conclusion is that , despite of the extraordinary achievements of the technological world , maxwell s equations are inefficacious in most practical cases , unless they are accompanied by rough and non well justified mathematical adaptations .", "in order to make the problem as simplest as possible let us suppose we are in vacuum , though this restriction is not necessary . maxwell s equations include the ampre s law : @xmath7 where we set the current source term equal to zero . moreover , we have the faraday s law of induction : @xmath8 and the two following conditions on the divergence of the fields : @xmath9 @xmath10 putting all together , there are six unknowns and eight equations .    relations ( [ fde1 ] ) and ( [ fdb1 ] ) are often taken as an optional . for example , if one assumes that @xmath5 holds at initial time @xmath11 , it follows from ( [ fem1 ] ) that the divergence of the electric field must be zero at all times . it is enough to compute the divergence of both terms in equality ( [ fem1 ] ) to obtain : @xmath12 the above passage is mathematically correct . however , it is source of big mistakes . from expression ( [ dfem1 ] ) we presume that it is not necessary to check whether equation @xmath5 is maintained during time evolution . nevertheless , it would be wise not to be much confident on this fact . we shall demonstrate through a simple example that @xmath13 can instead spontaneously assume values different from zero , mining the foundations of the ampre s law in vacuum . we assume that our functions are regular , so that they can be differentiated as many times as needed . it is easy to recover the following equation regarding the time variation of the electromagnetic energy : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the poynting vector . to get ( [ poyn ] ) one scalarly multiplies ( [ fem1 ] ) by @xmath16 , ( [ fbm1 ] ) by @xmath17 , and uses notions of standard calculus . the electric field satisfies the wave equation : @xmath18 which is obtained by observing that : @xmath19 therefore , relation ( [ fde1 ] ) is necessary in order to get ( [ wave ] ) . the wave equation also holds for the magnetic field @xmath17 . in addition , there are initial conditions and boundary constraints . the discussion of these is a crucial issue . there are several ways to impose boundary conditions . commonly , a list of possible choices is presented ( see , e.g. , @xcite , section i.5 , or @xcite , section 11.6.1 ) . one can then pick up the ones that better fit the phenomenon to be studied .    as in the case of the wave equation ( [ wave ] ) , there is the tendency to transform the first - order system ( [ fem1 ] ) , ( [ fbm1 ] ) into a second - order one . playing with second - order derivatives in the space variables is much easier and the _ well - posedness _ of the problem generally follows from properties of the laplace operator . in this circumstance , boundary conditions are naturally derived from a solid theory . it is to be noticed however that the choice of the constraints for an elliptic operator is not equivalent to that of a system of hyperbolic equations , where a preliminary study of the _ characteristic lines _ should be done in order to detect which part of the boundary is actually involved . this analysis looks quite difficult in the context of maxwell s equations , where the notions of characteristic curves and wave - fronts are in most cases not very clear .    for practical applications , the nature of the boundary constraints comes from physical considerations , sometimes without worrying about the mathematics . it is not rare to see cases where boundary conditions are under - determined , and others in which boundary conditions are over - determined . nevertheless , this does not seem to cause any sort of ethical problem . as far as the results are in agreement with reality there is no reason to suspect the possibility of spurious solutions or that the entire formulation is inconsistent .    by examining a specific case , let us review what possibilities are offered regarding equation ( [ wave ] ) . for a given smooth bi - dimensional domain @xmath20 , we consider a capacitor where the two plates , shaped as @xmath20 , are parallel and placed at a distance @xmath21 . the vertical direction is the @xmath22-axis and the plates are situated at the positions @xmath23 and @xmath24 . we assume to work with an _ ideal capacitor_. this means that the electric field stays perpendicular to each plate surface and that the charge can be uniformly modified on the plates . as initial condition we impose ( capacitor completely uncharged ) : @xmath25 since @xmath26 , one has @xmath27 for @xmath11 . thanks to ( [ fem1 ] ) , one must have : @xmath28        we are going to show that the wave equation for the electric field has unique solution ( which is not however a proof for existence ) . if there were two distinct solutions , their difference would satisfy the wave equation with homogeneous data . consequently , we impose the initial conditions in ( [ initd ] ) , dirichlet homogeneous conditions on the upper and the lower plates , and conditions in ( [ rote ] ) on the lateral surface . it is possible to show ( see below ) that , with these constrictions , the only admissible case is @xmath16 identically zero everywhere at every time . therefore , the difference of two solutions has to vanish identically , and this is against the hypothesis that they are distinct . the uniqueness of the vector wave equation follows from the conservation of a suitable energy . by extending the proof given in @xcite , p. 83 , to the vector case , one scalarly multiplies both members of ( [ wave ] ) by @xmath45 and integrates on the whole domain : @xmath46 } \\frac{\\partial {

@xmath49 ( lower and upper plates ) . by assuming that @xmath29 is the outer normal , green s formulas yield : @xmath50 } \\left ( \\frac{\\partial { \\bf e } } { \\partial

\\bf n}\\right ) { \\rm div}{\\bf e}\\ ] ] all the terms on the right - hand side are zero by virtue of the homogeneous boundary conditions ( note in particular that @xmath53 on the lower and upper sides ) . on the left - hand side we have the time derivative of a non negative quantity . due to the initial conditions , such a quantity is zero at the beginning . hence , it will remain zero forever . one easily finds out that the only compatible solution is @xmath54 identically . for this last check , boundary conditions must be used one more time . note that the role of the one - dimensional boundaries @xmath55 and @xmath56 is negligible ( in presence of regular solutions , at least ) . the above reasoning is quite standard , especially in the framework of finite element approximations , where the theory is constructed on a weak formulation having the associated energy similar to the one considered here . let us suppose for example that @xmath16 is forced to be zero on the lower and upper plates ( homogeneous dirichlet conditions ) . one gets , after integrating ( [ poyn ] ) in the entire domain : @xmath67 } ( \\vert { \\bf e}\\vert^2 + c^2\\vert { \\bf

@xmath29 directed outward . the last term is zero because of ( [ rotem ] ) . according to ( [ poyni ] ) , the electromagnetic energy , initially zero , will stay zero during time evolution . this says that the maxwell s system admits unique solution .      by assuming @xmath5 , we multiply equation ( [ wave ] ) by @xmath45 and integrate , obtaining through the usual passages : @xmath50 } \\left ( \\frac{\\partial { \\bf e } } { \\partial t}\\right)^{\\hspace{-.1cm}2 } ~+~c^2 \\int_{\\omega\\times [ 0,d ] } ( \\vert \\nabla e_x\\vert^2 + \\vert \\nabla e_y\\vert^2 + \\vert \\nabla e_z\\vert^2 )

  + \\frac{\\partial e_z}{\\partial t}\\frac{\\partial e_z}{\\partial { \\bf n } } \\right ) ~=~0\\ ] ] where we imposed ( [ neum ] ) and homogeneous dirichlet conditions on the plates . again , we deduce an uniqueness result .", "we apply to a concrete case the situation examined in the previous section . the two plates , initially short - circuited , are successively subjected to a difference of potential . as far as the initial and boundary condition are concerned , we assume ( [ initd ] ) and ( [ rote ] ) . moreover , for any @xmath71 : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a given function with @xmath74 and @xmath75 . thus , the charge starts flowing smoothly on the plates , based on a difference of potential equal to @xmath76 . for symmetry reasons , we can set the ground at level @xmath77 . with respect to the lines of force of the electric field , for @xmath73 positive the lower surface is an _ inflow boundary _ , while the upper surface is an _ outflow boundary_. the total flux through the boundaries is zero , so that the integral of @xmath13 on the whole domain is also zero . we omit to specify the boundary conditions for @xmath17 , since there is no need for them , as it will emerge from the analysis .    in the context of smooth functions , the solutions to the maxwell s system belong to a subset of those satisfying the wave equation ( [ wave ] ) . we can construct an explicit solution by setting @xmath78 , where @xmath79 does not depend on @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in this fashion , we have : @xmath82 with ( see the last relation in ( [ rotec ] ) ) : @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85    the explicit expression of ( [ wavez ] ) is not elementary but it is recoverable through fourier series expansion . a theory in the framework of sobolev spaces can be found for instance in @xcite , section 7.2 , or in @xcite , p. 345 . such a solutions turns out to be smooth in the domain including the boundary . due to the uniqueness theorem cited in the previous section , there are no other possible choices for @xmath16 . hence , we also found the solution to the maxwell s problem .    at this point we notice that the function @xmath79 is not certainly constant with respect to @xmath22 . in fact , the setting @xmath86 , @xmath87 $ ] , is in general incompatible with equation ( [ wavez ] ) , because @xmath88 . therefore , the partial derivative @xmath89 is different from zero almost everywhere . in the end , we have : @xmath90    we just discovered that the solutions to our vector wave equation can not be divergenceless . as a consequence , independently on how we define the magnetic field , there are no chances to solve the entire set of maxwell s equations . this is true for any set @xmath20 , for any @xmath21 and for any function @xmath73 ( with zero derivative at the origin ) ; too many degrees of freedom to argue that this is just incidental . the problem we proposed has very smooth solutions , hence the idea that things may improve by converting it into variational form is hopeless . in truth , using a general _ test function _ in ( [ wave2 ] ) , a variational formulation is soon obtained , which can be automatically extended to functions belonging to suitable sobolev spaces .    by the above procedure , the magnetic field turns out to be totally unspecified . as already noticed , the electric field remains parallel to the @xmath22-axis and does not depend on @xmath80 and @xmath81 . the only reasonable choice compatible with such a behavior of the electric field is @xmath26 everywhere at all times . this is again in contradiction with ( [ fem1 ] ) since we know that @xmath91 . the case @xmath92 is more difficult to handle , but this preliminary analysis induces us to guess that conclusions can not be too much different . time periodic conditions applied at the plates are not compatible with ( [ initd ] ) . however , even starting from @xmath92 , after a transient , the function @xmath73 may assume a given oscillating behavior , resulting asymptotically in a periodic evolution of the internal fields ( see figure 1 ) .    at this point , one may argue that the wave equation approach requires too strong boundary conditions . perhaps , by weakening the insulation condition at the lateral sides one can enlarge the solution space and obtain situations that are compatible with @xmath93 . so , we just enforce @xmath94 , forgetting the other constraints and losing the uniqueness result for the wave equation . unfortunately , this weaker hypothesis is again inconsistent with maxwell s equations . to prove such a negative claim we follow very classical arguments . we work in the neighborhood of the lower plate @xmath95 . due to ( [ conv ] ) , we have : @xmath96 @xmath97 thanks to ( [ derze ] ) , the third component of the wave equation satisfies ( [ wavez ] ) for all @xmath98 , when restricted to @xmath99 . moreover , the @xmath93 condition implies : @xmath100 in conclusion , one obtains : @xmath101 therefore , near the surface , one gets the taylor expansion : @xmath102 for instance , let us assume that @xmath73 has a quadratic growth ( though similar considerations will hold for a more general choice ) : @xmath103 . the expression of @xmath79 for @xmath22 sufficiently small becomes @xmath104 . we now take @xmath1050,d]$ ] and consider the domain @xmath106 $ ] . the divergence of @xmath16 is zero inside there . the lateral boundary is insulated , i.e. @xmath107 , hence the incoming flux in @xmath108 must equate the outgoing flux in @xmath109 . if @xmath110 is suitably small this is impossible since @xmath111 uniformly in @xmath20 for @xmath23 , which is less than @xmath112 for @xmath113 . again we arrive at a contradiction . it is worthwhile to notice that , in the proof given above , the zero divergence condition has been recalled both locally ( via ( [ cv1 ] ) ) and globally ( gauss s law applied to the box @xmath106 $ ] ) .    this paradox tells us that there are troubles at the constitutive level . relation ( [ dfem1 ] ) states that condition @xmath114 must be preserved at all times , while we discovered that this can not be true . where is the mistake ? the wrong assumption is in the writing of the ampre s law in vacuum , where the generic vector @xmath45 is supposed to be the _ curl _ of another vector . this is not necessarily true . by dropping this hypothesis one discovers that , even in absence of currents due to independent charges , there might be a sort of flow - field with the property @xmath115 . one may try a correction by rewriting equation ( [ fem1 ] ) as : @xmath116 where the added forcing term substitutes the boundary conditions , that now become of homogeneous type . this consideration does not help , since the new term is also the _ curl _ of a vector ( take for instance @xmath117 ) .    to justify that relation @xmath115 is physically admissible one can rely on the finiteness of the speed of light @xmath118 , which rules the transfer velocity of the information between the two plates . as one modifies the difference of potential , the electric field inside the capacitor has to be redistributed ( recall that , in the path we followed , the magnetic field remains equal to zero ) . this happens at speed @xmath118 , in contrast with coulomb s law ( represented by the gauss s law ) that requires the information to travel at infinite speed . the only way for a field of the form @xmath119 to establish a communication between the plates is to create compression and rarefaction waves by varying its divergence . note however that the integral of @xmath13 on the entire domain remains always zero , so that sources and wells are in perfect equilibrium . these observations , based on elementary arguments , tell us that a rethinking of the equations ruling electrodynamics is unavoidable .    at this point , some readers may argue that the insulating condition @xmath107 is too `` artificial '' and made on purpose to guide the internal field along vertical lines of force . in order to answer this possible question , first of all , we remark that , in the framework of 3d geometries , imposing @xmath107 does not necessarily mean that @xmath16 must be vertical ( this is a consequence of the resolution of the wave equation ) . secondly , we propose to remove the boundary conditions in ( [ rote ] ) and replace them by ( [ neum ] ) . a uniqueness theorem for the wave equation is still guaranteed ( see the end of section 2 ) . in the new setting , @xmath16 could in principle assume configurations that are more similar to those of a charged capacitor in a stationary regime , i.e. , with curved lines of force that are more pronounced at the rim of the plates . by the way , such an improvement is only illusory . indeed , let us consider again @xmath78 ( with @xmath79 not depending on @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) satisfying the one - dimensional equation ( [ wavez ] ) . such a solution also satisfies ( [ neum ] ) , therefore it is the unique solution to the vector wave equation ( [ wave ] ) equipped with the new set of boundary constraints . we know that @xmath16 is not of maxwellian type since its divergence is not zero . we also know that @xmath17 remains equal to zero when time passes . thus , starting from @xmath54 and @xmath120 at time @xmath11 , there is no development of horizontal component of @xmath16 during the charging process . such a conclusion seems counterintuitive . every physicist would bet that there is a mistake in the reasoning . on the other hand , this is just a correct mathematical results which is a consequence of having approached the problem from a nonstandard perspective . here the study of a dynamical situation provides results apparently not in agreement with the stationary case . as claimed in the introduction , there are many different paths one may follow and they depend on what information one would like to extrapolate . although some partial results could be reasonably in agreement with the physical phenomenon under study , others may not . in any case the final answer is often contradictory . one may finally wonder about the possibility to replace ( [ neum ] ) by weaker hypotheses , as done for the case of the insulated wall . the aim is to allow the creation of a nontrivial field @xmath17 with the consequent generation of curved lines of force for the electric field . at the same time , the hope is to restore the zero divergence condition . the risk is to invalid the uniqueness theorem for maxwellian solutions . certainly , one may think that there are infinite ways the magnetic field can grew up in the capacitor s charging procedure , as there are infinite ways the electric field may be deformed . distinguishing among these solutions may require unusual physical considerations that are not comprised in the standard theory of electrodynamics . nevertheless , such a risk does not occur , since , even with a total lack of information on the lateral boundary , we are able to end up with a nonexistence result . the proof is simple . let us recall relation ( [ cv3 ] ) and for simplicity take @xmath121 . near the surface @xmath99 , the electric field is of the form : @xmath122 , neglecting second - order infinitesimals . this is true for any @xmath98 . at level @xmath113 ( for @xmath123 fixed and sufficiently small ) , by computing the divergence one gets : @xmath124 where the approximation holds up to first - order infinitesimals . the crucial step is now to observe that , since the capacitor is initially uncharged , for @xmath98 small enough the sum of @xmath125 and @xmath126 can not be equal to the fixed number @xmath127 . thus , we arrived at another absurdity . this check shows that there is conflict between boundary constraints , the wave equation and the divergence - free condition , pointing out once again the inconsistency of the model . note that hypotheses here are really very mild . in particular , it is sufficient to have the boundary condition @xmath128 only in a 2d region ( of any size ) included in @xmath99 . we do not deny that there are interesting solutions of the full set of equations , but they look dotted islands in the ocean of electromagnetic phenomena ( see the introduction ) . one can try to `` hide '' the above evidences and argue as follows ( the @xmath2-steps - instead - of-@xmath129  technique mentioned in the introduction ) . faraday s and ampre s laws can be advanced in time . they have good physical justification , so the solution will naturally find its path , reproducing within a certain accuracy the phenomenon . thanks to ( [ dfem1 ] ) , there is no necessity to check what happens to the divergence of the electric field . one hopes that nobody will discover that , in some small remote region of the plates , @xmath16 will grow up in such a way that @xmath130 is not of curl - type , disregarding ampre s law . a nonzero divergence starts developing and at this point the link with maxwell s equations is definitely lost . if somebody asks to explain the reason of a non vanishing divergence , an evasive answer is that such a divergence is negligible in practical cases . that is why is hard to convince the public of the unreliability of the maxwell s model .", "we propose the following experiment . the difference of potential between the plates is increased quadratically for a given interval of time , after which is kept constant . the information propagates from the boundary to the interior and the third component @xmath79 follows the wave equation ( [ wavez ] ) . as we stop the increasing of potential , the field continues to develop and assumes an oscillating behavior . the plots of figure 1 , obtained from a simple numerical test , show that after a transient where the distribution monotonically grows ( solid lines ) , a periodic regime follows ( dashed lines ) . we do not specify all the parameters of the test , since the purpose here is to comment the qualitative behavior . in particular , the intensity of the field inside the capacitor assumes values that are greater than the ones attained at the boundary .    by denoting with @xmath131 the area of @xmath20 , the capacitance is given by @xmath132 , while the stored energy is given by : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the difference of potential and @xmath135 is the measure of the volume of the capacitor . in ( [ enec ] ) it is assumed that , at stationary regime , the electric field inside the capacitor is uniformly equal to @xmath136 . we also know that the quantity @xmath137 denotes the energy density of the electromagnetic field . in the case we are examining , this energy integrated over the volume of the capacitor is : @xmath138 . as we notice before , this last quantity can be bigger than the one predicted by ( [ enec ] ) . of course , perfect capacitors as the one we are studying here do not exist in reality and this strangeness is not noticed in practice . nevertheless , such a suspicious theoretical result provides us with another indication that the ruling equation have flaws or , at least , that the definition of the energy stored by a capacitor is lacunary . behavior with respect to time of the function @xmath79 . boundary conditions are increased quadratically and suddenly stopped . as the wave equation predicts , non dissipating oscillations are developed .    in the _ two - capacitors paradox _ ( see , e.g. , @xcite , vol . 2 , p. 684 ) , the charge present at the plates of a capacitor of capacitance @xmath139 is redistributed by adding another capacitor in parallel of capacitance @xmath139 ( the new total capacity is then @xmath140 ) . this implies that the initial voltage @xmath141 is halved . the initial stored energy is @xmath142 while the final one is @xmath143 . thus , half of the energy mysteriously disappears . explanations of this fact have been proposed copiously . the principal track for the investigation is the analysis of losses in the charge transfer procedure . this includes : heating of the connecting wire , self inductance of the circuit ( see @xcite ) , electromagnetic emission , etc . what emerges from this paper is rather the urgent need of restating basic formulas . the stored energy in ( [ enec ] ) is only part of the total energy that also contains the kinetic of the fields inside the capacitors . such a dynamics in inevitably produced by the redistribution of the charges . by assuming energy conservation , internal oscillations do not dump and must contribute to the total energy . a correction of ( [ enec ] ) should include this option . a similarity can be made with a perfect elastic ball , that initially is at rest at distance @xmath144 from the ground ( pure gravitational potential energy ) . the ball successively drops and bounces back . a barrier is posed at level @xmath145 before the ball can reach again level @xmath144 . oscillations develop between the ground and level @xmath145 , where the potential energy is half of the initial one . however , there is no energy loss , since one has to take into account the nonzero kinetic energy when the ball hits the upper obstacle . formula ( [ enec ] ) is only valid in the pure stationary case , so its application in the dynamical description of the charge transfer between two capacitors is incorrect . in practical applications , the oscillations decay in a finite time due to some internal energy dissipation . this loss of energy must be added to the one arising from the external circuitry . after an appropriate interval of time , the total amount of lost energy is , as correctly predicted , equal to half of the initial energy . this result is not as suspicious as before : if from one hand , we have the right to suppose that the dissipation due to the outer circuit is negligible , on the other hand we must handle the dissipation of the internal oscillations in some appropriate way .", "i am sure that following the above discussion many experts will start providing their explanations . an ideal capacitor does not exist . charges are fluctuating on the plates making it impossible a uniform distribution and resulting in the creation of `` magnetic currents '' . the lateral boundaries of the capacitors can not be perfectly insulated . the wave equation theoretically implies that the divergence of the electric field can be different from zero , but in a quasi - stationary regime the amount is negligible . for fast - varying fields the approach to the problem should be different . at high frequencies , the coupling of electric and magnetic fields produces electromagnetic emissions . in other words , nature is very complicated and a simple linear model , such as the maxwellian , can not take into account all the possible manifestations , unless one accepts to introduce some approximation .    by the way , there are no excuses ! what has been studied here is a mathematical setting trying to explain a very simple phenomenon . moreover , it is not a simple phenomenon with very rare specific parameters , since the shape of the capacitor and the applied potential are arbitrary . the results are wrong because the underlying physics is wrong : too many constraints compared to the degrees of freedom . the evolution equations rely on the finiteness of the speed of light , while the gauss s law ( ruling the stationary cases ) finds its roots on the `` action at the distance '' . depending on circumstances , one has to choose what equations are `` more meaningful '' . what is the borderline between the physics of slow - varying or fast - varying potentials ? nobody can predict it ; because in reality such a difference does not exist . why do we think there should be a difference ? because the maxwell s model is controversial . it has to be specialized based on the target , and misses the analysis of the intermediate situations . in fact , very little is known for instance about the so called _ near - field _ of an antenna , where , under suitable resonance conditions , oscillating fields transform into radiation waves ( see my paper @xcite to this regard ) . it is not admissible that the structure of a model changes depending on the problem to be solved . i have a solution to propose ( see the references to my papers ) . in my alternative model equations the divergence of the electric field can be different from zero even in vacuum ( let me skip any explanation ) . what happens inside a capacitor ? everything one may suspect : magnetic fields are generated , information propagates at the speed of light , some electromagnetic pressure ( included in the model equations ) acts on the plates , and several other known ( or less known ) effects . it depends on the assumptions on the device and the external solicitation . the general solution can be a nightmare . the difficulty of the math reflects however the complexity of the phenomena observed in the real world , without any barrier among the different regimes . starting from a unique formulation , negligible quantities can be simplified later , if the nature of the phenomenon allows for it . in the modified model , the wave equation does not hold and it is substituted by a suitable nonlinear hyperbolic system of equations where @xmath13 can be actually different from zero . a meaningful solution ( from the mathematical viewpoint ) can be finally recovered . this is the way a correct model should work . a more precise explanation will be given in a future paper . i still do not know if my proposal is the optimal tool to study electromagnetism . it is certain that maxwell s model is mathematically incorrect and , consequently , requires revision . it fails on simple questions and not just in the simulation of exotic problems ."], "summary": "the charge of an ideal parallel capacitor leads to the resolution of

@xmath12 km @xmath13 mpc@xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) technically lies at the high - luminosity edge of the lirg class with @xmath17 , in many ways it is a prototypical ulirg , and is commonly referred to as such . ngc 6240 is a late - stage merger of two massive disk galaxies @xcite ; it has extended tidal tails and a close nuclear pair separated by @xmath01.5 , or a projected distance of 715 pc ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? its k band light is dominated by red supergiants in @xmath020 myr - old starbursts @xcite , and at the double nucleus two agn have been discovered in hard x - rays @xcite as well as at 5 ghz @xcite . as in other merging systems , most notably ngc 4038/9 ( the antennae galaxy ) @xcite , star clusters have previously been observed in ngc 6240 s main body and tidal tails with the wfpc2 f450w , f547w , and f814w filters @xcite . but recently @xcite detected previously unseen circumnuclear star clusters at j , h and k bands using natural guide star ( ngs ) adaptive optics ( ao ) with the nirc2 wide - field camera on keck ii . these clusters , and other similar clusters in ulirgs and galaxy mergers , may hold clues regarding a variety of open questions , from the distribution of dust and star formation in ulirgs , to the formation and evolution of globular clusters ( gcs ) .    historically , measuring star formation rates ( sfrs ) in galaxy mergers has been difficult , and until recently the contribution of smgs to the total luminous energy density in the high - redshift universe has been significantly underestimated . a variety of heterogeneous techniques have been used to measure sfrs @xcite , but in starburst galaxies these are complicated by the presence of dust @xcite , including the usual methods of measuring sfrs through h@xmath18 line fluxes or uv continuum luminosities . in these cases astronomers have turned to far - infrared ( fir ) wavelengths to measure the dust - reprocessed light . but a well - known problem arises when using fir luminosities to estimate sfrs in ulirgs : in addition to young ob stars , agn also help heat the dust . while studies have shown that the luminosities of most ulirgs are dominated by star formation even when agn are present @xcite , accurately measuring the fractional agn contribution to the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath19 ) has proved difficult . for example , @xcite reported on their detection of the [ ne v ] 14.3 @xmath20 m emission line feature , with a flux of @xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath14 , which provides direct evidence of the buried agn in ngc 6240 . they note that the [ ne v]/[ne ii ] ratio is often incorrectly treated as a reddening independent quantity , even though [ ne v ] comes directly from gas heated by the agn , while [ ne ii ] can be dominated by a starburst . without correcting for dust , @xcite state that the large equivalent width of the @xmath23 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission feature , and the small [ ne v]/[ne ii ] and [ ne v]/ir flux ratios , are consistent with an apparent agn contribution of only @xmath24% of @xmath19 . but after correcting the measured [ ne v ] flux for extinction using values implied by their sed fitting , @xcite estimate that the intrinsic fractional agn contribution to the bolometric luminosity of ngc 6240 is much higher , between 20 and 24% .    by detecting individual , massive , star clusters in merging galaxies we can trace the most violent star formation activity , while circumventing some of these hurdles which make accurately measuring sfrs a difficult task . for example , the circumnuclear locations of clusters makes them easily distinguishable from agn . in addition , while the exact size distribution of dust grains in both star clusters and diffuse stellar populations is impossible to know , the complicated dust mixing models required for analyzing diffuse stellar fields reduce to simple dust screens toward clusters , if we assume that all intracluster dust has been evacuated . even when some intracluster dust is present , the dust screen approximation is still reasonable assuming that the amount of dust internal to the cluster is far less than the intervening dust along the line of sight through the entire merging galaxy . furthermore , individual clusters are well approximated by single stellar populations , making stellar population analysis of clusters more straightforward than for diffuse stellar fields . finally , near - infrared ( nir ) cluster observations provide a more localized measure of the sfr compared to estimates based on longer wavelength observations . but unfortunately , while star clusters seem to represent a common mode of star formation in spirals and lirgs alike ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , detecting dust - reddened clusters is challenging because longer wavelength observations are innately of lower spatial resolution . however , with the improvement of ao systems on large , ground based telescopes , the possibility of detecting individual infrared star clusters , even at @xmath25 , is now a reality .    in order to measure _ localized _ sfrs with fewer complications due to agn and dust , we have obtained @xmath26  resolution images of roughly 10 kpc surrounding the merging galaxies nuclei using the nirc2 narrow - field camera with ngs ao at keck . we combine our data with hst images taken with the nicmos nic2 camera ( using the f110w , f160w , and f222 m filters ) and the wfpc2 planetary camera ( using the f450w and f814w filters ) . using the combined data set we study a total of 32 clusters with inhomogeneous wavelength coverage , partially due to variations in the fields of view , and partially due to non - detections in some wavebands . in order to estimate the sfr associated with these clusters we estimate masses , ages , and extinctions toward these 32 clusters by comparing the clusters spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to model seds from stellar population synthesis codes @xcite , employing simple , screen extinction models by @xcite . given the data currently available , we do not attempt to quantify the cluster s properties with the precision of previous studies of nearby mergers . this work is meant to be a preliminary analysis of ngc 6240 s recently discovered cluster population  one of the most distant such populations ever detected ; future high - resolution spectral observations will provide a much clearer understanding of the cluster s properties . in  [ observations ] we describe our observations , in  [ data processing ] we describe our data reduction , including the techniques we used to identify clusters and perform photometric calibrations , and in  [ results ] and [ discussion ] we present and discuss our results .", "we observed ngc 6240 with the ngs ao system on the keck ii telescope using the narrow - field camera ( 0.009942  pixel@xmath14 ; 4.74 pc pixel@xmath14 ) of the nirc2 infrared instrument at h ( @xmath27 m ) and k ( @xmath28 m ) bands . the h and k observations were obtained on 24 april 2005 and 17 august 2003 , respectively . the natural guide star ( b = 13.5 ) is usno - b 1.0 0924 - 0386013 , located 35.8  east - northeast of ngc 6240 s dual nuclei . due to the faint nature of the star clusters superposed on the diffuse background light from the galaxy , it is problematic to measure the resolution and strehl ratio ( s ) at the location of the clusters , i.e. off - axis from the guide star . we did not observe psf star pairs and therefore can not reasonably guess what the strehl may be at the clusters locations . if there were no tip - tilt errors then the core of the off - axis point spread function ( psf ) would be diffraction - limited , and at 2.1@xmath20 m the full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of this diffraction - limited , off - axis psf core is @xmath29 ( @xmath30 pc at @xmath31 ) , making our observations slightly oversampled . throughout this paper we assume that the off - axis psf and strehl  whatever they may be  are constant across the off - axis fov . this assumption is well justified when a small fov ( @xmath32 ) is far off - axis ( @xmath3330 ) , and when the areas of interest in the fov are oriented perpendicular to the direction of the guide star . most of the clusters in our images are located along the north - south orientated double nuclei , and therefore are oriented approximately perpendicular to the direction of the guide star . the assumed constancy of the resolution and strehl ratio across the fov implies that our detection limits and photometric measurements should be accurate in the relative sense ; in  [ caseii ] ( case ii ) we describe the steps we have taken to ensure that our photometric measurements are accurate in the absolute sense as well , by sidestepping the need to know the absolute strehl ratio to perform photometry .    in table [ tableobskeck ] we outline the details of these keck observations , including the on - axis strehls achieved for the guide star on each night . while the off - axis strehl is unknown , the strehl measured on the guide star is an indicator of the overall performance of the ao system , including the effects of wind turbulence , sampling rate , and weather . we have analyzed archival wfpc2 images taken as part of the go proposal 6430 ( pi : r. van der marel ) . the observations were taken with the planetary camera ( .0455  pixel@xmath14 ; 21.7 pc pixel@xmath14 ) using the f450w and f814w filters on 28 march 1999 . the theoretical fwhm of the diffraction - limited psfs for these two wfpc2 images are @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . at ngc 6240 s distance , these angular resolutions correspond to 18.1 and 32.7 pc , respectively . the f450w and f814w filters are roughly equivalent to the johnson - cousins b and i filters , therefore throughout this paper we use the shorter johnson - cousins _ notation _ interchangeably with the true wfpc2 filter names . however , when performing all calculations and measurements we use the exact filter transmission functions for the wfpc2 filters . we have also made use of archival nicmos images obtained on 1998 february 02 with the hubble space telescope using the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) as part of the guaranteed time observing ( gto ) program 7219 ( pi : scoville ; @xcite ) . the imaging program employed three spectral filters ( f110w : @xmath36 , fwhm = 0.592 @xmath37 ; f160w : @xmath38 , fwhm = 0.403 @xmath37 ; f222 m : @xmath39 , fwhm = 0.143 @xmath37 ) in nicmos camera 2 ( pixel scale : @xmath40  pixel@xmath14 , @xmath41  pixel@xmath14 ; @xmath42 36.3 pc pixel@xmath14 , @xmath43 36.0 pc pixel@xmath14 ) . four exposures in each filter , using step8/nsamp = 10 , 11 , and 12 multiaccum sampling @xcite for f110w , f160w and f222 m , respectively , were taken with corresponding integration times of 40s , 48s , and 56s in each exposure . nicmos camera 2 critically samples its point spread function at @xmath44 ( see * ? ? ? all images were acquired under a four - point  dither \" pattern with pointing offsets of 1.9215 , thus enabling critical sampling at @xmath45 ( after image combination ) , as well as improved sampling and rejection of data from defective pixels at all wavelengths . because the f160w and f222 m filters provide wavelength coverage roughly similar to the h and k mauna kea filters ( fig . [ filters ] ) , these two nicmos images are used primarily as a tool to help perform photometric calibrations on the nirc2 , ao images . ( the details of this photometric calibration technique are described in  [ fluxcalibrations ] . ) however where the fields of view of the nicmos f160w and f222 m images extend beyond the nirc2 fields of view , the nicmos images provide additional spectral information and thus we analyze these images . note that of all the data discussed in this paper the nicmos images have the lowest spatial resolutions  about 4 times lower than the resolution provided by the keck ao system at similar wavebands . the theoretical fwhm of the diffraction - limited psfs for the three nicmos images are 0.093 , 0.13 , and 0.18 , corresponding to linear scales of 44.2 , 64.3 , and 85.0 pc . details regarding both the wfpc2 and nicmos hst observations are shown in table  [ tableobshst ] .", "the complete set of data is composed of 7 images from 3 different instruments at the following bandpasses , in order of increasing central wavelength : b , i , f110w , f160w , h , k , and f222 m . the inhomogeneous nature of these images , including the manner in which they were taken , the morphology that they display , and their resolutions which span more than a factor of five , requires that we employ non - uniform processing techniques . we shall discuss the pitfalls inherent to treating data in a non - uniform fashion . the near - infrared images taken with nirc2 were reduced in the standard way , by masking bad pixels , flat fielding each frame using twilight images , and dark subtracting and sky subtracting frames of the appropriate exposure times . before combining nirc2 narrow camera frames , we removed the geometric distortions using the iraf drizzle package with the distortion coefficients published in the nirc2 manual , and the kernel parameter set to `` lanczos3 . ''    the nicmos data analyzed in this paper were obtained by recalibrating and reprocessing the archival data . instrumentally calibrated count - rate images were created from the raw archival multiaccum frames after applying linearity corrections , dark - frame subtraction , dc bias compensation , flat - field correction , and cosmic - ray rejection . darks , made from contemporaneous on - orbit calibration observations , calibration reference files for linearity corrections , obtained from stsci , and flats , obtained from the nicmos instrument definition team ( idt ) , were applied in an idl - based process closely following the iraf / stsdas calnica task . the image data were photometrically calibrated based upon the absolute instrumental calibration established by the idt ( f110w : @xmath46 jy count@xmath14 s ; f160w : @xmath47 jy count@xmath14 s ; f222 m : @xmath48 jy count@xmath14 s ) . known  bad \" or defective pixels were replaced by two - dimensional gaussian weighted interpolation of good neighbor pixels with wavelength - dependent weighting radii of 3 , 5 , and 7 pixels for the f110w , f160w , and f222 m frames respectively . the fully calibrated images were geometrically rectified to correct for the @xmath49% linear geometrical distortion in nicmos camera 2 , and for each filter , those four images were median combined into a single image on a 2-times finer resampled grid ( @xmath50 mas pix@xmath14 ) . all image resampling ( including re - mapping for registration , and rectification ) was done with sinc - function apodized gaussian weighted interpolation using the idp3 package developed by the nicmos idt @xcite , conserving the target flux density while resampling . the three resulting images ( one for each filter ) are those that are discussed further in this paper . we obtained the archival wfpc2 data from the wfpc2 associations at mast ( multimission archive at stsci ) , and these data are corrected for bias , dark current , flat fielding , and cosmic rays . we performed no additional processing on these wfpc2 associations . we attempted to identify unresolved star clusters in the 7 images in a systematic way by using the find routine adapted for idl from daophot . however , this method and variations on this method , including using the find algorithm on unsharp - masked images , were all unsuccessful , especially in regions where the diffuse background light from the galaxy is highly variable or bright . therefore in this paper we have visually identified clusters , and we define a cluster to be any source that appears unresolved in an unsharp masked image . we neglect clusters that are visible only at b and/or i bands because these have been previously analyzed by @xcite , and our analysis would provide no new spectral coverage . figure  [ grayimage ] shows the cluster positions superimposed on images at b , i , and k bands .    in total we identified 32 clusters that are visible in at least one of the infrared passbands ( f110w , f160w , h , k , and f222 m ) . of these , 27 lie within the intersection of the 7 fields of view , lending themselves to the most complete spectral analysis . of these 27 clusters , only 7 have low enough extinction to be detected at i band , and this number decreases to 5 at b band . figure  [ fovfig ] shows the locations of all 32 clusters and the relative sizes and orientations of the 7 fields of view . in figure  [ clusterids ] we label each cluster with a number from 1 through 32 with 1 being the northernmost cluster . note that cluster # 15 is coincident with the site of the northern black hole , as determined by @xcite . for reference , in the publicly available wfpc2 i band image , the brightest pixel in the northern nucleus is 0.27  east and 0.099  north of the northern black hole ( i.e. cluster # 15 ) . in figures [ fovfig ] and  [ clusterids ] we mark the position of the northern black hole with an orange cross . the positions of each cluster relative to cluster # 15 can be found in table  [ clustertable ] . the complicated morphology of ngc 6240 makes it impossible to specify a single cluster detection limit across the entire fov . the morphology of the h and k images is relatively smooth , with background luminosity increasing sharply toward the double nuclei . therefore the cluster detection limits at h and k worsen monotonically towards the double nuclei . while it is generally true that the detection limits worsen toward the double nuclei in the b and i images as well , the situation here is more complicated because these images are far more patchy due to dust obscuration . we estimate our detection limits by adding simulated clusters to various locations in each image , and decreasing the fluxes of the simulated clusters until the clusters become undetectable by eye . ( see  [ fluxcalibrations ] cases i and ii for a detailed description of how we create the simulated clusters . ) using this method , we estimate that clusters brighter than @xmath51 mag , @xmath52 mag , @xmath53 mag , and @xmath54 mag should be detectable throughout much of the images .      in order to align all 7 images to the same spatial grid we first visually determined which star clusters are common to pairs of images . ( no stars are visible in the small nirc2 fov . ) we fed the centroids of the matched cluster pairs into the iraf geomap routine , and in this way computed second - order polynomial spatial transformation functions . we applied the transformations with the iraf geotran package using bilinear interpolation to rebin the images . due to ngc 6240 s drastically different morphology between b and k bands , finding enough clusters in common at these two wavelengths was challenging . therefore , instead of aligning the b image directly to the k image , the b image was first aligned to the i image , and then to the k image using the transformation computed for the i - k alignment . this two step process also ensures that @xmath55 colors are as accurate as possible , with the fewest errors introduced from poor image alignment . typical rms fitting errors computed by geomap were @xmath56 when aligning keck images , @xmath57 when aligning hst images , and @xmath58 when aligning hst images to keck images .      because the star clusters , although unresolved , can not be conveniently modeled as many point sources on a smooth sky background , and because the strehl ratio for the ao images is uncertain , we performed aperture photometry rather than using the standard psf - fitting photometry packages like daophot . we explored two aperture photometry techniques . first , we simply performed aperture photometry on all images using an aperture radius of 0.07  and a 0.02-wide sky annulus centered at a radius of 0.1   from the cluster centroid . this annulus is near enough to the cluster that we can accurately measure the local background in a complicated environment , while the aperture is large enough to lessen the effects of poor image alignment . second , we tried to minimize the color errors by creating matched - resolution image pairs before performing aperture photometry . we found that this second technique produced poorer results because we were forced to degrade the image quality of the nirc2 images , making many of the clusters disappear into the noise . therefore , the results presented in this paper were calculated by performing simple aperture photometry on all the clusters , using the same aperture and annulus size for each filter . note that the wfpc2 and nirc2 images have very similar resolutions , with the best resolution ( from the h band ao image ) being a factor of 2 better than the worst resolution ( from the wfpc2 i band image ) . however the nicmos images have poorer resolutions than the wfpc2 and keck ao images , so that performing aperture photometry on these images with the same size aperture and annulus introduces color errors in the case where different colored background flux from the galaxy falls within the aperture . thus caution must be used when interpreting the nicmos data , especially in regions near the nuclei where the background flux from the galaxy is bright .    in figures [ seds_7_18 ] -  [ seds_1_32 ] we present the results of our aperture photometry measurements in the form of seds for each cluster , and in the following paragraphs we outline the procedure we used to create these seds for two key cases . other cases can be deconstructed into variations on these two cases .      in order to populate the sed of a cluster that is detected in only the b , i , f110w , f160w , and f222 m images , first we perform aperture photometry on the cluster in each image ( using aperture parameters just described ) . we calculate appropriate aperture corrections by repeating this procedure on simulated point sources extracted from the tinytim ( ver 6.3 ) software package . finally , we convert the ( aperture corrected ) counts to calibrated flux ( in janskys ) using the photflam and photplam keywords in the fits header of the wfpc2 images , and the instrumental calibration values determined by the nicmos idt ( see  [ datareduction ] ) . on an sed graph we represent these measured fluxes in the form of a single point at the position of the central wavelength for each filter .    to calculate the photometry errors shown in figures  [ seds_7_18 ] -  [ seds_1_32 ] , for each cluster we simulated 100 additional clusters using tinytim psfs . the simulated clusters were made to have the same sed as that which was measured for the real cluster , and they were placed in approximately similar areas of the image as the real cluster . ( we defined 3 regions of the images  far , close , and intermediate distances from the nuclei . ) next , we performed the same aperture photometry procedure on the simulated clusters as we did on the real clusters . the resulting distribution of 100 measurements is sensitive to the exact placement of the simulated clusters and is not gaussian . therefore we discard the 10 smallest and largest measured values , and quote errors as 80% confidence limits from the pared distribution . the error bars on the single data point at which all models are normalized represent something slightly different from the error bars on the other points in the sed . the former are 80% confidence limits on the flux at that frequency , while the latter are 80% confidence limits on the color . thus when analyzing these normalized seds , which are plotted in log - linear space , realize that the seds may shift vertically by an amount governed by the error bar on the point at which the seds are normalized , while the slopes of the seds may change only by the size of the error bars on the _ other _ points . since the slope of an sed is governed by the stellar population of that cluster and any intervening dust , the color error bars indicate how confidently we know the cluster s stellar population . likewise , since the total mass of the cluster corresponds to an overall multiplicative factor , i.e. a vertical shift in log - linear space , the flux error bars indicate how confidently we know the cluster s mass , assuming no errors on the stellar population and extinction values .    in the error analysis procedure described above , if the 80% confidence limits indicate that the cluster may have negative flux , as is sometimes the case when performing aperture photometry on barely detected clusters , then we replace the lower error bar with a downward arrow , signifying an upper limit . ( we still plot the upper error bar . ) for clusters that we deem undetected we calculate upper limits using a different method . we create a simulated cluster using a tinytim psf , and place it exactly at the location of the known cluster . we decrease the flux of the simulated cluster until it is undetectable ( by eye ) and call the final flux an upper limit . because absolute flux calibration of ngs ao images is very difficult when the off - axis strehl is unknown , the procedure we have adopted for populating a cluster s sed with photometric information taken by the keck ao system is quite different from the procedure outlined for hst in case i. as an example , we outline the procedure used to populate the sed of a cluster detected only in the h and k images . cluster 18 is an example of such a cluster for which the following procedure was employed . we begin as before by first performing aperture photometry on the cluster in the k image . next , because we have no way of performing an accurate aperture correction or converting counts into janskys for this image taken using ao , we make use of the nicmos f222 m image . though the particular cluster in question is not visible in the lower resolution nicmos image , one cluster , namely cluster # 2 , _ is _ visible in both images , and is relatively far from the bright nuclei . we calculate the total flux of cluster # 2 in the f222 m image using the standard procedure for nicmos data , namely performing aperture photometry and applying an aperture correction calculated from a tinytim psf , and converting aperture corrected counts into calibrated janskys by using the appropriate instrumental calibration value determined by the nicmos idt . next we perform aperture photometry on cluster # 2 in the k image . the ratio of the total flux of cluster # 2 to the aperture photometry result can be used to convert from counts in the k image ( calculated using a particular aperture and annulus ) to _ total _ , _ calibrated _ flux for any cluster . we use this ratio to convert the counts in the particular aperture and annulus for cluster # 18 in the k image to _ total _ , _ calibrated _ flux . on an sed graph , this flux is represented in the form of a single point at the position of the central wavelength for the k filter .    because the k and f222 m filters are not identical ( as can be seen in fig . [ filters ] ) , the bootstrapping procedure described above produces accurate results only when the slopes of the sed in the nir are flat , or the same , for clusters 2 and 18 . indeed , the nir sed is very flat for the case of young , dusty clusters . to estimate the errors introduced by this bootstrapping procedure we convolved various @xcite stellar population models with the transmission functions for the f222 m and k filters . assuming a salpeter imf , solar metallicity , and padova evolutionary tracks , we determine that observations taken with the two different filters should differ by less than 0.1 magnitudes for a cluster between the ages of 0 and 10 gyr . if an intervening dust screen , corresponding to extinctions ranging from @xmath59 to 12 , reddens the cluster and flattens the nir sed , then observations taken with the two different filters should differ by less than @xmath60 for a cluster that is less than 1 gyr old . a completely analogous procedure , which makes use of cluster # 29 , is used to bypass the aperture correction and flux calibration of the h band ao images ; the errors introduced by calibrating h band data with f160w images are comparable to the 0.1 mag errors quoted above . the photometry error calculations and the upper limit calculations in the case where the cluster is only detected in the ao images are completely analogous to the procedures described in case i. however , instead of using tinytim psfs to simulate clusters , we used a theoretical ao psf . we model the ao psfs as the sum of two gaussians . one gaussian has a fwhm equal to @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the observing wavelength and d is the 10 m diameter of the keck telescope . the other gaussian has fwhm equal to @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the fried parameter , which we assume to be 30 cm . we let the on - axis strehl ratio govern the ratio of the total amounts of energy in each gaussian . we recognize that the strehl used for the simulated clusters is certainly over estimated . one of the consequences of these assumptions is evident in figure  [ seds_1_32 ] , where upper limits for cluster # 31 are clearly far too low . ( larger strehls make fainter clusters easier to detect . ) therefore when interpreting infrared upper limits shown in figures  [ seds_7_18 ] -  [ seds_1_32 ] , the upper limits computed from nicmos data  for which the psf is well modeled by tinytim  should be trusted more than the upper limits computed from the ao data .", "in this complicated galaxy merger the values we have calculated , namely a cluster s magnitude in _ at most _ 5 distinct wavebands , are outnumbered by the unknown variables , which include , but are not limited to , the following list : 1 ) the metallicity of gas that formed each cluster ; 2 ) the duration and temporal profile of the starburst for each cluster ; 3 ) the initial mass function ( imf ) of stars in each cluster ; 4 ) the stellar evolutionary track followed by every star in each cluster ; 5 ) the extinction , scattering , and absorption properties of the dust in and in front of each cluster ; and 6 ) the mass and age of each cluster . in principle we would like to find the stellar population that most closely matches the observed photometry for each cluster , but because it is impossible to fully constrain this problem , rather than perform minimization techniques on a many - dimensional parameter space we adopt a different approach which requires making the following simplifying assumptions . we assume that all clusters : 1 ) have solar metallicity ; 2 ) were formed in an instantaneous burst ; 3 ) are composed of stars with stellar masses governed by a salpeter imf ; 4 ) are composed of stars that evolve on padova ( 1994 ) evolutionary tracks ; and 5 ) have evacuated all intracluster dust before an age of @xmath03 myr , and are obscured behind a simple dust screen that behaves according to @xmath65 . the fact that all 32 of these clusters are concentrated within @xmath66 kpc of the double nuclei ( in projection ) suggests that their formation was triggered by the merger and that they were formed roughly contemporaneously . to simplify our analysis we initially assume that all clusters were formed simultaneously , although this is obviously false . later we relax this assumption to allow for clusters of three possible young ( or intermediate ) ages . it is possible that some subset of the clusters are old gcs from the progenitor galaxies that happen to be passing through the center of the merger , but this is surely not the case for the majority of the clusters  especially those closest to the nuclei . assuming the clusters are not old gcs , it is reasonable to choose a metallicity close to solar . if the triggering event was short , then the assumption that the clusters stellar populations are well modeled by an instantaneous burst is roughly accurate . however , those clusters that are located very near to the double nuclei may be experiencing a continual accretion of gas , and therefore it is possible that they would be better modeled by a stellar population with a constant sfr . we leave the clusters ages and the amount of intervening dust along the line of sight to each cluster as free variables .    after making the aforementioned simplifications , our approach entails visually comparing the seds that resulted from performing aperture photometry at b through k bands , to model seds created by the isochrone synthesis code of @xcite . in figures  [ seds_7_18 ] -  [ seds_1_32 ] we present the results of this approach for the case where we assume that all clusters are 14.5 myr old . ( we justify this choice of age shortly . ) we organize the results into 3 groups ; figure  [ seds_7_18 ] shows the 12 clusters closest to the northern nucleus , figure  [ seds_3_28 ] shows the 12 next closest clusters , that lie at an intermediate distance from the norther nucleus , and figure  [ seds_1_32 ] shows the remaining 8 clusters that are farthest from the northern nucleus . all model seds shown in these figures embody the former 6 simplifying assumptions , and for the purpose of visual comparison , each sed has been scaled so that it passes through either the k or the i data points . implies an insignificant k - correction . ] the different colors of the sed curves correspond to varying column densities of interstellar dust applied using the @xcite dust prescription with @xmath67 . ( grain size distribution comes from @xcite ; pah optical properties come from @xcite . ) for the 12 clusters nearest the northern nucleus , column densities corresponding to between 3.5 and 11 magnitudes of visual extinction were required to match the observations with the models . similarly , when comparing the intermediate - distance clusters to the model seds , column densities corresponding to @xmath5 between 4.5 and 14 mag were applied to the models . but for the clusters farthest from the northern nucleus , much smaller column densities , corresponding to @xmath68 mag , were needed to produce seds spanning the range of observations . immediately we see that if our simplifying assumptions are correct , and if all clusters are assumed for the time being to be the same age of 14.5 myr , then on average the outermost clusters are obscured by a thinner dust screen than that which obscures the inner clusters . we repeat this procedure for two additional cases , where all clusters are 2.88 myr old , and where all clusters are 180 myr old . these ages were chosen for the following two reasons . 1 ) the ages span a range that is consistent with our previous assumptions . for example , clusters younger than 3 myr could have considerable intracluster dust , and clusters older than several hundred million years would have been formed before the onset of the merger , thus it is unlikely that they would have formed contemporaneously or be situated coincidentally near the nuclei , the masses required to match the observations to the models for clusters older than @xmath0180 myr are too large to be credible . ] . 2 ) the ages bracket the results published in the literature for other star clusters in ngc 6240 . using photometry at the f450w , f547w , and f814w wavebands , @xcite found that the clusters in ngc 6240 s main body and tidal tails have probable ages ranging from 5 to 13 myr . by analyzing the co 2 - 0 absorption bandhead equivalent width , @xcite show that ngc 6240 s k - band light is dominated by a @xmath020 myr - old , short - duration starburst . for each of the three ages analyzed , we choose as the  best - fitting \" model the sed with the smallest value of @xmath5 that matches the observations for each cluster . for example , the observed sed for cluster # 13 in figure  [ seds_7_18 ] is consistent with model seds having @xmath5 ranging from 5.5 to 16 mag ; therefore we assume that cluster # 13 , _ if it is 15 myr old _ , is extinguished by @xmath69 mag . note that larger extinctions translate to more massive clusters , so our method finds the least massive cluster that matches the data for a given age . we do not show graphs of the 2.88 and 180 myr - old model seds for every cluster ; instead we tabulate the results of this exercise in table  [ clustertable ] . the values of @xmath5 listed for each cluster and for each assumed cluster age correspond to the  best - fitting \" model just described . the masses of each cluster are directly proportional to their un - extincted fluxes ; for two clusters with equal ages and equal apparent magnitudes , the more extinguished cluster is more massive . in figure  [ histograms ] we depict these same results in the form of histograms . the blue , red , and yellow histograms show the  best - fitting \" @xmath5 , and corresponding mass and ( un - extinguished ) @xmath70 , of all 32 clusters for the cases where all clusters are assumed to be 2.88 , 14.5 , and 180 myr old , respectively .    while the values listed in table  [ clustertable ] indicate the stellar population with the  best - fitting \" @xmath5 assuming 3 different cluster ages , we have not yet specified which age stellar population best matches the observations . we address this next step using figure  [ examplaryplots ] , in which we use 3 typical clusters to directly compare the model seds with the best - fitting @xmath5 for 4 different ages . each of the measured seds for clusters # 1 , 28 , and 21 are shown over - plotted with model seds corresponding to stellar populations that are 2.88 , 14.5 , 180 , and 2000 myr old . cluster # 1 is typical of a cluster for which it is difficult to distinguish between the 14.5 and 180 myr - old populations , but it is easy to rule out the youngest and oldest ages with the help of spectral information at wavelengths beyond 1@xmath37 . in cases like these , to be consistent with our previous method of quoting the least massive clusters that match the data , we choose as the most likely cluster age that which yields the smallest cluster mass . for cluster # 1 , the 14.5 and 180 myr - old populations correspond to @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively , and so we designate this cluster as having aged 14.5 myr . in table [ clustertable ] we indicate this final designation with bold text . the center panel in figure  [ examplaryplots ] uses cluster # 28 to demonstrate the case where the 2.88 myr - old model sed visibly fits the observations better than stellar populations of the other three ages . in cases like these , although the cluster s young age requires it to be very massive , we nevertheless designate it as having aged 2.88 myr by using bold text in table  [ clustertable ] . finally , cluster # 21 is representative of the majority of the clusters , for which it is not possible to rule out any age stellar population through visual inspection of the various model seds . in cases like these , we again resort to choosing the cluster age which yields the smallest cluster mass . for cluster # 21 , the 2.88 , 14.5 , 180 , and 2000 myr - old populations correspond to clusters that have approximate masses of @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , respectively , and therefore we designate this cluster ( and clusters like this one ) as having aged 14.5 myr . note that in order for the younger models to be consistent with the observations we must assume more intervening dust ; the 2.88 myr - old model shown for cluster # 21 corresponds to @xmath77 mag , while the 2000 myr - old model corresponds to @xmath78 mag . this , of course , demonstrates the typical astronomer s dilemma of distinguishing between young , dusty populations and older stellar populations .    finally , having just described the method we used to estimate the properties of each cluster , we reiterate our motivation to _ not _ perform a detailed @xmath79 minimization when matching model seds to our observations . given the number of assumptions we are required to make in this work , a detailed minimization of the sed fits would provide very little additional insight , and could be misleading . in particular , a minimization would only describe which of the three chosen ages best fits the models ; a fourth ( intermediate ) age could fit the models better than any of the three . therefore it is more instructive to examine the cases of young and old clusters and to discuss how our results would differ if we had chosen different ages . we do this in  [ clusterproperties ] , and indeed , we discover  not unexpectedly  that a different intermediate age may best describe some of the clusters .", "as shown with bold text in table  [ clustertable ] , the best - fitting model stellar populations and dust screens imply that the clusters are consistent with being young ( @xmath80 myr ) and having masses that range from approximately @xmath2 to @xmath81 . the summed mass of all 32 clusters is @xmath82 , with the single most massive cluster making up @xmath83% of the total mass . the 8 next most massive clusters with @xmath84 contribute @xmath85% of the total mass . cluster # 15 , which is coincident with the site of the northern black hole , is the only cluster which we expect may have a non - stellar sed , or may be poorly modeled by an instantaneous burst . this cluster is the second most massive cluster and accounts for approximately 10% of the total mass .    with the exception of the most massive cluster , the clusters analyzed in this paper have masses similar to , albeit slightly larger than , those found in other well - studied merging galaxies . @xcite estimate that the young , optically bright clusters in the antennae galaxies have masses ranging from @xmath86 to @xmath87 . @xcite find that the brightest near - ir star cluster in the antennae is @xmath88 myr old and has @xmath89 . similarly , many of the young ( @xmath90 myr ) clusters in arp 220 have masses @xmath91 , or even as much as @xmath92 @xcite . ( note that all three of these aforementioned works assume a salpeter imf . ) @xcite found kinematic masses of @xmath93 and @xmath94 for two clusters in m82 . recall that the masses stated in this paper are underestimated in the sense that we adopted stellar population models with the smallest value of @xmath5 possible . in addition , for all cases where the observed seds fit the different aged models equally well , we designated the correct model to be that which yielded the least massive cluster . but by comparing the resulting cluster masses to those in the literature , we judge that these two assumptions were probably necessary for the majority of the clusters . figure  [ histograms ] shows that if we had assumed the clusters were much younger or older than @xmath95 myr , many of the resulting masses would be far larger than those measured in any other merging system . in fact , the clusters masses put stringent constraints on their maximum ages , assuming we have correctly modeled other properties of the stellar populations . as clusters age past 180 myr , they become dimmer and dimmer so that the masses required for us to detect them become unreasonably large ( @xmath96 ) .    the star formation rates measured for ngc 6240 using a variety of methods put additional stringent constraints on the cluster s ages . @xcite use the 1.4-ghz luminosity to show that @xmath97 in the nuclear region of ngc 6240 . @xcite show that the hcn luminosity , which traces dense molecular gas , is a good indicator of the star formation rate in spirals and ulirgs alike . using the relationship described by @xcite and the value of @xmath98 measured by @xcite , we calculate that the total star formation rate in ngc 6240 is approximately @xmath99 . this value is slightly larger than that derived from ngc 6240 s integrated ir luminosity , @xmath100 @xcite . the total star formation rate due to the 32 clusters analyzed in this paper is @xmath101 . considering that our measurement exceeds the sfr measured by @xcite for the nuclear region of ngc 6240 , and that the unresolved clusters do not include the majority of the infrared nuclear light ( see fig . [ grayimage ] ) , our measured sfr may be implausibly high . however , @xmath102% of the total sfr from the clusters comes from just 4 clusters which each contribute sfr @xmath103 . these 4 clusters are the only clusters for which we determined that the 3 myr - old model seds fit the observations better than models of other ages . also have @xmath104 . ] we have already conceded that our method of visual inspection does not search the entire parameter space for a best fitting model . while a salpeter imf or a solar metallicity may be to blame , it is unlikely that all but 4 clusters can be reasonably modeled by our assumptions . thus we suggest that these 4 clusters are neither 3 , nor 15 , nor 180 myr old , but rather some other intermediate age . the k band brightness implied by the instantaneous burst stellar population models @xcite monotonically decreases for population ages greater than @xmath105 myr , and increases for population ages between @xmath7 and 10 myr . thus , these 4 clusters may be better described by a stellar population with an age of @xmath105 myr , implying that they are less massive and contribute less to the total sfr . the total sfr measured for the remaining 28 clusters , for which the observations are consistent with 15 myr - old stellar populations , is @xmath106 . this agrees well with the literature , and implies that the newly detected clusters account for @xmath107% of the nuclear sfr , or @xmath108% of the total sfr in the ulirg . finally , if we assumed that the same 28 clusters were all 3 myr old and summed their appropriate star formation rates in table  [ clustertable ] , we would conclude that they contribute a whopping @xmath109 . thus given our assumptions ( outlined in detail in paragraph 1 in  [ results ] ) the total star formation rate for ngc 6240 puts rather stringent constraints on the clusters ages . to summarize , the masses of star clusters observed in other mergers like arp 220 and the antennae strongly suggest that the clusters in ngc 6240 are younger than 180 myr , while the sfrs measured for ngc 6240 using @xmath110 , @xmath98 , and @xmath111 require that the majority of the clusters be older than 3 myr . 28 of the 32 detected clusters are consistent with being 15 myr old , while the large sfrs of 4 clusters ( clusters # 6 , 28 , 29 , and 32 , their high sfrs do not directly contradict @xmath112 limit set by @xcite . ] ) suggest that these 4 may be more consistent with another intermediate age . the large mass of cluster # 15 and the fact that cluster # 15 is coincident with the northern black hole suggests that the measured sed may have a non - stellar component . ngc 6240 s cluster population  excluding the 5 aforementioned clusters  is very similar to other cluster populations in the literature . the cluster masses range from approximately @xmath2 to @xmath3 , and the total contribution to the sfr from these 27 clusters is @xmath113 , or @xmath105% of the total sfr in the nuclear region . the cluster population discussed in this paper is considerably more massive than that which was discussed in @xcite . the latter consists of 41 clusters located in ngc 6240 s  main body \" and 13 clusters located in the galactic tails . @xcite estimate that these clusters have probable masses of @xmath114 . because @xcite do not give the locations of the clusters they analyze it is difficult to know whether this is a discrepancy or whether we are simply noticing an increase in the cluster mass toward the double nuclei , as was noted by @xcite . while it is obvious that @xcite did not analyze the majority of the clusters discussed in this paper , for which we measure only upper limits on the b and i photometry , it is intriguiging that clusters # 2 and 4 , which are located in what appears to be the  main body \" of ngc 6240 , and for which b and i measurements were made , are rather massive @xmath115 compared to estimates made by @xcite . it is possible that this apparent discrepancy is due to the fact that @xcite used starburst99 stellar population models with a different reddening law and sub - solar metallicity . this apparent discrepancy can not , however , be attributed to a difference in imf , since @xcite used the same imf as we did in this paper , namely a salpeter imf with lower and upper mass cutoffs of 0.1 and 100 m@xmath116 , respecitvely . finally , we note that while using a salpeter imf is helpful when comparing our results to the literature , the @xcite imf is more realistic and results in lower cluster mass estimates . since the infrared luminosity of clusters is dominated by light from high mass stars that quickly turn off the main sequence , and since the salpeter and @xcite imfs differ only for masses below 0.5 m@xmath116 , the cluster masses one derives when employing these imfs differ by a simple scaling factor for clusters with ages less than the main sequence lifetime of a 0.5 m@xmath116 star . the exact mass scaling can be easily derived by piecewise - integrating the two imfs from 0.1 to 100 m@xmath116 . the result is that two young clusters with equal infrared luminosities but different imfs have masses that differ by a factor of @xmath117 , with the larger mass corresponding to the cluster formed with a salpeter imf and the smaller mass corresponding to the cluster formed with a @xcite imf . thus if we had used a more realistic imf throughout our analysis in this paper , we would have estimated cluster masses to be smaller by a factor of about 0.77 . correspondingly , our sfr estimates would decrease by this same factor . ngc 6240 s cluster population , if in fact obscured by a simple dust screen with @xmath118 as described by @xcite , is extinguished by column densities of dust corresponding to @xmath5 between 0.5 and 14 mag . mag and is negligible given the uncertainty on our measurements . ] there is no significant difference in the values of @xmath5 measured for the 24 clusters closest to the northern nucleus , but the 8 clusters farthest from the nucleus exhibit significantly less extinction . this is to be expected for an active merger , in which gas is funneled onto the nuclei , in this case powering the agn that @xcite detected . excluding clusters # 6 , 28 , 29 , 32 , and 15 as previously discussed , on average the 6 clusters farthest from the northern nucleus are extinguished by @xmath119 mag , and the remaining 21 clusters closest to the nucleus are extinguished by @xmath120 mag . @xcite and @xcite both estimate extinctions toward the northern and southern nuclei assuming foreground dust screens . for the northern nucleus we can directly compare our results to theirs using clusters # 12 and 14 as two sight lines through this region . ( @xcite and @xcite both classify the brightest northern knot as the northern nucleus . ) @xcite and @xcite estimate that @xmath121 mag and @xmath122 mag , respectively . both of these values are considerably less than the measurements made in this paper : @xmath123 mag and @xmath124 mag toward clusters # 12 and 14 , respectively . in addition , @xcite measure a peak extinction of @xmath125 mag , while we find that many clusters discussed in this paper have @xmath126 mag . for these reasons we suggest that @xcite and @xcite have both underestimated the amount of extinction in this ulirg . our values of extinction agree better with the values in the literature , measured using a variety of methods . @xcite used x - ray observations and found @xmath127 mag , @xcite used line ratios and found @xmath128 mag , and @xcite used continuum k and l spectrophotometry and inferred @xmath129 mag . the cause of the previous underestimates may be due in part to the different spatial scales being probed , and in part to the fact that the measurements can only probe the optically thin layer surrounding the nuclei . the observations presented in this paper are the first infrared observations to resolve the northern nucleus , and thus it is sensible that we would infer higher values of extinction than were found by @xcite .    finally , note that while @xcite may have underestimated the overall extinction in this ulirg , the morphology of their extinction map is consistent with our findings . they find that the extinction is greatest between the nuclei and least toward the northern nucleus . we detect a cluster coincident with the northern nucleus and we find a large concentration of clusters just northwest of the northern nucleus , yet we can not resolve the southern nucleus , nor do we detect many clusters directly between the nuclei . thus the locations of the clusters in our sample strongly suggest that the region between the nuclei is the most obscured , and that the southern nucleus is more highly obscured than the northern nucleus . this evidence suggests that deeper observations would result in additional cluster detections , particularly between the two nuclei . the circumnuclear locations of the clusters detected in these new , high - resolution observations strongly suggest that their formation was triggered by the merger event that created the ulirg ngc 6240 . this motivates our decision to model the clusters as solar metallicity , instantaneous burst stellar populations . if we further assume that the stellar populations were created with a salpeter imf , and that the stars in the clusters follow padova evolutionary tracks , then we find that 27 of the 32 newly discovered clusters are consistent with being @xmath95 myr old , and 4 of the 32 clusters are probably between 3 and 15 myr old . cluster ages much younger or much older than 15 myr can be ruled out by the large star formation rates and masses inferred , respectively . assuming the clusters are 15 myr old , then the majority of the clusters have masses ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , and the total contribution to the sfr from these 27 clusters is @xmath130 , or roughly 10% of the total sfr in the nuclear region . the extinctions calculated toward these clusters range from @xmath131  14 mag , with the least extinguished clusters being located farthest from the double nuclei . while the range of extinctions quoted in the literature for ngc 6240 varies greatly , the values measured in this paper agree well with some of the larger published values . the locations of the clusters detected here , along with the extinction map published by @xcite , suggest that there may be as - yet - unobserved clusters located between the nuclei that are still obscured . the complicated morphology of this ulirg makes it very difficult to determine our completeness limits empirically . we would like to thank peter bodenheimer , seran gibbard , raja guhathakurta , david koo

one is a fluid oscillation mode similar to the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 modes of a newtonian star ( cf . @xcite ) ; the other is a wave mode ( @xmath8 mode ) , which exists only in general relativity @xcite . even for the axial mode , chandrasekhar and ferrari@xcite illustrated that quasinormal modes exist if the effective potential has a minimal as that in an ultracompact star . kokkotas @xcite numerically calculated such axial quasinormal modes for various ultracompact stars . kojima @xcite extended it to a slowly rotating star , setting regge - wheeler gauge conditions . as for emitted gravitational waves from a binary system , kojima @xcite studied them for the case that a test particle is moving in a circular orbit around a polytropic star . for a circular orbit , the axial mode cancels from the orbital symmetry so that the polar mode was only taken into account . he showed that the resonance mode appears in the energy flux when the orbit reaches the radius where the orbital frequency coincides with that of the quasinormal mode . for the axial mode , recently , borrelli @xcite calculated energy spectra of gravitational waves emitted by a test particle spiraling into an ultracompact star . in his result , its energy spectrum shows many peaks , which correspond to axial quasinormal modes of the star . although it is important , since we are interested in a compact binary , a direct collision might show some different features from the binary case . we also do not know what will happen when a test particle reaches the surface of the star . to avoid such an unknown factor and to analyze the case of a compact binary , we first study gravitational waves emitted when a test particle is scattered by a neutron star in this paper .    for a schwarzschild black hole , oohara and nakamura @xcite analyzed it and showed that the energy spectrum has no peak except for one which corresponds to the orbital frequency . here we consider a spherical star instead of a schwarzschild black hole . we study only the axial mode which does not exist in newton gravity . to discuss the dependence of the equations of state , we analyze two models : a uniform density star as in @xcite and a polytropic star . this paper is organized as follows . in secs . [ sec : linear]a and [ sec : linear]b , we briefly review the perturbation theory for a spherically symmetric relativistic star . we show our numerical results in sec . [ sec : gw ] . section [ sec : discussion ] is devoted to a discussion . some numerical techniques for calculating gravitational waves are summarized in the appendix . throughout this paper , we use units of @xmath9 and a metric signature of @xmath10 .", "we start with summarizing briefly the metric perturbation of a spherically symmetric relativistic star . a spherically symmetric background metric @xmath11 is described as @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a mass function inside a radius @xmath15 . we assume a perfect fluid as the stellar matter , i.e. @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the total energy density and the pressure , respectively , which satisfy a barotropic equation of state , @xmath19 . using tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equations , we construct a stellar model and its spacetime metric numerically except for the constant density star case . the radius @xmath20 of a star is defined by a surface where the pressure vanishes , and the mass of the star @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 .    for linearized einstein equations , we can decompose the perturbed metric into an axial mode @xmath23 and a polar mode @xmath24 : @xmath25    using regge - wheeler gauge conditions , we will integrate the interior and exterior regions of the linearized einstein equations , separately , and impose appropriate junction conditions at the surface @xmath20 to find the solution . in this paper , we only deal with axial mode perturbation . then , we write down the linearized einstein equation only for axial modes in the following subsections .      in order to find the linearized einstein equations for axial modes , we expand the perturbed metric by tensor harmonics for polar angle @xmath26 and azimuthal angle @xmath27 @xcite , and proceed to a fourier transformation for the time coordinate @xmath28 . although there are ten independent components for the linearized metric , four of them are gauge freedoms of coordinate transformations , which are fixed by a choice of regge - wheeler gauge @xcite , resulting in two components belonging to axial modes , while the rest of the four correspond to polar modes . for axial mode perturbations , we can set @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath15 defined below , and @xmath32 is a spherical harmonics . the axial mode in the interior region of a star is described by a single wave equation for gravitational waves , because a rotation does not exist in a spherically symmetric background spacetime . that is , we have a single wave function @xmath33 , which determines the behaviors of axial modes as @xmath34 the equation for the wave function @xmath33 is derived from the linearized einstein equation for axial modes as @xmath35 where the `` tortoise '' coordinate @xmath36 and the effective potential @xmath37 are defined as @xmath38 respectively . as for the boundary condition , the wave function @xmath33 must be regular at the center of a star . expanding @xmath33 around the center @xmath39 , we find @xmath40 r^{l + 3 } + o(r^{l+5 } ) \\right\\ } , \\label{eq : bc_x}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is an arbitrary constant , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are the central density , pressure , and metric functions , respectively . apart from a free parameter @xmath41 , we obtain a solution @xmath33 by integrating eq . ( [ eq : inside_perturbation_equation ] ) with the boundary condition ( @xmath45 ) . further details of the numerical techniques constructing the wave function @xmath33 are given in the appendix , subsection [ subsec : app_interior ] . the background metric outside the star is the schwarzschild spacetime , i.e. , eq . ( [ eq : bgmetric ] ) , with @xmath46 as for the trajectory of a test particle , without loss of generality , we can assume that the particle moves on the equatorial plane ( @xmath47 ) . then , the equation of motion for the particle is described as @xmath48 where the particle trajectory is @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are the mass , the normalized energy , and the normalized orbital angular momentum of the particle , respectively , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 . the normalized effective potential energy @xmath55 of the particle is given as @xmath56 in this paper , since we only consider the motion of a test particle scattered by a spherical star , the particle orbit is unbounded , i.e. , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the maximum value of the potential . the perturbed metric outside a star only comes from an oscillation of spacetime , that is , gravitational waves . then , similar to the interior region , the linearized einstein equations for the metric @xmath59 and @xmath60 defined as eq . ( [ metric ] ) are reduced to a single wave equation for a new wave function @xmath61 defined by @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is one of the source terms given below .    from the linearized vacuum einstein equations , we find the wave equation for @xmath61 ( regge - wheeler equation)@xcite as @xmath65 where @xmath36 is the tortoise coordinate defined by @xmath66 @xmath67 is regge - wheeler potential given by @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the source term , which is described by the energy - momentum tensor of a test particle expanded by tensor harmonics@xcite as @xmath70 \\right ] , \\label{source}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath71 and @xmath72 being @xmath73 ,   \\label{eq : def_q } \\\\ d_{lm}(t , r ) & = &   - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2n(n+1 ) } } \\mu \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } d \\tau \\delta { \\bf ( } t - \\hat{t}(\\tau ) { \\bf ) } \\delta { \\bf ( } r - \\hat{r}(\\tau ) { \\bf ) }   \\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\quad \\times \\biggl\\ { \\frac{1}{2 }   \\left [ \\left ( \\frac{d \\hat{\\theta}}{d \\tau } \\right)^2   - \\sin^2 \\hat{\\theta }   \\left ( \\frac{d \\hat{\\phi}}{d \\tau}\\right)^2 \\right ]   \\frac{1}{\\sin \\hat{\\theta } } \\bar{x}_{lm } ( \\hat{\\omega } )   \\nonumber   \\\\ & &   \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad -   \\sin \\hat{\\theta }   \\frac{d \\hat{\\theta}}{d \\tau }   \\frac{d \\hat{\\phi}}{d \\tau }   \\bar{w}_{lm}(\\hat{\\omega } ) \\biggr\\}. \\label{eq : def_d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath74 , @xmath75 are the tensorial part of a tensor harmonics defined by @xmath76 and the overbar denotes the complex conjugate . the boundary condition outside the star should be imposed such that there is no incoming wave at infinity , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the amplitude of an outgoing wave at infinity . the details of constructing the wave function @xmath61 are given in the appendix , subsections [ subsec : app_exterior ] and [ subsec : app_turning_point ] . we have to combine two wave functions , the interior wave function @xmath33 and the exterior one @xmath61 , at the surface of the star . the matching condition is that the wave function must be continuous and smooth at the surface . for the case of the axial mode , since the wave function inside the star does not couple to perturbations of the matter fluid , the condition turns out to be very simple as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the radius of the star by use of the  tortoise \" coordinate . then we calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves @xmath78 as follows : we first integrate eqs . ( [ eq : inside_perturbation_equation ] ) and ( [ eq : outside_perturbation_equation ] ) using their boundary conditions , eqs . ( [ eq : bc_x ] ) and ( [ eq : bc_infty ] ) . next , we connect those solutions at the surface of the star using eqs . ( [ eq : s_condition1 ] ) and ( [ eq : s_condition2 ] ) , which determine two unknown coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath78 .    from the wave function obtained as above , we obtain some information about gravitational waves emitted by a scattered particle . when we discuss the gravitational waves , we usually decompose them into two modes : @xmath81 and @xmath82 modes . then , we have to transform our coordinate system from the regge - wheeler gauge to the transverse - traceless one , which metric near infinity is described as @xmath83 then the axial mode in transverse - traceless gauge at infinity turns out to be @xmath84 where the spin - weighted spherical harmonics @xmath85 is defined by @xmath86 the energy - momentum tensor of the gravitational waves at infinity is given by @xmath87 in the transverse - traceless gauge , where the angular brackets denote an appropriate average .    from this definition , we find the energy spectrum @xmath88 of gravitational waves at infinity for the axial mode as @xmath89", "in this subsection , we consider a uniform density star . we restrict our analysis only to the case of the @xmath90 mode , just for simplicity . we find that features of the energy spectrum of emitted gravitational waves can be classified into two cases , which mainly depend on the shape of the effective potential . figure [ fig : potential ] shows the effective potential [ eqs . ( [ eq : inside_perturbation_equation_potential ] ) and ( [ eq : outside_perturbation_equation_potential ] ) ] for a uniform density star with three different compactness parameters @xmath91 . the effective potential has the following three features . first , the regge - wheeler potential [ eq . ( [ eq : outside_perturbation_equation_potential ] ) ] has a maximum point near @xmath92 ( accurately at @xmath93 for @xmath94 ) . second , the potential is discontinuous at the surface because of a discontinuity of the energy density of the star at the surface . finally , a potential minimum appears inside the star , if the star is ultracompact ( for the case of @xmath0 ) .    according to the last feature , we study two cases separately . the first stellar type is the case that the surface is outside the potential barrier ( @xmath95 ) . for a usual neutron star , @xmath96 , and then the first type is most likely a realistic astronomical object . the second stellar type is the case that the surface is inside the potential barrier ( @xmath97 ) , which may be an exotic star , if it exists . first we show our result for the first type . for the case of @xmath98 , we show the energy spectra of emitted gravitational waves in fig . [ fig : rm5 ] . in this figure , there exists only a single peak in each spectrum . this peak corresponds to the orbital frequency of a test particle at the turning point , i.e. , periastron . this means that most gravitational waves are emitted around the turning point , where the effect of the gravitational field is the strongest . no other feature is found in this spectrum . in fact , fixing the energy @xmath99 and orbital angular momentum @xmath100 , the spectrum depends less on the compactness parameter @xmath91 ( see fig . [ fig : rm5bh ] ) . for a black hole background , we find quite similar behaviors in the energy spectrum ( fig . [ fig : rm5bh ] ) , except for the high frequency region , where the difference of the boundary conditions is crucial . we also find that the spectrum approaches closer to that of a black hole as the star gets smaller . we also calculate the waveform for the case of @xmath101 and black holes , respectively . we see that a burst wave due to the encounter of a test particle emerges for each case . as the same as the energy spectrum , the difference between these waveform is very little ( see fig . [ fig : wf5 ] )    therefore , for the first stellar type of @xmath102 , the energy spectrum largely depends on the trajectory , but not on the background object . next we discuss an ultracompact star , which shows much more various structure in the spectrum . in this case , a minimum point of the effective potential appears inside the star . as for the trajectory of a test particle , we have two possibilities : one is that the particle gets into the inside region beyond the potential barrier and the other is that one passes through outside the barrier . since the particle approaches closer to the star , it feels a stronger gravitational field . as a result , the excitation by the particle is more efficient and the emitted gravitational waves are enhanced . as a numerical example , we show those energy spectra for the model with radius @xmath103 with the turning points @xmath104 and @xmath105 in fig . [ fig : rm2.26 ] .    apart from a global maximum , which appears in the first type model as well and corresponds to the orbital frequency of a test particle at the turning point , we also find many small periodic peaks in fig . [ fig : rm2.26 ] . this microscopic peak structure is classified into two types , which are divided at the frequency of the maximum @xmath106 ( @xmath107 for @xmath94 ) of the effective potential . in the lower frequency region ( @xmath108 ) , small and sharp peaks correspond to the quasinormal modes , as we will show it next . for the higher frequency region ( @xmath109 ) , we find small periodic peaks , which may appear because of a resonance between two potential barriers . we will also discuss this later .    in order to analyze our numerical results , we first have to know the axial quasinormal modes . our method to calculate a quasinormal mode is based on the continued fraction expansion method which was originally used for black holes by leaver @xcite , and adopted for the polar mode of a spherical star by leins , nollert , and soffel @xcite . we apply this method to axial modes as well . we show our results in table [ tab : qnm_urm2.26 ] with those of kokkotas@xcite whose method is different from ours . the table shows that both results agree quite well .    in fig . [ fig : rm2.26qnm ] , we present both the quasinormal mode and energy spectrum . as seen from fig . [ fig : rm2.26qnm ] , axial  quasinormal \" modes are classified into two : the lower frequency mode ( @xmath110 ) , which imaginary part is very small @xmath111 , and the higher frequency mode ( @xmath112 ) , which imaginary part is rather large @xmath113 . the reason is very simple . for a frequency lower than @xmath114 , we can have a quasibound state . since trapped waves tunnel through the potential barrier , the energy will decrease . it is similar to the quasinormal mode of a black hole . then , we may call it the axial quasinormal mode as well . however , if the frequency is higher than @xmath114 , we have no bound state . nevertheless , we can find the  quasinormal \" mode , by which we mean a wave solution with the same boundary condition as that of the conventional quasinormal mode , which is the outgoing wave condition . in the present case , although we find such wave solutions , those waves decay very quickly because the frequency is higher than the potential barrier . this is the reason why we find a large imaginary part of the mode frequency . the solutions which satisfy the boundary condition appear periodically as seen from fig . [ fig : rm2.26qnm ] . we find that the frequencies of these quasinormal modes coincide with those of spectrum peaks in the frequency region lower than @xmath114 . this is because a test particle excites those quasinormal modes . in fact , when we see the waveform ( fig . [ fig : wf2.26 ] ) , the wave consists of two parts : large one , which corresponds to the burst wave by the encounter by a test particle , and the other part with several oscillations , which comes from exited quasinormal modes in the spectrum . actually the waveform in the region after @xmath115 in fig . [ fig : wf2.26 ] is similar to kokkotas s result for a gaussian pulse wave @xcite .    on the other hand , in a frequency region higher than @xmath114 , although many periodic peaks appear , those positions are not exactly the same as the frequencies of  quasinormal \" modes . we may understand this fact as follows . even if the wave frequency @xmath116 is higher than the potential barrier , the reflection coefficient does not vanish and oscillates with respect to @xmath116 , which period is determined by the potential form . in the present case , we have also an infinite wall near the center of a star . we then expect that small periodic peaks appearing in the spectrum are due to an interference between the incoming and outgoing waves reflected by two potential barriers . since these waves decay very quickly as mentioned above , the process is quite dynamical , and then the peaks in the spectrum do not coincide with the frequencies of  quasinormal \" modes .    in fig . [ fig : rm2.26 - 2.3 ] , we show the energy spectra for two stellar models with @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , which correspond to the cases that the turning point is inside and outside the barrier , respectively . for fixed energy @xmath119 and angular momentum @xmath100 , the global peaks corresponding to the orbital frequency at the turning point agree with each other . on the other hand , the other small periodic peaks from the excited quasinormal modes do not agree with and rather depend on the compactness parameter @xmath91 . consequently , from the analysis of the energy spectrum of axial modes , we may determine the compactness parameter @xmath91 of an ultracompact star . we can also compare a black hole and an ultracompact star . in fig . [ fig : rm2.26bh ] , we show the energy spectra both for a black hole @xcite and an ultracompact star with @xmath120 . from fig . [ fig : rm2.26bh ] , we see that even for the case of a schwarzschild black hole , the global peak due to the orbital motion of the particle coincides with that for the star . however , unlike the stellar model , no small periodic peaks appear in the case of a black hole . in fact for a black hole , there is no peak after @xmath115 ( see fig . this is because the effective potential of the star has an infinite potential wall near the center , which guarantees the existence of quasinormal modes , while that of a schwarzschild black hole has no such wall , and incoming waves fall entirely into the event horizon @xmath121 . hence , we can also distinguish a background object , i.e. , whether it is an ultracompact star or a black hole , analyzing only axial modes . as for the total energy of emitted gravitational waves @xmath122 , we find @xmath123 with @xmath124 and @xmath125 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively , and for @xmath128 and @xmath129 . the efficiency @xmath130 increases monotonically as the compactness gets smaller , and seems to end up with that for schwarzschild black holes ( @xmath131 ) . for @xmath132 and @xmath133 , the efficiency , which is @xmath134 , little depends on @xmath135 up to the case of a black hole .      from the analysis of the energy spectrum for a uniform density star , we find that the spectrum strongly depends on the shape of effective potential . therefore , it may be important to see the dependence of the equation of state on the energy spectrum . then , in this section , we study a polytropic star . just for simplicity , we use the newtonian polytropic equation of state as @xmath136 where @xmath137 is a polytropic index and @xmath138 is a constant value .    first , we consider the first type stellar model with @xmath139 . we set the polytropic index @xmath140 and the constant @xmath141 , and choose the central energy density @xmath142 . this choice gives a stellar model with mass @xmath143 and radius @xmath144 . the compact parameter is @xmath145 , and then the surface locates outside the peak of the regge - wheeler potential . we show the energy spectra of gravitational waves from a scattering test particle in fig . [ fig : polytropic1.0 ] . we find the same feature as that for the uniform density star with @xmath146 , i.e. , there is only a single global peak which frequency corresponds to the orbital one of the particle at the turning point . next , we discuss the second type stellar model , i.e. , an ultracompact star . to construct an ultracompact star with a polytropic equation of state , we set the polytropic index @xmath147 , the constant @xmath148 , and choose the central energy density @xmath149 , for which the compactness parameter @xmath135 turns out to be the smallest . for such a choice , the radius , mass , and compactness parameters of the star are @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 , respectively . although this seems very implausible for a realistic star , we will use this solution in our analysis to study the dependence of the equation of state on the energy spectrum . in fig . [ fig : polytropic0.5 ] , we show the energy spectra for two trajectories of a test particle . one is the case that a particle goes into the inside of the potential barrier , while the other is the case that a particle passes through only outside the potential barrier . we find the same feature as that of the uniform density star with @xmath153 . the difference is found in the frequencies of quasinormal modes because of the different shapes of the potential . then , we find many small and sharp peaks in the spectrum at the positions different from those for a uniform density star . consequently , we may be able to distinguish the inside structure of an ultracompact star by observing the energy spectrum of emitted gravitational waves .", "we have studied the axial modes of gravitational waves from a test particle scattered by a spherically symmetric relativistic star . we have considered both a uniform density star and a polytropic star . we find that the energy spectrum depends mainly on the shape of the effective potential for gravitational waves , i.e. , whether its minimum exists or not . when there is no minimum ( e.g. , a regular type of neutron star with a compactness parameter @xmath154 ) , the energy spectrum shows only a single global peak , which corresponds to the orbital frequency of a test particle at the turning point . gravitational waves are mostly emitted around the turning point , where the effect of the gravitational field is strongest .    while if a minimum of the effective potential exists ( i.e. , some exotic relativistic star with small compactness parameter @xmath155 ) , the energy spectrum shows a variety in its structure in addition to the global peak as the same as that found in the previous case . we find small and sharp periodic peaks in the region lower than @xmath114 ( the maximum value of the effective potential ) , which correspond to an excitation of the axial quasinormal modes . the existence of the potential minimum allows the existence of a quasibound state of gravitational waves , i.e. , quasinormal modes . then those modes are excited by a scattered particle . this becomes more conspicuous when the particle gets into the inside region beyond the potential barrier . we also find small periodic peaks in the frequency region beyond @xmath114 , which may come from an interference between two waves reflected by the potential barrier and the infinite wall near the center of the star .    from the observation of the energy spectrum of the axial mode , what we can determine ? naively speaking , we may not find any information about the constituent of the star , because the axial mode does not couple to matter fluid . this is true for the first type stellar model , i.e. , a regular neutron star . emitted gravitational waves are mostly determined by the particle orbit . the case of black holes also belongs to this case , although there is a small difference in the high frequency part because of the difference of the boundary condition . however , if a star is compact enough to make a potential minimum ( @xmath156 ) , emitted gravitational waves show much more abundant information . it may determine a compactness parameter @xmath91 . we also find quasinormal mode frequencies , which depend on the shape of the potential , and then could depend on the equation of state .    in the axial mode case , however , in general , we can not have direct information about the matter fluid , in particular about the equation of state . the polar mode of gravitational waves will provide us a more conspicuous dependence of matter property . work on the polar modes is under way . we would like to thank yasufumi kojima for kind suggestions at the beginning of this study . the numerical computations were mainly performed by the fujitsu - vx vector computer at the media network center , waseda university . this work was supported partially by a jsps grant - in - aid ( no . 5689 and specially promoted research no . 08102010 ) , and by the waseda university grant for special research projects .", "here , we present numerical techniques solving the wave equations . we improved borrelli s method@xcite to guarantee numerical accuracy . for the interior region , the numerical error of the wave function accumulates and becomes maximal at the surface , because the pressure vanishes there . in order to overcome this difficulty , we solve the wave equation both from the center and from the surface , and connect two wave functions at some inner point , e.g. , @xmath157 . for the exterior solution , we integrate the wave equation from the surface to infinity , by which we can reduce the numerical error . in the present model , the test particle mainly emits gravitational waves at the turning point , where we have to solve the wave equation very carefully because an apparent divergence appears . we shall discuss these three methods in order . here we show how to solve the interior wave equation ( [ eq : inside_perturbation_equation ] ) . transforming the wave function @xmath33 to @xmath158 we find the perturbation equation for @xmath159 as @xmath160 \\frac{dz_{l\\omega}}{dr } + e^{\\lambda - \\nu } \\left ( \\omega^2 -\\frac{2n}{r^2}e^{\\nu }   \\right )   z_{l\\omega } = 0 . \\label{eq : near_center_z_equation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the regularity condition at the center , we obtain the asymptotic behavior at @xmath161 as @xmath162 r^{l + 4 } + o(r^{l+6 } ) \\right\\ } , \\label{eq : near_center_z}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are density , pressure , and metric functions evaluated at the center , respectively . in order to reduce the numerical error at the surface , we adopt the following procedure .      then , we find two independent wave functions @xmath165 by integrating eq . ( [ eq : near_center_z_equation ] ) from the surface to the middle point . the boundary conditions of those wave functions at the surface are given as @xmath166 , @xmath167 . by those two independent solutions , we construct the wave function @xmath168 as @xmath169 where the coefficients @xmath170 and @xmath171 are fixed by junction conditions at @xmath157 . since the wave functions constructed above must be continuous and smooth at @xmath157 , we find the junction conditions @xmath172 from these two conditions , we find @xmath170 and @xmath171 , and then the interior wave function @xmath159 . next we construct the exterior wave function . in order to use the green s function method , we first consider the homogeneous wave function @xmath176 , which satisfies the wave equation @xmath177 and the boundary condition at the surface , which we have already evaluated in the previous subsection , that is , @xmath178 then , we construct a particular solution @xmath179 with a source term , which equation is described as @xmath180 where @xmath69 comes from the motion of a test particle . at the surface , the solution @xmath179 satisfies the following condition : @xmath181 for the homogeneous equation ( [ eq : outside_perturbation_eq_homogeneout ] ) , we have two independent solutions @xmath182 and @xmath183 , which correspond to outgoing and incoming waves at infinity , respectively . then , we describe the wave function @xmath176 by these two independent solutions as @xmath184 where @xmath185 and @xmath186 are complex constants , which are fixed by eqs .

( [ eq : amplitude_result ] )      when a test particle is scattered by a star , the orbit includes a turning point ( @xmath207 or @xmath208 by the tortoise coordinate ) , where the radial velocity @xmath209 vanishes . the source term @xmath69 in eq .

successful applications of game theory in the area of economics and political decisions initiated its increasing development after the second world war @xcite . originally , the game theory is devoted to find the optimal strategy for a given game between two intelligent players . the straightforward developments involve the generalization toward the iterated games of @xmath4 players with assuming local interactions among the spatially distributed players . the spatial evolutionary prisoner s dilemma games ( sepdg ) has attracted a particular attention because of its applicability in the human and behavior sciences as well as in biology @xcite . nowadays the prisoner s dilemma game is considered to be the metaphor for studying the emergence of cooperation among selfish individuals . the emerging cooperation appears to be crucial at many transitions in evolution @xcite . the first numerical investigations have shown that the cooperation can be maintained by very simple strategies in the iterated games @xcite . very recently it is demonstrated that the players can be as simple as bacteriophages ( viruses that infect bacteria)@xcite .    in these systems the players wish to maximize their individual income coming from games with other players . the prisoner s dilemma game is a simple version of the two - player matrix games where the players income depend on their simultaneous choice between two options . following the widely accepted expressions each player can choose defection or cooperation with the other player . the defector reaches the highest payoff @xmath5 ( called temptation to defect ) against the cooperator , which receives then the lowest reward @xmath6 ( called sucker s payoff ) . for mutual cooperation [ defection ] each player receives the same payoff @xmath7 ( reward for mutual cooperation ) [ @xmath8 ( punishment ) ] . the game is symmetric in the sense that player s income is independent of the player itself , it depends only on their choice . the mentioned payoff values satisfy the inequalities @xmath9 and @xmath10 . these assumptions provide the largest total payoff for the mutual cooperators . comparing to this situation the defector reaches extra income against the cooperator whose loss exceeds the defector s benefit . consequently , the choice of defection can be interpreted as an exploiting behavior . these are the main features for which the prisoner s dilemma games are used to study the emergence of mutual cooperation , altruism and ethic norms among selfish individuals @xcite . the rational players should defect as this choice provides the larger income , independently of the partner s decision . however , this situation creates a dilemma for intelligent players as mutual cooperation would result in higher income for each of them than mutual defection does .    in the iterated round - robin prisoner s dilemma games we can introduce some simple evolutionary processes without assuming intelligent players ( who are capable to find the best strategy if it exists ) . these games are started from an initial set of strategies , which defines the player s decision in the knowledge of their previous choices . the evolutionary process is devoted to model the darwinian selection principle among @xmath4 ( selfish ) players whose total income comes from @xmath11 games within a given round . in the simplest evolutionary models the worst player adopts the winner s strategy round by round . the numerical simulations have demonstrated the crucial role of the so - called `` tit for tat '' strategy in the emergence of mutual cooperation . despite of its simplicity the `` tit for tat '' strategy won the computer tournaments conducted by axelrod @xcite . the `` tit for tat '' strategy cooperates in the first step and then always repeats his co - player s previous decision . this strategy cooperates forever with all the other so - called nice strategies which never defect first . furthermore , its defection and cooperation can be interpreted as a punishment and forgiveness when reacting to the previous decision for other strategies . the most remarkable feature of this strategy is that it is capable to sustain the mutual cooperation among themselves in the presence of defectors . early numerical investigations have also indicated the importance of local interactions because it favors the formation of cooperating colonies . in the simplest models the players are distributed on a lattice and the interaction ( the games between two player as well as the strategy adoption ) is limited to a given neighborhood . evidently , the short range interactions enhance the role of fluctuations at the same time . these models can be well investigated by sophisticated methods of non - equilibrium statistical physics .    for the numerical investigation of the spatial effects nowak and may  @xcite have introduced an sepdg model , which is equivalent to a two - state cellular automaton . each lattice site can be in one of the two states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , representing the two simple strategy `` always cooperate '' and `` always defect '' respectively . the income for a given player ( site ) comes from games with its neighbors ( and also with itself in some version of the model ) . according to the cellular automaton rule the players modify their strategy simultaneously in discrete time steps . namely , each player adopts the best strategy found in its neighborhood . the step by step visualization of the strategy distribution on a two - dimensional lattice exhibits different spatio - temporal patterns ( homogeneous and coexisting strategies , transitions between these states , competing interfacial invasions , etc . ) depending on the payoff matrix , which is characterized by a single parameter . in these models the randomness is restricted to the initial states . in a subsequent work nowak _ @xcite have extended the former models by allowing irrational strategy adoptions with some probability . the simulations indicated that the randomness favors the spreading of @xmath1 strategies . these results have initiated systematic numerical investigations of many stochastic cellular automata @xcite . the study of spatio - temporal patterns observed in nature , however , requires continuous time description @xcite . moreover , it is difficult to analyze the above mentioned stochastic cellular automata in the framework of generalized mean - field approximation , which is often used in non - equilibrium physics . to reduce the technical difficulties szab and tke have suggested a simplified dynamics @xcite . the systematic investigations of this model have justified that when tuning the model parameters the stationary state undergoes two consecutive phase transitions which belong to the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class@xcite . very recently this sepdg model has been extended by allowing three strategies for the players @xcite . in the present work this three - strategy model will be compared with its simplified version . during the model descriptions and discussion , our attention will be focused on the motivations , the elementary processes and their consequences as well as on the universal features relating the sepdgs to the area of complex systems .", "in the present spatial evolutionary prisoner s dilemma game the players are located on the sites @xmath12 of a square lattice , where @xmath13 . to avoid the undesired boundary effects we assume periodic boundary conditions . each player follows one of the three strategies : @xmath1 defects always ; @xmath0 cooperates unconditionally ; @xmath2 accommodating to the partner s strategy chooses defection against @xmath1 and cooperation with @xmath0 and @xmath2 . in fact the name @xmath2 refers to the strategy `` tit for tat '' which first cooperates and later repeats the partner s previous decision . consequently , after the first step the decisions of these two strategies are equivalent against @xmath0 , @xmath1 and themselves . the consequences of the different first decisions become irrelevant if the strategy changes ( defined below ) are rare comparing to the frequency of games . at the site @xmath14 the player s strategy is denoted by a three - component unit vector whose possible values are @xmath15 corresponding to the @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath2 strategies respectively . at a given time the state of the whole system is described by the variables @xmath16 .    for each player the total payoff comes from the games with its four nearest neighbors . using the above formalism the total payoff @xmath17 for the player at site @xmath14 is given as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the transpose matrix of @xmath16 and the summation runs over the four nearest neighbors ( @xmath20 ) . accepting the simplified payoff matrix suggested by nowak and may @xcite @xmath21 is given by the following expression : @xmath22 where the only free parameter @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) measures the temptation to defect . in the above mentioned notation the present payoff matrix corresponds to the choices : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 in the limit @xmath29 .    to model the darwinian selection rule the players are allowed to modify their strategy . in the simplest case the system evolution is governed by random sequential updates . it means that a randomly chosen player ( e.g. at site @xmath14 ) adopts one of its neighboring strategy , @xmath30 , if @xmath31 and this elementary process is iterated many times . here it is worth mentioning that a state consisting only of @xmath0 and @xmath2 strategies leads to a uniform payoff distribution [ @xmath32 and the above dynamics leaves this state unchanged . an example of a more complicated situation is given in figure [ fig : podistrn ] . the payoffs associated with the three different strategies , @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 , are explicitly given . the reader can easily check that inside a @xmath1 region the defectors receive zero payoffs . the same is true for a solitary @xmath2 surrounded by defectors . in the absence of @xmath0 strategies , however , two ( or more ) neighboring @xmath2 strategies will invade the @xmath1 territories because their mutual cooperation gives them some incomes , while the defectors payoff remain zero .    in the presence of @xmath0 strategies , however , the above situation becomes quite different as the exploitation provides large incomes for the defectors . as a result , the defectors can invade the neighboring @xmath0 or @xmath2 sites for some configurations . this process dominates the time evolution for small @xmath2 and large @xmath0 concentrations as illustrated in a ternary diagram ( see figure  [ fig : flowp ] ) . note that the trajectories are two dimensional projections of a many dimensional space . accordingly , there can be crossing of trajectories . as the average defector s payoff decreases with the @xmath0 concentration , sooner or later the @xmath33 invasion processes will govern the system evolution and , finally , all the @xmath1 strategies extinct . figure  [ fig : flowp ] shows clearly that the ratio of @xmath0 and @xmath2 strategies in the final ( frozen ) state depends on the initial state . it is emphasized that in the absence of @xmath2 strategies the defectors will dominate the present system in the final state . it is not evident as in figure  [ fig : podistrn ] one can find many @xmath1-@xmath0 pairs where @xmath0 beats @xmath1 . in general , these pairs are located along the horizontal and vertical straight fronts separating the @xmath1 and @xmath0 domains . the random sequential invasions , however , makes the smooth fronts irregular and this situation generally prefers the @xmath34 invasion to the opposite one . as a result , the `` sharp '' @xmath1 fronts cut the @xmath0 s domains into small pieces and finally all the @xmath0s will be eliminated . the reader can easily recognize that in most of the @xmath0-@xmath1 ( or @xmath2-@xmath1 ) confrontations the direction of dominance is not affected by the value of @xmath23 within the prescribed region ( @xmath24 ) . the systematic analysis shows that there is only one situation when the value of @xmath23 becomes important . namely , if a defector has a payoff of @xmath35 while its @xmath0 ( or @xmath2 ) counterpart has 3 . in this case , @xmath1 wins if @xmath36 , otherwise @xmath1 will be invaded . these types of elementary processes , however , do not modify the system behavior drastically @xcite , therefore the subsequent investigations will be focused on the case @xmath36 . the above dynamical rules introduce some noises ( irrational choices ) in the system evolution . now an additional ( superimposing ) noisy term is introduced by allowing the appearance of mutants with probability @xmath3 . in fact , the effect of two different external constraints ( mutation mechanisms ) will be studied in models a and b as a function of @xmath3 .      in the first model , the above evolutionary rule is modified as follows . each randomly chosen player adopts with probability @xmath3 a randomly chosen strategy among the two other strategies . with probability @xmath37 it follows the old rule . this model can describe the behavior of those biological and economical problems where the appearance of mutants can not be neglected @xcite . the main feature of this model is that this mutation mechanism does not allow the extinction of any strategy .      in the second model the mutation mechanism is restricted to the adoption of @xmath0 strategies @xcite . in other words , the randomly chosen player adopts the @xmath0 strategy with probability @xmath3 , otherwise it adopts one of its neighboring strategy if this neighbor has higher income . note that in this case the extinction of the @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 strategies is permitted . model b is devoted to describe the effect of an external constraint which enforces the cooperative behavior naively by supporting an unconditional cooperation . such a phenomenon can be observed in human societies in which any kind of social pressure enforces the @xmath1 and @xmath2 players to choose the @xmath0 strategy . furthermore , a @xmath2 player surrounded by only cooperating strategies ( @xmath0 or @xmath2 ) is motivated to adopt the @xmath0 strategy also because of its convenience . in fact , playing @xmath0 is simpler than playing @xmath2 , which requires the knowledge of the previous decision of your neighbors .", "in the classical mean - field approximation the system is described by the strategy concentrations which satisfy the normalization condition @xmath38 . in this approach the average payoffs are given as : @xmath39 for model a , the time dependent concentrations satisfy the following equations of motion : @xmath40 where the upper ( lower ) signs are valid if @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) . in these expressions the first terms describe the effect of external constraint , the second terms come from the darwinian selection mechanism .    after some algebraic manipulations one can easily get the following stationary solution ( for @xmath43 ) : @xmath44 here all the three strategies are present for arbitrary values of @xmath3 . notice that the concentrations of @xmath0 and @xmath2 strategies are the same due to the symmetries of eqs . ( [ eq : mfa ] ) . in the limit @xmath45 , however , the concentration of @xmath1 strategy vanishes . evidently , the concentration of the three strategies becomes equal when the evolution is governed exclusively by the mutation ( @xmath46 ) .    for model b the corresponding equations of motion are similar to those given by eqs . ( [ eq : mfa ] ) , the differences appear in the first terms proportional to @xmath3 . namely , @xmath47 where the average payoff values are given by eqs . ( [ eq : mfpayoff ] ) and the conditions of validity of the upper and lower signs are defined as above . the analytical solution of these equations predicts strikingly different behavior in the stationary state @xcite , that is , for @xmath48 @xmath49 while the system goes to the absorbing state ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) for @xmath52 . the most surprising result is the extinction of @xmath2 strategy if @xmath53 . we have to emphasize the non - analytical behavior in the limit @xmath45 . as illustrated in the upper plot of figure  [ fig : flowzab ] , without the mutation ( @xmath54 ) the system evolves toward either a homogeneous @xmath1 state ( @xmath55 ) or a mixed state composed of @xmath0 and @xmath2 strategies with a ratio depending on the initial conditions . however , the homogeneous @xmath1 state is unstable against @xmath2 invasions , therefore in the close vicinity of this state some small perturbations can drive the system toward the state of @xmath0+@xmath2 . conversely , this mixed state becomes unstable at a given concentration ( where @xmath56 ) against small perturbations increasing @xmath57 and @xmath58 simultaneously . in other words , the system evolves toward the @xmath1 dominance when the state is positioned on the right hand side of dashed line ( see the upper plot in figure  [ fig : flowzab ] as a results of fluctuations . this feature explains why the system is so sensitive to applied external constraints . figure  [ fig : flowzab ] illustrates that for model a the mutation drives the ( concentration ) trajectories away from the boundaries . on the right hand side of the dashed line ( @xmath59 ) , @xmath57 and @xmath60 decrease while @xmath58 and @xmath61 increase until one crosses the dashed line . on the left hand side all the initial states tend toward the only fixed point given by eq . ( [ eq : mfsola ] ) . for model b , however , there is no fixed point on the left hand side . in this region the external insertion of @xmath0 strategies increases the value of @xmath57 until @xmath60 becomes larger than @xmath62 and then the @xmath1 invasion drives the system toward the fixed point defined by eq . ( [ eq : mfsolb ] ) . during the @xmath1 invasion the external constraint can compensate only the loss of @xmath0 strategies . consequently , the @xmath2 strategies die out exponentially fast . notice that the variation of @xmath23 leaves the fixed points unchanged , but modifies only the slope of the dashed line separating the two regions mentioned above .    within the framework of mean - field theory , the extinction of @xmath2 strategies is a consequence of the fact that here @xmath63 [ see eq . ( [ eq : mfpayoff ] ) ] in contrary to the spatially extended case , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : podistrn ] .", "systematic monte carlo simulations have been performed on a square lattice consisting of @xmath64 sites with periodic boundary conditions , @xmath65 varying from 200 to 1500 . the larger sizes were used in the vicinity of the critical points . each run started from a random initial state . during the simulations we have monitored the number of players playing a given strategy ( @xmath66 ; @xmath67 , @xmath0 or @xmath2 ) and the payoffs related to a given strategy . after some relaxation time we have determined the average concentrations @xmath68 and the fluctuations @xmath69 by averaging over a sampling time varying between @xmath70 and @xmath71 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) per sites . the results obtained respectively for model a and b are the following . figure [ fig : assp02 ] shows a typical strategy distribution for the stationary state at a small value of @xmath3 . in contrary to the mean - field prediction [ see eqs .  ( [ eq : mfsola ] ) ] the system is dominated by the @xmath2 strategies . the randomly inserted @xmath1 and @xmath0 strategies form small islands . occasionally the larger @xmath0 islands are occupied by @xmath1s , however , a consecutive @xmath2 invasion will eliminate the larger @xmath1 territories and maintains the @xmath2 dominance . at the same time this process prevents the formation of large @xmath0 islands inside a @xmath2 domain . one can observe in figure  [ fig : s3mmc ] that when increasing the value of @xmath3 , the concentration of @xmath1 and @xmath0 strategies increases monotonously . in the limit @xmath72 , the strategy distribution on the lattice tends toward a random ( uncorrelated ) one @xmath73 in agreement with the classical mean - field theory [ ( [ eq : mfsola ] ) ] . in this case , instead of the neighbor invasions , the system evolution is ruled by the stochastic mutation mechanism .    as shown in figure [ fig : s3mmc ] , the monte carlo data agree remarkably well with the results of the pair approximation . this pair approximation is considered as a generalized mean - field theory taking the nearest - neighbor correlations explicitly into account . the details of this calculation are available in many previous works @xcite . the good agreement refers to the absence of long - range correlations which is observable in the `` homogeneous '' strategy distribution ( see figure  [ fig : assp02 ] ) . it is worth mentioning that the pair approximation is capable to describe the dominance of @xmath2 strategies in the limit @xmath45 .      in order to visualize the relevant differences between the two models at small @xmath3 values the strategy distribution for model b is displayed in figure  [ fig : bssp02 ] . when comparing the corresponding snapshots ( figures  [ fig : assp02 ] and [ fig : bssp02 ] ) the reader can easily recognize the most striking differences . namely , the appearance of a strongly correlated spatial structure for model b. in this case the formation of large @xmath0 domains inside the sea of @xmath2 strategies is not prevented by the random appearance of @xmath1 mutants as happened in the previous case . the large @xmath0 domains ( white areas in figure  [ fig : bssp02 ] ) , however , are unprotected against the @xmath1 invasion . figure  [ fig : bssp02 ] shows some @xmath1 domains ( black areas ) invading the @xmath0 s territories . these @xmath1 domains are `` strip - like '' because their territories are invaded simultaneously by the @xmath2 strategies . this invasion process is similar also for larger values of @xmath3 ( but @xmath74 , see later ) , and only the average invasion velocity changes . on the other hand , the randomly inserted @xmath0 strategies survive and accumulate in the @xmath2 domains . consequently , far behind the @xmath2-@xmath1 invasion front the @xmath2 s territory will be occupied by the externally inserted @xmath0s and then this area becomes unprotected against the @xmath1 invasion . sooner or later this area will be invaded by @xmath1s and the above process repeats itself . this means that the cyclic invasion maintains a self - organizing domain structure . here we have to emphasize that this cyclic ( rock - scissors - paper game like ) dominance is provided by this external constraint . similar processes are observed in the forest - fire models @xcite introduced by bak et al . @xcite to model the phenomenon of self - organized criticality . in these models each cell can be in one of the following three states : non - burning tree , burning tree and ash . the dynamics are governed by cyclic dominance , similarly to our model b. note that the consequence of cyclic invasion with three ( or more ) states are studied in lotka - volterra models @xcite and in cyclically dominated voter models @xcite .    in model b the transition from the @xmath2 to @xmath0 state introduces a characteristic length and time unit , both proportional to @xmath75 . in other words , this length unit is characteristic to the typical ( linear ) size of the @xmath2+@xmath0 domain , and the time unit corresponds to periodic time of cyclic invasion processes at a given site .    when increasing the value of @xmath3 , the typical size of @xmath2+@xmath0 domains decreases and the concentration of @xmath1 s increases . it is found that the @xmath2 strategies die out if @xmath76 . figure  [ fig : bssp13 ] shows a typical snapshot in the vicinity of this critical value . in this case the external support is sufficiently strong to maintain small @xmath0 clusters inside the @xmath1 domains . the most remarkable feature of this snapshot is that the @xmath2 s form non - uniformly distributed small ( isolated ) colonies . the observation of time evolution of configuration shows that these @xmath2 colonies walk randomly , they can extinct spontaneously , a single colony can split into two , or two colonies can merge . this phenomenon is analogous to the branching annihilating random walks ( barw ) exhibiting a critical transition when varying the control parameters @xcite . the corresponding critical transitions , both for our model b and for barw , belongs to the so - called directed percolation universality class @xcite .    for @xmath77 , the concentration of @xmath1 decreases monotonously if @xmath3 is increased and vanishes at @xmath78 . this extinction process is similar to the previous one , i.e.  it also belongs to the dp universality class . the similarity in the correlations is recognizable in the spatial distribution of the extincting strategies when comparing the snapshots displayed in figures  [ fig : bssp13 ] and [ fig : bssp366 ] .    for @xmath79 , any initial state evolves toward the absorbing state where all the players follow the @xmath0 strategy . the results of our systematic investigations are summarized in figure  [ fig : s3mc ] . systematic numerical investigations in the close vicinity of the critical points show that the vanishing concentrations follow the same power law behavior . namely , @xmath80 in the limits @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively and @xmath83 in both cases @xcite . within the statistical error this value of the exponent @xmath84 agrees with the one of the 2 + 1 dimensional directed percolation @xcite . as expected , these critical transitions are accompanied with the divergence of concentration fluctuations , i.e. @xmath85 in the vicinity of the corresponding critical points . the numerical fitting yields @xmath86 in agreement with the dp values @xcite .    despite the same universal behavior there is a remarkable difference between the two extinction processes . the second extinction process ( at @xmath87 ) results in a frozen ( time independent ) absorbing state . conversely , the transition at @xmath88 is an example where the extinction of @xmath2 strategies happens on a fluctuating background . in other words , the properties of the absorbing state ( frozen or fluctuating ) do not affect the critical behavior of our model . as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : s3mc ] the results of monte carlo simulations are reproduced qualitatively well by the pair approximation @xcite . the striking differences are related to the long - range correlations accompanying the critical transitions at @xmath88 and @xmath89 . due to the strongly correlated domain structure , illustrated in figure  [ fig : bssp02 ] , the largest deviation can be observed for small @xmath3 values . we note that the concentration fluctuations , defined by eq . ( [ eq : chi ] ) , also diverge in the limit @xmath45 . unfortunately , in this particular case , we could not deduce a reliable value for the exponent @xmath90 because of the significant size effects . further systematic analyzes are required to clarify what happens in this limit .", "we have studied quantitatively the effect of external constraints on the emergence of cooperation in an evolutionary prisoner s dilemma game with three possible strategies ( cooperation , defection and tit for tat ) . in the present spatial model the players are distributed on a square lattice and their interactions are restricted to nearest neighbors . the darwinian selection rule is modeled by the adoption of the neighboring successful strategies . this evolutionary process is superimposed by two types of mutation mechanisms ( external constraints ) whose strength is characterized by a control parameter @xmath3 .    the choice of these three possible strategies yields non - analytical behavior in the limit @xmath45 for both the mean - field approximation and monte carlo simulation . the time - dependent predictions of mean - field theory are sensitive to the small perturbations .    according to the monte carlo simulations , in the absence of external constraint the system tends toward a frozen state composed from @xmath0 and @xmath2 strategies whose ratio depends on the initial concentrations . for both types of external constraints ( models a and b ) the system evolves toward a stationary state independently of the initial condition , and the defector concentration vanishes linearly as @xmath91 . in the limit @xmath45 , however , model a and b will exhibit different ratio of @xmath0 and @xmath2 strategies . this difference is related to the appearance of self - organizing patterns for model b. the present investigation indicates that such a society of strategies ( or species ) are very sensitive to the type of external supports ( or the ration of mutation rates ) . the measure of mutual cooperation can be well characterized by the average payoff whose maximum ( 4 ) can be reached only in the absence of defectors . figure  [ fig : apayoff ] compares the monte carlo results for the models a and b. surprisingly , for weak external support ( small @xmath3 ) the average payoff is larger for model a than for model b. in contrary to the naive expectation , the weak support of defenseless cooperators results in opposite consequence . namely , this mechanism feeds the defectors and simultaneously prevents their elimination by the retaliatory ( @xmath2 ) strategies . examples from the political and economical world justifies the above conclusions . in general , the exploiters are preferred by the governmental support for the defenseless layer of a society . the most dangerous effect is the reduction in the @xmath2 type population which can maintain the mutual cooperation against the exploiters . from the view point of cooperation , it is better to help those individuals who are able to prevent themselves against the exploitation . evidently , for sufficiently large @xmath3 values the random insertion of @xmath0 strategies can provide their dominance . in this case the a type external support is preferred to the b one if we wish to improve cooperation . above a threshold value this type of external constraints yields a homogeneous @xmath0 state which is defenseless against any defector appearing occasionally in a real system . further systematic research is required to clarify what happens in those models where the mutation mechanism is characterized by three independent control parameters . the present study confirms that the @xmath2 strategy is able to prevent the spreading of defection in the spatial models . we have to emphasize , however , that according to the simplest mean - field theory , @xmath2 dies out if the external support is of b type . consequently , the defectors will dominate those systems where the mean - field theory is exact ( e.g. infinite range of interaction , or randomly chosen partnership ) . in these mean - field like systems , the games between the  parent  and `` its offspring '' is not emphasized ( they are not neighbors ) , which is an advantage for the defectors comparing to spatially extended models . in the light of this feature our investigations imply many interesting questions related to the transition from the `` short range '' spatially extended systems to the `` long range '' of mean - field like ones ."], "summary": "we study the emergency of mutual cooperation in evolutionary prisoner s dilemma games when the players are located on a square lattice . the players can choose one of the three strategies : cooperation ( @xmath0 ) , defection ( @xmath1 ) or `` tit for tat '' ( @xmath2 ) , and their total payoffs come from games with the nearest neighbors . during the random sequential updates the players adopt one of their neighboring strategies if the chosen neighbor has higher payoff . we compare the effect of two types of external constraints added to the darwinian evolutionary processes . in both cases the strategy of a randomly chosen player is replaced with probability @xmath3 by another strategy . in the first case , the strategy is replaced by a randomly chosen one among the two others , while in the second case the new strategy is always @xmath0 . using generalized mean -

[ fig : rr - series ] . we computed the first moments for each resulting segment . the variance is deemed not constant throughout segments , but it is dispersed over more than one decade as illustrated in fig . [ fig : dispersion ] , for all segment sizes . the local variance is larger for the healthy subjects . thence , equal variance can not be assumed as in previous analysis of heart - rate series  @xcite . furthermore , our finding implies that if one keeps such a simpler analysis , at least the effective degrees of freedom in the @xmath0-test should be obtained by the welch - sattherthwaite equation . it is worth referring that despite the tendency for the variance to be larger in the ` nor ` group , the quotient for consecutive segments is very similarly distributed in both groups , with a slow power - law decay ( with exponent close to -3 ) ( not shown ) . the complementary cumulative distributions of segment sizes for ` nor ` and ` chf ` individuals are displayed in fig . [ fig : nor_chf ] . for both groups , the plots can be described by a double exponential @xmath25 with characteristic lengths @xmath26 and @xmath27 . hence there is no indication of a scale - free behavior , as suggested by previous segmentation analysis through the mean - based algorithm  @xcite .     with amplitude and characteristic lengths @xmath28 ( 0.78,78,372 ) and ( 0.86,64,373 ) respectively . ] our next example concerns the scenario of mixed statistics that has been applied to the study of fluid turbulence  @xcite . besides turbulence , its relevance is highlighted by the fact that several models for finance have been inspired by this physical problem  @xcite . succinctly , the mixed approach corresponds to a conjecture where one has a classical boltzmann - gibbs statistics , conditioned to given temperature ( @xmath29 ) , which signals the existence of local equilibrium , that is associated with certain distribution @xmath30 . nonetheless , up to now , the approaches to the problem have considered the existence of a _ single scale _ of local equilibrium , which can be seen as a first step for an outright description  @xcite . endowed with our segmentation algorithm , we are in position to evaluate the distribution of local time scales , @xmath31 , of the @xmath32 factor and verify the local equilibrium assumption in this type of system . as example , we consider a series of wind velocities ( one month of measurements at a 30s acquisition interval )  @xcite . we reduced the strong daily periodicity by scaling the data by the average at each time of the day . then velocity @xmath33 is dimensionless . accordingly , in a segment within which local equilibrium holds , the velocity distribution is defined by @xmath34 $ ] , wherefrom the distribution of the speed , @xmath35 , is @xmath36 $ ] . along these lines , we apply our segmentation procedure pitching at detecting the time intervals where the local equilibrium approximation is valid . the result of the segmentation is depicted in fig . [ fig : wind - series ] . the complementary cumulative distribution of segments decays more slowly than exponentially ( plausibly a stretched or double exponential , the latter with characteristic times of 32 min and 93 min ) . the distribution of segment lengths has mean ( standard deviation ) approximately equal to 129 ( 91 ) points ( corresponding to 64 ( 45 ) min approx . ) . one observes in fig . [ fig : mixing ] that the 2d - maxwell distribution fails in describing the distribution of velocities , because the local variance is dispersed ( inset of fig . [ fig : mixing ] ) . then we considered the mixing @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the maxwell distribution defined above , substituting @xmath39 , given that the ( conditioned ) raw moments are @xmath40 $ ] . one observes that the mixed distribution is in good accord with the data distribution , once local trends are removed . the mixed distribution also agrees with the histogram built from artificial series obtained by juxtaposition of sequences of maxwellian random numbers , with the same length and local variance as the real ones . afterwards , we have computed the local variance that is proportional to the inverse @xmath32 factor . its distribution , presented in the inset of fig . [ fig : mixing ] , is responsible for the deviation of @xmath41 from the 2d - maxwell distribution ( main frame of fig . [ fig : mixing ] ) . besides , the speed , @xmath42 , we also looked at angle variations ( at 30s lag ) . while a more quantitative analysis on this matter is addressed to future work , here we would like to call attention to the fact that , even if the average value is constantly close to zero , changes in the local variance are detected by the present method , as depicted in fig . [ fig : series - angle ] , while no segmentation occurs with the procedure based on the discrepancy of the means .", "in this manuscript we have presented a segmentation method which aims at coping with non - stationary signals from widespread physical and non - physical systems where the local - equilibrium or local - stationarity hypotheses hold . our method , which is based on the kolmogorov - smirnov test , improves previous proposals as soon as it is non - parametric and thus independent of any pre - assumed order of fluctuation between the stationary segments , resulting into a more flexible and effectual algorithm . concerning algorithmic complexity , our algorithm is more efficient than methods based on matrix diagonalization , such as principal component analysis . in comparison with moment based segmentation proposals , our algorithm requires sorting segments of length @xmath43 which increases the complexity in a factor of order @xmath44 , which does not represent a significant larger computational cost , despite the enhanced ability . the applicability of our proposal was then tested with two poles apart signals , heart - rate intervals and wind velocities , with significant results in each case . in the first case , the non - stationarity portrait is altered with respect to that of previous analysis based on the discrepancy of the means , as soon as the local variance can not be assumed constant . in the second , the procedure is shown to be useful to detect meaningful windows to compute local statistical quantities . in general , proper segmentation is helpful in several problems where local - stationarity applies .    [ [ app ] ]      we determined @xmath15 numerically for a large number ( @xmath45 ) of sequences of @xmath22 i.i.d . gaussian numbers and built its cumulative distribution . from the cumulative distribution , we obtained the critical values of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , for each given significance level @xmath16 . the resulting critical curves are shown in figure  [ fig : critical ] . for the significance tests applied throughout the segmentation procedure , we used the effective form of the critical curves given by the heuristic simple expression @xmath48 with @xmath49 equal to @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively . we noticed that , along a random series , the position @xmath56 for which @xmath14 is maximal is not uniform but presents a u - shaped distribution . this could set forth a bias in the cutting performance propping up an increase in the number of short segments . let us mention that in the mean - based algorithm an alike u - shape is also present . to avoid this effect , we tested a redefinition of the standard ks distance , by considering @xmath57 , with arbitrary @xmath58 and observed that the flattest ( more uniform ) distribution of @xmath10 , for any size @xmath22 , occurs for @xmath59 . we compared the implementation of the algorithm both values of @xmath58 ( 0.5 and 0.64 ) , however , both for real and artificial series no significant differences in the segmentation portrait were observed . then we kept the standard definition of @xmath14 .      to check the performance of the algorithm , we analyzed artificial series @xmath60 , formed by segments of @xmath43 gaussian numbers . we set unitary jumps in the means of consecutive segments ( @xmath61 ) and alternating standard deviation ( square root of the variance ) @xmath62 , @xmath63 , as illustrated in fig .

[ fig : diagram10 ] and [ fig : diagram50 ] which just differ in the value of @xmath73 . of course , false cutting points can also be reduced by increasing the value of @xmath74 ( compare the second row of fig .

derived and experimental landscapes are significantly smoother than random landscapes and resemble moderately perturbed additive landscapes ; thus , these landscapes are substantially robust to mutation . the model landscapes show a deficit of suboptimal peaks even compared with noisy additive landscapes with similar overall roughness . thus , the smoothness and substantial deficit of peaks in fitness landscapes of protein evolution could be fundamental consequences of the physics of protein folding .", "one of the most intriguing questions in evolutionary biology is : to what extent evolution is deterministic and to what extent it is stochastic and hence unpredictable ? in other words , what happens if `` the tape of evolution is replayed : '' are we going to see completely different outcomes or the constraints are so strong that history will be repeated @xcite ? if evolution is envisaged as movement of a population across a fitness landscape , the question can be reworded more specifically : among the numerous trajectories connecting any two points on the landscape , what fraction is accessible to evolution ? until recently , these remained purely theoretical questions as experimental study of fitness landscapes in the actual sequence space was impractical , due both to the technical difficulty of producing and assaying numerous expressed sequence variants and to the more fundamental problem of defining an adequate quantitative measure of fitness . however , recent experimental studies of fitness landscapes could potentially shed light on the problem of evolutionary path predictability . the most thoroughly characterized feature of empirical fitness landscapes is the structure near a peak . in experiments that examine the peak structure , a high fitness sequence is typically subjected to either random mutations or an exhaustive set of mutations at a small number of important sites . the resulting library of mutants is then assayed to measure a proxy of fitness @xcite . significant sign epistasis ( a situation in which the fitness effect of a particular mutation can be either positive or negative depending on the genetic context ) near the peak has been typically observed whereas local deviations from the additive model have been found to be uncorrelated with the genetic context and derived from a nearly normal distribution @xcite . because these studies characterize only a small region of the landscape , they can not be used to address the question of path predictability .    another broad class of experiments probes the evolutionary trajectories from low to high fitness . usually , in such experiments , a random peptide is subjected to repeated rounds of random mutagenesis and purifying selection @xcite . during this process fitness grows with each generation and eventually stagnates at a suboptimal plateau . the characteristics of the fitness growth as well as the dependence of the plateau height on the library size can be used to classify landscapes @xcite . a quantitative comparison to the @xmath0 model of random epistatic landscapes ( @xmath1 is the number of sites in an evolving sequence and @xmath2 is the number of sites that affect the fitness contribution of a particular site through epistatic interactions ) can even yield quantitative estimates of @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite . the directed evolution studies explore the evolutionarily accessible portion of the landscape and could in principle be used to shed light on the question of path predictability . however , the inaccessible regions of the landscape remain unexplored and the volume of data at this point is insufficient to obtain quantitative conclusions regarding path predictability .    a different type of landscapes has been explored in various microarray experiments where protein - dna(rna ) binding affinity serves as the proxy for fitness @xcite . these experiments produce vast , densely sampled landscapes . a comparison with a sophisticated landscape state machine model of a correlated fitness landscapes yields estimates of the model parameters @xcite . the dna binding landscapes , in principle , contain the information required for the analysis of path statistics , and could be a valuable resource for advancing the understanding of evolutionary path predictability .    empirical studies that exhaustively sample a region of the fitness landscape allow one to actually assess the accessibility of the entire set of theoretically possible evolutionary trajectories in a particular ( small ) area of the fitness landscape . for example , all mutational paths between two states of an enzyme , e.g. , the transition from an antibiotic - sensitive to an antibiotic resistant form of @xmath3-lactamase @xcite or the transition between different specificities of sesquiterpene synthase @xcite have been explored . the results of these experiments , which out of necessity explore only short mutational paths of @xmath4 amino acid replacements , suggest that there is a substantial deterministic component to protein evolution : only a small fraction of the possible paths are accessible for evolution @xcite . theoretical analyses of available empirical fitness data reveal a tight link between genetic and molecular interactions which are responsible for the landscape ruggedness and ubiquitous sign epistasis @xcite . the emerging quantitative analysis of fitness landscapes can shed light on some of the most fundamental aspects of evolution but the interpretation of the currently available experimental results requires utmost caution as only a minuscule part of the sequence space can be explored , and that only for a few more or less arbitrarily selected experimental systems .    here we focus on the question of the predictability of mutational paths which is intimately tied to the ruggedness / smoothness of the fitness landscapes . the study of random landscapes of low dimensionality revealed an intuitively plausible negative correlation between the roughness of a landscape and the availability of pathways of monotonic fitness @xcite . in the same study , carneiro and hartl showed that experimentally characterized landscapes are significantly smoother than their permuted counterparts and exhibit greater peak accessibility @xcite .    to gain insights into the structure of the fitness landscapes of protein evolution and in particular the accessibility of mutational paths we used a previously developed simple model of protein folding and evolution @xcite . the key assumption of this model , which is based on the concept of misfolding - driven evolution of proteins @xcite , is that the fitness of model proteins is determined solely by the number of misfolded copies that are produced before the required abundance of the correctly folded protein is reached . we have previously shown that this model accurately reproduces the shape of the universal distribution of the evolutionary rates among orthologous protein - coding genes along with the dependencies of the evolutionary rate on protein abundance and effective population size @xcite . these results appear to suggest that our folding model ( described in detail the methods section ) is sufficiently rich to reproduce some of the salient aspects of evolution . the model is also simple enough to allow exhaustive exploration of the fitness landscapes , which prompted us to directly address the problem of evolutionary path predictability . we build on the efforts of carneiro and hartl @xcite who examined the statistics of evolutionary trajectories . although counting monotonic fitness paths reveals important features of the landscapes , we argue that reliable retrodiction of the evolutionary past is possible ( i.e. , evolution is quasi - deterministic ) only when the available monotonic paths are similar to each other in a quantifiable way . we therefore propose a measure of path divergence to quantify the difference between the available monotonic paths . our aims are to investigate the structure of the fitness landscapes of protein evolution and to elucidate the connection between the roughness of landscapes and the predictability of mutational trajectories . we analyze three classes of fitness landscapes : landscapes in which fitness is derived from the folding robustness of model polymers ; additive random landscapes perturbed by noise ; and experimental landscapes derived from the combinatorial mutation analysis of drug resistance and enzymatic activity . we show that all three classes of landscapes are markedly smoother than their randomly permuted counterparts and all exhibit a similar qualitative connection between roughness and path predictability . however , at the same level of path predictability , the folding landscapes have substantially fewer fitness peaks . given that the statistical properties of the model landscapes can be directly traced to the constraints imposed by the energetics and kinetics of a folding heterpolymer , we hypothesize that the relative smoothness and the suppression of suboptimal peaks in fitness landscapes of protein evolution are fundamental consequences of protein folding physics .", "carneiro and hartl compared small random landscapes to several empirical fitness landscapes using deviation from additivity as a measure of roughness @xcite . they found that empirical landscapes were significantly smoother than their random counterparts and that the degree of smoothness was correlated with the number of monotonic paths to the main summit . deviation from additivity of a landscape is computed by fitting an additive model in which the fitness of each sequence is different from the peak fitness by the sum of contributions of the substitutions that differentiate it from the peak sequence . the negative fitness contributions of the substitutions to the peak fitness are adjusted to minimize the sum @xmath5 of squares of the differences between the actual fitnesses in the landscape and the fitnesses predicted by the additive model . deviation from additivity is defined as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of points in the landscape .    because roughness of a multidimensional landscape with variable degree connectivity is not an intuitive concept , we introduce three additional quantitative measures to probe alternative facets of the concept of roughness . first , local roughness is the root mean squared difference between the fitness of a point and its neighbors , averaged over the entire landscape . as defined , local roughness conflates the measures of roughness and `` steepness . '' for example , a globally smooth landscape , in which fitness depends only on the distance from the peak , will have a non - zero local roughness . however , because there is a large number of directions that change the distance from the peak by one , the local roughness of a globally smooth landscape will be vanishingly small . in addition , our landscapes tend to be globally flat  so that the average decrease in fitness due to a single mutation step away from the main peak is much smaller than the local fitness variability  everywhere except a small region around the main peak ( see fig .  [ fig:7 ] ) . therefore , the landscape - average local roughness in our case is a true measure of the local fitness variability . second , the fraction of peaks is the number of points with no fitter neighbors divided by the total number of points in the landscape . a strictly additive landscape has a single peak @xcite whereas the peak fraction in landscapes derived from the folding model as well as the corresponding randomized landscapes depends on the method of landscape construction , alphabet size and sequence length . third , the roughness of a landscape can be assessed by identifying its tree component . the tree component is the set of all nodes with no more than one neighbor of higher fitness . thus , the tree component includes peaks and plateaus . monotonic fitness paths along the tree component form a single or several disjoint tree structures without loops . in the limit of high selection pressure , a mutational trajectory that finds itself on the tree component has a single path to the nearest peak or plateau , i.e.  evolution on the tree component is completely deterministic . we use the mean distance to the tree component , i.e.  the distance to the tree component averaged over the landscape , as a measure of roughness . in a fully additive landscape , only the peak sequence and its immediate neighbors belong to the tree component and therefore the mean distance to the tree component is a measure of the diameter of an additive landscape ( which , for example , could be defined as the maximum pairwise distance between points on the landscape ) . kauffman and levin have shown that in a large class of correlated random landscapes , the mean distance to the tree component grows only logarithmically with the number of points in the landscape @xcite . we utilize two quantitative measures of the predictability of evolutionary trajectories . first is fraction of monotonic paths to the main peak @xmath8 which is computed by counting the number @xmath9 of simple ( without reverse substitutions or multiple substitutions at the same site ) monotonic paths to the main peak from each point @xmath10 on the landscape , dividing it by the total number of simple paths @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the hamming distance from point @xmath10 to the peak ) , and averaging over the landscape via @xmath13 where @xmath7 is the number of points in the landscape and the sum excludes the main peak . the monotonic path fraction @xmath8 measures the scarcity of accessible evolutionary paths when selection is strong . when the monotonic path fraction is small , evolution is more constrained . second , the mean path divergence , is a fine - grained measure of evolutionary ( un)predictability . we first define the divergence @xmath14 of a pair of paths @xmath15 and @xmath16 , as the average of the shortest hamming distances from each point on one path to the other path . suppose that we have a way of generating stochastic evolutionary paths . the outcome of a large number of evolutionary dynamics simulations is a collection of paths with their associated probabilities of occurrence . in general , the probability of occurrence of an evolutionary path is proportional to the product of fixation probabilities of its constituent mutation steps . given a bundle of paths with the same starting and ending points , we define its mean path divergence to be @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the probability of occurrence of path @xmath19 in the ensemble . in other words , if two paths were drawn from the bundle at random with probabilities proportional to @xmath18 , their expected divergence would be @xmath20 . alternatively , if we were to fix one path to be the most likely path in the bundle and to select the second path at random with probability proportional to @xmath18 , the divergence would be proportional to @xmath20 as well . in an additive landscape , the mutational trajectory is maximally ambiguous . as every substitution that brings the sequence closer to the peak increases fitness , substitutions can occur in any order and all shortest mutational trajectories to the peak  without reverse substitutions or multiple substitutions at the same site  are monotonic in fitness . in the strong selection limit of our model defined below , all monotonic trajectories have roughly the same probability of occurrence , so the mutational path can not be predicted . the mean path divergence is a better measure of the predictability of evolutionary trajectories than the number or fraction of accessible paths . even when only a small fraction of paths are monotonic in fitness , these paths could potentially be quite different , perhaps randomly scattered over the landscape . in such a case , prediction of the evolutionary trajectory would be inaccurate despite the scarcity of accessible paths which will be reflected in a high value of path divergence . equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) introduces the mean path divergence of a bundle of paths with the same starting and ending points . the landscape - wide mean path divergence is measured by constructing representative path bundles with all possible [ start , peak ] pairs including suboptimal peaks as trajectory termination points . path divergence is averaged over all bundles with the starting and ending points separated by the same hamming distance . to construct the path bundles , we employed a low mutation rate model in which the attempted substitutions are either eliminated or fixed in the population before the next mutation attempt occurs . we invoke the misfolding - cost hypothesis to assign a fitness to a sequence that folds with probability @xmath21 to a particular structure . to produce an abundance @xmath22 of correctly folded copies , an average of @xmath23 of misfolded copies are produced . the `` fitness '' of a sequence should be a monotonically decreasing function of the cost incurred by the misfolded proteins . previously we showed that qualitative conclusions drawn from the average population dynamics on the fitness landscape did not depend on the precise functional relationship between the number of misfolded copies and fitness @xcite . we use simply the negative of the number of misfolded copies and assign a fitness @xmath24 , to a sequence whose probability of folding to the reference structure is @xmath21 . because the exact population dynamics model is not important , we use diploid population dynamics in the low mutation rate limit . therefore , the probability of fixation of a mutant @xmath25 in the background of @xmath10 is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the effective population size @xcite which in all simulations was fixed at @xmath28 . the required abundance @xmath22 is a measure of the strength of selection . in the limit of large @xmath22 , the probability of fixation of a beneficial mutation is unity whereas neutral and deleterious mutations are never fixed . in this limit , all uphill steps in the fitness landscape are equally likely and all monotonic uphill trajectories have equal evolutionary significance .    in the analysis that follows , we study the association between landscape roughness and path predictability for the folding landscapes and their randomized ( also referred to as permuted or scrambled ) versions . in the scrambled landscapes , the topology ( i.e.connectivity ) of the landscape is preserved but the fitness values are randomly shuffled . we also compare the roughness and path predictability characteristics of the model and the experimental landscapes for @xmath3-lactamase @xcite and sesquiterpene synthase @xcite to those for noisy additive landscapes with a continuously tunable amount of roughness . we first establish that the folding and the experimental landscapes are significantly different from their randomly permuted counterparts . the deviation from additivity of the folding landscapes is typically several standard deviations below the mean of their scrambled counterparts . although the additivity hypothesis accounts for less than 40% of the fitness variability ( computed by comparing the sum of the squares of the fitnesses in the landscape to the sum of the squares of the residuals of the additive fitness model fit ) in all but one of the folding landscapes , the deviation from additivity of the permuted landscapes is substantially greater ( fig . [ fig:1]a ) . the experimental landscapes follow the same pattern , in agreement with the earlier findings of carneiro and hartl @xcite . furthermore , both in the folding and in the experimental landscapes , the fraction of monotonic paths to the main peak is several standard deviations greater than in the respective scrambled landscapes ( fig . [ fig:1]b ) . an even more striking disparity exists between the fraction of peaks in the folding landscapes and their permuted versions : the folding landscapes contain at least an order of magnitude fewer peaks than their scrambled counterparts ; the experimental landscapes resemble the folding landscapes more closely than their own randomized versions ( fig . [ fig:1]c ) .    to further characterize the deviation of the folding and experimental landscapes from their permuted counterparts , each landscape metric was measured and the mean and standard deviation were computed among 100 randomly permuted landscapes . we then compute the z - score ( deviation from the mean measured in the units of the standard deviation ) of the original non - permuted landscape compared to the ensemble of the permuted landscapes . this z - score shows how much more correlated the original landscape is , as measured by the chosen characteristic , compared to its scrambled counterparts ( figure [ fig:2 ] ) . notably , despite the considerable scatter of the z - score values for the folding landscapes , they all showed extremely large difference ( mean z - score greater than 20 standard deviations ) from the scrambled landscapes for all measures , with the sole exception of the monotonic path fraction ( figure [ fig:2 ] ) . the two experimental landscapes also significantly differed from the scrambled landscapes albeit less so than the folding landscapes , again with the exception of the monotonic path fraction in which case the two classes of landscapes had similar z - scores ( figure [ fig:2 ] ) .    aside from the significant correlation ( pearson @xmath29 ) between peak fraction and mean distance to the tree component , there was little or no correlation between the four measures of landscape roughness ( fig . [ fig:3 ] ) . roughness of landscapes of high and variable dimensionality is impossible to capture by a single quantity . therefore , the different measures seam to reveal distinct aspects of landscape architecture . the strong negative correlation between the peak fraction and mean distance to the tree component is due to the fact that each peak spawns a distinct subset of the tree component . the higher the density of peaks on the landscape , the larger fraction of the landscape that is covered by the tree component . therefore the average distance to the tree component declines with the increasing density of peaks .      starting from a random non - peak sequence in the landscape , we introduced random mutations and accepted or rejected them according to equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) until the trajectory arrived at a fitness peak . this procedure was repeated a large number of times , and path bundles were constructed for all pairs of starting and ending sequences . then the mean path divergence was computed for each path bundle using equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) and averaged over all bundles for which starting and ending points were separated by the same hamming distance . when selection is weak , all mutations which do not result in a sequence with zero folding probability are accepted . thus , evolution is a random walk on the landscape and the statistical properties of evolutionary trajectories are fully determined by the topology of the landscape ( i.e. the connectivity of each node ) . conversely , in the strong selection limit , only mutations that increase fitness are fixed . the mean path divergence varies smoothly between the two limits ( fig . [ fig:4 ] ) and saturates at high selection pressure . in our analysis , we focus on the strong selection limit plateau . in the weak selection limit , the diversity of trajectories stems solely from the number of neighbors of each point ; by contrast , in the strong selection limit , the statistics of the monotonic trajectories depend on the roughness of the landscape . thus , the weak selection limit probes only the topology of the landscape whereas the strong selection limit also exposes its topography which appears to be critical for assessing predictability of evolution . all four measures of landscape roughness can serve as predictors of path divergence and monotonic path fraction to some degree ( fig.[fig:5 ] ) , in agreement with the notion that each of these measures reflects salient properties of fitness landscapes . the properties of the folding and empirical landscapes are consistent with those of additive landscapes that were perturbed by a moderate amount of noise ( see methods for details ) . a striking exception is the dearth of peaks and monotonic paths in folding landscapes all other characteristics being similar . deviation from additivity and fraction of peaks are negatively correlated with path divergence . this relationship captures the intuitive notion that in rough landscapes there are fewer accessible evolutionary paths than in smooth landscapes , and furthermore , in rough landscapes , even those paths that are accessible show the tendency to aggregate within small areas on the landscape . indeed , in both the folding model - derived landscapes and the experimental landscapes , the mean path divergence for all hamming distances between the starting and ending points was dramatically greater than in scrambled landscapes ( fig . [ fig:6 ] ) . interpreting these findings in terms closer to biology , the fitness landscapes derived from the model as well as experimental landscapes show greater robustness to mutations than random landscapes : a random mutation in a model - derived or experimental fitness landscape is more likely than expected for random landscapes to have no deleterious effect , leading to another monotonic path to the peak . consequently , evolution on the model - derived and experimental landscapes is less predictable ( deterministic ) than it would be on uncorrelated random landscapes . in contrast to deviation from additivity , the mean distance to the tree component is positively correlated with path divergence . when the tree component comprises a large fraction of the landscape , the mean distance to the nearest tree branch is small . consequently , the path divergence is reduced as the paths that reach the tree component do not deviate from each other from that point onward . by the same token , when the tree component is large , there are fewer monotonic paths . the origin of the positive correlation between the local roughness and path divergence ( fig .  [ fig:5 ] ) is less obvious . paradoxically , greater noise results in lower mean local roughness of noisy additive landscapes . the lowering of the overall mean fitness with noise and , more importantly , the flattening of the mean fitness dependence on the distance from the peak ( fig .  [ fig:7 ] ) appear to provide an explanation for this counter - intuitive result . indeed we found that in noisy additive landscapes there is a characteristic fitness value of approximately 0.2 above which roughness increases with increasing noise and below which roughness declines with increasing noise . given that roughly 75% of the points on the landscape have fitnesses below 0.2 , the landscape - averaged local roughness declines with increasing noise amplitude .", "here we examined the fraction of monotonic paths and introduced mean path divergence as quantitative measures of the degree to which the starting and ending points determine the path of evolution on fitness landscapes . the lower the mean path divergence value , the more deterministic ( and predictable ) evolution is . global measures of landscape roughness correlate with path divergence in the three analyzed classes of fitness landscapes : additive landscapes perturbed by noise , landscapes derived from our protein folding model and two small empirical landscapes . the folding landscapes are substantially smoother than their permuted counterparts . as a result , although in all analyzed landscapes only a small fraction of the theoretically possible evolutionary trajectories is accessible , this fraction is much greater in the folding and experimental landscapes than it is in randomized landscapes . in addition , the mean path divergence in the randomized landscapes is significantly smaller than in the original landscapes . thus , the model and empirical landscapes possess similar global architectures with many more diverged monotonic paths to the high peaks than uncorrelated landscapes with the same distribution of fitness values . consequently , evolution in fitness landscapes is substantially more robust to random mutations and less deterministic ( less predictable ) than expected by chance . these findings are compatible with the concept that might appear counter - intuitive but is buttressed by results of population genetic modeling , namely , that robustness of evolving biological systems promotes their evolvability @xcite . additionally , the folding landscapes exhibit a substantial deficit of peaks compared to perturbed additive landscapes and experimental landscapes , a property that translates into a substantially greater fraction of paths leading to the main peak . when it comes to the interpretation of the properties of fitness landscapes described here , an inevitable and important question is whether the folding model employed here is sufficiently complex and realistic to yield biologically relevant information . in selecting the complexity of our folding model , we attempted to construct the simplest model which exhibits 1 ) a rich spectrum of low energy conformations across the sequence space , and 2 ) a non - trivial distribution of substitutions effects on the low energy conformations . an important choice is whether the location of monomers is confined to a lattice or can be varied continuously . when the configuration space is continuous , the distribution of energy barriers between energetically optimal conformations can extend to zero . therefore , the subtlety of distinctions between conformations can lead to a richer structure of the fitness landscape . we chose not increase the complexity of the model further and treated monomers as point - like particles in a chain where the distance between nearest neighbors is fixed but the angle between successive links in the chain in unrestricted . our level of abstraction is therefore somewhere between lattice models and all - atom descriptions of proteins @xcite . another important choice is the number of the model monomer types . again , we opted for an intermediate level of abstraction and chose four types of monomers : hydrophobic , hydrophilic , and charged . this choice drastically reduces the size of the sequence space while retaining some of the substitution complexity whereby hydrophilic and charged monomers can be swapped under some conditions without radically altering the native state . the intermediate level of abstraction in our approach has its pros and cons . although the model reproduces key features of protein folding such as the existence of the hydrophobic folding nucleus and two - stage folding kinetics @xcite , compact conformations certainly do not represent proteins . rather , we might think of our monomers as representing structurally grouped regions several ( perhaps up to a dozen ) amino - acids in length . compact conformations in the model might therefore be analogous to tertiary structures of proteins . representing sequence space with only four monomer types and treating mutations without reference to the underlying dna or genetic code does not accurately reflect the natural mutation process . however , our goal was to isolate the features of fitness landscapes which could be traced directly to the constraints imposed by the heteropolymer folding kinetics and energetics . we therefore used a simple sequence space and a homogeneous mutation model to avoid compounding the fitness landscape structure by the complexity derived from the mutation process . most importantly , our folding model has been shown to reproduce the observed universal distribution of the evolutionary rates of protein - coding genes as well as the dependencies of the evolutionary rate on protein abundance and effective population sizes @xcite . therefore , despite its simplicity , the behavior of this model might reflect important aspects of protein evolution . in particular , the conclusions drawn from the analysis of the model landscapes exhaustively explored here could also apply to the fitness landscapes of protein evolution . in the previous work , we concluded that the universal distribution of evolutionary rates and other features of protein evolution follow from the fundamental physics of protein folding @xcite . the results presented here suggest that the ( relative ) smoothness and a substantial deficit of peaks in the fitness landscapes of protein evolution that lead to mutational robustness and the ensuing evolvability could similarly follow from the fact that proteins are heteropolymers that have to fold in three dimensions to perform their functions . the experimental landscapes considered here are decidedly incomplete . due to experimental limitations , only the analysis of binary substitutions at a handful of sites is feasible at this time . the incompleteness of the empirical landscapes analyzed in this work could be the cause of the observed lack of peak suppression . this proposition will be put to test by the study of larger parts of experimental landscapes that are becoming increasingly available .", "the goal of this study is to explore the relationship between roughness and path divergence in realistic fitness landscapes . our polymer folding model provides a simple way of constructing such landscapes . the model has been described in detail previously @xcite .    in brief , the model polymer is a flexible chain of monomers in which the the nearest neighbors interact via a stiff harmonic spring potential with rest length @xmath30 . the angles between the successive links in the chain are unrestricted . there are four types of monomers : hydrophobic , hydrophilic , and charged and . next nearest neighbors @xmath10 and @xmath25 in the chain and beyond interact via a pairwise potential @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the distance between monomers @xmath10 and @xmath25 , @xmath33 is the monomer s charge , @xmath34 is the debye - hckel screening length , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 depend on the pair in question . the interaction parameters are chosen to mimic the essential features of the amino - acid interactions . to emulate the effects of solvent , we assign a stronger attraction to the pair than to the , , and pairs . there is also a long range repulsion between and and even stronger repulsion between and the charged monomers . the values of the parameters are @xmath37 , debye -

( [ eq:3 ] ) over non - nearest neighbor pairs , and the second term reflects the springs connecting nearest neighbors . the spring constant is proportional to temperature @xmath43 . the parameters are fixed for all simulation runs at @xmath44 , and the quench temperature @xmath45 . to mimic the observed tendency of the @xmath1 and @xmath46 termini to be in close proximity , we fixed the endpoint monomers of the model sequences to be of @xmath40 and @xmath41 types . dynamics of folding are simulated via overdamped brownian kinetics which are appropriate when inertial and hydrodynamic effects are not important . units are chosen so that each component @xmath47 of the @xmath10th monomer s coordinates @xmath48 is updated according to @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the time step and @xmath51 is a random variable with zero mean , variance @xmath52 , uncorrelated with @xmath53 for other times , monomers and spatial directions . the `` native structure '' of a particular sequence is represented by an equilibrium ensemble of conformations . the ensemble is constructed by identifying the typical folded conformation and measuring the characteristic rmsd @xmath34 due to thermal fluctuations in the folded state . three thousand quenches are then performed and the resulting folded conformations are accumulated . the equilibrium ensemble that represents the native structure is defined as the largest cluster of quenched conformations within rmsd distance @xmath34 from each other . thus , each conformation in the ensemble differs from any other by an amount comparable to the differences introduced by thermal fluctuations alone . the concept of the native structure ensemble allows us to compute the probability that a sequence folds to a particular structure in a natural , physically plausible fashion . given a native structure ensemble we assess its conformation space density by computing the distance @xmath54 between each member @xmath10 of the ensemble and its closest neighbor . given the set @xmath55 of these shortest distances we compute the median @xmath56 and the median absolute deviation ( mad ) @xmath57 . a new conformation is deemed to belong to the ensemble if the shortest distance from this conformation to the members of the ensemble is smaller than @xmath58 . given a native structure ensemble of some sequence @xmath59 we compute the probability @xmath21 that sequence @xmath60 ( which could be @xmath59 itself ) folds to the this structure by accumulating @xmath61 equilibrated quenched conformations of @xmath60 and using the above criterion to determine the fraction @xmath21 that belong to the native structure ensemble of @xmath59 . because @xmath61 sample conformations are computed , the smallest measurable @xmath21 is @xmath62 . the sample size used to measure @xmath63 dictated by the computational demands of the model , introduces a random component to the model fitness landscapes . as we report below , model landscapes turn out to be substantially smoother than random . therefore the underlying global structure of the model landscapes appears to survive the modest amount of randomness introduced by the relatively small sample size used for measuring @xmath21 . robust folders ( sequences with a high probability of correct folding ) tend to have large linear regions stretched by repulsive coulomb interactions . because the linear regions have no contacts with other monomers , we focused our attention on compact conformations with a high monomer contact density . substitutions in these higher complexity conformations were more likely to exhibit non - trivial effects . to find compact robust folders in the vast available sequence space of @xmath64-mers ( the sequences are of length @xmath65 but the endpoint monomer types are fixed ) with @xmath66 monomer types , we implemented a simulated annealing search which optimized the correct folding probability @xmath21 divided by the cube of the native conformation s radius of gyration . the search produced over 800 sequences with @xmath67 and at least two distinct regions of the polymer in mutual contact . we examined each single substitution mutant of a robustly folding sequence and computed the folding probability @xmath21 to the structure of the original sequence . all mutants with @xmath68 were added to the landscape and if @xmath69 their mutants were also examined . this process is repeated until all mutants of the last sequence under consideration have @xmath70 .    from our study of complete landscapes we estimate that on average for each sequence with @xmath68 which is included into the landscape , roughly 6 others with @xmath71 need to be examined . since each quench and equilibration takes about 24 seconds , landscape construction takes roughly 30 minutes to an hour per included sequence . thus landscapes larger than 10,000 sequences take months to compile . at the time of submission , 39 complete landscapes have been constructed , the largest comprising 12969 sequences . the organization of the folding fitness landscapes and experimental landscapes were compared with perfectly additive landscapes perturbed by noise constructed as follows . each substitution to the peak fitness sequence was assigned a negative fitness differential drawn at random from an exponential distribution with parameter @xmath72 . the sum over the fitness differentials of a particular set of substitution was modified by either additive of multiplicative noise @xcite . additive noise is drawn from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath73 which was varied between @xmath74 and @xmath75 . the multiplicative perturbation is achieved by multiplying the fitness by a number drawn from a uniform distribution @xmath76 raised to a positive power @xmath77 varied between @xmath78 and @xmath79 when @xmath77 is small , multiplicative factors are close to unity and the perturbation is small as well . if the perturbed fitness was positive , the mutant was included into the landscape . the noise amplitude was varied to obtain a family of landscapes of continuously varying roughness . only the data for the additive landscapes with multiplicative noise were included in this manuscript . landscapes perturbed by other types of noise exhibited essentially the same qualitative behavior . the studies on experimental fitness landscapes typically involve constructing a library of all possible combinations of binary mutations at a small number of sites . the first study included in the present analysis measured the minimum inhibitory concentrations ( mic ) of an antibiotic for a complete spectrum of mutants with modified tem @xmath3-lactamases ; the transition from the antibiotic - sensitive to the antibiotic - resistant form requires five mutation , so the landscape encompassed 120 mutational trajectories between the most distant points on the landscape ( or 32 sequences ) @xcite . the logarithm of mic was used as the proxy for fitness . in the second study , catalytic activity of 419 sesquiterpene synthase mutants that differed by at most 9 substitutions was measured @xcite . we used the catalytic specificity ( propensity for producing a particular reaction product rather than a broad spectrum of products ) of the mutant enzymes as the proxy for fitness . before performing the analysis , the fitnesses in the experimental landscapes are mapped onto the @xmath80 interval to enable meaningful quantitative comparisons of the roughness measures . 10 [ 1]`#1 ` urlstyle [ 1]doi:#1    [ 1 ] [ 2 ]    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ key : # 1 + annotation :  # 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    gould sj ( 1997 ) full house : the spread of excellence from plato to darwin . new york : three rivers press . conway ms ( 2009 ) the predictability of evolution : glimpses into a post -

( color online ) a half - infinite 1d qw with a magnetic ion placed at its edge taken as a reference point . the ionic spin is @xmath3 and @xmath4 characterizes its spatial distribution . the electronic density is zero at the edge , @xmath5 . thus for @xmath6 one expects no rkky oscillations in the system . however , for @xmath7 the electronic density exhibits the friedel oscillations converging to the electronic density of the corresponding infinite 1d qw , @xmath8 . therefore for @xmath9 the exchange interaction takes place and is responsible for the rkky oscillations of the electron spin density.,width=8 ]    however , in spite of considerable amount of scientific research on the rkky interaction a little attention has been paid to the fact that the exchange interaction responsible for the rkky interaction is actually non - local in space but has a finite range @xmath4 given by the spatial spin distribution around the localization center . in theoretical models of the rkky interaction it is almost always assumed that @xmath6 and the exchange interaction has a point - like character which is modeled by the dirac delta - function . of course , in many cases it is a very good approximation when the wave function of a magnetic impurity is well localized which means that @xmath4 is less than all other relevant lengths present in the system . however , in semiconductors there is one important length , namely the wave length of the itinerant carriers living on the fermi surface , @xmath10 , which can be varied in a wide range . this can be done , _ e.g. _ , by changing the carrier density with the help of a gate voltage . therefore , one can reach a situation where @xmath11 .    what is more interesting is that even in the case when @xmath12 it can happen that in a given system the rkky spin density oscillations appear only due to a finite value of @xmath4 and can not appear if @xmath6 . such a situation takes place , for example , when magnetic impurities are deposited on a surface of a paramagnetic bulk sample . the wave function of the itinerant carriers in the sample is equal to zero on its surface and therefore for a point - like model of the exchange interaction , @xmath6 , the rkky spin density oscillations do not appear and can not couple the spins of the magnetic impurities on the surface . therefore , no magnetic ordering will take place . however , in reality @xmath9 and the exchange interaction will definitely produce the spin density oscillations with the subsequent magnetic structure of the impurity spins on the surface of the sample . thus , in this system a finite value of @xmath4 creates itinerant surface magnetism .    some efforts to consider a finite range of the exchange interactions were made in the research devoted to ferromagnetism in heusler alloys @xcite . an essential drawback of the models of the exchange interactions in those attempts was that in the limit @xmath13 the models did not reproduce point - like exchange interactions . however , it is desirable to reproduce the dirac delta - function in the limit @xmath13 because it is often used in many theoretical models and therefore one would like to make a comparison with traditional theories in the limit @xmath13 . a finite range exchange interaction which in the limit @xmath13 gives the traditional dirac delta - function model has been used in ref . to calculate the rkky exchange integrals and in ref . to study the rkky spin density oscillations in a mesoscopic ring . in particular , in ref . it has been demonstrated that a finite value of @xmath4 removes an unphysical divergency of the rkky integral at zero distance while in ref . it has been shown that any finite value of @xmath4 always becomes important if the number of the electrons in the ring is large enough . however , the research in ref . represented mainly a numerical experiment and , as a result , did not clarify the physical role played by the localization radius of the impurity spin . in addition , the rkky spin density oscillations in that study were also present in the limiting case @xmath13 and therefore a finite value of @xmath4 did not play any key role in the formation of the rkky spin density oscillations .    in the present work we use the model of ref . for a finite range exchange interaction in a system where the rkky spin density oscillations appear only if @xmath9 . the system represents a half - infinite 1d qw with a magnetic impurity on its edge . since the wave function of the itinerant carriers ( electrons to be definite ) is zero on the edge of the wire , the rkky spin density oscillations exist only if @xmath4 is finite . to understand the physical role played by the impurity spin localization radius in the rkky spin density oscillations we solve the problem _ analytically _ in the case when @xmath12 and calculate the coordinate dependence of the rkky oscillations in this system . we demonstrate that at large distances this dependence is identical to the one of the rkky oscillations which one would obtain in the limiting case @xmath6 of our model but for an infinite 1d qw with electrons whose mass is _ strongly _ modified by the localization radius of the impurity spin .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ fp ] we mathematically formulate the problem and solve it in section [ ds ] using the feynman diagram approach . in connection with recent experiments we make a suggestion in section [ sdsrkkyi ] about directionality of surface rkky interaction . conclusions are given in section [ s ] .", "as mentioned in the introduction the system represents ( see fig . [ figure_1 ] ) a half - infinite 1d qw with , _ e.g. _ , a magnetic ion on its edge . it could be also another object , natural or artificial ( _ e.g. _ , a quantum dot with odd electron number ) with non - vanishing total spin @xmath3 . the electrons in a half - infinite 1d qw have eigenenergies @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the effective mass of the conduction electrons and @xmath16 is not the electron momentum because the translational invariance is broken . the quantum number @xmath16 takes all real values except zero , @xmath17 . the eigenstates @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the spin quantum number , in the coordinate representation are @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the size of the system . to consider a half - infinite system we take the limit @xmath22 in the subsequent calculations . since the momentum operator is @xmath23 , one can see that @xmath24 is not the eigenfunction of @xmath25 and thus , as mentioned above , the quantum number @xmath16 is not the electron momentum . the electronic density vanishes on the edge of the wire . far from the edge it has the value which it would have in an infinite 1d qw with the fermi momentum @xmath26 ( in the infinite case it would be real momentum ) , @xmath27 in the region close to the edge the electronic density shows oscillations known as the friedel oscillations . the half - infinite quantum wire can be modeled by the following potential : @xmath28    the second quantized hamiltonian of the half - infinite 1d qw without the magnetic impurity thus reads in the coordinate basis as @xmath29\\hat{\\psi}_\\sigma(x)+\\\\ & + \\sum_\\sigma\\int dx\\:u(x)\\hat{\\psi}_\\sigma^\\dagger(x)\\hat{\\psi}_\\sigma(x ) , \\end{split } \\label{h_0}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the electronic creation and annihilation field operators of the half - infinite 1d qw . when the magnetic impurity is deposited on the edge of the half - infinite 1d qw , the electronic spin density interacts through the exchange interaction with the impurity spin . the corresponding second quantized hamiltonian is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the vector of the pauli matrices and for @xmath34 we use the model of ref . , @xmath35 . \\label{j_mod}\\ ] ]    the total hamiltonian describing the rkky electronic spin density oscillations is given by the sum @xmath36    to get the rkky oscillations and understand the physical role of the finite impurity spin distribution @xmath4 on those oscillations one may consider @xmath37 as a perturbation . in the next section we will implement this perturbation theory on the language of the feynman diagram expansion . ( color online ) the first order feynman diagram contributing to the electronic spin density oscillations . unlike the traditional way to draw the propagators by straight lines the incoming and outgoing propagators are drawn using wavy lines to stress that they take into account the friedel oscillations of the electronic density which are present in a half - infinite 1d qw without the magnetic impurity.,width=8 ]", "to obtain the electronic spin density we first have to find the imaginary - time ( or matsubara ) one - particle green s function , @xmath38 where the angular brackets stand for the thermal average and the electronic field operators are in the imaginary - time heisenberg representation , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the chemical potential .    the exact electronic spin density is obtained from the imaginary - time green s function as @xmath41 , \\label{sd}\\ ] ] where the trace is taken in the spin space . the rkky oscillations of the electronic spin density are contained in the contribution to @xmath42 of the first order in the perturbation hamiltonian @xmath37 . the corresponding feynman diagram is shown in fig .

( [ q_qxqx ] ) that when @xmath6 , the matrix @xmath57 vanishes and no rkky spin density oscillations appear in the system . this is in agreement with our earlier qualitative discussions . below we only consider the most interesting case of zero temperature @xmath59 . ( [ q_qxqx ] ) we obtain from eq .

scale clumping of the dust . the impact of dust extinction on both the colors of the galaxy itself and on the statistical extinction and reddening of background sources depends also on the small scale clumping of the dust ( e.g. ,  witt and gordon , 1996 ; berlind _ et al . _ 1997 , hereafter b97 ) and on its concentration towards the spiral arms ( white and keel , 1992 , hereafter wk92 ; keel and white 1995 ) .    even though galaxy disks ( and their associated dust ) may cover only a few percent of the sky to redshifts @xmath12 , they affect particularly interesting lines - of - sight . for example , the true rate of damped ly-@xmath10 systems depends sensitively on the degree to which the detectability of the qso ( usually in the optical ) is affected by potential dust extinction in the absorber ( bartelmann and loeb , 1996 ) . similarly , the incidence of multiple gravitational images and of lensing magnification caused by disk galaxies may be altered by the presence of dust that may prevent the cataloging of the source ( rodrigues - williams et.al . 1994 ; boyle et.al . 1988 ) . measuring the optical depths of spiral disks is most straightforward with background light sources , because the influence of dust scattering is minimized , leaving only extinction . however , background point sources are insufficient to study the spatial structure of dust extinction . keel ( 1983 ) and white and keel ( 1992 ) pioneered a technique to map the extinction distribution in a galaxy , by analyzing the light distribution of a background galaxy shining through it . using three pairs of galaxies , they found that in these systems the face - on b - band extinction near the spiral arms was @xmath13 , and @xmath14 in the interarm - regions . as the results of such an extinction analysis depend on the objects chosen , the radial range probed , the available spatial resolution and the wavelengths of observation , it is important to increase the number of case studies and employed techniques to arrive at a coherent and comprehensive picture of dust extinction in spiral galaxies . here we present an analysis of the projected galaxy pair ugc  5041 , following the approach of wk92 . the forground galaxy is a highly inclined sc at @xmath15  km / s , with a background galaxy at @xmath16km / s , whose center is projected at a mean distance of @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) from ugc  5041 s center . we decided to present another case study , to complement the existing small set of studies already in the literature ( wk92 and b97 ) , because the particular galaxy pair , the observations and analysis differ in several relevant aspects :    * the background galaxy behind ugc  5041 was found only in h@xmath19 m ) images ( gary bernstein , _ priv . _ ) ; it is completely obscured in the b - band . hence , the galaxy pair is subject to different selection biases than optically selected pairs and has the potential to yield an optical depth estimate of @xmath20 . * given the relatively small projected separation ( @xmath21 ) and qualitatively high optical depths ( see also ngc  3314 , keel 1983 ) , our analysis is based solely on near - ir observations ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) . * from the observations we calculate the _ area - weighted optical depth distibution _ , p@xmath3 , near the half - light radius of the foreground disk this is the most immediately relevant quantity for assessing the extinction statistics of background sources . * we apply the derived p@xmath3 to explore the under - representation of qsos lensed by spiral galaxies and of qsos with low redshift damped ly-@xmath10 absorption . the paper is organized as follows . in  2 we describe the data reduction and analysis . in  3 we describe the estimates of the optical depth distribution and its errors ; in  4 we discuss the implications of this estimate and in  5 we present the conclusions .", "the h - band ( 1.6@xmath24 m ) images were taken on september 19 , 1996 at the 2.3 m bok telescope on kitt peak using the 256x256 ircam with a scale of @xmath25/pixel . bias and dark frames were obtained at the beginning of the night . the data were taken by integrating on the object for 60 seconds , shifting to the sky ( @xmath26 off - set ) for 60 seconds , then returning to the galaxy and repeating the procedure . each telescope dither was to a slightly different part of the sky near the object . the total integration time on the galaxy pair was 3600  sec ( 60 object - sky image pairs ) . in the subsequent analysis , eleven of the final images were discarded , because crucial portions of the image were corrupted by bad pixels . most of the data reduction was carried out with iraf . the bias and dark frames were subtracted from all galaxy and sky frames . subsequently , the two sky flats bracketing an object image were averaged , normalized and used to flatfield the interleafing galaxy image . the resulting images were then aligned using the foreground galaxy center and co - added . reduced and flux - calibrated i - band(7800 ) and the b - band(4400 ) ccd images of ugc5041 were kindly provided by gary bernstein . they were originally taken on february 27 and 29 , 1992 , respectively , at the 2.3 m bok telescope on kitt peak . since the optical images had different pixel scales ( 0.3@xmath27/pixel ) , the h - band image need to be de - magnified and aligned . all photon - noise and flux - calibration errors were propagated throughout these steps , but in the end found to be negligible compared to the systematic modeling uncertainties discussed below . figure 1 shows the resulting images in b , i and h. it is apparent that in the b - band the extinction is high , for the most part obscuring the background galaxy . only one bright region is shining through ( in the upper left part of the foreground galaxy ) , explaining why this galaxy pair was never found in optical surveys . qualitatively , the i - band image hints at @xmath28 , as the dust extinction is obvious , but not overwhelming . the rightmost panel of figure 1 shows that dust extinction effects in the h - band are subtle . however , we do not neglect the h - band extinction . with the three images aligned , scaled , and flux - calibrated we can proceed to estimate the optical depths in the foreground galaxy . the recorded images are composed of light from the foreground galaxy and of attenuated light from the background galaxy . the equation for radiative transfer in this case is simply ( see also wk92 ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the wavelength of the observations , and x the image position . since the extincted source is well behind the extincting dust we neglect scattering into the line of site . from eq.(1 ) one can see that as a first step we must subtract the foreground galaxy light , @xmath32 , at each wavelength in the region where the two galaxies overlap . since the edge - on background galaxy is an almost linear feature , an estimate of the foreground galaxy light was made by interpolating the adjacent foreground light across it . this fit was then subtracted from the overlapping region , and the associated errors were an important source of uncertainty in the final optical depth determination . indeed , the hii regions and the spiral arms in the foreground galaxy rendered the b - band image too irregular to get an accurate estimate for the fit . therefore , the b - band data was not used in the subsequent analysis . the h - band image on the other hand , had little error in subtracting out the foreground light , because the foreground galaxy contributed little to the light in the overlapping region to begin with . to get an independent error estimate for @xmath33 we analyzed the opposite side of the foreground galaxy , where there are no over - lapping galaxies , and carried out the same interpolation the residuals provide us with an accuracy estimate of @xmath34 in i for the foreground subtraction . next the corrected background light , @xmath35 , should be divided by an estimate of its _ un_extincted value , @xmath36 , to solve for @xmath37 . although direct estimates of @xmath36 are unknown , because we can not neglect the foreground extinction even in the h - band . fortunately , the intrinsic i - h color of highly inclined disk galaxies is quite uniform . for example , bernstein et al ( 1994 ) find i - h=1.88@xmath380.08 magnitudes for their sample of 21 spirals , with 2 outlier galaxies that are bluer by 0.4 magnitudes than the mean . hence , we have a very good guess of the background galaxy s color in absence of the foreground galaxy . by dividing the observed i - h flux ratio by the un - extincted , or intrinsic , value , we can estimate @xmath29 directly via @xmath39 to obtain a well defined map of @xmath29 we created a mask that isolated the image regions of significant background galaxy flux in h. the pixel values in the masked ratio - image can then be converted into a histogram of @xmath29 , which is shown in figure 2 . our data span a range of @xmath40  kpc in the plane of the foreground galaxy , but no systematic radial variation of the extinction was found . uncertainties in the optical depths were calculated by standard propagation of errors ( bevington 1992 ) , accounting for the foreground subtraction and the intrinsic color ratio variance . intrinsic color ratio errors contributed 0.1 to @xmath41 , and the error contribution from the subtraction depended on @xmath33 . the final median error in @xmath29 was found to be @xmath380.13 .", "our data provide a direct estimate of the differential extinction probability distribution @xmath43 . for broader applications it would be useful to correct this value to face - on and to convert it to estimates of @xmath44 . the radial range ( @xmath45 to @xmath46  kpc ) covered by our estimate of p@xmath47 is quite limited , but of particular interest . first , because damped ly-@xmath10 absorbers have sizes @xmath48  kpc ( briggs et . al . 1989 ) . second , because the einstein ring radius for distant galaxies is @xmath49  kpc(e.g . schneider et . al . 1992 ) . as a first step and benchmark , we estimate @xmath44 by assuming an extinction curve , @xmath50 , similar to the milky way s , ( e.g. mathis , 1990 ) . under this assumption the face - on value of @xmath44 is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 ( mathis 1990 ) . the inclination angle , i , of the foreground galaxy was found by fitting isophotes . assuming an edge - on axis ratio of 0.19 for ugc  5041 s stellar disk we find an inclination angle of @xmath53 ; the inclination error turned out to be negligible in the subsequent analysis .    a pixel - to - pixel histogram of the face - on optical extinction , @xmath44 , derived under these assumptions is shown in figure 3 . the distribution of the face - on @xmath44 is approximately gaussian with @xmath54 , and a variance of @xmath55 .      in converting @xmath29 to @xmath44 we assumed so far that the extinction curve in the foreground galaxy was similar to the milky way s . however , the ir extinction was derived over an extended region of the foreground galaxy , as each @xmath56 pixel subtends @xmath57 on a side at a distance of @xmath58mpc . casual inspection of nearby galaxy images and quantitative studies ( see e.g. ,  witt and gordon , 1996 ; wk92 , b97 ) make it clear that the dust is quite clumpy on much smaller scales . in this section we investigate how much dust inhomogeneities affect our estimates of p(@xmath44 ) by using a simple model to derive an effective coefficient , @xmath59 , for clumpy extinction . following b97 we consider an area a in the foreground galaxy , covered by one pixel , within which a fraction @xmath60 is covered by material with an @xmath61 times greater extinction curve than the rest of the area . the incoming intensity @xmath62 , emerges as @xmath63 , averaged over the area a : @xmath64 carrying out the integration and denoting @xmath65 where , @xmath66 gives @xmath59 . in eq . 6 @xmath67 is the mean v extinction , equal to 0.34 , derived in  3.1 . if @xmath60 is set to zero in eq 6 then the measured , or effective , extinction will be equal to the mean . qualitatively the situation differs most for @xmath68 , where we obtain @xmath69 for a ratio of optical depths , x @xmath70 . very similar estimates for @xmath71 have been derived empirically by b97 ( their figure 3 ) . the histogram for @xmath72 , the clumpy extinction case , is shown by the dotted lines in figure 2 . the mean extinction in v has increased from 0.34 to 0.41 , with a commensurate increase of the dispersion . note , that the mean has changed by more than the measurement errors . therefore , the assumed extinction curve is the dominant of uncertainty in our analysis .", "optical depths through galaxy disks have been derived several ways by different authors ( keel 1983 , keel and white 1995 , james and puxley 1995 , b97 ) . each analysis had to rely on different sets of assumption , such as intrinsic galaxy symmetry ( wk92 , b97 ) , _ case  b _ recombination ratios for balmer lines ( james and puxley 1995 ) , and intrinsic near - ir colors of galaxies ( this paper ) . it is interesting to explore to which extent the results are impacted by the different techniques . james and puxley ( 1995 ) found quite high extinction values from analyzing h@xmath73/h@xmath10 ratios , seen though the center of ngc3314 . these values could be due to the small impact parameters of the probed lines of sight , or because the extinction intrinsic to the hii regions has been under - corrected . wk92 and b97 have estimated extinction by broad - band photometric methods , wk92 using ccd data , b97 using data that extend to @xmath74 m . referring all extinction values to face - on and the b - band , we find a mean of @xmath75 for ugc  5041 at @xmath76 using our clumpy model , which has an effective extinction curve similar to b97 . keel and white ( 1995 ) list @xmath77 at somewhat larger radii , and b97 find @xmath78 in an inter - arm region at @xmath79 . b97 also find @xmath80 in the dust - lanes near the arms , for which detailed case studies of nearby galaxies ( e.g. ,  elmegreen 1980 and rix and rieke 1993 ) have already shown that @xmath81 . even though we have analyzed a purely infrared - selected pair of galaxies , and have based our analysis on near - ir data , it appears that our results are quite consistent with the optical analyses , implying that the basic result of semi - transparent disks is not simply a selection effect .      as mentioned above , dust in foreground galaxies will dim and redden distant background objects , such as qsos , that appear in close projection . on the other hand , the mass concentration associated with the intervening galaxies may brighten the background source through gravitational lensing ( hutchings 1990 ; bartelmann et . al . 1996 ) . hence the observed incidence rate of close alignments between background sources and foreground galaxies depends on the competition between the two effects .    here we show how to use @xmath82 to estimate the first effect , focusing on optically selected quasars that lie within @xmath83 @xmath84  kpc of galaxies , such as qsos lensed by spiral galaxies , or qsos with low - redshift damped ly-@xmath10 absorbers . the radial range ( @xmath45 to @xmath85  kpc covered by our estimate of p@xmath47 is quite limited , but of particular interest . first , because damped ly-@xmath10 absorbers have sizes @xmath48  kpc ( briggs et . al . 1989 ) . we take from peterson ( 1997 , p.  174 ) the integrated number  magnitude relation for quasars brighter than @xmath86 : @xmath87 for objects whose light passes through a foreground galaxy , the magnitude limit of any survey is effectively @xmath88 , where @xmath67 is the optical depth at the wavelength of the survey . given a probability distribution @xmath89 we would expect such sources to be under - represented by a factor of : @xmath90 as figure  3 shows @xmath89 is well approximated by @xmath91 which leads to @xmath92 for the derived values of @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , @xmath96 , this results in @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively . hence the chance of finding lensed of damped ly-@xmath10 absorbed quasars ( with @xmath99 ) in such close projection ( @xmath100  kpc ) to spiral disks is suppressed by about a factor of two due to dust extinction , in good agreement with the independent estimate based on the milky way gas - to - dust ratio by perna , loeb and bartelmann ( 1997 ) .", "we have presented and analyzed h , i and b band images of the projected galaxy pair ugc  5041 , in order to explore the distribution of dust extinction that light suffers while crossing the highly inclined foreground galaxy disk . this galaxy pair is completely obscured in the optical , and hence could have lead to @xmath101 ; this system also provides optical depth constraints at quite small impact parameters .    after removing the light contribution from the foreground galaxy , we compared , pixel by pixel , the observed i - h color of the ( extincted ) background galaxy to its expected intrinsic i - h color , which can be estimated to @xmath102  mag . this comparison resulted in a direct estimate of the distribution of @xmath103 , with @xmath104 . for a homogeneous dust distribution this translates into a face - on v - band optical depth of @xmath105 , for clumpy dust this corresponds to @xmath106 , with dispersion of @xmath55 and @xmath107 in @xmath44 .    despite the different selection criteria ( which would have permitted to arrive at much higher optical depths ) and an analysis based solely on near - ir data , these optical depths are consistent with the values found by wk92 and b97 , and corroborate that generically @xmath108 in nearby galaxy disks .    using the derived distribution of @xmath82 , we estimated by how much quasars in close projection ( @xmath109  kpc ) are under - represented in optically selected , flux - limited samples ( @xmath110 ) , and found a deficit by a factor of two due to dust extinction . as in many other analyses , the limited spatial resolution , which leads to averaging over areas of differing extinction is an important limitation . we are currently analyzing hst images of ugc5041 to repeat an analogous analysis at vastly improved spatial resolution ."], "summary": "we probe the dust extinction through the foreground disk of the overlapping galaxy pair ugc 5041 by analyzing b , i , and h band images . the inclined foreground disk of this infrared -

[ fig : error ] shows a plot of the error versus a range of algorithmic time steps @xmath3 . [ fig : error ] indicates that , unsurprisingly , the accuracy increases as we decrease the algorithmic time step @xmath3 . when @xmath96 , the error is below @xmath97 . on the other hand , the error behavior in fig . [ fig : error ] for a large algorithmic time step tends to saturate , mirroring the saturation in the effective time step @xmath98 for the dominant mode @xmath64 . [ fig : eff_timestep ] shows a comparison between the dominant effective time step @xmath99 in eq . ( [ eq : dominant - dteff : pfc ] ) and a numerical estimate of the same quantity . the numerical estimate is obtained by calculating @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the total time needed to reach the final state ( a crystalline state without dislocations ) using euler algorithm and @xmath102 is the number of computer steps needed to reach the same state using unconditionally stable algorithms . we find good agreement for @xmath103 , while for @xmath92 , the separation between the analytic and numerical expressions increases . while the agreement at small times steps in unsurprising , the curve provides a useful metric for the optimum algorithmic time step of @xmath104 , for the chosen parameters . when @xmath74 , the ratio of the number of time steps needed to achieve a particular energy using the unconditionally stable versus euler algorithm is approximately @xmath105 ( the ratio of the dominant mode effective time step to the euler time step ) . this is a substantial speedup , and requires minimal analysis to implement the technique .", "in this paper , we have presented an unconditionally stable algorithm applicable to finite difference solutions of the the pfc equation . we have demonstrated that a fixed algorithmic time step driving scheme may provide significant speedup , with a controlled level of accuracy , when compared with euler algorithm . for the representative parameters chosen , a speedup of a factor of 180 was obtained . the analytical results and the numerical results are consistent with an effective time step analysis . although this algorithm allows arbitrarily large algorithmic time steps , caution is indicated , as taking too large an algorithmic time step will yield inaccuracies with little improvement in the overall speedup of the calculation . this saturation in the speedup results from the details of how the system s energy evolution ( and its corresponding microstructural evolution ) is governed by the effective time step , which saturates as the algorithmic time step increases . thus , there is little advantage in too large an algorithmic time step . a method for obtaining a reasonable value for the algorithmic time step @xmath3 is suggested , in which a few test cases are run with different values of @xmath3 to see which one offers a good speedup and maintains the desired accuracy . the analytic form of the effective time step provides a useful guide for deciding how large a time step to select when trading off the obtainable speedup versus the loss of accuracy . we expect the methodology developed in this paper could find extensive applications in a wide class of non - equilibrium systems . for example , it can be straightforwardly applied to the swift - hohenberg equation , given its similarity with the phase field crystal model . additionally , the method also will apply to systems where there is a dominant mode realized at late times , such as is found in diblock co - polymers . this method should allow researchers to dramatically improve the computational efficiency associated with modeling the dynamics of materials systems .", "we thank andrew reid and daniel wheeler for useful discussions . j. s. langer , in _ solids far from equilibrium _ , edited by c. godrche ( cambridge university press , 1992 ) , pp . a. j. bray , theory of phase - ordering kinetics , adv . phys . * 43 * , 357 ( 1994 ) . j. d. gunton , m. san miguel and p. s. sahni , in _ phase transitions and critical phenomena _ , vol . 8 , edited by c. domb and j. l. lebowitz ( new york academic press , 1983 ) pp . 267 . h. furukawa , dynamic scaling assumption for phase separation , adv . * 34 * , 703 ( 1985 ) . j. w. cahn and j. e. hilliard , free energy of a nonuniform system . i. interface free energy , j. chem . * 28 * , 258 ( 1958 ) . s. m. allen and j. w. cahn , a microscopic theory for antiphase boundary motion and its application to antiphase domain coarsening , acta metall . * 27 * , 1085 ( 1979 ) . p. wiltzius and a. cumming , domain growth and wetting in polymer mixtures , phys lett . * 66 * , 3000 ( 1991 ) . r. f. shannon , s. e. nagler , c. r. harkless and r. m. nicklow , time - resolved x - ray - scattering study of ordering kinetics in bulk single - crystal cu@xmath106au , phys . b * 46 * , 40 ( 1992 ) . b. d. gaulin , s. spooner and y. morii , kinetics of phase separation in mn@xmath107cu@xmath108 , phys . lett . * 59 * , 668 ( 1987 ) . n. mason , a. n. pargellis and b. yurke , scaling behavior of two - time correlations in a twisted nematic liquid crystal , phys . lett . * 70 * , 190 ( 1993 ) . i. chuang , n. turok and b. yurke , late - time coarsening dynamics in a nematic liquid crystal , phys lett . * 66 * , 2472 ( 1991 ) . laguna and w. h. zurek , density of kinks after a quench : when symmetry breaks , how big are the pieces ?

? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and radio wavelengths @xcite . the interpretation of the number of lensed sources that are detected in a flux - limited survey depends critically on the factors by which the sources are magnified . lensed objects are drawn from a parent population with smaller fluxes than their unlensed counterparts . one therefore samples a fainter portion of the source luminosity function and a more distant range of source redshifts . this well - known `` magnification bias '' also affects the relative frequencies of different lens morphologies . four - image lenses are more highly magnified than two - image lenses , and are subject to a stronger magnification bias .    early studies of lens statistics used lens models with circular symmetry , such as singular isothermal spheres , for which the magnification bias is easy to calculate ( e.g. , * ? ? ? . however , symmetric models only produce 2-image lenses and can not be used to interpret the statistics of each morphology separately . more recently , numerical studies have been performed with more realistic elliptical lens models ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? while numerical calculations are certainly valuable , they tend to obscure the roles of competing contributions to what is being calculated . analytic forms for such things as luminosity functions and magnifications may be no more accurate , but they produce results that are more readily understood .    with this motivation we examined a number of simple elliptical lens models and found one for which the mean magnification can be computed analytically , for both 2-image and 4-image lensing . the model is a singular isothermal sphere in an external shear field ( sis+xs ) , which is physically motivated and widely used .    in the next section we briefly review the mathematics and the qualitative features of lensing by non - circular potentials . in  [ sec : calculation ] , we specialize to the sis+xs and derive the analytic expressions for all of the relevant quantities , including the mean magnification . finally , in   [ sec : numerical ] we compare our result to the full numerical evaluation of the magnification distribution , and remark on applications to the interpretation of lensing statistics .", "lensing theory is well developed and has been expounded in detail by @xcite , among others . the particular problem of lensing by elongated potentials has been lucidly described by @xcite . here we briefly review only those concepts that are required to follow the calculations presented in   [ sec : calculation ] . we use the conventional definition of the lens potential , @xmath2 in which @xmath3 is the newtonian gravitational potential of the galaxy ; @xmath4 is the sky - plane angular displacement ; @xmath5 is the line - of - sight coordinate ; and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the angular - diameter distances to the lens , to the source , and between lens and source , respectively . with this definition , the correspondence between source position @xmath9 and image position @xmath4 is @xmath10 [ eq : lens - equation ] the inverse magnification of a particular image @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 which is negative when the image and source have opposite parity . for a survey in which sources are selected by total flux , the relevant quantity is the total magnification @xmath13 , the sum of the unsigned magnifications of all images of a source located at @xmath9 . most of the observed galaxy lenses can be described ( at least qualitatively ) using centrally concentrated , singular potentials . if the isopotential contours are only moderately elliptical , such potentials produce either 1 , 2 , or 4 images of a background source , in locations that can be understood with reference to the curves plotted in the top two panels of figure  [ fig : sisxs ] . the curves are plotted for the sis+xs , but the following discussion applies to many singular elliptical potentials .    for a source outside the _ radial caustic _ , one image is produced outside the 12 _ transition locus_. a source on the radial caustic corresponds to one image on the 12 transition locus and another image at the origin , with zero flux . if the source moves from the radial caustic to the _ astroid caustic _ , the outer image moves to the outer 24 transition locus , while the inner image acquires a nonzero flux and moves to the inner 24 transition locus . on the astroid caustic , three images are produced : one on each of the 24 transition loci ; and one on the _ critical curve _ , with infinite flux . inside the astroid caustic , the latter image splits into two images with finite flux , and the result is one image in each of the regions marked `` 4 '' in figure  [ fig : sisxs ] . the caustics and critical curve are well known to those who study gravitational lensing , but the transition loci receive less attention than they deserve  in particular , they are crucial for our calculation of mean magnification .    for more elongated potentials , two cusps of the astroid caustic pierce the radial caustic and are often referred to as `` naked cusps . '' the relevant curves in the source plane and the image plane are shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : sisxs ] . a source inside a naked cusp corresponds to three images located on the same side of the origin as the source  one in each of the three regions marked `` 3 '' in figure  [ fig : sisxs ] . if the source position is random , the cross section for producing 4 images , @xmath14 , is the total area within the 4-image region of the source plane ( marked `` 4 '' in figure  [ fig : sisxs ] ) . the 2-image cross - section is the area of the 2-image region , and the 3-image cross - section is the area of the 3-image region . the cross - section for multiple imaging is @xmath15 . the mean magnification for multiple - image lensing is the average value of the total magnification for all source positions that result in more than one ] where the integral of @xmath16 extends over the region in the image plane in which multiple images are found . [ eq : mean - magnification ] holds because the jacobian for the @xmath17 transformation is equal to the magnification . alternatively , one can visualize the calculation as follows . because lensing conserves surface brightness , a source consisting of uniform brightness in the region formed by the union of the caustics will result in an image of uniform brightness within the union of the transition loci . the mean magnification for multiple - image lensing , which we denote @xmath18 , is the ratio of the image area to the source area . the mean magnification of 4-image lenses , denoted @xmath19 , is the ratio of 4-image region of image space and the 4-image region of source space . the mean magnification of 2-image and 3-image lenses can be visualized in a similar manner .    of the approximately 100 observed cases of multiple - image gravitational lensing by galaxies , almost none require naked cusps for explanation . the one possible exception is apm  08279 + 5255 @xcite . because naked - cusp systems are apparently rare in nature , and because the calculations described below can not be done analytically for naked - cusp systems , in this paper most of our attention will be on systems in which the astroid caustic is interior to the radial caustic .    in that case , to find the cross - sections and mean magnifications for 2-image and 4-image lensing , it is sufficient to calculate the areas enclosed by the radial caustic ( @xmath20 ) , astroid caustic ( @xmath21 ) , the 12 transition locus ( @xmath22 ) , and the inner and outer 24 transition loci ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) . as long as the astroid caustic is contained entirely within the radial caustic , we have : @xmath25", "we concentrate on the case of a singular isothermal sphere in an external shear field ( sis+xs ) , for which the potential is @xmath26    here @xmath27 are polar coordinates in the image plane , @xmath28 is the einstein ring radius ( which sets the mass scale of the lens ) , and @xmath1 is the magnitude of the external shear . the sis is an idealization of a spherical dark - matter halo with a flat rotation curve , and the external shear is a non - circular perturbation . this potential can be thought of as a truncated multipole expansion of the lens potential ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? the sis+xs has been used extensively in the literature to model observed lenses , often as a starting point for more complicated models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    by computing the second derivatives of this potential and using eq .

class , browne et al.2002 ; winn et al . our analytic results are therefore directly relevant to this case , in which previous calculations were performed by numerical integration and monte carlo simulation .    for example , the jvas and class surveys have found roughly equal numbers of 2-image and 4-image lenses , a result that various authors have struggled to interpret because it seems to require a magnification bias for 4-image lensing that is larger than expected @xcite . a resolution considered by these authors is that the matter distribution in the lens galaxies is systematically more elongated than the observed light distribution of elliptical galaxies . we can estimate of the required value of @xmath1 from our calculations of mean magnification . the ratio of 4-image lenses to 2-image lenses , including the effect of magnification bias , is @xmath101 for the sis+xs model and a @xmath100 luminosity function , the result is @xmath102 this result is rather specialized , depending as it does on the assumption of a particular lens model and source luminosity function , but it has the virtue of being analytic . to obtain equal numbers of 4-image and 2-image systems we require @xmath103 , for which @xmath104 and @xmath105 are both approximately 5 .    for @xmath67 one must also consider the possibility of 3-image systems produced by naked cusps . in this case the computation of areas in the image plane must be done numerically . figure  [ fig : areas ] shows the results of a numerical calculation of the relative areas of the 2-image , 3-image , and 4-image regions of the image plane , for @xmath106 . as before , if @xmath100 then this plot can also be interpreted as the expected fractions of 2-image , 3-image , and 4-image lenses discovered in a flux - limited survey . for @xmath46 the results are identical to our analytic formula . for @xmath107 , naked - cusp images are possible but occur with vanishing probability ;

linearities @xcite , which are exceedingly difficult to achieve at the single photon level . nevertheless , a partial bsm can be realized with a simple beam - splitter ( bs ) . to obtain a successful bsm , the two photons involved must be indistinguishable , i.e. must be in the same spatial , temporal , spectral and polarization mode in order to bunch at the bs . the experimental feasibility of a partial bsm has already been demonstrated for polarization qubits @xcite as well as for time - bin qubits @xcite , but never over tens of kilometers as required for communication under realistic circumstances . however , a realization with distant sources implies additional experimental difficulties , in particular , if the photons are transmitted through optical fibers . a recent experiment @xcite showed , that the major problem is to maintain temporal indistinguishability , because of thermally induced fiber length fluctuations and thus differences in the travelling times . one possibility to relax the length stability requirements is to use photons with a long coherence length . however this requires narrow filters which reduce the production rate of photon pairs . hence longer acquisition times are necessary and the constraints for stability become more severe .    pairs of entangled photons can be obtained by spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) in a @xmath0 nonlinear crystal . in this process a pump photon can be converted with a small conversion efficiency , into two entangled photons , according to conservation of energy and momentum . however , photons produced by spdc show generally a large bandwidth , corresponding to a short coherence length . different approaches have been considered to increase the coherence length of photons obtained by such a spontaneous process . one possibility is to place the nonlinear crystal in a cavity @xcite . another possibility is to use strongly non - degenerate photons created in long crystals . bandwidths of 60ghz have recently been reported for photon pairs at 800 and 1600 nm @xcite . but this solution is not suitable if both photons are wanted to be at telecommunication wavelengths . finally a last and simple approach that we adopt here consists in filtering a small range out of the broad emitted spectrum . note that this demands a high yield of the photon source , in order to compensate the associated losses , as mentioned above .    in this paper , we present an experiment proving the feasibility of a partial bsm over two times 25 km of optical fibers . we create two degenerate photons at 1550 nm by spdc in a periodically poled lithium niobate ( ppln ) waveguide . in order to increase their coherence length , their initial spectral bandwidth of 80 nm is filtered down to 0.8 nm ( 100ghz ) , corresponding to a fourier limited coherence length of 1.3 mm fwhm in air . as previously shown , this kind of waveguide features a high conversion efficiency @xcite . the two photons are sent to a 25 km long balanced mach - zehnder interferometer and the necessary indistinguishability is verified by performing a hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) experiment @xcite . this experiment represents a first step towards the realization of entanglement swapping with sources , which are separated by a long distance . in section2 we calculate the theoretical predictions for our particular system , showing that beside the hom interference , a conjunction of one and two photon interference is expected . in section3 , we present the experiment and analyze the results , followed by a discussion on the dispersion cancellation effect in section4 . a conclusion is given in section5 .", "to prove indistinguishability between two photons after travelling 25 km each , we perform a hom experiment . thereby the two indistinguishable photons , entering a bs in two different input modes , are superposed . due to their bosonic nature , they bunch together and exit always in the same output - mode . the coincidence rate between two detectors , one at each output of the bs , is hence dropping to zero . these second order quantum interferences only appear if the two photons are completely indistinguishable in their polarization , spectral , temporal and spatial modes . by shifting now the relative arrival time of one photon in respect to the other , this drop in the coincidence rate can be observed as a dip within their overlapping range , the so - called `` hom - dip '' . while a complete demonstration of a partial bsm for independent photons is usually realized with independent sources and a pulsed pump beam @xcite , this is not needed here . since we want to check the temporal indistinguishability due to the transmission in fibers , it suffices to take one source creating pairs of photons , split them , and recombine them , after each has travelled in a different fiber . a cw laser is therefore sufficient . as depicted in fig.1 , the two photons to be overlapped emerge from the same source completely indistinguishable , and thus only can be separated probabilistically , e.g. by a 50/50 beam - splitter ( bs1 ) . the two outputs of bs1 are connected to 25 km of standard optical fiber and recombined at bs2 , which forms a balanced mach - zehnder interferometer . an important consequence therefore is that both single - photon and two - photon interferences are expected as discussed below . we label @xmath1 the creation operator of input of bs1 , evolving as _ @xmath2 _ , @xmath3 and @xmath4 representing the upper and lower path of the interferometer . the evolution of the phase shift is described as _ , with @xmath6 . suppose that we have a two photon state at input @xmath7 of bs1 , described by @xmath8 . @xmath9 and @xmath10 stand for the creation operators of respectively one photon at frequency @xmath11 and one at @xmath12 , and @xmath13 characterizes the spectral distribution of the created photons .    the evolution through the two beam splitters together with the phase shift results in a final state , which is described by    @xmath14    with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being the creation operators of the two output modes of the second beam - splitter ( bs2 ) . in order to calculate the coincidence probability @xmath17 , we consider @xmath18 to be gaussian and integrate over the temporal resolution of our detectors of the order of 1ns . taking into account only the terms containing @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath17 is therefore calculated to be proportional to    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the pump frequency and @xmath23 the bandwidth of the down converted photons . note that this calculation only holds true for a temporal path difference @xmath24 much smaller than the time resolution of the detectors . the calculated probability @xmath17 is plotted in fig .  2 . the form can be explained as a superposition of franson - type @xmath25 2-photon interferences @xcite and a hong - ou - mandel dip @xmath26 @xcite . the temperature fluctuations are too large to resolve the franson - type interferences , which are on a @xmath27-scale , but small enough to observe the hong - ou - mandel dip ( mm scale ) . hence the maximally attainable visibility of the average count - rate in this measurement is 50% . the width of the dip corresponds to the convolution of the two wave - packets . the solid line represents the average probability of coincidences as it will be measured .", "the experimental setup is shown in fig.[mandeldip ] . to create the two photons to be superposed , we pump a ppln waveguide @xcite with 35@xmath28w of a cw diode laser at 783 nm . pairs of collinear energy - time entangled photons are created by spdc @xcite with a conversion efficiency of the order of @xmath29 . the waveguide is temperature stabilized at the degeneracy point , where signal and idler are emitted at 1566 nm and coupled into a standard fiber with an efficiency of 18% for each photon . this coupling efficiency is essentially limited by the mismatch between the guided modes in the waveguide and the collecting fiber . filtering is achieved by a fiber bragg grating with 0.8 nm fwhm . this kind of filter reflects more than 99% of the light in the chosen spectral window . a circulator is used to recover the filtered reflected light . the pump light is sufficiently blocked by the bragg grating and the circulator , so no further absorbing filters are required . signal and idler photons are split up probabilistically by a 50/50 beam - splitter ( bs1 ) . these two output modes travel through a mach - zehnder - interferometer configuration , with each arm 25.3 km long . note that the most demanding point is the stability of the length difference between the two arms . it needs to be kept within the coherence length of the photons during the measurement without any active stabilization , as this is impractical in field applications . the two fibers are on separate spools , thus a local change in temperature affects the whole fiber length . this is not the case in telecom fiber networks , where a local change in temperature only concerns a certain part of the fibers . hence we can expect to have less fluctuations there , as already measured in former experiments @xcite to be of the order of a few mm per day for a 10 km link . even though the two fibers should behave the same way for temperature fluctuations affecting the two spools , we figured out a stability within 0.1k / h to be necessary . this is reached by protecting them from air draught in the laboratory and close to the conditions in the field .    to observe a hom - dip , the arrival time of one photon at bs2 is scanned with respect to the other one . this delay is provided by slightly lengthening one arm mechanically . a maximal length difference of 11 mm is covered by a computer controlled step motor device .    in order to insure indistinguishability at the beam - splitter ( bs2 ) , a fiber optical polarization controller ( pc ) matches the polarization modes of the two arms . at the two outputs of the beam - splitter , photons are detected by single photon ingaas avalanche photodiodes ( apd ) which are peltier cooled to -30@xmath30 . one of them is operated in passive quenching mode @xcite with an efficiency of 7% and a dark count rate of 2khz . this detector triggers the second one which is optically delayed and operated in gated mode with an efficiency of 8% and a dark count probability of around @xmath31 per ns . coincidences between these two detectors are registered by a time - to - digital converter ( tdc ) , where only a 2ns time window is regarded .    in fig.4 , the obtained coincidence count rate is plotted as a function of the difference between the two arms of the mach - zehnder interferometer @xmath32 . the square points show the raw data , and the lower graph the false detection , due to dark counts and accidental coincidences . the black line represents a fit through these points supposing a gaussian shape . a dip with a raw visibility of 37.6% can be observed when the interferometer is exactly balanced which yields a net visibility of 47.3% when the noise is subtracted . although dark counts are an important source of error in an entanglement swapping experiment , the use of two pulsed photon pair sources , like intended in the future setup , will allow one to trigger the detectors . hence the accidental coincidences will be reduce by at least one order of magnitude . in this way , the important figure of merit in this experiment is the net visibility . the dotted line in fig.4 gives the theoretical expected curve of the convolution of two gaussian wave - packets . their width corresponds to the coherence length of the filtered wave - packets , corrected by the refractive index of a stressed optical standard fiber . in former experiments @xcite , this value was found to be 1.8 . the width of the obtained dip is slightly broader than the expected theoretical value . unfortunately , the first order interference terms can not be observed experimentally because of phase shifts during the integration time . so just the mean value over several fringes is recorded , leading to a maximal depth of the dip of 50% .    to resolve these fringes , the path difference would required a stability within one wavelength during the acquisition of every data point . but due to low count - rates , integration times of 50s are necessary and temperature fluctuations during this time prevent their resolution . note that for a temperature length dependence of 4@xmath33 , a stability of @xmath34 would be required to resolve these interference fringes .", "as can be seen from the experimental results , even after two times 25 km neither the visibility nor the width of the hom - dip is significantly altered . in this section we will discuss why chromatic dispersion in optical fibers is cancelled out in our experiment and what it means for further experiments . a detailed discussion can be found in @xcite , where we also took the schemes from . in the scheme below we give a graphic explanation of the cancellation , followed by an analytical calculation . wave packets of a spectral width @xmath35=0.8 nm correspond to a coherence length of @xmath36=4.25ps . even though they are broadened to 430ps after 25 km of standard optical fiber , the form of the obtained 2-photon interference dip still corresponds to the initial coherence length . this can be explained by the following fact . without loss of generality , we consider the case with a non - zero dispersion coefficient in only one arm . light passing through an interferometer is subject to chromatic dispersion like sketched in fig.5 . although our spectra are entirely in the infrared light , we will label the two photons `` red '' ( r ) and `` blue '' ( b ) , to point out their difference in frequency . we assume dispersion only in the upper arm a. interference takes place for two different paths which lead to the same detection scheme and are therefore , even in principle , indistinguishable . the two alternatives here are either both the photons are transmitted or reflected at bs2 , shown as fig5a and fig5b . in the two cases , the blue photon always arrives with the same delay after the red one . as long as no information about the creation time of the photon pair is available , the two cases remain indistinguishable . but as soon as the centers of the two wave - packets are relatively delayed by more than their coherence length , the two possible detection events become distinguishable and the bunching disappears . this also can be understood by calculating the relative delay of the two photons . be @xmath37 the travel time of a light pulse per length unit . mathematically , the effects of fiber dispersion are accounted for by expanding @xmath37 in a taylor series around the center frequency @xmath38 . @xmath39    note that @xmath40 with @xmath41 the group velocity of a wave packet . the chromatic dispersion @xmath42 corresponds to @xmath43 . be @xmath44 , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 the different propagation times of fiber @xmath47 and fiber @xmath48 at frequency  @xmath11 . the time difference @xmath49 of the two cases where the blue photon ( @xmath50 ) passes through fiber  @xmath47 ( @xmath51 ) and the red ( @xmath52 ) through fiber  @xmath48 ( @xmath53 ) , respectively vice versa ( @xmath54 ) and @xmath53 ) is described by    @xmath55    by taking eq.1 and eq.2 , @xmath49 can be calculated as    @xmath56    the length of the two fibers can be adjusted , so that @xmath57 . for energy correlated photons ( @xmath58 ) the terms @xmath59 in eq.3 cancel out . this effect is known as dispersion cancellation . so just the terms in @xmath60 can contribute to @xmath61 and cause a change of the hom - dip . as we obtain a net visibility of 47.3% which is quite close to the theoretical value of 50% , we can conclude , that @xmath62 should be negligibly small .    for the objective of a bell - state measurement with photons originating from different sources , the energy - correlation is no longer fulfilled . in this case , @xmath63 has to be small within the coherence time and dispersion cancellation only works for similar dispersion in both paths . for standard telecom fibers ( smf-28 ) typical values of @xmath42 between 16.8 and 17,9@xmath64 can be found . in our case , that leads to a variation of @xmath37 of 0.14@xmath65 for a bandwidth of 0.8 nm . this means a limitation to less than 30 km , before this variation becomes larger than the coherence length of the photon of 4.25ps . beyond this limit , the fibers have to be chosen to have similar chromatic dispersion or compensated individually in order to still obtain 2-photon interferences . this again leads to a dip width corresponding to the coherence length of the two photons @xcite . equal chromatic dispersion in both arms can , in principle , be compensated by adding a dispersive medium right in front of the detectors with an dispersion index inverse to that of the fibers .    on the other hand , as light is polarized and needs to be in the same mode at bs2 , we have to control the polarization . because of the coherence length of our photons , it does nt depolarize and polarization mode dispersion ( pmd ) does nt significantly affect the results over this distance if high quality fibers are used .", "in conclusion , we realized a proof - of - principle experiment of a long distant hom experiment over two times 25 km . a spdc source creates signal and idler photons at telecom wavelength with 100ghz bandwidth , corresponding to a coherence length of 1.3 mm in air . they pass through a 25 km mach - zehnder interferometer and are recombined on a beam - splitter again . a hom - dip over this range has been observed , achieving a net visibility of 47.3% , which is quite close to the the maximal theoretically value of 50% . this proofs the indistinguishability of photon which travel via different fibers . it has been demonstrated that even after 2@xmath66 km , chromatic dispersion and pmd have no significant impact on the obtained measurements . this represents a first step towards long distance entanglement swapping , as required in real world quantum communication . the following step will be a realization with photons coming from two independent sources . we acknowledge the support of hc photonics for supplying the waveguide . financial support from the swiss nccr -

effect transistor put forward by datta and das already in 1990 @xcite . the merit of this paradigmatic theoretical concept is that it allows , once realized , all - electrical control of electron spins in two - dimensional iii - v semiconductor structures , avoiding any magnetic field . on the other hand , at about the same van houten _ et al . _ published a pioneering both theoretical and experimental study of magnetic focusing of electrons in semiconductor quantum wells @xcite . here the control over the orbital degree of freedom of the carriers is achieved by a perpendicular magnetic field of typically moderate strength , very analogously to the classical cyclotron motion . this effect has been demonstrated both for conduction - band electrons @xcite and for valence - band holes @xcite ; very recently cyclotron orbits in an electron focusing experiment were directly imaged using scanning probe microscopy @xcite . other recent experimental studies have addressed the question whether it is feasible to spatially separate ( and , in turn , separately detect ) carriers in different spin - spilt subbands of a quantum well via such transverse focusing techniques @xcite . in these investigations , the spin splitting of subbands was either provided by a strong in - plane component of the magnetic field @xcite , or , more relevant for the present study , by specific contributions to spin - orbit coupling acting on the spin of carriers in semiconductor quantum wells @xcite . in the latter case , different initial spin states provide via spin - orbit interaction a separation of carriers in real space , an effect which has already attracted also significant theoretical interest @xcite . in the present paper we provide a complementary theoretical study of cyclotron motion and magnetic focusing under the influence of spin - orbit interaction using a fully quantum mechanical approach . a related phenomenon is the predicted _ zitterbewegung _ of carrier wave packets in the presence of spin - orbit coupling @xcite . _ zitterbewegung _ of free electrons described by the four - component dirac equation was originally predicted by schrdinger and occurs for wave packets which contain solutions of the free dirac equation of both positive and negative energy @xcite . in effective models for electrons and holes in semiconductors the intrinsic spin - dependent energy splitting due to spin - orbit coupling can lead to a similar oscillatory _ zitterbewegung_@xcite . however , the latter effect is predicted to occur on time and length scales being much more favorable for experimental detection compared to the situation of free electrons where _ zitterbewegung _ has never been observed so far @xcite . on the other hand , a unifying aspect of these two phenomena is given by the fact that _ zitterbewegung _ of itinerant band carriers in semiconductors occurs due to spin - orbit interaction which can be viewed as the nonrelativistic of the strong coupling between spin and momentum being manifest in the dirac equation . moreover , the interplay between spin - orbit coupling and cyclotron motion in a perpendicular magnetic field was already studied theoretically in some detail in refs . @xcite . here the authors concentrate on semiclassical approximations , and on an analogy between the jaynes - cummings model of atomic transitions in a radiation field and the rashba hamiltonian @xcite in a perpendicular magnetic field , an aspect to be briefly reviewed below . in the present paper we report on numerical evaluations of the full quantum mechanical dynamics of a free electron in a two -

v semiconductor materials to magnetic fields of a few tesla . such fields are somewhat larger than those considered in circumstances of semiclassical approximations neglecting landau quantization , and in this sense our present study is complementary to those previous investigations . for definiteness we will also concentrate on spin - orbit coupling of the rashba type , although also other effective coupling terms can be considered . finally we note that a complementary theoretical study of conduction - band electrons being subject to spin - orbit coupling and a homogeneous _ in - plane electric field _ was given very recently in ref . @xcite . this paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] we summarize the essential properties of the rashba model in a perpendicular magnetic field . we discuss the analogy to the jaynes cummings model of quantum optics , and we describe in detail the initial states used for the numerical simulations of time evolutions to be discussed in section [ results ] . all further technical details can be found in the appendix . we close with conclusions in section [ concl ] .", "we consider an electron in an n - doped quantum well being subject to rashba spin - orbit coupling @xcite and a homogeneous perpendicular magnetic field coupling both to the orbital degrees of freedom as well as to the spin , i.e. the single - particle hamiltonian reads @xmath0 here @xmath1 the the effective band mass , @xmath2 is the two - component kinetic momentum with the canonical momentum @xmath3 and the vector potential @xmath4 generating the magnetic field @xmath5 along the growth direction of the quantum well chosen as the @xmath6-axis , @xmath7 . the effective rashba spin - orbit coupling parameter is denoted by @xmath8 , g is the effective g - factor , @xmath9 the bohr magneton , and @xmath10 are the usual pauli matrices . note that the rashba hamiltonian can be viewed as a momentum - dependent field coupling to the electron spin , an interpretation we will use later on in the discussion of numerical results . moreover , in the following we will assume , without loss of generality , that the product of the electron charge @xmath11 and the magnetic field strength @xmath12 is always positive , @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath5 points along the negative @xmath6-direction .      defining the usual bosonic operators @xmath14 fulfilling @xmath15=1 $ ] and @xmath16 being the magnetic length , the hamiltonian reads @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the cyclotron frequency , and we have defined @xmath19 . the operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 connect different landau levels . note that the hamiltonian ( including the spin - orbit part ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath20 and @xmath21 only , no further orbital operators occur . therefore its eigenstates have the same landau level degeneracy as in the absence of spin - orbit coupling .    fixing a certain intra - landau - level quantum number , we denote by @xmath22 a state in the @xmath23-th landau level with spin direction @xmath24 . then @xmath25 is an eigenstate with energy @xmath26 , and all other eigenstates are of the form @xcite @xmath27 with energy @xmath28 and the amplitudes parametrizing the eigenstates read @xmath29 thus , the energy levels and eigenstates of the system are characterized by the interplay of three energy scales : the cyclotron energy @xmath30 , the zeeman energy @xmath31 , and the rashba energy @xmath32 .      as it was recognized recently in ref . @xcite , the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) is formally equivalent to the jaynes - cummings model for atomic transitions in a radiation field . this model has been studied very intensively in theoretical quantum optics , and the time evolution of orbital and spin operators has been obtained in terms of analytical but rather implicit expressions @xcite . to explore this analogy it is useful to separate the hamiltonian into two commuting parts , @xmath33 , with @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the bare electron mass . then the time evolution of the position operators in the heisenberg picture , @xmath36 can be written as @xcite @xmath37 where the operator - valued frequencies @xmath38 are given by @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 are the usual coordinates of the center of the classical cyclotron orbit which commute with the hamiltonian and are therefore constant in time . the result ( [ acker ] ) is correct but still not very explicit . in particular , the operator character of the quantities @xmath38 poses severe obstacles against evaluating this expression for a given initial state . therefore , in the present work we follow a different route towards the full quantum dynamics by expanding the initial state of the system in terms of its eigenstates .      in the very general considerations so far there was not any necessity to specify the gauge of the vector potential @xmath4 . for the practical calculations to be described below , however , we shall work in the landau gauge @xmath42 where the spinless orbital eigenstates in the absence of spin - orbit coupling have the following well - known form @xmath43 labelled by a wave number @xmath44 corresponding to translational invariance in the @xmath45-direction , or , equivalently , by a guiding center coordinate @xmath46 for the @xmath47-direction . @xmath48 are the usual hermite polynomials , and the phases of the above wave functions have been adjusted to fulfill @xmath49 .    in what follows we will be interested in the quantum dynamics of an initial state @xmath50 being a direct product of an orbital and a spin state , @xmath51 where the spinor components are related to the usual polar angles @xmath52 , @xmath53 of the initial spin direction via @xmath54 , @xmath55 . as a generic initial orbital state we consider @xmath56 i.e. a normalized gaussian wave packet of spatial width @xmath57 and initial momentum @xmath58 along the @xmath45-axis , i.e. the direction of translational invariance of the hamiltonian . the initial position of the particle is at the origin , @xmath59 . the energy of the above initial state can be expressed as @xmath60 where the bar denotes complex conjugation . conversely , for a wave packet of the above form with fixed energy @xmath61 and given width and spin state , the initial momentum reads @xmath62^{1/2}\\ , . \\label{wverg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      a conceptually straightforward way to evaluate time - dependent expectation values is to expand the initial state in terms of the eigenstates of the above system and use the matrix elements of the desired operator in this eigenbasis . for instance , for the kinetic - momentum operator , this approach formally reads @xmath63\\ , , \\label{timeevol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have already anticipated that these operators are diagonal in the intra - landau - level quantum number @xmath44 ; the same holds for the spin operators @xmath64 . the summation over @xmath65 , @xmath66 runs over @xmath67 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 . from the expectation values of the position operators can be obtained from those of the momenta via @xmath71 where the expectation values of the constant centers of the classical cyclotron motion are given by @xmath72 , @xmath73 . as explained in detail in the appendix , the integration over the wave numbers @xmath44 can be performed separately and serves as an input for the numerical evaluation of the remaining sums . for any further technical details , we refer the reader to the appendix .", "we now present the results of numerical simulations of the time evolution of expectation values described in eq . ( [ timeevol ] ) . all relevant technical details can be found in the appendix . in all simulation we assume the rashba coefficient to be positive , @xmath74 . let us first investigate the influence of spin - orbit coupling on the cyclotron motion in general . [ fig1 ] shows the the particle orbit evaluated in terms of the expectation values @xmath75 of a wave packet of initial width @xmath76 and group wave number @xmath77 for various initial spin states . the rashba energy is @xmath78 while the zeeman energy is , for simplicity , put to zero here . in the left ( right ) top panel , the spin points initially along the positive ( negative ) @xmath47-direction . the middle and bottom panels show the corresponding data for the @xmath45- and @xmath6-direction , respectively . the total simulation time is always @xmath79 . the strictly circular motion ( dotted lines ) with radius @xmath80 occurring in the absence of spin - orbit coupling is shown in all graphs as a guide to the eye . the magnetic length @xmath81 can conveniently converted into practical units via @xmath82 . all six graphs have the appearance of a more or less distorted spiral . the _ prima vista _ most regular motion is found in the two top panels where the initial spin direction is collinear with in initial direction of the momentum - dependent coupling to the spin described by the rashba hamiltonian this situation was investigated very recently in ref . @xcite in the framework of several schemes of semiclassical approximations . in one of these approaches the spin is assumed to follow in an adiabatic fashion the momentum - dependent field coupling to it , where both quantities are taken to be classical variables . we will discuss below to what extend this approximation leads to useful results in the parameter regime considered here where the energy of the initial wave packet is comparable with the cyclotron energy .    in fig . [ fig2 ] we have plotted the corresponding spin dynamics expressed in terms of the time - dependent expectation values @xmath83 . the initial conditions in the three panels are the same as in the left column of fig . the solid lines show the modulus of the vector @xmath84 of the time - dependent expectation values of spin components . this quantity can be used as a measure of entanglement between the electron spin and its orbital degrees of freedom @xcite . in fact , when tracing out the real - space degrees of freedom , the time - dependent reduced density matrix of the spin reads @xmath85\\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\left ( \\begin{array}{cc } 1+\\langle\\sigma^{z}_{h}(t)\\rangle & \\langle\\sigma^{+}_{h}(t)\\rangle \\\\ \\langle\\sigma^{-}_{h}(t)\\rangle & 1-\\langle\\sigma^{z}_{h}(t)\\rangle   \\end{array } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with eigenvalues @xmath86 . thus , a modulus of @xmath87 ( as present in the intitial condition at @xmath88 ) corresponds to a direct product of spin and orbital state with a reduced spin density matrix of rank @xmath89 , while a vanishing modulus @xmath90 indicates maximal entanglement between spin and orbital degrees of freedom , and the reduced spin density matrix is proportional to the unit matrix @xcite . as seen in fig . [ fig2 ] , the modulus @xmath84 is generically clearly smaller than unity signalling between spin and real - space coordinates , an effect certainly beyond semiclassical approximations . let us now come back to the investigation of the adiabatic semiclassical approximation employed in ref . @xcite . here both spin and particle momentum are treated as classical variables , and the projection of the spin on the instantaneous direction of the momentum - dependent field is assumed to be constant . intuitively , this assumption corresponds to strong spin - orbit coupling @xcite as it is the case for a rashba energy of @xmath78 studied above . to investigate the validity of this adiabatic approximation , we introduce @xmath91 and @xmath92 the first quantity is the projection of the vector @xmath83 onto the direction of the momentum - dependent field evaluated in terms of @xmath93 , whereas in @xmath94 we have additional divided by @xmath84 in order to eliminate the effects of entanglement discussed above . for the adiabatic - semiclassical approximation to be valid , @xmath95 and @xmath94 should be reasonably constant in time . [ fig3 ] shows the time dependence of @xmath95 and @xmath94 for the same system parameters as in fig . in particular @xmath96 points along the positive @xmath45-direction which means that the momentum - dependent field coupling to the spin is initially in the @xmath47-direction in spin space . in the top panel , the spin points initially along the positive ( negative ) @xmath47-direction with @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) . the middle and bottom panels show the analogous data with the spin initially aligned along the @xmath45- and @xmath6-axis , respectively . here we have always @xmath99 . as seen in the figure , @xmath100 and @xmath101 significantly deviate from a constant value even in the case where the spin is initially fully aligned with the momentum - dependent field ( top panel ) . from these observations we conclude that this adiabatic semiclassical approximation is rather problematic in the parameter regime studied here where the total energy of the electron wave packet is of the order of the cyclotron energy . in fact , the behavior of the system is only rather poorly represented by introducing two different cyclotron radii corresponding to two spin directions as suggested in ref . @xcite . on the contrary , the dynamics are much richer and show trajectories reminiscent of chaotic behavior . the latter observation becomes even more significant at smaller initial group wave number @xmath102 as one can see in fig . [ fig4 ] where we have plotted trajectories analogous to those in fig . [ fig1 ] but with a shorter initial group wave vector of only @xmath103 . for lower cyclotron energies , however , we expect the semiclassical approximation of ref . @xcite to be significantly better fulfilled than in the regime studied here . the smaller the cyclotron energy compared to the total energy of the wave packet , the larger the number of landau levels to be included in the numerical simulation . as explained in the appendix , such simulations require the precise numerical evaluation of high - order hermite polynomials , a task which technically limits our approach to the regime where the cyclotron energy is comparable with the energy of the initial wave packet . in this sense , our study is complementary to previous semiclassical approaches concentrating on the regime of weaker fields .    finally fig . [ fig5 ] shows the orbital dynamics for again the same system as in fig . [ fig1 ] for various values of the initial group wave number @xmath102 and the spin initially always pointing along the positive @xmath47-axis . for a better comparison the the components of @xmath104 are given in units of @xmath80 . clearly , the dynamics become more `` regular '' ( or less `` chaotic '' ) the larger the initial group wave number @xmath102 .    in the above investigations we have concentrated on the position operator @xmath105 to describe the time evolution of the initial state chosen as a gaussian wave packet . regarding the width of this wave packet ( as opposed to its center @xmath106 ) let us consider the case of vanishing spin - orbit coupling . here the components of the position operator are straightforwardly obtained as @xmath107 and are completely analogous to the classical cyclotron motion . for an initial state gaussian wave packet given in eq . ( [ initorb ] ) the time dependent width reads @xmath108 thus , differently from the dispersive dynamics of a wave packet in the absence of a magnetic field , the width does not increase to infinity but remains bounded and rather oscillates with the cyclotron frequency , similarly to the time evolution of a coherent state in a harmonic oscillator . in the presence of spin - orbit coupling we expect the time evolution of the width of the initial state to be more complex but still essentially bounded . let us now turn to the issue of magnetic focusing under the influence of spin - orbit coupling . a magnetic focusing experiment is conceptually very simple and sketched in fig.[fig6 ] : electrons enter a quantum well at a location @xmath109 , follow a ballistic cyclotron orbit , and impinge again on the boundary of the system at a location @xmath110 . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , this difference in coordinate depends , just as in the classical case , only on the applied magnetic field and the initial group wave number @xmath102 , @xmath111 . thus , using an appropriately located detection contact one can study electron transport as a function of these two quantities .    in a typical experiment , however , rather the energy @xmath61 of electrons ( defined by the fermi energy of the injecting lead ) not their momentum is fixed with both quantities being connected via eq . ( [ wverg ] ) . therefore , the wave number @xmath102 of an injected electron will in general depend on its spin state ; only in the absence of both zeeman coupling and spin - orbit interaction @xmath102 is independent of the electron spin . in turn , for random initial spin directions , @xmath112 will be distributed according to some probability density @xmath113 . fig.[fig7 ] shows a numerical evaluation of @xmath113 for a wave packet of width @xmath114 , total and energy @xmath115 at zero zeeman coupling and different rashba energies . the initial angular coordinates @xmath116 and @xmath53 determining the complex amplitudes @xmath117 and @xmath118 in the initial state ( [ init ] ) were chosen at random from uniform distributions in the interval @xmath119 $ ] and @xmath120 $ ] , respectively . the data is averaged over 500000 randomly chosen initial spin states each . at a small rashba energy of only @xmath121 ( top left panel ) the dynamics depend only very weakly on spin and @xmath113 is strongly peaked around @xmath122 , the classical cyclotron diameter expected in the absence of spin - orbit coupling . with increasing rashba energy , this peak undergoes a broadening with the maximum of the probability density being located at smaller values of @xmath112 . [ fig8 ] shows the same type of data at a zeeman energy of @xmath123 which does not lead to any qualitative difference .    in summary , the initial narrow peak of the probability density @xmath113 at small spin - orbit coupling broadens with increasing rashba energy and develops an non - trivial structure in terms of a maximum at small arguments with a broad shoulder reaching to higher values . the structures seen in figs .  [ fig7],[fig8 ] appear to be somewhat different to the results of ref . @xcite where a splitting of the conductance peak as a function of magnetic field was found for increasing rashba coupling . these two peaks can be related to two different effective cyclotron radii corresponding to two initial spin states with respect to a quantization axis being perpendicular to the initial momentum and the magnetic field , an observation similar to the `` strong coupling '' semiclassical scenario of ref . thus , in the light of these investigations one could also expect a double - peak structure to develop in the probability density @xmath113 . however , the investigations of ref . @xcite work at clearly higher electron energies compared to the cyclotron energy , and landau quantization is explicitly neglected . this is in contrast to the present study which works at larger cyclotron energies taking into account the full quantum dynamics of the problem .", "we have studied the ballistic motion of electrons in iii - v semiconductor quantum wells with rashba spin - orbit coupling and a perpendicular magnetic field . differently from previous investigations , our numerical approach takes into account the full quantum mechanics of the problem and is technically limited to situations where the cyclotron energy is of the same order as the energy of the initial electron wave packet . for typical experimental parameters , this restriction corresponds to magnetic fields of a few tesla . such fields are larger than those considered previously in circumstances of semiclassics neglecting landau quantization , and in this sense our present study is complementary to such semiclassical approaches . as a result , in the parameter regime considered here the electron dynamics are particularly rich and not adequately described by semiclassical approximations . an interesting issue for futher investigations here includes the question whether the seemingly `` chaotic '' trajectories shown in section [ cyclomotion ] are truely ergodic . moreover , it is tempting to attribute the irregularity of these trajectories to the _ zitterbewegung _ predicted previously for electron motion in two - dimensional electron gases without magnetic fields @xcite . what both phenomena have indeed in common is the fact that they are the result of spin - orbit coupling , and the irregular motion of electrons in a perpendicular magnetic field is the consequence of the non - equidistant spectrum of landau levels induced by spin - orbit interaction .    in this study , we have concentrated on spin - orbit coupling of the rashba type . however , the situation of linear dresselhaus coupling can be treated analogously @xcite as it only couples , like the rashba term , pairs of neighboring landau levels with opposite spin . if both types of spin - orbit coupling terms are present , all landau levels are coupled , and the single - particle hamiltonian can not be diagonalized analytically anymore . in this case the eigensystem of the hamiltonian needs to be computed numerically , or appropriate approximations have to be employed @xcite . it is an interesting question whether the inclusion of both kinds of couplings leads to qualitativly new observations . a particular situation is reached if both terms occur with the same magnitude , where , for zero zeeman coupling , a new conserved spin operator arises @xcite . further possible extensions of the present work include the study of valence - band holes ( as opposed to conduction - band electrons ) with an effective spin - orbit coupling being trilinear in the momentum , and electron or hole dynamics under the influence of an additional in - plane electric field .", "the overlap of the initial orbital state ( [ initorb ] ) and the basis states ( [ basis1 ] ) of the usual landau levels can be expressed as @xmath124}\\biggl[\\frac{(-1)^{p}}{p!}\\frac{n!}{(n-2p)!}(-2k_{0}\\ell)^{n-2p } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\left(1-\\frac{d^{2}}{\\ell^{2}}\\right)^{p}\\left(1+\\frac{d^{2}}{\\ell^{2}}\\right)^{p - n } \\biggr]\\ , , \\label{ovl2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath125 $ ] denotes the largest integer not larger than @xmath47 , and the second of the above equations shows explicitly that the overlap is well - behaved at @xmath114 . the above expressions can be obtained by using the explicit form of the hermite polynomials , @xmath126}\\left[\\frac{(-1)^{p}}{p!}\\frac{n!}{(n-2p ) !

time data processing in big data environments , there is a pressing need to re - imagine the traditional computing techniques . for example , data locality in popular big data system distributions like hadoop @xcite and spark @xcite is redefined as bringing compute to data instead of the traditional approach of the moving the data that needs to get processed . this trend of re - inventing the traditional methods do not necessarily transform to the security needs of big data . the security features implemented in big data systems are still based on traditional methods for systems based on general purpose machines . user authentication , multi - level data access control and logging are typically used for security in big data @xcite . data encryption is slowly being adopted in the big data field , but it is limited by big data properties like volume and velocity . as we covered in our previous work @xcite , big data security is premature and there is a lot of scope for improvement in this area . for instance , the current security standards for big data systems assume system - level consistency which is not necessarily true always . we demonstrated in our previous work @xcite that big data platforms can be affected by insider attacks . in this work , we concentrate on detecting process - level intrusions within big data systems .    intrusion detection systems ( ids ) can identify malicious use based on their knowledge of possible threats or by learning from the behavior of programs . knowledge - based ids usually search a program for known threat signatures that are stored in a database . with new and zero - day attacks emerging regularly , it is impractical to have a pre - populated database of all possible threats . even if it is assumed to have such a database , maintaining it would require a lot of resources and running search queries against it would be expensive . behavior based ids tries to model , analyze and compare application behavior to identify anomalies . this technique needs more resources and is more complex than signature - based ids but it is more effective in a dynamically changing threat environment . behavior based ids generally use statistics and rules to detect anomalies . figure [ fig_tax ] gives a taxonomy of the different types of ids . in today s internet age , a distributed implementation of ids is needed for which aggregation , communication and cooperation are key factors of success . distributed ids gives centralized control and detects behavioral patterns even in large networks but it has to be employed at multiple levels : host , network and data @xcite . hence , using big data in general - purpose distributed ids implementations is recommended for faster processing . in this work , we concentrate on ids that can be used for security within big data systems . ids within a big data system favors anamoly - based ids when compared to knowledge - based ids because of the naturally large and ever increasing scope of threats .    using control - flow graphs for logic level intrusion detection is a commonly known idea @xcite . for example , control - flow integrity @xcite is a security mechanism that can identify misuse of application logic bugs , like buffer - overflow attacks . though cfgs are generally sparse graphs , they can grow very big in size . hence , it is important to design ids techniques that can work with a reduced representation of cfgs . a minimum spanning tree ( mst ) contains all vertices and only some paths of its source graph and the number of msts for sparse graphs is generally less . hence , a set of msts extracted from a cfg can be used for ids that detects program level anomalies .    in this paper , we propose a control - flow based intrusion detection technique for big data systems . the proposed technique checks for program level anomalies in big data applications by analyzing and comparing the control - flow behavior of all processes running inside a big data system . the proposed intrusion detection technique is divided into two parts . first , the control - flow of each process running on a data node in the big data cluster is locally analyzed . this is done by extracting a set of msts from the instruction level cfg of a compiled program . the extracted set of msts are hashed and stored in an array called the _ program signature_. then , the stored program signature is encrypted and shared with other replica nodes that run the same program . in the second step , the received encrypted program signature is decrypted and matched with the local version to check for coherence . matching two program signatures involves finding a perfect match for every mst in a signature within the set of msts of the other . the result of the matching step is then shared with replica nodes for consensus . our technique is designed to be simple , scalable and efficient in identifying both control - flow and brute - force attacks . the rest of this paper is organized as follows . section ii gives some background about big data systems , control - flow graphs and ids . the various related works are also discussed here . section iii explains the proposed intrusion detection technique in detail . experimental setup and results are thoroughly discussed in section iv . finally , section v gives the conclusion and future work .", "in this section , background about the three topics - big data systems , control - flow graphs and intrusion detection is provided . the related works are briefly outlined here . big data systems are data driven and their work can be classified into 2 major tasks - writing user data to the disk for storage and ; reading stored data when user requests for it . typically , this data is quantified in units called _ blocks_. for fast and fault - tolerant service , big data systems rely on replication of data blocks which in turn demands data consistency . big data systems can not afford to have read or write service - level inconsistency . the motivation for this work comes from a weak assumption in the big data community that the services used by a big data system to maintain data consistency are never attacked . it is our knowledge that this problem has not been widely addressed before .    to propose an ids for big data services , it is important to understand how the services work . for this , we picked 2 popular big data services - reads and writes . when a client ( or user ) wants to write a block , the namenode picks _ n _ data nodes from the big data cluster to complete this task where _ n _ is the replication factor of the cluster . first the namenode checks if the datanodes are ready . it sends a ready request to datanode1 which when ready , forwards that request to datanode2 and so on . when the namenode knows that all _ n _ datanodes are ready , it asks the client to start writing . the client only writes to datanode1 which is subsequently written on to datanode2 , datanode3 and so on . in case of any failure , namenode orders a new datanode to maintain block replicas . when the client wants to read a block , namenode gives the client a list of all datanodes that have the block and the client picks first datanode . if there is a problem reading from datanode1 , the client request gets forwarded to the next datanode that has a copy of the same block .      0.45        0.45        0.2     0.2     a control - flow graph ( cfg ) is a directed graph representation of a program and usually a sparse graph . cfgs include all possible control paths in a program . this makes cfg a great tool to obtain control - flow behavior of its process . vertices in a cfg give the level of detail , such as instruction - level or basic block level , that can not be further divided . edges in cfg represent control jumps and are classified into two types - forward and backward . branch instructions , function calls , conditional and unconditional jumps account for forward edges . virtual calls and indirect function calls are also considered as forward edges but their destinations are difficult to determine . loops and returns generally account for backward edges . the integrity among duplicate processes that run on replica nodes of a big data system can be verified with the information available in a cfg @xcite . similarity check between program logic of two programs can be performed by comparing their cfgs for isomorphism . there are many ways to check for such graph isomorphism @xcite but analyzing the similarity of two processes by conducting cfg level graph isomorphism is hard and time consuming . graph isomorphism is a complex problem , sometimes known to be np - complete as well @xcite . to reduce the complexity of graph algorithms , cfgs can be reduced to trees or subgraphs before performing any coherence or integrity checks @xcite . a cfg can be converted to a tree using methods such as depth - first traversal . several tree structures like dominator tree , minimumm spanning tree ( mst ) , minimumm spanning arborescence ( msa ) can be extracted form cfgs @xcite . for this work , mst and msa can be used interchangeably . cfgs can be broken into subgraphs using methods like k sub - graph matching and graph coloring . some popular methods for graph reduction and graph comparison that can be found in the literature are given below ( assume graphs to have n vertices and m edges ) :    * _ based on edit distance _ : using smith - waterman algorithm with levenshtein distance to identify similarity between two graphs represented as strings @xcite . the time complexity is o(nm ) . * _ based on traversal _ : ( a ) a preorder traversal of a graph g where each node is processed before its descendants . ( b ) a reverse postorder in a dag gives a topological order of the nodes @xcite . * _ based on dominator trees _ : a data structure built using depth first search or using the method proposed by tarjan in @xcite . tarjan s method has a time complexity of o((n+m)log(n+m ) ) . * _ based on reachability _ : transitive reduction of a sparse graph to another graph with fewer edges but same transitive closure @xcite . the time complexity is o(nm ) .    in this work , we chose to reduce a cfg to a set of msts because cfgs are generally sparse graphs and hence the size of the set of msts will be finite and small . edmond s algorithm can be used to extract msts from a digraph @xcite . since an mst contains all vertices of its graph , there will be no loss in the program instruction data . depending on the connectedness of the graph , the edge count will defer between the cfg and mst representation of a program . figure [ fig_ex1 ] shows transformation of a line of java code to basic blocks of bytecode to cfg to set of msas . vertices b1 , b2 , b3 , b4 are the basic blocks formed from java bytecode . there exists an o(m + n log n ) time algorithm to compute a min - cost arborescence @xcite . alternately , another approach for converting a cfg to mst using union find is used by popular compilers like llvm and gcc for security purposes . one known disadvantage of using cfgs and msts for security is that dynamic link library calls can not be verified . traditionally , ids checks for known malware in programs by performing signature matching on a threat database @xcite . signature match using exact string matching is limited in its scope . this is because variants of same attack will have different signatures . recently , methods to detect new malwares using statistical machine learning have been proposed . static analysis using cfg is another efficient way to detect intrusions but it is very complex @xcite . converting a cfg to a string and implementing string matching is another way to deal with this problem but the solution will not be polynomial . also , cfg at basic block level can have basic block variants that look different but perform the same function . to deal with these shortcomings , many approximate matching techniques have been proposed . tracing applications to get their cfg is another approach that is used in applications like xtrace , pivottrace etc @xcite . in case of big data systems , data nodes usually have the same processor architecture . hence it can be assumed that there will be no variants when the cfg is constructed at byte - level . it is then sufficient to verify similarity among the cfgs of two processes to confirm coherence in the nodes of a big data system .    1        1", "in this section , we describe our proposed two - step intrusion detection technique for big data systems . the first step involves capturing the control - flow of a process running on a datanode of the big data system . the second step involves process - level similarity check followed by consensus among replica datanodes .      in this work , we emphasize on process level intrusion detection by observing coherence in the behavior of duplicate processes running on replica datanodes of a distributed big data system . to capture the program behavior , the first step is to identify a representation of the program that has the information we need and filters out all other data . we call this representation as the program signature . since our goal is to identify intrusions from control - flow mismatch , our program signatures should contain all possible control flow information of a program . compiled source code of a program is generally used to generate static cfg . since most big data frameworks use a virtual machine ( like jvm ) , an instruction level cfg in this context is generated from java byte code . in this work , disassembled object code ( doc ) from java byte code is used as input to generate the cfg at instruction level . it is important for the program signature to contain only the information that is necessary . hence , every cfg is converted into a set of msts that are later used to generate the program signature . in this work , we propose the idea of representing a program by a set of msts / msas that can be extracted from a byte - level cfg using edmonds algorithm . this set of msts that are extracted from a cfg are further filtered to only the set of edge - disjoint msts . there are many versions proposed for edmonds algorithm @xcite and for this work we used a version from networkx graph library @xcite that generates edge disjoint spanning trees from the root vertex of a given digraph . once a minimal representation of the logic in a program is obtained in the form of an msa , it is converted into a string by listing the node list first followed by edge list , which is in accordance to the dot format representation . the length of a mst string in dot format is dependent on program size . to make the comparison step faster , we convert the variable length mst strings of a program to fixed length strings using hashing . the extracted set of edge - disjoint msts are hashed using popular hashing algorithms like sha or md5 to generate a set of fixed - length hash strings . since a sparse graph like cfg can have multiple msas , the program signature can be a single hash string or a set of hash strings . having all possible msas in the program signature makes the graph similarity check more reliable . in the end , a _ program signature _ is a set of fixed - length strings . program signatures are encrypted before being shared with replica datanodes for tighter security . the private key for encryption is generated from a harcoded master key if we use secure hardware like the one proposed in our previous work @xcite . every datanode in a big data system runs the proposed _ profiling method _ for every running process and it includes all the steps involved in converting the compiled binary of a program to its program signature . a pictorial representation of the steps in profiling method is given in figure [ fig_algo ] . replication property of big data systems opens scope for new methods of implementing application logic level ids techniques . process similarity check among duplicate nodes of the cluster helps in checking for coherence among the replica datanodes while performing a write or read operation . when a process is scheduled to run on a datanode that hosts the primary copy of a data , a signature for that process is created by the _ profiling method _ ( step 1 ) of our proposed ids technique and that signature string is shared with all replica datanodes . in the _ matching method _ ( step 2 ) , these signatures received from other datanodes are decrypted and matched with the local versions of the same process . the results are shared with all other replica datanodes for consensus . for secure communication among datanodes , we intend to use the same secure communication protocol that was proposed in our previous work @xcite . the most important part of the matching method is to check for similarity ( or dissimilarity ) between two program signatures . generally , graph similarity check can be performed by checking node similarity and edge similarity . the following points are considered while comparing msts to check for similarity among programs :    * msts are sparse graphs obtained from byte - level cfgs . hence , checking for path sensitivity is not exponential . * all edges are assumed to have the same weight of 1 . * the total number of msts for a cfg is limited ( by cayley s formula @xcite ) . * by edmond s theorem , a graph which is k - connected always has k edge - disjoint arborescences . * two msts are a perfect match if their node sets and edge sets match exactly . * if edge set of one mst is a subset of the edge set of another mst , the source graphs of these msts are not similar . * two graphs are similar if for every mst in one graph there exists a perfect match in the set of msts of the other graph . * hashing algorithms like sha1 or md5 are quick and efficient .    based on the points listed above , the following method is developed for graph similarity check . let us consider 2 control - flow graphs g1 and g2 . let @xmath0 represent g1 where n1 is the node set of the graph g1 and e1 is the edge set of the graph . similarly , @xmath1 represents g2 where n2 is the node set of the graph g1 and e2 is the edge set of the graph . after employing a variation of edmonds algorithm on these cfgs ( such as finding all edge - disjoint msts ) , lets us assume that m1 @xmath2 $ ] is the set of mst / msa for g1 and m2 @xmath3 $ ] is the set of mst / msa for g2 . in order to check for similarity in both graphs g1 and g2 , we check if there is a perfect match in m2 for all msts in m1 . in order to simplify the match function , we propose using a hash function on m1 and m2 that creates a unique hash for every mst . let h1 be a set of hashes generated from m1 and h2 be the set of hashes from m2 . if any hash in h1 does not exist in h2 , we deduce that the graphs are not equal .", "in this section , the experimental setup and experiments used for testing the proposed technique are provided . the results and some analysis are also provided . an amazon ec2 @xcite m4.xlarge instance running ubuntu 14.04 is used to generate msts ( and their hashes ) from cfgs using sagemath . the proposed technique was implemented and tested on an amazon ec2 big data cluster of 5 t2.micro nodes -

reduce examples on a big data cluster and the time taken to run the proposed intrusion detection technique . the execution times for some examples ( represented by * in table [ table_hadoop_values ] ) are inconsistent among multiple runs . we can notice from table [ table_hadoop_values ] that only 0.81% of time taken to execute an example is needed to analyze it for intrusion detection . the time needed to run the proposed detection technique includes ( a ) time taken to create cfg for the main method from the class file ; ( b ) time taken to extract mst set from cfg ; ( c ) time taken to hash the msts and encrypt them and ; ( d ) time taken to check for similarity among duplicate processes by comparing the program signatures . all of these values can be found in table [ table_hadoop_values ] . the last row of this table gives the average values . it can be noticed from figure [ fig_r2 ] that the time required by the proposed technique is influenced by the profiling method trying to extract msas from cfg , particularly when there are more than one msas for a cfg . though the matching method performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the number of edge - disjoint msas in a cfg i.e.  @xmath4 worst case complexity , we observed that it is rare to have more than a couple of edge - disjoint msas in a cfg because of the sparse nature of cfg . 0.47        0.47", "in this paper , we introduced a novel approach to detect program level intrusions in big data systems with help of control flow analysis . the main idea is to use the replication property of big data systems and check for coherence in program behavior among replica datanodes . behavior of a program is modeled by extracting a msa set representation of its cfg . similarity check among duplicate programs is performed by a complete matching among hashed sets of msas . experiments were conducted on real - world hadoop map - reduce examples and it is observed that the proposed technique takes only 0.8% of execution time to identify intrusions . the naturally sparse nature of cfgs helps in achieving this low overhead . for future work , we would like to explore graph string matching and compare the proposed matching method ( step2 ) with other graph isomorphism techniques .    1 dean , jeffrey , and sanjay ghemawat . `` mapreduce : simplified data processing on large clusters .

1956 @xcite for the derivation of a formula for a branching process where the variance to mean was above unity , @xmath4 . the @xmath5-function became called the feynman y - function , characterising the deviation of the relative variance from unity . both its time dependence , expressed by the prompt neutron decay constant @xmath6 , as well as its asymptotic value , carry information on the sought parameters of the system . the original application of these studies was related to the theoretical description of statistical fluctuations of the number of neutrons in multiplying medium or in other words , to the determination of the level of subcriticality . therefore , the above - mentioned research remained classified for several years . the fundamental principles of the feynman - alpha theory have been extensively described in a number of publications , e.g. @xcite . about a decade ago the interest to this subject returned again in connection to the on - line measurement of subcritical reactivity of accelerator - driven systems ( ads ) . whereas the original feynman - alpha formulas referred to a homogeneous system in an monoenergetic ( `` one - group '' ) description @xcite , dealing only with one exponent or decay constant , the further experiments , e.g. the yalina @xcite and muse @xcite , showed the appearance of more than one decay constant and , therefore , the possible need of extension of the one - group one - region ( also referred to as `` one - point '' ) feynman - alpha formulas to more energy groups and spatial regions . several attempts were made towards the explanation of multiple exponential modes by the spatial effects @xcite . by that time it was decided that the future ads - systems will be driven by pulsed neutron and spallation sources which lead to the extension of the theory of variance - to - mean formulas for a continuous source with poisson statistics to the cases of pulsed and spallation neutron sources with different definition of the pulse shapes and pulsing manner @xcite . latter analysis @xcite showed the close link between the application of feynman - alpha formulas to subcriticality measurements and safeguards .    in line with the above , the suggestion of new safeguards technique for mox / spent fuel assay @xcite , the differential die - away self - interrogation ( ddsi ) technique , displayed the interest towards the energy - dependent aspects of neutron counting . in connection with this , the two - group feynman - alpha theory was elaborated in @xcite where delayed neutrons were neglected , and in @xcite with inclusion of delayed neutron precursors . however , fast fission and thermal detections were neglected in both papers . the results of further considerations of the importance of the energy - aspect in evaluation of the real systems shows that `` a measured variance - to - mean ratio in fast systems may be contaminated by the energy - higher order mode effect except when the system is near - critical @xcite '' .    in the light of recent advances in detector technologies in safeguards towards the development of fast neutron detection systems with scintillators , the knowledge of the energy - dependent behavior of neutron counting became a very important issue to be taken into account in feynman - alpha theory . the authors of @xcite showed that the short and long time behavior of the @xmath7-function can be used to assay the amount of @xmath8pu and the absolute amount of @xmath9pu+@xmath10pu in the reprocessed fuel . therefore , one part of this paper is devoted to the derivation of the general case of one - point two - group feynman - alpha formulas , when fast fission and thermal detections and delayed neutrons are included . however in some cases , for example , when the fission chambers are used as detectors , the energy importance makes way for the region - dependent aspect . this issue has not well been studied previously , although some expressions for the one - group two - region feynman - alpha formulas can be found in @xcite . however , even these investigations are limited to the case of delayed neutron precursors having been neglected and detections accounted for only in one region . thus , the second part of this paper is devoted to the derivation of the general case of the two - point one - group feynman - alpha formulas , when detections and delayed neutrons are accounted for in both regions . it has to be noted that the present paper does not carry out fully an analysis of the diagnostic value of the obtained formulas the same way as it was made in the traditional works based on a one - group treatment in a single ( infinite ) homogeneous medium . in the traditional case the time dependence of the feynman @xmath5 function is characterised essentially with one decay constant which can clearly be related to the subcriticality of the system . in the case of using two energy groups and two spatial regions , the number of decay constants increases and each of them becomes a much more involved function of the increased number of material properties ( reaction intensities ) that the treatment of different regions and energy intervals incurs . the sought system parameters become very involved functions of these decay constants , and no attempt is made in this paper on the investigation of how these parameters can be extracted from the measurements . this is deferred to later work . the objective of the present work is to give a clear and transparent derivation of the various variance - to - mean formulas as functions of the reaction and transition intensities , and to compare the solutions for the different cases .", "in this paper , the two - point two - group , the two - group one - point ( with delay neutrons ) and the one - group two - point ( with delayed neutrons ) feynman - alpha formulas were derived by using the kolmogorov forward approach @xcite . in the general model used for derivations we assume that the neutron population consists of two groups of neutrons : fast ( denoted as 1 ) and thermal ( denoted as 2 ) . fast and thermal neutrons can undergo different reactions ( i ) listed below :    * absorption ( @xmath11 ) , * fission ( @xmath12 ) , * detection ( @xmath13 ) , * removal from the fast group to the thermal ( @xmath14 ) . unlike in the terminology , used in the traditional one - group treatments , absorbtion here stands only for capture . the decay constant of the delayed neutron precursors is given as @xmath15 . in addition , both the fast and thermal neutrons can transit from one region to the others , in both directions . in all models the source is considered as releasing n particles with probability _ @xmath16 _ at an emission event . in this paper a term _ `` two - point '' _ has the same meaning as _ `` two - region''_.      for the two - group two - point model it was assumed that two adjacent infinite and homogeneous half - space regions ( denoted as a and b ) with different independent reaction intensities for absorption of fast and thermal neutrons ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , fission induced by fast and thermal neutrons ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) and detection of fast and thermal neutrons ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) . the two regions are coupled by two passage intensities ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) in two different directions describes the intensity of particles ( group i ) leaving region a for region b and @xmath33 is the intensity of particles ( group i ) transferring to region a from region b. ] . thus , each of the reactions for the different groups of neutrons can be described by transition intensities , as shown in figure [ fig:1 ] . total intensities including both the reactions and transitions between the regions for the fast and the thermal neutrons are denoted as @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 for regions a and b , respectively :    _ a1 = _ a1a + _ a1f + a2 = _ a2a + _ a2f + _ a2 t + _ a2d    _ b1 = _ b1a+ _ b1f + _ b1 t + _ b1r + _ b1d    _ b2=_b2a + _ b2f + _ b2 t + _ b2d    the slowing down process , i.e. the removal of neutrons from the fast group to the thermal group is described by the removal reaction intensity @xmath38 . in the two - point two - group model we also include two extraneous compound poisson sources of fast neutrons placed in different regions , a and/or b , with intensities @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the following , two special cases of the above general form will be described briefly . because in the lower dimensionality of the special cases , inclusion of delayed neutrons is possible .      in the two - group one - point feynman - alpha model ( figure [ fig:25 ] ) , we assume that the medium is infinite and homogeneous . the neutron population consists of two groups of neutrons , fast and thermal . a compound poisson source of fast neutrons with emission intensity @xmath41 is included in the model . thus , the total transition intensities for the fast and thermal neutrons , denoted as @xmath42 and @xmath43 , are given as :    _ 1 = _ 1a + _ 1f + _ r + _ 1d    _ 2 = _ 2a + _ 2f + _ 2d      the assumption behind the one - group two - point model is that the two adjacent homogeneous half - space regions ( denoted as a and b ) with independent reaction intensities for detection ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) , absorption @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and fission @xmath48 and @xmath49 are coupled by two passage intensities @xmath50 and @xmath51 in two different directions . the decay constants of delayed neutron precursors are given as @xmath52 and @xmath53 for regions a and b , as shown in figure [ fig:3 ] . thus , total transition intensities for region a and region b are denoted as @xmath54 and @xmath55 :    _ a = _ aa + _ af + _ at + _ ad    _ b = _ ba + _ bf + _ bt + _ bd    in the model we include two compound poisson sources of fast neutrons in regions a and b with emission intensities @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively . the sources are considered as releasing @xmath58 particles in one emission with the probability distributions of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively . for the induced fission reaction , we consider that @xmath61 neutrons and @xmath62 delayed neutron precursors are emitted with the probability distributions @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the fission reaction in region a and region b , respectively .", "based on the main concept and assumptions used the two - group two - region , the two - group one - region and the two - region one - group feynman - alpha formulas are elaborated as below .      in order to derive the two - point two - group feynman - alpha theory let us assume that the source @xmath65 is switched on in the region a / b at the time @xmath66 , while the detection process is started at the fixed time instant @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 . let the random processes @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 represent the number of fast neutrons in region a , fast neutrons in region b , thermal neutrons in region a and thermal neutrons in region b at the time @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 - the number of fast and thermal particle detections in the regions a and b in the time interval [ @xmath67 , @xmath79 , respectively . for convenience , we consider _ @xmath67=0_. thus , the joint probability of having @xmath80 fast neutrons in region a , @xmath81 fast neutrons in region b , @xmath82 thermal neutrons in region a , @xmath83 thermal neutrons in region b at time @xmath0 , @xmath84 fast neutrons have been detected in region a , and @xmath85 fast neutrons have been detected in region b , @xmath86 thermal neutrons have been detected in region a , and @xmath87 thermal neutrons have been detected in region b during the period of time @xmath88 can be defined as :    @xmath89 .    by summing up the probabilities of all mutually exclusive events of the particle not having or having a specific reaction within the infinitesimally small time interval d@xmath0 , one can write :    = -(_a1n_a1+_a2n_a2+_b1n_b1+_b2n_b2+s_a+s_b)p(n_a1,n_a2,n_b1,n_b2,z_a1,z_b1,z_a2,z_b2,t ) + _ a1a(n_a1 + 1)p(n_a1 + 1,n_a2,n_b1,n_b2,z_a1,z_b1,z_a2,z_b2,t ) + _ a2a(n_a2 + 1)p(n_a1,n_a2 + 1,n_b1,n_b2,z_a1,z_b1,z_a2,z_b2,t ) + _ b1a(n_b1 + 1)p(n_a1,n_a2,n_b1 + 1,n_b2,z_a1,z_b1,z_a2,z_b2,t ) + _ b2a(n_b2 + 1)p(n_a1,n_a2,n_b1,n_b2 + 1,z_a1,z_b1,z_a2,z_b2,t ) + _ a1f_k^n_a1 + 1(n_a1 + 1-k)f_a1(k)p(n_a1 + 1-k , n_a2,n_b1,n_b2,z_a1,z_b1,z_a2,z_b2,t ) + _ b1f_k^n_b1 + 1(n_b1 + 1-k)f_b1(k)p(n_a1,n_a2,n_b1 + 1-k , n_b2,z_a1,z_b1,z_a2,z_b2,t )    + _ a2f_k^n_a1(n_a2 + 1)f_a2(k)p(n_a1-k , n_a2 + 1,n_b1,n_b2,z_a1,z_b1,z_a2,z_b2,t ) + _ b2f_k^n_b1(n_b2 + 1)f_b2(k)p(n_a1,n_a2,n_b1-k , n_b2 + 1,z_a1,z_b1,z_a2,z_b2,t ) + _ a1t(n_a1 + 1)p(n_a1 + 1,n_a2,n_b1 -

point two - group version of the feynman - alpha theoretical formula to the two - point one - group , the one - point two - group and the one - point one - group ( i.e. traditional ) versions . [ sec:9 ]      in order to compare the four different versions of the feynman - alpha theory , quantitative values of the transition probabilities and reaction intensities were obtained by using monte - carlo simulations in a way similar to that described in @xcite . the simulation setup consists of two regions , region a and region b , as shown in figure [ fig:2 ] . region a represents nuclear material ( radius 4.46 cm ) , in particular a mixture of 2.5% @xmath170u and 97.5% @xmath171u . region b consists of a moderating material with a thickness of 21 cm . the neutron source emits the neutrons with an energy of 2.5 mev . two cases are considered in the simulations , one when the neutron source is in the center of region a and another when the neutron source is at a distance of 15 cm from the center of the nuclear material , in region b. two point detectors , in region a and in region b , are included in the simulation setup . delay neutron precursors are not included in the simulations . initially , the transition probabilities and reaction intensities are obtained in simulations for the two - point two - group case . then , the values of reaction intensities of the two - point two - group case are condensed in order to get the reaction intensities which correspond to the two - point one - group , the one - point two - group and one - point one - group cases . afterwards , these values are used in order to obtain the values of the @xmath7 and @xmath172 coefficients in the feynman - alpha formulas for the cases when the source is in region a , and in region b for fast neutron detections and thermal neutron detections , as shown in table [ table : tab1]-[table : tab4 ] , respectively . .the values of the @xmath173 and @xmath174 calculated for four various versions of feynman - alpha formulas ( the source is in region a , fast neutron detector is used either in region a or b ) . [ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ table : tab4 ]    since there is only one region considered in the two - group one - point and the one - point one - group feynman - alpha formulas , the coefficients are the same for the detection in the different regions of the initial system used for the simulations . the same is true for the energy - dependent factor in the two - point one - group and the one - point one - group feynman - alpha formulas , the coefficients are the same for the fast and thermal neutron detection . * attention ! * in the studies described below we assume that the two - point two - group version of feynman - alpha formulas gives the most accurate predictions as the most involved one among the four various versions , i.e. the two - point two - group , the two - point one - group , the two - group one - point and one - point one - group theories .      figures [ fig:4]-[fig:5 ] show a quantitative illustration of the dependence of the variance to mean of the number of fast neutron detections on the detection time for four versions of feynman - alpha theories when the source is in region a. different curves in figures [ fig:4]-[fig:5 ] are created based on the parameter values from table [ table : tab1]-[table : tab2 ] .        as it is shown in figure [ fig:4 ] , when fast neutrons are detected in region a , the two - point two - group , the two - point one - group and one - point one - group versions of the feynman - alpha theoretical formulas give very similar results . however , the one - point two - group version of the formulas overestimates the asymptotic ratio of the variance to mean . thus , we can conclude that the region dependence of the model plays a more important role than the energy dependence for the case when the source and the fast neutron detector are both placed in the region of the nuclear material . therefore , in this situation all three versions of the feynman - alpha theory , the two - point two - group , the two - point one - group and one - point one - group , can be used , although it is more time - efficient to use the one - group one - point version of the feynman - alpha theory . as an example , in reality this case may be related to the measurements performed in the spent fuel pool when the detector is placed in the control tube of fuel assembly .        in the case when the fast neutron detector is in region b ( figure [ fig:5 ] ) , a slight difference is observed between the two - point two - group and the two - point one - group versions of feynman - alpha theories . at the same time , the one - point two - group and one - point one - group versions of feynman - alpha theory significantly overestimate the values of variance to mean ratio obtained with the two - point two - group version of the formulas . thus , in this case two versions of feynman - alpha theory , the two - point two - group and the two - point one - group can be used , although it is more time - efficient to use the two - point one - group version for quantitative estimates . the differences between the various versions of feynman - alpha theory are significantly higher when the neutron source is placed in region b and the fast neutron detector is in either region a or b , see figures [ fig:6]-[fig:7 ] .        in all cases when the fast neutron detector is used , the two - point two - group version of feynman - alpha formulas produce high values of the asymptotic variance - to - mean ratio compared to results obtained with other versions , i.e. the two - point one - group , one - point two - group and one - point one - group versions of the theory .      regarding thermal neutron detection , when the source and the detector are in region a ( figure [ fig:8 ] ) , the three special versions of the feynman - alpha theory , the two - point one - group , the one - point two - group and the one - point one - group , all deviate significantly from the two - point two - group version . however , the one - point one - group theory gives very similar predictions of the ratio of the variance to mean as the two - point one - group theory . at the same time , the two - group one - point theory provides somewhat more accurate results . thus , the impact of the energy - dependence appears to be somewhat higher than the impact of the space - dependence .        when the thermal neutron detection is performed in region b ( figure [ fig:9 ] ) , we may conclude that both the space - dependent and energy - dependent aspects play important role for this case . if the source is in region b and detection is performed in region a ( figure [ fig:10 ] ) , the two - point one - group version of the feynman - alpha theory gives results which are closer to the one obtained with two - point two - group theory . thus , the impact of the space - dependence to the final results is higher than the impact of energy - dependence . although , for a case of detector and source being placed in region b ( figures [ fig:11 ] ) , the two - point one - group , two - group one - point and one - group one - point versions provide results of the variance - to - mean ratio that are significantly deviating from the ratio obtained by using the two - point two - group theory . thus , the space - dependent and energy - dependent aspects , both play the important role in this situation . in general , we can say that for the thermal neutron detections when the detection is done in region a , the energy - dependence has a higher impact to the ratio of the variance to mean than the space - dependent factor . on the other hand , for detection in region b both factors should be equally taken into account .", "the two - group two - point version of feynman - alpha theory was derived with a use of the forward master equation technique . the two - group one - point feynman - alpha theory ( with delay neutrons ) is extended by including fast neutron detections and and fast fissions . the two - point one - group variance - to - mean formula ( with delay neutrons ) is enhanced as well , by including detection and source terms in both regions . thus , this gives the possibility of treating fast reflected systems in a more accurate way , by treating the counts separately in the fast and the thermal groups ( or in the nuclear material ( fissile region ) and reflector regions ) . the comparative study of the two - group two - point , the two - group one - point , the one - group two - point and the one - group one - point feynman - alpha models is made by using the specific reaction intensities obtained in monte - carlo simulations . it is shown that for all cases when the fast neutron detector is used in measurements , the space - dependent aspect has a higher impact on the final results than the energy - dependent aspect . in particular , when the source and the fast neutron detector , both placed in the region of nuclear material three versions of feynman - alpha theory provides similar accuracy in the determination of the variance to mean ratio . namely , the two - point two - group , the two - point one - group and one - point one - group can be used , although it is more time - efficient to use the one - group one - point version of the feynman - alpha theory . the situation is not so optimistic for a case , when the fast neutron detector is in region b , because a slight difference is observed between all versions of the theories . the one - point two - group and one - point one - group versions of feynman - alpha theory significantly overestimate the values of variance to mean ratio obtained with the two - point two - group version of the formulas . therefore , in this case two versions of feynman - alpha theory , the two - point two - group , the two - point one - group can be considered as the accurate qualitative estimates . regarding the use of the thermal neutron detections , both energy- and space - dependent factors are important to take into account . when the detection is done in region a , the space - dependence has a higher impact to the ratio of the variance to mean than the energy - dependence , while , for detection in region b both factors should be equally considered ."], "summary": "this paper presents a full derivation of the variance - to - mean or feynman - alpha formula in a two energy group- and two spatial region - treatment . the derivation is based on the chapman - kolmogorov equation with the inclusion of all possible neutron reactions and passage intensities between the two regions . in addition , the two - group one - region and the two - region one - group feynman - alpha formulas , treated earlier in the literature for special cases , are extended for further types and positions of detectors . we focus on the possibility of using these theories for accelerator - driven systems and applications in the safeguards domain , such as the differential self - interrogation method and the differential die - away method . this is due to the fact that the predictions from the models which are currently used do not fully describe all the effects in the heavily reflected fast or thermal systems . therefore , in conclusion a comparative study of the two - group two - region , the two - group one - region , the one - group two - region and the one - group one - region feynman - alpha models is discussed . example.eps gsave newpath 20 20 moveto 20 220 lineto 220 220 lineto 220 20 lineto closepath 2 setlinewidth gsave .4 setgray fill grestore stroke grestore", "ranking": [4, 1, 3, 2, 0]}

[ b20 ] .    in order to enhance the signal / noise ratio one generally needs to accumulate a great number of times the nmr signal . to achieve these accumulations and in order to obtain quantitative information about the populations of the different chemical species present in the specimen , one needs to strictly respect the relaxation of each population between subsequent accumulations . we have selected from the literature results obtained taking this condition into account@xcite . nmr signal intensities , @xmath31 , are in general proportional to the absolute number @xmath32 of excited silicon nuclei of species @xmath27 within the sample , @xmath33 , with @xmath34 being the constant of the measurement ( species @xmath27 denotes a silicon nuclei belonging to a monomer , dimer , or trimer silicon cluster ) . the proportionality constant is usually eliminated by considering relative signal intensities @xmath35 which correspond to mole fractions @xmath36 . the constant @xmath37 defines the absolute silicon mass scale . the nmr measurements we refer to , provide plots of the time - dependent mole fractions for monomer , dimer and trimer silicon nuclei@xcite . however , plots for mole fractions show , as will be demonstrated below , more complex algebraic behavior .      in order to get an idea about the global hydration kinetics of cement we consider the chemical _ net _ reaction ( [ net - reaction ] ) in a more schematic representation , @xmath38 where the species @xmath39 and @xmath40 refer to silica nuclei of @xmath30 and @xmath29 respectively . we denote the anhydrous @xmath30 ( monomer ) mole fraction as @xmath41 and the @xmath29 ( dimer as well as trimer ) mole fraction as @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath43 . the reader is reminded that eq . ( [ schematic - net - reaction ] ) describes precisely a solid  state transformation as mentioned in the introduction , however , there is one fundamental difference in that the dimeric and trimeric silicon nuclei @xmath40 are not _ initially solvated _ within the silicon monomers @xmath39 . the @xmath40 nuclei become rather formed within the liquid solution which does not appear in eq . ( [ schematic - net - reaction ] ) . it is here the place to say something about the range of validity , the similarities , and the differences of eqs . ( [ net - reaction ] ) and ( [ schematic - net - reaction ] ) .    strictly speaking , the above net reactions can only hold , if the employed water to cement weight ratio is not too high , that is to say the number of solvated ions should be always orders of magnitudes lower than the number of molecules belonging to the solid state , i.e. , eqs . ( [ net - reaction ] ) and ( [ schematic - net - reaction ] ) are _ inconsistent _ in the limit of infinite dilution . a proximate condition for this is a comparison of the cement to water concentration with the solubility of portlandite , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , or @xmath46 . the here considered experimental data certainly fulfill this condition , i.e. , @xmath47 . furthermore eq . ( [ net - reaction ] ) describes a solid  liquid to solid transformation , however , eq .  ( [ schematic - net - reaction ] ) a solid to solid transformation . it is thus natural that both reactions describe very different things , if the initial water to cement ratio is so low that the water severely becomes a limiting reactant for the hydration process ( case of very thick pastes ) . to be more specific , the hydration following eq . ( [ net - reaction ] ) can not be completed for _ chemical _ reasons , if @xmath48 or equivalently if @xmath49 . it is , a priori , difficult to judge whether the employed experimental water / cement ratio @xmath50 is sufficiently large in order to exclude a systematic effect on hydration due to limiting water . however , as we will see further below , considering the kinetics of the ` deacceleration ' period , water is very unlikely a chemically limiting reactant . it is , however , not possible to determine from the considered measurements any water - specific kinetic exponent for the associated rate law of eq . ( [ net - reaction ] ) . the determination of such a dependency , would require a set of experiments , conducted for different initial water to cement ratios . similarly it is not possible to determine kinetic exponents for portlandite ( @xmath51 ) from the considered measurements , because @xmath52 is directly proportional to @xmath53 at every instant . in order to isolate the kinetic influence of precipitated portlandite on the overall hydration kinetics one needs to break up the direct proportionality between @xmath52 and @xmath53 . preferable this could be done by examination of the hydration rate dependence for different initial @xmath51 admixtures , i.e. , @xmath54 . bearing the foregoing caveats in mind , it should be obvious why we consider the schematic reaction ( [ schematic - net - reaction ] ) . we are only in position to characterize the kinetic influence of reactants and products on the cement hydration . but already this limited information will be , in our opinion , informative .      in the following we consider the ratio of silica mole fractions , @xmath55 varying between @xmath56 ( no hydrates at time @xmath57 ) and @xmath58 ( complete hydration at time @xmath59 ) . figure [ fig1 ] shows a double - logarithmic plot of @xmath60 versus the hydration time . this figure reveals several interesting facts about the hydration kinetics which will be addressed in this paper . we note that the considered experimental data have been taken from three independent publications obeying similar experimental conditions ( room temperature , normal pressure , geometry of specimens , and initial water / cement weight ratio @xmath50 ) , see @xcite for details . the relatively narrow scatter of the data over order of magnitudes demonstrates consistent and reproducible measurements . we observe , within in the scatter , two power laws separated by a sharply defined characteristic time @xmath61 with value @xmath62 . for the ` early ' hydration period ( @xmath7 ) we obtain , @xmath63 with an exponent @xmath64 . below 5 hours of hydration time there are no quantitative nmr data available , because of the bad signal / noise ratio for the @xmath29 . above @xmath65 the hydration dramatically slows down , @xmath66 with @xmath67 . this second period takes place from @xmath68 to at least @xmath69 of hydration time . equations ( [ early - powerlaw ] ) and ( [ later - powerlaw ] ) define a continuous dependency in time . however , the first derivative of @xmath60 taken at @xmath70 is not continuous , which might appear unphysical . the discontinuity in @xmath71 arises , because we have assumed a zero crossover range in eqs . ( [ early - powerlaw ] ) and ( [ later - powerlaw ] ) to obtain the best representation of experimental data . it is interesting to note , that an ansatz of the form @xmath72^{1/m},\\ ] ] with proper chosen exponents @xmath73 and @xmath74 gives a quite satisfactory representation of data for high integers of @xmath75 , see fig . [ fig1]@xcite . the best representation is found for @xmath76 , which corresponds to eqs . ( [ early - powerlaw ] ) and ( [ later - powerlaw ] ) .    in the following we propose relations between the above mentioned exponents @xmath77 and @xmath78 and the kinetic exponents of an overall rate equation . the observed exponents will allow for some general statements about the hydration mechanisms . we note , that from eq . ( [ f ] ) the trivial relations @xmath79 and @xmath80 follow , where @xmath81 characterizes the absolute silica mass scale . the overall rate equation for @xmath82 and @xmath83 has to be first order in time , @xmath84 one particular observation from eqs . ( [ e1 ] ) , ( [ e2 ] ) , and ( [ e3 ] ) is that the global hydration rate can be represented as a product of powers of the mole fractions @xmath82 and @xmath83 , if @xmath85 follows a power - law in @xmath86 . in such case the reaction is of overall order two and @xmath60 follows a power - law in time , except for @xmath87 which yields an exponential dependency in time . we have already mentioned , considering the experimental results in fig . [ fig1 ] , that @xmath60 follows indeed two power - laws , eqs . ( [ early - powerlaw ] ) and ( [ later - powerlaw ] ) , seperated by a characteristic time @xmath70 . thus it is possible to extract two rate laws from the measurements ; one for ` early ' times @xmath7 and another one for ` late ' times @xmath8 . consider @xmath88 where for times @xmath7 , @xmath89 and for times @xmath8 , @xmath90 , according to eqs . ( [ early - powerlaw ] ) and ( [ later - powerlaw ] ) . the associated first order differential equation is @xmath91 . inserting this into eq . ( [ e3 ] ) and resorting with respect to factors @xmath83 and @xmath82 [ eqs . ( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ e1 ] ) ] we obtain the explicit rate equation in terms of mole fractions , @xmath92 with @xmath93 for @xmath7 and @xmath94 for @xmath8 .    furthermore , by passing from mole fractions to concentrations , it is possible to determine the approximate effective rate constant(s ) from the experimentally observed crossover point , the extracted exponents , and the initial water to cement weight ratio . it is convenient to consider first the initial concentration @xmath95\\vert_{t_0}=n_a(t_0 ) / v_0 $ ] of cement in the overall specimen volume @xmath96 @xcite , @xmath97\\vert_{t_0}}= ( 1+\\frac{\\rho_{c_3s}}{\\rho_{h_2o}}\\cdot\\frac{w}{c})v_{c_3s } \\approx 0.18\\,liter\\,mol^{-1},\\ ] ] with @xmath98 and @xmath99 being the relative density and the molecular volume of cement respectively . the considered water to cement weight ratio is @xmath50 . we find for the ` accelerated ' period ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath100= \\frac{d}{dt}[b]=k_{t < t_\\times}\\cdot [ b]^{0.6 } [ a]^{1.4},\\ ] ] with @xmath101\\vert_{t_0}^{-1 } t_\\times^{-1}f_\\times^{0.4 } \\approx 7\\cdot 10^{-6}\\,liter\\,mol^{-1}\\,s^{-1}$ ] , and for the ` deaccelerated ' period ( @xmath8 ) @xmath102= \\frac{d}{dt}[b]=k_{t > t_\\times}\\cdot [ b]^{-1.0 } [ a]^{3.0},\\ ] ] with @xmath103\\vert_{t_0}^{-1 } t_\\times^{-1}f_\\times^{2.0 } \\approx 6\\cdot 10^{-7}\\,liter\\,mol^{-1}\\,s^{-1}$ ] .", "before we are going to present a possible explanation for the hydration kinetics as manifested in eqs . ( [ accelerated ] ) and ( [ deaccelerated ] ) we would like to give a brief account on another representation of the hydration kinetics being more widespread in cement literature , i.e. , the degree of hydration @xmath104 . the degree of hydration is usually referred as the relative amount ( mole fraction ) of hydrated cement@xcite , @xmath105 . therefore eq . ( [ e2 ] ) gives the relationship between @xmath104 and @xmath60 as defined in eq . ( [ f ] ) . typical experimental curves for the degree of hydration exhibit sigmoidal shapes in linear representations . the observed inflection points , however , do in general not posses any particular significance for a change in chemical mechanism . this can be seen for example by assuming in eq . ( [ e4 ] ) @xmath106 for _ all times_. the degree of hydration will show an inflection point though there is only a single chemical mechanism ( rate law ) operative . therefore it is not reliable to read off characteristic times from @xmath104 diagrams . while @xmath104 approximates @xmath60 well if @xmath107 ( early hydration ) the discrepancy becomes very large for @xmath108 ( late hydration ) . the foregoing remark has hopefully illustrated why we have avoided degree of hydration diagrams in our considerations . as another motivation for our approach we present in fig . [ fig_avrami ] a so - called ` avrami  plot ' for the hydrated silica amount , i.e. , a test on the stretched exponential relationship @xmath109 . such empirical relationships are frequently found for overall transformations@xcite . it can be clearly seen from fig . [ fig_avrami ] that the hydration data _ can not _ be described by such a relation . the kinetic equations eqs . ( [ accelerated ] ) and ( [ deaccelerated ] ) allow to make somewhat more substantial statements about the global cement hydration mechanism(s ) . during the acceleration period already existing hydrates _ catalyse _ the precipitation of new hydrates ( positive kinetic exponent for the products in eq . ( [ accelerated ] ) ) . the growth of _ connected _ hydrate structures appears thus to be thermodynamically more favorable than an uncorrelated ` through solution ' precipitation mechanism .    on the other hand in the deacceleration period ( @xmath8 ) the ` hydrate layers ' surrounding the cement grains increasingly separate reacting anhydrous cement and water and thus hinder / block further @xmath30 dissolution . the hydrates are acting in the deaccelerated period as _ inhibitors _ ( negative exponent for the products in eq . ( [ deaccelerated ] ) . the inversed role of hydration products during the accelerated and deaccelerated periods appears to be experimentally evident from the foregoing considerations . a widespread assertion in cement literature is that ` early ' hydration is controlled by chemical kinetics whilst ` late ' stage kinetics is being diffusion controlled . we agree with the later assumption that ion diffusion most probably represents the rate controlling step within the deacceleration period . this is in fact strongly indicated by the very low hydration rate at large times , see fig . [ fig1 ] .    however , there is no direct indication that the acceleration kinetics is chemically limited . obviously eq . ( [ accelerated ] ) _ can not _ describe initial nucleation ( approximately within the first @xmath110 ) because there exist no products at this times at all ( @xmath111\\vert_{t_0}=0 $ ] ) . on the other hand the early nucleation period is not accessible employing the here considered experimental techniques , so there is no conflict in interpretation . one just has to keep in mind that all experimental data points as well as the thereof extracted power  laws are beyond the nucleation period . after the first few minutes of bringing cement and water into contact , the ions in solution rise their concentrations far beyond the equilibrium solubilities , without precipitating at all . this can be understood by viewing the process of heterogeneous nucleation as overcoming a thermodynamical barrier ( supersolubility @xcite ) . being supersaturated the hydrate nucleation happens on the cement grain surfaces @xcite . at this instant a more or less significant part of the solution is strongly oversaturated with respect to the equilibrium solubility . the further precipitation ( growth ) of the hydrates can thus be regarded to happen approximately within a spatial uniform oversaturated solution ( oversaturated interface layer ) . this is in so far of concern as the uniformity of ` initial conditions ' is crucial to predict kinetic exponents for diffusion controlled reactions . it also supposes that the nucleation rate tends rapidly to zero as the hydrate microstructure further develops . the hydrate microstructure has been experimentally classified for a water to cement ratio @xmath112 . within the first @xmath113 foil  like microstructure precipitation is reported to happen radially away from the cement grains ( typical dimensions @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) . thereafter ( @xmath116 ) the formation of a gelatinous layer sourrouding the cement grains have been observed ( thickness @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) . also needle - like precipitates have been found . finally after several days crumpled interlocking foils are observed ( comp . [ fig0 ] ) . it has been also reported that the precipitated microstructure morphologies are strongly influenced by the available interparticle spacings@xcite . there is presently no straightforward way to predict / calculate microstructural morphologies for such complex systems , however , recently developed heterogeneous reaction - diffusion models have received considerable interest in this context@xcite . the growth of a precipitate is kinematically very complex . the precipitated geometry ( microstructure ) can not be predescribed in general beyond the initial conditions but is rather a _ result _ of the associated interface dynamics . the most simplest case is governed by the growth of spherical precipitates of radius @xmath119 from an initially supersaturated solution of concentration @xmath120 . let @xmath121 denote the particle concentration in the solvent , @xmath122 the particle concentration within the precipitate at the interface , @xmath123 the particle concentration within the solvent at the interface and @xmath124 the diffusion coefficient of particles in the solvent . one has from continuity of mass , @xmath125 this is the equation of motion for the interface ( in spherical co  ordinates ) . it establishes the direct proportionality between _ local _ growth rate and particle current density at the interface . in general @xmath126 depends , as a consequence of interfacial tension , on the ( local ) interface curvature . if the precipitate is not too small one often assumes the zero curvature limit , i.e. , @xmath127 . the most interesting point in eq . ( [ boundaryequation ] ) is that the gradient of @xmath128 contains ` global information ' about the interface because @xmath129 is the solution of the ( stationary ) diffusion equation , @xmath130 obtained under boundary conditions @xmath131 and @xmath132 . the solution of eqs . ( [ boundaryequation ] ) and ( [ laplaceequation ] ) is the well known parabolic growth law@xcite , @xmath133 similarly a parabolic solution is also obtained for the growth of a flat interface . more generally does the local growth rate dynamically depend on ( at least ) two competitive mechanisms ( a ) flattening of high curvature regions due to interfacial tension and ( b ) sharpening of these regions due to preferential diffusive growth at these ` tips ' . numerical boundary integral methods have been developed in order to study the associated interface dynamics and instability , e.  g.  see ref . for a pertubative treatment see for example ref . @xcite . despite the complexity of involved microstructural transformations the natural question arises whether there exists at a given time a _ typical microstructure _ and a _ typical mode of growth _ within the system . suppose the case of a vanishing nucleation rate during precipitate growth . if the precipitating structure grows geometrically in form of a plate ( see the above experimental classification scheme ) then the variation in mole fraction of precipitated phase in time is predicted theoretically for @xmath134 as @xmath135@xcite with @xmath136 being a characteristic timescale for the growth@xcite . the plate s rim grows at a constant rate while its thickness grows parabolically in time , explaining the exponent @xmath137 . for @xmath134 one can replace the quantity @xmath60 by @xmath138 in all foregoing considerations . one is lead to the conclusion that for early foil  like hydrate growth @xmath139 and @xmath140 in eqs .  ( [ early - powerlaw ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) respectively . this is in agreement with the considered measurements , see fig . [ fig1 ] .    what causes the observed slowing down of the hydration process ? if a single foil would precipitate in a spatially infinite supersaturated solution there would be no obvious reason for a slowing down of the hydration process as there exists no characteristic length scale . however , the here considered case of cement paste is an assembly of small anhydrous cement grains immersed in water . the mean free distance between particles has to be considered as a typical length scale for the transport and for the precipitation process ( @xmath141 ) . the size of the growing flakes _ can not _ exceed this because of spatial hindrance . hence there must exist a typical time scale @xmath70 at which the flakes change their mode of growth into thickening only . we interpret this typical time as the crossover time @xmath6 observed in fig . growth of flakes in the thickening only mode is expected to happen parabolically in time for diffusion limited precipitation reactions@xcite . therefore we predict the exponents of the deaccelerated period to be @xmath142 and @xmath143 in eqs . ( [ later - powerlaw ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) respectively , in agreement with the experimental data fig . [ fig1 ] .    apparently with the above assessments we have related the experimentally observed kinetic exponents of the hydration products to microstructural information . certainly there is no unique mapping between kinetics and geometry , but this constitutes a complex question in terms of eqs . ( [ boundaryequation ] ) and ( [ laplaceequation ] ) to be studied in future on its own right . so far we have restricted our considerations to the case of a water to cement weight ratio @xmath25 . the question arises whether the kinetic exponents are universal and how the observed typical crossover quantities @xmath70 and @xmath144 do depend on @xmath145 . we show in fig . [ fig2 ] experimental ( replotted ) data for three different @xmath145 ratios . the data do not collapse , which is not so surprising because the typical interparticle spacing does depend on @xmath145 . qualitatively higher @xmath145 ratios correspond to lower charateristic times @xmath70 and lower hydrate ` amounts ' @xmath144 . for early times we observe kinetic exponents that do ( apparently ) depend on @xmath145 . interestingly are the kinetic exponents @xmath78 for the deacceleration period in all cases close to @xmath146 . however , we have not studied this in further detail because there are less experimental data available than for the standard case @xmath25 , i.e. , the hydration curves need to be experimentally reproducible for given @xmath145 .", "we have reconsiderd nmr measurements on the overall hydration kinetics of tricalcium silicate pastes ( @xmath50 ) in sec .

we therefore conclude that the fit is good and the cluster is well represented by a @xmath9 model . there is a strong degeneracy in the fit between @xmath9 and @xmath42 ; however this has little effect on the comparison with the sz data and the derived value of @xmath0 . figure [ margplot ] shows the likelihood contours for the fit in the @xmath9@xmath34 plane , marginalised over @xmath43 and using the best - fit value of the axial ratio ( which is very well constrained ) . overlaid are the contours of predicted mean observed sz flux density on the shortest rt baseline . it can be seen that despite the degeneracy between @xmath9 and @xmath34 , the range of sz flux densities corresponding to the 1-@xmath2 limits of the model fit is only @xmath44 . since the sz flux density varies as @xmath45 , this corresponds to a @xmath46 error in @xmath0 due to the model fitting . this lack of sensitivity to the @xmath9@xmath47 degeneracy is characteristic of observations that are sensitive to spatial frequencies around the cluster core size ( see eg reese et al ) and contrasts with the sensitivity to the model fitting of measurements that measure only lower spatial frequencies ( eg birkinshaw & hughes ) .", "to measure @xmath0 , we compared the real sz data with a simulation of the sz effect from the x - ray gas model . we use the expression of challinor & lasenby to provide a relativistic correction to the standard non - relativistic sz expression ;

{"id": "astro-ph0312300", "section_names": ["introduction", "observations", "results", "discussion", "conclusions"], "document": ["a key question in star formation research concerns the mechanisms behind the launch of jets from young stars . these jets are believed to play an important role in the removal of excess angular momentum from the system , thus allowing accretion of matter onto the star up to its final mass . it is generally acknowledged that magneto - centrifugal forces are responsible for jet launching . in particular in the so - called ` disk - wind ' model ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) the jet is launched from the disk surface within a few au from the star ; while in the x - wind model @xcite the base of the flow is located at a few stellar radii from the source . to date , resolution constraints on observations have impeded progress in validating the magneto - centrifugal mechanism , since jet launching occurs on small scales ( i.e. less than 20 au from the star ) ; moreover , infall and outflow kinematics are complex and confused close to the source , that is often heavily embedded . recently , however , interesting results have been obtained from observations of jets from more evolved , less embedded t tauri stars ( ttss ) for which the jet can be optically traced back to its origin . observational backing for canonical models would require , for example , proof of rotation around the symmetry axis , close to the base where the jet is launched . the first hint of jet rotation was reported for the hh 212 system @xcite . however the knots were located at 2@xmath510@xmath6 - 10@xmath7 au from the jet source . independently , asymmetries in velocities within the first 110 au of the outflow from the t tauri star dg tau were found @xcite , indicative of rotation . these results were obtained through an analysis of high angular resolution spectra taken with the hubble space telescope imaging spectrograph ( hst / stis ) , aimed at probing the acceleration and collimation region of a stellar jet . further confirmation of the rotation hypothesis came from owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) observations , which report the sense of rotation of the disk of dg tau to be the same as that of the jet @xcite . moreover , the derived toroidal velocities in the observed portion of the jet were seen to be in agreement with the predictions of the magneto - centrifugal models , and indeed they can be used to find the location on the disk plane of the launching point of the wind ( @xcite ) . these results motivated us to conduct an optical stis survey to establish conclusively whether jets from young stars rotate . we report findings for another three sources ( of eight in the survey sample ) for which the data have already been acquired , i.e. the bi - polar jets from the ttss th28 and rw aur , and the blue - shifted jet from lkh@xmath0321 .", "observations were made of the jets associated with th28 , lkh@xmath0321 and rw aur using hst / stis on june 22 , august 20 , and october 3 , 2002 respectively ( proposal i d 9435 ) . an aperture of 52 @xmath5 0.1 arcsec@xmath8 was used with the g750 m grating which gave a spectral sampling of 0.554   pixel@xmath2 , corresponding to a radial velocity of @xmath4 25 km  s@xmath2 for the wavelength range covered . the angular sampling was 0@xmath3.05 pixel@xmath2 . an acquisition of the stellar peak intensity prior to science observations allowed the slit to be centered accurately on the star before being offset to a position perpendicular to the jet axis at 0@xmath3.3 from the source . we assume inclination angles ( w.r.t . the plane of the sky ) of 10@xmath9 for th28 @xcite , 44@xmath9 for rw aur @xcite , and 45@xmath9 for lkh@xmath0321 ( arbitrary , since unknown , although it may have a large inclination angle from spectro - astrometric measurements @xcite ) . the offset of 0@xmath3.3 then represents a deprojected distance of @xmath4 51 , 195 and 233 au along the jet for th28 , rw aur , and lkh@xmath0321 , respectively . the only exception was in the case of the rw aur blue - shifted jet lobe where the slit was placed at 0@xmath3.2 due to lack of line emission at 0@xmath3.3 @xcite . spectra were obtained of the blue- and red - shifted lobes , using exposure times of 2200 and 2700 seconds respectively , for the bi - polar jets associated with th28 and rw aur . in the case of lkh@xmath0321 , only the blue - shifted lobe was detectable and so two spectra of this lobe , with exposure times of 2200 and 2700 seconds , were obtained and summed to increase the signal - to - noise of the faint emission lines . in total , this yielded five spectra , in the transverse direction at the base of the jets , which included h@xmath0 and the forbidden emission lines ( fels ) [ oi]@xmath106300,6363 , [ nii]@xmath106548,6583 , [ sii]@xmath106716,6731 . data were calibrated through the standard hst pipeline , subtraction of the reflected stellar continuum was performed , and hot / dark pixels were removed .", "in order to determine whether rotation is present in the jet channel , the difference in velocities on either side of the jet axis was analysed . position - velocity contour plots for a sample of emission lines are shown in figure  [ pv ] , top panels . all radial velocities are systemic , i.e. they are quoted with respect to the mean heliocentric velocity of the star , which has been measured from photospheric lines to be + 5 km  s@xmath2 for th28 @xcite , + 23 km  s@xmath2 for rw aur @xcite and -7 km  s@xmath2 for lkh@xmath0321 ( e. whelan , priv . comm . ) . the lower order contours trace the outer jet channel where the jet is not so well collimated and where the lower velocities lie . if rotation is present , there will be a difference in radial velocities between the two sides of the jet . this difference will be evident graphically as a skew in the contours of the transverse position - velocity diagram . such a skew is indeed observed in all three cases in the outer contour lines . this suggests the presence of rotation in at least the low velocity component ( lvc ) of the flow near the outer borders of the jet channel . the high velocity component ( hvc ) , which is located much closer to the jet axis and gives rise to the emission peak @xcite , appears not to be spatially resolved in our spectra . for this reason we can not resolve any velocity difference in the hvc between the the two sides of the flow , i.e. we can not detect rotation for this velocity component .            to give a quantitative estimate of the observed velocity shifts , it was firstly necessary to ensure that we measure velocity offsets at equal distances on either side of the jet axis . to this purpose we assumed that the peak of the ( hvc ) emission traces the position of the axis , and measured its distance from the nominal center of the slit , with a gaussian fit along the cross - dispersion direction . we then shifted the line emission re - centering the hvc peak on the nominal zero arcsecond position . in all cases a small offset ( @xmath11 0.4 pixels ) was required , table  [ pixel_shifts ] . the offsets have different sign and magnitude for the three targets , indicating that this is not an instrumental systematic effect . instead , pixel shift values for emission lines in opposite jet lobes are consistent with a maximum misalignment @xmath11 2 degrees with respect to the perpendicular of the actual jet axis at sub - arcsecond scales . this resulted in a displacement of the peak intensity of up to 0@xmath3.02 , a quantity which would produce a marginal asymmetry in radial velocity estimated to be at most 20@xmath12 if uncorrected @xcite . this error was , however , avoided as the emission was brought on - axis prior to analysis . lc jet lobe & pixel shift applied + th28 red lobe & + 0.3672 + th28 blue lobe & -0.3672 + rw aur red lobe & -0.216 + rw aur blue lobe & + 0.1728 + lkh@xmath0321 blue lobe & -0.36 +    the peak intensities of pixel rows on either side of the central row were then compared for velocity differences , figure   [ pv ] , bottom panels . the intensity profiles of each pair of pixel rows symmetric about the jet axis was plotted ( e.g. @xmath10@xmath3.1 , or as indicated in each box ) . the single curve at the bottom in each case is the intensity of the central on - axis pixel row . two methods were used in velocity measurements : a cross - correlation technique , which analyses the overall displacement of lines and is independent of the shape of the line profile ; and a gaussian fitting technique , which acts as a suitable check given the simple shape of the line profile in most cases . specifically , each pair of pixel rows , mirrored in distance from the jet axis , was cross - correlated , and gaussian fits for each pair of rows were also compared . the outcomes of the two methods are consistent , showing clear radial velocity differences of 10 to 25 ( @xmath1 5 ) km  s@xmath2 for opposing jet edges . results are listed in table  [ radial_velocities ] , in which we report the measured radial velocity differences in the direction of the oriented slit , corresponding to a direction specified in the first column of the table . in a small number of cases , flagged in the table with a @xmath13 symbol , the emission had to be filtered out of a background which was causing velocity measurements to be artifically changed due to either : relatively strong hvc presence ; oversubtraction of the background ; or low signal - to - noise at crucial positions . the overall results are illustrated graphically in figures [ velocitydiff1 ] to [ velocitydiff3 ] . . the derived sense of rotation is illustrated by the circular arrow around the symmetry axis . _ top right : _ symbols adopted for the various lines . _ bottom right : _ summary of radial velocity asymmetries measured at the base of the blue -

[ velocitydiff1 ] ]    , for the bi - polar jet from th28 . both slits were located at 0.@xmath143 from the source . [ velocitydiff2 ] ]    , for the bi - polar jet from rw aur . in the blue - shifted jet lobe the spectrum was taken at 0@xmath3.2 from the star . [ velocitydiff3 ] ]    finally , the radial velocity profile across each jet is shown in figure  [ transvel ] . in the red - shifted lobes of th28 and rw aur , the on - axis radial velocity is clearly the highest and the value reduces as the edges of the jet are approached . the blue - shifted lobes are not so clear as the emission is fainter and often more scattered . data reduction in these cases often required isolation of the lower velocity component from the hvc ( as marked in table  [ radial_velocities ] ) to identify elements of rotation . however radial velocities in this figure _ include _ the hvc , and so rotation is not apparent in all cases .    from the results of this spectral analysis , combined with the inclination angles , we find poloidal velocities for the rw aur jet of 144 - 227 km  s@xmath2 in the red lobe and 245 - 288 km  s@xmath2 in the blue lobe - this velocity asymmetry is well known from previous observations , @xcite ; for th28 jet of 115 - 288 km  s@xmath2 in the red lobe and 230 - 374 km  s@xmath2 in the blue lobe - an asymmetry which was also previously recorded , @xcite ; and for lkh@xmath0321 of 540 - 550 km  s@xmath2 . toroidal velocities derived from the outer positional radial velocity shifts , being less affected by projection effects ( see section 4 ) , are in the ranges of : 7 to 17 km  s@xmath2 for both lobes of rw aur ; 5 to 13 km  s@xmath2 for the red lobe of th28 ; 4 to 8 km  s@xmath2 for the blue lobe of th28 ; and 4 to 9 km  s@xmath2 for the blue lobe of lkh@xmath0321 . ( note that , in the ranges given above , the higher poloidal velocities lie at distances closest to the rotation axis , and these correspond to the lower toroidal and radial velocities . )", "assuming that emission from the jet is axially symmetric , we interpret our findings of velocity differences between the two sides of the jet flow , table   [ radial_velocities ] and figures   [ velocitydiff1 ] to [ velocitydiff3 ] , as evidence for rotation at the base of the jet . most importantly , for th28 and rw aur , the red and blue jet lobes were found to rotate in the same direction . this implies that the helicity in the red and blue lobes ( i.e. the handedness of toroidal with respect to the poloidal velocity ) is opposite in opposite directions , a result predicted by mhd models where the ambient field is wrapped around due to disk rotation .    before looking at each target individually , there are a few general comments to be made about the results in table  [ radial_velocities ] . firstly , the velocity difference measurements close to the jet axis , i.e. at the 0@xmath3.05 position , are noticeably smaller than points further away , and where the emission is detectable at 0@xmath3.2 and beyond , velocity differences are higher than at intermediate distances . this effect may at first appear in contradiction with the notion that the central portions of the jet should rotate faster . a detailed comparison with disk - wind model predictions ( @xcite , and @xcite ) shows , however , that the apparent decrease of the observed velocity difference toward the jet axis is likely to be due to projection and beam smearing effects . since the emission is optically thin we see , along the line of sight , the sum of the contributions emitted from regions in the jet that rotate with different toroidal velocities . this causes a reduction of the observed velocity shift . such an effect is more important for regions closer to the axis , while the values measured at the outer jet borders are less contaminated and so are in better agreement with theoretically predicted toroidal velocities . in other words this effect does not reflect a true kinematic feature , but is expected on the basis of mhd acceleration models when combined with our observational mode . secondly , it should be noted that the size of velocity differences in different emission lines does not represent scattering around an average value but rather is due to the fact that emission has its origin at different positions along the line of sight . and lastly , the [ nii ] lines show higher velocity differences than other emission lines , a result that illustrates how they trace the central more collimated higher velocity region of the flow ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    the results for the th28 red - shifted jet lobe are clearest . velocity differences alomg the sw - ne direction are positive , with a few exceptions mainly in the [ sii ] lines . also , the data close to the jet axis are not well resolved as explained above . the stronger [ oi ] and [ nii ] lines have values of 5 and 6 km  s@xmath2 at 0@xmath3.05 from the axis compared to 10 to 20 km  s@xmath2 further from the axis , while the outer jet channel seems to have higher radial velocity differences of about 24 km  s@xmath2 . values in the blue - shifted jet lobe are less clear , but [ nii ] and [ oi ] emission give positive differences consistent with the red - shifted lobe . all other usable data points fall within the error bars about zero . globally , we find evidence that both lobes of the jet rotate in a clockwise direction , looking down the blue - shifted jet lobe towards the source , with a measured radial velocity difference of 10 to 25 km  s@xmath2 . the rw aur jet also shows clear indications of rotational velocities . exceptions include the [ sii]@xmath156731 values in the red - shifted lobe . also points close to the jet axis show smaller radial velocity differences due to strong unresolved hvc emission . however , the [ oi ] lines give clear results with higher radial velocity difference evident at 0@xmath3.2 from the jet axis . the blue - shifted lobe is less definite , but nevertheless velocity differences outside the error bars are positive in line with the red - shifted lobe . overall , results show an anti - clockwise rotation looking down the blue - shifted jet lobe towards the source , again with radial velocity differences of 10 to 25 km  s@xmath2 . these findings are consistent in magnitude and direction with results of similar research on the rw aur jet @xcite in which rotational velocities in the same direction of 10 to 20 km  s@xmath2 have been observed , in the form of velocity differences between the borders of the flow . for this study hst / stis was also used , but the spectra were taken in a set of positions across the jet with the slit direction parallel to the jet axis .    in the case of lkh@xmath0321 , which is located at 550 pc ( more than three times the distance of the other targets ) the emission lines were very faint despite having combined two spectra to increase the signal - to - noise ratio . nevertheless , velocity differences in the range of -5 to -30 km  s@xmath2 have been measured , although evidence of rotation is weaker in this case . the sense of rotation for lkh@xmath0321 is measured as anti - clockwise looking down the blue - shifted lobe towards the star . in this jet we are able to measure rotation at higher velocities because of a number of factors : lkh@xmath0321 is farther away meaning we are looking further along the jet ( 233 au from the source , projected distance ) to a point where it has widened and so we can resolve higher velocities ; a large inclination angle ( which appears to be the case from spectro - astrometric measurements @xcite ) would mean that the poloidal and radial velocities approach each other ; and finally this is a larger mass t  tauri star , since it has spectral type g1 @xcite , implying higher velocities in the outer resolvable regions of the jet .    it is reassuring that we obtain _ negative _ shifts in the case of lkh@xmath0321 , as opposed to the positive shifts observed for the other two sources because , as we are comparing the _ same _ rows on the ccd detector in all cases , it means we are not measuring an instrumental effect . conceiveably , a slight misalignment of the slit with respect to the transverse direction of the jet ( i.e inaccurate position angle used in the pointing of the instrument ) may produce an effect similar to rotation . in this case , the position of the real jet axis will then be shifted with respect to the nominal zero arcsec position . we have shifted the spectral image back to the zero arcsec position as previously discussed ( section 3 ) , but the angle subtended remains a problem . it could produce a rotation signature even in a non - rotating jet , since the hvc and lvc are at different spatial locations on the ccd with respect to the zero arcsec row of pixels , implying that we are not probing symmetric regions of the jet with respect to its real axis . given such a misalignment has occurred , the extent of the contamination does not have , however , a dramatic affect on our results , as can be seen from the fact that the pixel shift requirements for th28 and lkh@xmath0321 ( table   [ pixel_shifts ] ) are in the same direction but the sense of rotation of their jets is opposite . for rw aur , the same pa was used here for slit positioning as in a previous study @xcite , where it was found that the magnitude of the false rotation signature contamination due to incorrect pa was , at most , 1 - 5 km  s@xmath2 . however , the sense of the false signature is in fact opposite in direction to that of the jet s rotation , and so the values we have measured are actually lower limits . apart from this , the only other obvious effect which could produce a contour skew mimicking rotation is asymmetrical interaction with the local environment on either side of the propagating jet , e.g. asymmetrical mass entrainment leading to asymmetrical poloidal velocities . however such mimicking is unlikely because ( apart from the fact that asymmetrical entrainment should also produce enhanced emission at one border of the flow , which is not seen in our spectra ) we see the same asymmetry in both the red and blue shifted jet lobes where present , and the magnitudes of the deduced toroidal velocity differences are in the range predicted by theory ( as discussed below ) . overall , our observations are in line with the observations of the jet from the t  tauri star dg tau @xcite . in that case , by using simple and general relationships governing the physics of magnetically launched disk  winds together with an observationally based estimate of the ratio , @xmath16 , between the mass flux in the jet and the mass flux accreted through the disk ( @xmath16 @xmath17 0.1 ) , it was demonstrated that the observed velocity differences were in the expected range , @xcite . these values compare well with our results , which therefore support the magneto -

called unfolding technique ( which is used in this paper ) allows one to obtain estimates on the maximal number of bounces of a particle in a wedge . one could expect that the bouncing coin dynamics could be interpreted as a billiard ball problem . in this paper we consider a simpler system ( with fewer degrees of freedom ) which we call the dumbbell . the bouncing coin on a flat surface , restricted to have axis of rotation pointing in the same direction , can be modeled as a system of two masses connected with a weightless rod . the dumbbell dynamics that is studied in this article is a useful model to initiate investigation of this potentially useful relation . another motivation for the dumbbell dynamics comes from robotics exploratory problems , see _ e.g. _ @xcite . consider an automated system that moves in a bounded domain and interacts with the boundary according to some simple laws . in many applications , it is important to cover the whole region as _ e.g. _ in automated vacuum cleaners such as roomba . then , a natural question arises : _ what simple mechanical system can generate a dense coverage of a certain subset of the given configuration space_. the dumbbell , compared to a material point , has an extra degree of freedom which can generate more chaotic behavior as _ e.g. _ in sinai billiards . indeed , a rapidly rotating dumbbell will quickly `` forget '' its initial orientation before the next encounter with the boundary raising some hope for stronger ergodicity .    in this paper , we study the interaction of a dumbbell with the flat boundary . this is an important first step before understanding the full dynamics of the dumbbell in some simple domains . by appropriately rescaling the variables , we obtain an associated single particle billiard problem with the boundary corresponding to the collision curve ( which is piecewise smooth ) in the configuration space . the number of collisions of the dumbbell with the boundary before scattering out depends on the mass ratio @xmath0 . if this ratio is far from 1 , then the notion of adiabatic invariance can be introduced as there is sufficient time scales separation . we prove an adiabatic invariant type theorem and we describe under what conditions it can be used .    finally , we estimate the maximal number of bounces of the dumbbell with the flat boundary . + * notation : * we use some standard notation when dealing with asymptotic expansions in order to avoid cumbersome use of implicit constants . + @xmath1 for some @xmath2 + @xmath3 + @xmath4 +", "let us consider a dumbbell -

meaning : angular velocity times the distance traveled by the light mass between two consecutive collisions . now , we state the theorem for a realistic scenario when a rapidly rotating dumbbell

leave the floor after the final bounce by @xmath5 with @xmath125 . the adiabatic invariant is defined as above @xmath126 . the condition on the angle @xmath127 comes naturally from the following argument . if @xmath128 , the dumbbell approaching from infinity will naturally hit the floor when @xmath129 . since @xmath71 is small , this implies @xmath130 . if @xmath131 happens to be too close to @xmath132 , then there is no hope to obtain adiabatic invariant and we exclude such set of initial conditions . in the limit @xmath133 the relative measure of the set where @xmath134 tends to zero

@xmath146 . then , at the @xmath135 collision , the center of mass will be located at @xmath147 , which will imply @xmath139\\de$ ] . now using lemma 3.1 , corollary 3.2 , and theorem 3.3 , we compute the error term of the adiabatic invariant under the assumption that the total number of collisions is bounded by @xmath148 and the heavy mass does not hit the floor . @xmath149    by the theorem proved in the next section there is indeed a uniform bound on the number of bounces . if the heavy mass does hit the floor it can do so only once as shown in the next section . we claim that the corresponding change in the adiabatic invariant will be only of order @xmath150 . indeed , using formula and the comment after that , we obtain @xmath151 where subscripts @xmath152 denote the variables just after and before the larger mass hits the floor . let the pairs @xmath153 @xmath154 denote the corresponding values of @xmath155 when the light mass hits the floor right before and after the large mass hits the floor . then , since @xmath156 , we find that @xmath157 and @xmath158 . as a consequence , @xmath159 and the change in adiabatic invariant due to large mass hitting the floor is sufficiently small @xmath160 .", "in this section , we estimate the maximal number of collisions of the dumbbell with the floor as a function of the mass ratios . as we have seen in section 2.2 , on @xmath161 plane , the dumbbell reduces to a mass point that has unit velocity and elastic reflection . we use the classical billiard result which states that the number of collisions inside a straight wedge with the inner angle @xmath162 is given by @xmath163 , see e.g. @xcite . first , we discuss the properties of the boundaries of the dumbbell system on @xmath164 plane . + when @xmath165 , we have the mass ratios @xmath166 . recall from ( [ bd ] ) that the boundaries are given by @xmath167 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the angle between the two sine waves is @xmath168 . + when @xmath169 , it follows from ( [ bd ] ) that the boundaries consist of two sine curves with different heights . we will assume @xmath170 , since the case @xmath171 is symmetric . it is easy to see that generically in the limit @xmath172 most of repeated collisions will occur between two peaks of ( [ bd1 ] ) . in section 4.2 , we will find the upper bound for the number of collisions of the mass point to the boundaries . to start the proof , let us consider the straight wedge formed by the tangent lines to ( [ bd1 ] ) at @xmath173 and @xmath174 . we call these tangent lines @xmath175 and @xmath176 respectively , and denote the angle of the straight wedge by @xmath177 , see figure 3 . let us denote the wedge created by the union of the sine waves when @xmath178 and the tangent lines @xmath175 and @xmath176 when @xmath179 as the hybrid wedge . plane.,width=240 ]      we first introduce some notations . denote the trajectory bouncing from the hybrid wedge by @xmath180 , and let the approximating trajectory bouncing from the straight wedge by the double - prime symbols @xmath181 . when @xmath180 or @xmath181 is written with the subscript @xmath182 , it denotes the segment of the corresponding trajectory between the @xmath182-th bounce and the @xmath183-st bounce . let @xmath184 be the angle from the straight wedge to @xmath185 , and @xmath186 denote the angle from the straight wedge to @xmath187 after the @xmath182-th collision . define @xmath188 as the angle difference between the straight wedge and the curved wedge at @xmath182-th collision of @xmath185 . the trajectory will terminate when the sequence of angles terminates ( due to the absence of the next bounce ) , or when there will be no more intersections with the straight wedge . this will happen when the angle of intersection , @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 , with the tangent line is less than or equal to @xmath177 . consider the hybrid wedge and the straight wedge described above . the sequence of angles @xmath192 will terminate after or at the same index as the sequence of angles @xmath193 . suppose that the initial segment @xmath194 ( of the full trajectory ) crosses the straight wedge before it hits the hybrid wedge , as shown on the right panel of figure 4.1 . then @xmath195 when the initial segment @xmath194 hits the hybrid wedge before crossing the straight wedge , as shown on the left panel , then set @xmath196 . now we can proceed by induction if @xmath197 and @xmath198 and the sequence @xmath184 has not terminated . @xmath199 which implies that @xmath200 . + since @xmath201 , then @xmath180 will terminate at the same time or before @xmath181 . define the bridge as the smaller sine wave created by @xmath202 when @xmath203 from @xmath173 to @xmath204 . the union of the bridge with the hybrid wedge will create the boundary as it is actually defined by the dumbbell dynamics . the presence of the bridge in the hybrid wedge will increase the number of collisions of the dumbbell by at most one from the number of collisions of the dumbbell to the hybrid wedge . consider the true trajectory ( denoted by @xmath205 ) that `` sees '' the bridge . recall the definition of angle @xmath184 , which is the angle from the straight wedge to @xmath206 . similarly , we let @xmath207 be the angle to @xmath208 . before @xmath205 intersects the bridge , by lemma 4.1 we have @xmath209 now define @xmath210 to be the angle measured from the horizontal line to the tangent line at the point where @xmath205 hits the bridge . note that @xmath210 takes a positive value if the dumbbell hits the left half of the bridge , and @xmath210 takes a negative value if @xmath205 hits the right half of the bridge . we express @xmath211 after the bounce from the bridge in terms of @xmath207 . by this convention , the bounce from the bridge does not increase the index count but we will have to add @xmath212 in the end . + then , we have @xmath213    we may assume that @xmath205 hits the bridge with non - positive velocity in @xmath29 . if the dumbbell hits the bridge with positive velocity in @xmath29 , it will continue to move in the positive @xmath29 direction after reflection from the bridge . then , we consider the reverse trajectory to bound the number of collisions . this allows us to restrict @xmath207 . moreover , @xmath208 naturally hits the upper part of hybrid wedge than @xmath206 . we also assume that @xmath205 hits the left half of the bridge . otherwise , we can reflect the orbit around the vertical line passing through the middle point of the bridge .    utilizing the above arguments , we have the inequalities    @xmath214    it is straightforward to verify that ( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) imply @xmath215 . from the @xmath216-nd bounce , if @xmath207 has not terminated , we can apply induction argument similar to the proof in lemma 4.1 . we have the base case @xmath217    note that @xmath218 s indicate the relative position of a collision point in the hybrid wedge . that is , if @xmath219 , then the starting point of @xmath220 is located at or above that of @xmath208 . since @xmath215 and @xmath220 starts above @xmath221 , we know @xmath222 will start on the hybrid wedge higher than @xmath223 . this implies @xmath224 then using the recursive relationship , @xmath225 we obtain @xmath226 . by induction @xmath227 for all @xmath182 . taking into account the bounce on the bridge , we conclude that the number of bounces of @xmath205 will increase at most by one relative to that of @xmath180 . note that in most cases , the number of bounces of @xmath205 will be less than the number of bounces of @xmath180 . now we are ready to prove the main theorem . the number of collisions of the dumbbell is bounded above by @xmath228 , where @xmath229 .    when @xmath230 , as we have found in the previous section 4.1 , the boundaries form identical hybrid wedges which intersect at @xmath231 . using lemma 4.1 , we conclude that the upper bound for the number of collisions is @xmath232 , which is less than @xmath233 . + when @xmath170 , we consider the true boundaries which consist of a hybrid wedge with the bridge . using lemma 4.1 and lemma 4.2 , we conclude that the the maximal number of collisions to the true boundary is bounded above by @xmath234 . since @xmath235 , this completes the proof .", "the

( 3 ) under the shape independent approximation . for convenience , we separate the hamiltonian into a center - of - mass part and a relative part , @xmath8 so that @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 . here the energy and length are expressed in units of @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the reduced mass ) respectively . the strength of the pseudo - potential is characterized by the modified s - wave scattering length @xmath0 . for a given inter - atomic potential , the precise value of @xmath0 depends on the trapping potential and it can be determined self - consistently by the methods discussed in ref . @xcite . in this paper we will treat @xmath0 as a parameter of the hamiltonian . the s - wave eigen - functions of the @xmath15 have been solved analytically in ref . @xcite . given a scattering length , the eigen - energy @xmath16 of @xmath17 is defined by the solution of : @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the gamma function . the eigenfunctions of @xmath17 with the energy @xmath16 are given by : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a normalization constant , and @xmath22 is the kummer s function @xcite .    in this paper we assume that the center of mass wave function is the ground state of @xmath23 , which is a simple gaussian : @xmath24 . combining @xmath25 with @xmath26 , the two - particle energy eigenfunctions are given by @xmath27 in fig . 1 , we illustrate how the eigen - energies depend on the scattering length . for convenience , we choose to plot with the inverse of scattering length , i.e. , @xmath28 , in order to indicate the continuous branch associated with the ground states . it should be noted that the ground state energy becomes large and negative when @xmath28 is positive and large . this feature also occurs in the absence of the harmonic trapping potential , and it is due to the existence of a tightly bound state in the @xmath29 limit @xcite . as an illustration , we show in fig . 2 the radial probability density associated with relative coordinate wave functions at several values of @xmath0 .", "the characterization of quantum entanglement is achieved by schmidt decomposition of @xmath30 , which reads : @xmath31 where @xmath32 are eigenvalues , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are schmidt eigenmodes defined by , @xmath35 note that the mode functions @xmath36 form a complete and orthonormal set , and the same is true for @xmath37 . if the atom 1 appears in the mode @xmath36 , then with certainty the atom 2 must be in the mode @xmath37 . in other words , eq . ( 7 ) indicates the pairing structure of the two particle state . in addition , the distribution of @xmath38 provides a measure of the degree of entanglement . this is usually discussed in terms of the entanglement entropy @xmath39 . however , a more transparent measure is the effective number of schmidt modes , which is provided by the schmidt number : @xmath40 @xcite . a disentangled ( product ) state corresponds to @xmath41 , i.e. , there is only one term in the schmidt decomposition . the larger the value of @xmath42 , the higher the entanglement . we point out that @xmath43 equals the purity of the density matrix of an individual particle . the purity has also been employed as a measure of the degree of entanglement in various physical situations @xcite . to carry out the schmidt decomposition of the wave functions in three dimension , we note that @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the angle between @xmath47 and @xmath48 . therefore the wave function @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the legendre polynominal , and @xmath51 with the help of the addition formula : @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 this expression is already partially in the schmidt form , because the pairing of angular functions has been identified . the remaining task is to decompose @xmath54 for each @xmath55 . this can be achieved by performing the schmidt decomposition of the function @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath57 here the prefactor @xmath58 is introduced in order to ensure correct normalization in radial directions . the final form of the schmidt decomposition of the wave function eq . ( 5 ) now reads : @xmath59\\left [ { \\frac { { v_{nl } ( r_2 ) } } { { r_2 } } y_{lm } \\left ( { \\theta _ 2 , \\phi _ 2 } \\right ) } \\right].\\ ] ] our derivation indicates a general feature that for any wave function that is a function of distances @xmath60 and @xmath61 only , the angular parts of schmidt modes are simply the spherical harmonics . the pairing involves angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath62 and @xmath63 , i.e. , the same @xmath55 and opposite @xmath5 must be paired . in addition , each @xmath5 is of equal weight for a given @xmath55 . therefore if one could select schmidt modes with a fixed @xmath64 and @xmath55 via projective measurement , then the resulting state is a maximally entangled state among various @xmath5 s on the projected @xmath55 manifold .", "the fact that the angular parts of schmidt modes can be obtained analytically reduces the computational difficulty in the original three - dimensional problem . finding @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 in eq . ( 12 ) is a relatively simple numerical task , because @xmath56 behaves as a two - particle ( one dimensional ) wave function in non - negative @xmath68 and @xmath69 regions . specifically , we first obtain @xmath70 by performing numerical integration of ( 10 ) for discretized values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , typically with the spacing @xmath71 . for the s - wave eigenfunctions considered here , it is sufficient to choose @xmath68 and @xmath69 ranging from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , where the wave functions are mainly confined . because of the symmetry properties of @xmath56 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the same real functions . therefore @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath74 can be obtained by diagonalizing the matrix @xmath56 . for low energy states considered in this paper , @xmath55 up to 30 are typically sufficient in order to obtain convergent results . we can now obtain the value of @xmath42 for the state ( 13 ) from the schmidt eigenvalues , i.e. , @xmath75 here @xmath76 is defined . the main result of this paper is shown in fig . 3 , where the values of @xmath42 are displayed as a function of the inverse of the scaled scattering length for low energy states . we notice that higher excited states generally have higher quantum entanglement . however , the ground state ( curve a ) shows a distinct behavior in the positive @xmath28 region , where we notice a sharp rise of @xmath42 as @xmath28 increases . the strong ground state entanglement in the large positive @xmath28 limit is understood as the appearance of increasingly bounded atoms . this is implied in the ground state energy curve ( a ) in fig . 1 , as well as in the wave function @xmath77 shown in fig . a crude estimation of @xmath42 can be made from the analytical results of gaussian functions . for gaussian functions separable in the center of mass and relative coordinates , it is known that @xmath78 when the center of mass width @xmath79 is much wider than the width of the relative coordinate @xmath80 @xcite . here the tightly bound state corresponds to a strong localization in particle s relative distance , with @xmath80 of order @xmath0 in the @xmath81 limit . therefore @xmath82 , and hence high values of @xmath42 can be expected as in the case of gaussians functions . however , we remark that gaussian can only serve as a guide here , because the singular @xmath83 dependence in @xmath84 can not be captured by gaussians . indeed , @xmath42 depends on @xmath0 in a complicated form according to our numerical calculations .    for excited eigenstates on the branches b and c , we see an interesting feature in fig . 3 that the change of quantum entanglement is only sensitive to a range of scaled scattering lengths . such a window of scaled scattering lengths is highlighted by dash lines in fig . 3 , where we found that @xmath42 changes significantly with @xmath28 when @xmath85 . recalling that we are using the length unit defined by the harmonic trap , our results suggest that the s - wave interaction can appreciably affect quantum entanglement in excited states when @xmath0 is greater than or comparable with the width of a ground state particle inside the trap , i.e. , @xmath86 . this feature is also true for the ground state with negative scattering lengths . the structure of quantum entanglement is characterized by the distribution of schmidt eigenvalues and the schmidt mode functions . in fig . 4 we show the distribution @xmath87 for the ground state with @xmath88 and @xmath89 . in the case of @xmath88 , the entanglement @xmath90 is not high because of the presence of a dominant @xmath91 schmidt mode , which covers about @xmath92 probability of the state . on the contrary , @xmath93 is much higher for the @xmath89 case . this is shown in the distribution of @xmath87 ( fig . 5b ) in which schmidt modes with @xmath94 and higher angular momentum number @xmath55 are involved . in other words , the strong entanglement is mainly manifested in the angular variables .    in fig . 5 , we illustrate the shape of leading schmidt modes corresponding to the ground state wave functions in fig . since the angular part are simple spherical harmonic functions , we show only the radial mode functions in the figure . apart from the fact that schmidt modes of positive scattering lengths are more attracted to the origin , the change of scattering length has small effects on the mode functions . this is in contrast to the schmidt eigenvalues , which are more sensitive to the values of @xmath0 as depicted in fig . 4 .    finally , let us discuss the limit of @xmath95 or @xmath96 . in such a limit , we find that the eigenfunctions take simple analytic forms . we present some of the s - wave eigenfunctions of @xmath15 in the limit @xmath95 : @xmath97 , \\\\ & & \\psi_{12 } \\left ( { { \\bf r}_1 , { \\bf r}_2 } \\right ) = \\frac{{\\sqrt { 3/2 } } } { { \\pi ^{3/2 } } } \\frac{{e^ { - r_1 ^ 2 } e^ { - r_2 ^ 2 } } } { { \\left| { { \\bf r}_1 - { \\bf r}_2 } \\right|}}\\left [ { 1 - 4\\left ( { { \\bf r}_1 - { \\bf r}_2 } \\right)^2 + \\frac{4}{3}\\left ( { { \\bf r}_1 - { \\bf r}_2 } \\right)^4 } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here eqs . ( 15 - 17 ) correspond to the energy eigenfunctions ( center of mass @xmath98 relative coordinates ) associated with the lowest three states of @xmath17 , and the ground state of @xmath23 . although eqs . ( 15 - 17 ) are simple expressions , the schmidt decomposition still can not be carried out analytically . we perform numerical calculations which give : @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 for the wave functions given in eqs . ( 15 - 17 ) . therefore the degree of entanglement remains finite at the infinite scattering limit . we remark that the regularized pseudo - potential method can only describe wave functions at inter - atomic distance much larger than the range of the actual inter - atomic potential @xmath102 , i.e. , @xmath103 . inside the interaction range @xmath102 , the actual wave functions remain finite as @xmath104 . therefore the singular behavior at @xmath105 in eqs . ( 15 - 17 ) is only an artifact of the shape independent approximation , and hence these wave functions should be understood for @xmath106 only . however , since @xmath102 is typically much smaller than @xmath13 ( which is about the width of @xmath107 ) , the probability of finding the two particles within the range @xmath102 is negligible @xcite . this justifies the use of the shape independent approximation here .", "to summarize , we present a procedure to analyze the s - wave quantum entanglement between two ultra - cold atoms in a spherical harmonic trap . the s - wave interaction is described by the regularized pseudo - potential . by performing the schmidt decomposition of low energy eigenstates , we quantify the quantum entanglement and indicate its dependence on the modified scattering length . in particular , our schmidt analysis reveals the angular correlations by showing explicitly the pairing of spherical harmonic functions . for small and positive @xmath0 , the ground states are highly entangled states , and we explain this feature as a consequence of tight binding between the atoms . for low excited states and ground states with negative @xmath0 , we find that the atom - atom interaction can only appreciably affect the entanglement when the scattering length is larger than the width of the ( non - interacting ) ground state defined by the trap . however , the degree of entanglement remains finite in the large scattering length limit . our work here indicates that quantum entanglement can be controlled by the scattering length . to explore applications of s - wave entanglement , one may need to establish schemes for detecting schmidt modes . in addition , the dynamics of entanglement associated with non - stationary states of the system is also an interesting topic for open future investigations .              m. block and m. holthaus , phys . a * 65 * , 052102 ( 2002 ) ; e. tiesinga , c. j. williams , f. h. mies , and p. s. julienne , phys . a * 61 * , 063416 ( 2000 ) ; e. l. bolda , e. tiesinga , and p. s. julienne , phys . a * 66 * , 013403 ( 2002 ) . d. jaksch , h .- j . briegel , j. i. cirac , c. w. gardiner , and p. zoller , phys . lett . * 82 * , 1975 ( 1999 ) ; u. dorner , p. fedichev , d. jaksch , m. lewenstein , and p. zoller , phys . lett . * 91 * , 073601 ( 2003 ) . the problem of entanglement generation in free space scattering processes was recently addressed by : c. k. law , phys . a * 70 * , 062311 ( 2004 ) ; a. tal and g. kurizki , phys . lett . * 94 * , 160503 ( 2005 ) . r. grobe , k. rzaewski and j. h. eberly , j. phys . b * 27 * , l503 ( 1994 ) ; w .- c . liu , j. h. eberly , s. l. haan and r. grobe , phys . lett . * 83 * , 520 ( 1999 ) ; r. e. wagner , p. j. peverly , q. su , and r. grobe , laser phys . * 11 * , 221 ( 2001 ) ; c. k. law and j. h. eberly , phys * 92 * , 127903 ( 2004 ) ; p. krekora , q. su , and r. grobe , j. mod . opt . * 52 * , 489 ( 2005 ) .             as a function of the inverse of dimensionless scaled scattering length . @xmath16 is in units of @xmath12 . the three branches : a , b , and c correspond to the lowest three states with zero angular momentum ( in relative coordinate).,width=377 ]          , where the @xmath65 is defined in eq . . the solid line corresponds to the ground state with @xmath88 , while the dash line corresponds to @xmath89 . the radial distance @xmath61 is in units of @xmath111.,width=453 ]"], "summary": "we analyze the quantum entanglement between two interacting atoms trapped in a spherical harmonic potential . at ultra - cold temperature , ground state entanglement is generated by the dominated s - wave interaction . based on a regularized pseudo - potential hamiltonian , we examine the quantum entanglement by performing the schmidt decomposition of low - energy eigenfunctions . we indicate how the atoms are paired and quantify the entanglement as a function of a modified s - wave scattering length inside the trap .", "ranking": [4, 0, 1, 2, 3]}

ray ( cr ) densities within our galaxy is a key to understanding their origin and propagation . high - energy crs interact with the gas in the interstellar medium ( ism ) or the interstellar radiation field , and produce @xmath0-rays via nucleon - nucleon interactions , electron bremsstrahlung and inverse compton ( ic ) scattering . since the ism is transparent to these @xmath0-rays , we can probe crs in the local ism , beyond direct measurements performed in the solar system , as well as in remote locations of the galaxy . although much effort has been made since the cos - b era ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , the results have been limited by the angular resolution , effective area and energy coverage of the instruments . the advent of the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope enables studying the spectral and spatial distribution of diffuse @xmath0-rays and crs with unprecedented sensitivity .    here we report an analysis of diffuse @xmath0-ray emission observed in the third galactic quadrant . the window with galactic longitude @xmath5 and latitude @xmath6 hosts kinematically well - defined segments of the local and the perseus spiral arms and is one of the best regions to study the cr density distribution across the outer galaxy . the region has been already studied by @xcite using egret data . the improved sensitivity and angular resolution of the _ fermi _ lat ( large area telescope ; * ? ? ? * ) and recent developments in the study of the ism allow us to examine the cr spectra and density distribution with better accuracy . we exclude from the analysis the region of the monoceros r2 giant molecular cloud and the southern filament of the orion - monoceros complex ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , in @xmath7 and @xmath8 , because 1 ) star forming activity and possible high magnetic fields suggested by the filamentary structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) could indicate a special cr environment , and 2 ) an ob association in monoceros r2 may hamper the determination of ism densities from dust tracers ( see   2.1.2 for details ) . study of the @xmath9 conversion factor which transforms the integrated intensity of the 2.6  mm line of carbon monoxide , @xmath10 , into the molecular hydrogen column density , @xmath11 , is also possible since the region contains well - known molecular complexes . in the local arm we find the molecular clouds associated with canis major ob  1 , ngc  2348 and ngc  2632 @xcite . at a few kpc from the solar system , in the interarm , lower - density region located between the local and perseus arms , we find maddalena s cloud @xcite , a giant molecular cloud remarkable for its lack of star formation , and the cloud associated with canis major ob  2 @xcite . this study complements the _ fermi _ lat study of the cassiopeia and cepheus region in the second quadrant reported by @xcite . the paper is organized as follows . we describe the model preparation in   2 and the @xmath0-ray observations , data selection and the analysis procedure in   3 . the results are presented in   4 , where we also discuss the emissivity profile measured for the atomic gas and we compare it with predictions by a cr propagation model . a summary of the study is given in", "in order to derive the @xmath0-ray emissivities associated with the different components of the ism we need to determine the interstellar gas column densities separately for each region and gas phase . for atomic hydrogen we used the leiden / argentine / bonn galactic h  survey by @xcite . in order to turn the h  line intensities into @xmath12(h ) column densities , a uniform spin temperature @xmath13 has often been adopted in previous studies . we will consider this option to directly compare our results with the former egret analysis of the same region @xcite and other studies of the galactic diffuse emission by the lat @xcite . recent h  absorption studies @xcite , however , point to larger average spin temperatures in the outer galaxy , so we have tried different choices of @xmath14 to evaluate how the optical depth correction affects the results . we will find that the emissivity per h  atom and the inferred cr density is affected by up to @xmath15  50% in the perseus arm , and will take this uncertainty into account in the discussion . the integrated intensities of the 2.6  mm line of co , @xmath10 , have been derived from the composite survey by @xcite . the data have been filtered with the moment - masking technique in order to reduce the noise while keeping the resolution of the original data . figure  [ fig : diagram ] shows the velocity - longitude profile of h  emission in our region of interest ( roi ) . the preparation of maps accounting for the different galactic structures present along the line of sight is similar to that described in detail in @xcite and based on a sequence of three steps :    1 . preliminary separation within galactocentric rings ; 2 . adjustment of the boundaries based on the velocity structures of the interstellar complexes ; 3 . correction for the spill - over due to the velocity dispersion of the broad h  lines between adjacent regions . four regions were defined in galactocentric distance , namely the local arm ( galactocentric radius @xmath16 ) , the interarm region ( @xmath17 ) , the perseus arm ( @xmath18 ) and the region beyond the perseus arm ( which hosts a faint segment of the outer arm ; @xmath19 ) . the boundaries separating these regions under the assumption of a flat rotation curve @xcite for the case of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the galactocentric radius and the orbital velocity of the local group of stars , respectively ) are overlaid in figure  [ fig : diagram ] .    the preparation of the h  and co gas maps started from these preliminary velocity boundaries , which were then adjusted for each line of sight to the closest minimum in the h  spectrum . then , the spill - over from one velocity interval to the next ones due to the velocity dispersion for the broad h  lines was corrected by fitting each h  spectrum with a combination of gaussian profiles . we believe that this separation procedure provides more accurate estimates of the ism column densities of each galactic region than a simple slicing based on the rotation curve .    in particular , effort was put into separating the outer arm structures from the more massive perseus arm component , especially at @xmath24 where the h  lines from the two regions merge into a single broad component . for directions where a minimum in the h  brightness temperature profile was not found near the @xmath25 kpc velocity boundary , we integrated the profiles on both sides of the @xmath25 kpc velocity boundary to estimate the perseus and outer arm contributions . then we inserted a line in the gaussian fitting at the outer - arm velocity extrapolated from the @xmath26 trend observed at @xmath24 to correct for the spill - over due to the velocity dispersion . given these difficulties we expect large systematic uncertainties in the outer - arm @xmath12(h ) column densities and the corresponding @xmath0-ray emissivities will not be considered for the scientific interpretation . we note that the impact on the emissivities associated with the inner regions is small , @xmath27% as described in  [ sec : crgradient ] . the resulting maps are shown in figure  [ fig : hi ] and [ fig : co ] . they exhibit a low level of spatial degeneracy , and thus allow us to separate the @xmath0-radiation arising from the interaction with crs in each component . it has been long debated whether the combination of h  and co surveys traces total column densities of neutral interstellar matter . by comparing gas line surveys , the @xmath0-ray observations by egret and dust thermal emission , @xcite reported a considerable amount of neutral gas at the interface between the two h  and co emitting phases , associated with cold dust but not properly traced by h  and co observations . their finding was then confirmed by lat data for the gould belt in the second quadrant @xcite . in order to complement the h  and co maps , we have prepared a map derived from the @xmath28 reddening map by @xcite . the residual point sources at low latitudes were masked by setting to zero regions of @xmath29 radius centered on the positions of potential iras point sources if the @xmath28 magnitude exceeded by @xmath30% that in surrounding pixels . the masked regions were then restored through an inpainting technique @xcite . in the course of the work , various source masking techniques have been used with negligible impact on the h  and co emissivity results . the resulting map was fitted with a linear combination of the set of @xmath12(h ) and @xmath10 maps described in  the operation was repeated for different choices of h  spin temperature . the fit was performed over the same region as for the @xmath0-ray analysis , excluding a @xmath31 region centered around canis major ob  1 @xcite where the temperature correction applied by @xcite to construct the @xmath28 map from the dust thermal emission is highly uncertain . a preliminary fit had led to extremely negative residuals ( @xmath32 mag ) around @xmath33 , @xmath34 . therefore , the residual @xmath28 map was calculated masking this region in the fit . we are aware that the temperature corrections used by @xcite are less reliable with decreasing latitude , but the improvement we find in the @xmath0-ray fit by adding the dust residual map supports the use of their map at low latitude . the residual @xmath35 map , after subtracting the linear combination of @xmath12(h ) and @xmath10 maps , is shown in figure  [ fig : ebv ] ( left panel ) . the residuals typically range from @xmath36 to @xmath37 magnitude . large regions of positive residuals are found along the galactic plane , in association with molecular / atomic clouds . they are expected to trace gas not correctly traced by h  and co surveys . a remarkable region of positive residuals is detected at intermediate latitudes around @xmath38 , @xmath39 , in a region not covered by co surveys . it corresponds to positive residuals also in @xmath0-rays (   [ sec : procedure ] ) and may be due to a missing , but possibly co - bright molecular cloud ( already suggested by @xcite discussing the completeness of their survey , see figure  8 of their paper ) . the negative residuals are generally small and may result from limitations in the gas column density derivation and/or dust spectral variations . the dust residual map compares well with the @xmath0-ray residual map obtained when using only h  and co to model the @xmath0-ray emission ( figure  [ fig : ebv ] , right panel ) . the correlation between the spatial distributions of the dust and @xmath0-ray residuals is statistically confirmed in  [ sec : procedure ] . dust and @xmath0-rays are consistent with the presence of missing gas in the positive residual clumps . the faint `` glow '' of negative residuals on both sides of the galactic plane is driven by the nearby @xmath12(h ) maps and it remains even when using the smallest possible column - densities derived in the optically thin case . it may suggest a small change in average spin temperature from the massive , compact clouds sampled in the plane to the more diffuse envelopes sampled off the plane , or it may be due to the presence of more missing gas in the plane than our templates can provide for in the fit . the dust - to - gas ratio as well as the @xmath0-ray emissivity in the h  components would then be driven to higher values by the low latitude data and would slightly overpredict the data off the plane . the interpretation of the @xmath35 map in this region of the sky is complicated by the lack of distance information for the dust emission . it is not possible to unambiguously assign the residuals to any of the regions under study . since we aim at separating different regions along the lines of sight to investigate the cr density gradient in the outer galaxy , using the h  and co lines is essential . we have therefore used the @xmath35 map to correct for the total gas column densities . this approach is supported by the correlation we find between the dust and @xmath0-ray data (   [ sec : procedure ] ) . we also note that , since the dust contribution linearly correlated with the h  and co maps has been removed in the @xmath35 map , this procedure allows us to extract the @xmath0-ray emissivities that are actually correlated with the h  and co components . to model @xmath0-ray emission not related with interstellar gas , we referred to the galprop code ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) for @xmath0-rays produced through ic scattering and to the first _ fermi _ lat catalog ( 1fgl ) for point sources @xcite . galprop @xcite is a numerical code which solves the cr transport equation within the galaxy and predicts the @xmath0-ray emission produced via interactions of crs with interstellar matter ( nucleon - nucleon interaction and electron bremsstrahlung ) and low - energy photons ( ic scattering ) . ic emission is calculated from the distribution of ( propagated ) electrons and the interstellar radiation fields developed by @xcite . here we adopt the ic model map produced in the galprop run 54_77xvarh7s in which the cr electron spectrum is adjusted to agree with that measured by the lat @xcite . this galprop model has been used in publications by the lat collaboration such as @xcite . the 1fgl catalog is based on the first 11 months of the science phase of the mission and contains 1451 sources detected at a significance @xmath40 ( the threshold is 25 in term of test statistic , ts ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the maximum likelihood with and without including the source in the model , respectively . @xmath41 is conventionally calculated as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the data and the model - predicted counts in each pixel denoted by the subscript @xmath46 , respectively ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? ts is expected to be distributed as a @xmath47 with @xmath48 degrees of freedom if the numbers of free parameters in the model are respectively @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( 4 for sources in the 1fgl catalog ) . ] ) . for our analysis we considered 21 point sources in the roi with ts larger than 50 .      following a well - established approach that dates back to the cos - b era ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , we modeled the @xmath0-ray emission as a linear combination of maps tracing the column density of the interstellar medium . this approach is based on a simple , but very plausible assumption : @xmath0-rays are generated through interactions of crs and the interstellar gas , and the ism itself is transparent to @xmath0-rays . then , assuming that cr densities do not significantly vary over the scale of the interstellar complexes under study and that crs penetrate clouds uniformly to their cores we can model the @xmath0-ray intensities to first order as a linear combination of contributions from cr interactions with the different gas phases in the various regions along each line of sight . we also added the ic model map by galprop and models for point sources taken from the 1fgl catalog as described in   2.2 . to represent the extragalactic diffuse emission and the residual instrumental background from misclassified cr interactions in the lat detector , we also added an isotropic component . cr interactions with ionized gas are not explicitly included in the model . the mass column densities of ionized gas are poorly known , but their contribution is generally lower ( @xmath51 ) than that of the neutral gas and its scale height is much larger ( @xmath52  kpc compared with @xmath53 kpc ; @xcite ) . we therefore expect the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission originating from ionized gas to be largely accommodated in the fit by other components with large angular scales , such as the isotropic and ic ones , and to minimally impact the determination of the neutral gas emissivities . therefore , the @xmath0-ray intensities @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) can be modeled as :    @xmath56 where sum over @xmath46 represents the combination of the galactic regions , @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) are the emissivities per h  atom and per @xmath10 unit , respectively . @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) is the emissivity per unit of the @xmath35 map ( for which independent normalizations are allowed between the positive and negative residuals ; see   [ sec : procedure ] ) . @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the ic model and isotropic background intensities ( @xmath65 ) , respectively , and @xmath66 represents the point source contributions . compared to the egret study by @xcite , we use two additional maps to better trace the ism : the co map in the perseus arm and the @xmath35 map .", "the lat on board the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope , launched on 2008 june 11 , is a pair - tracking telescope , detecting photons from @xmath67  mev to more than 300  gev . details on the lat instrument and pre - launch expectations of the performance can be found in @xcite , and the on - orbit calibration is described in @xcite . routine science operations with the lat started on 2008 august 4 . we have accumulated events from 2008 august 4 to 2010 february 4 to study diffuse @xmath0-rays in our roi . during this time interval the lat was operated in sky survey mode nearly all of the time , obtaining complete sky coverage every two orbits and relatively uniform exposures over time . we used the standard lat analysis software , the _ science tools _ and selected events satisfying the standard low - background event selection ( the so - called _ diffuse _ class ; * ? ? ? * ) . we also required the reconstructed zenith angles of the arrival direction of photons to be less than @xmath68 and the center of the lat field of view to be within @xmath69 from the zenith , in order to reduce the contamination of photons from the earth limb . in addition , we excluded the period of time during which the lat detected bright grbs , i.e. , grb080916c @xcite , grb090510 @xcite , grb090902b @xcite , and grb090926a @xcite . the model described by equation  ( 1 ) was fitted to the data using the _ science tools _ , which take into account the energy - dependent instrument point spread function and effective area . we have analyzed the lat data from 100  mev to 25.6  gev using 13 logarithmically - spaced energy bands from 100  mev to 9.05  gev , and a single band above 9.05  gev . we then have compared the model and data in each energy band using a binned maximum - likelihood method with poisson statistics ( in @xmath70 bins ) ; we thus did not assume an a - priori spectral shape of each model component except for the ic emission . for the other components the convolution with the instrument response functions was performed assuming an @xmath71 spectrum , and the integrated intensities were allowed to vary in each narrow energy bin . changing the fixed spectral shape index over the range from @xmath72 to @xmath73 has a negligible effect on the obtained spectrum . in the highest energy band , we have set both the normalization and the spectral index free to accommodate the wider bin width . we used a post - launch response function , p6_v3_diffuse , developed to account for the @xmath0-ray detection inefficiencies due to pile - up and accidental coincidence in the lat @xcite . we stopped at 25.6  gev since the photon statistics does not allow us to reliably separate different gas components above this energy . we started with point sources detected with high significance ( @xmath74 ) in the 1fgl catalog ; we have 14 sources in our roi for which the normalizations are set free . we also included 8 sources lying just outside ( @xmath75 ) of the region boundaries , with all the spectral parameters fixed to those in the 1fgl catalog . as a starting point we used h  maps prepared for @xmath13 . we added model components step by step as described below . we first fitted the lat data using equation  ( 1 ) without the @xmath35 map and the co map in the perseus arm , and then included the co map and confirmed that the fit improved significantly ; the test statistic summed over 14 bands with separate fits in each band ( i.e. , 14 more free parameters ) is 187.6 . the @xmath0-ray emission associated to the gas traced by co in the perseus arm is thus significantly detected by the lat . next we included the @xmath35 map in the analysis . we allowed the independent normalizations between the positive part and the negative part of the @xmath35 map , and found that the normalizations differ with each other . we thus will use the independent normalizations hereafter . we chose this model to better represent the lat data and constrain the cr distributions , and leave a detailed discussion about the use of dust as ism tracer to a dedicated paper . the improvement of the fit is very significant : @xmath76 for 28 more free parameters . the correlation between the @xmath35 map and the @xmath0-ray residual map obtained by the fit without the @xmath35 map , shown in figure  [ fig : ebv ] , further supports the use of @xmath35 map in our analysis . we also tried a fit without the ic component to assess the systematics . the effects on the derived emissivities are typically 23% and @xmath15 5% for @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively . they are much smaller than the statistical errors and systematic uncertainties ( see below ) , although the inclusion of the ic map improves the fit to the lat data . therefore the uncertainties on the ic model have no significant impact on our analysis due to its rather flat distribution across the region of interest while the gas in the ism is highly structured . on the other hand , lowering the threshold for point sources down to @xmath79 yields an about twice smaller emissivity for the @xmath10 map in the perseus arm . the emissivities of other components are unchanged within the statistical errors . this is plausibly due to the very clumpy distribution of the clouds in the perseus arm as seen by a terrestrial observer , see figure  [ fig : co ] , which makes it difficult to separate from that of some discrete sources . we thus use equation  ( 1 ) with point sources detected at @xmath80 in the 1fgl catalog as our baseline model , but we do not consider the highly uncertain co emissivities in the perseus arm for the discussion .    we summarize the results in tables  [ tab:125k ] and [ tab:250k ] for @xmath13 and 250  k , respectively , and the number of counts in each energy bin in table  [ tab : counts ] . the differential emissivities are multiplied by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the center of each energy bin in logarithmic scale . they are given for each model component . we note that our isotropic term ( @xmath64 ) includes the contribution of the instrumental background and might partially account also for ionized gas ( see   [ anamodel ] ) , thus it is significantly larger than the extragalactic diffuse emission reported by @xcite .    to illustrate the fit quality , we give the data and model count maps and the residual map in figure  [ fig : gammamap ] ( for @xmath13 ) , in which residuals ( data minus model ) are expressed in approximate standard deviation units ( square root of model - predicted counts ) . although some structures ( clustering of positive or negative residuals ) are observed , the map shows no excesses below @xmath83 and above @xmath84 . over 99% of the pixels are within @xmath85 . we thus conclude that our model reasonably reproduces the data . figure  [ fig : summaryspectra ] presents the fitted spectra for each component . the emission from the h  gas dominates the @xmath0-ray flux . although the emission from the gas in the co - bright phase and that traced by @xmath35 is fainter than the ic and isotropic components , their characteristic spatial structures ( see figure  [ fig : hi ] and [ fig : co ] ) allow their spectra to be reliably constrained .    to examine the effect of the optical depth correction applied to derive the h  maps , as anticipated above we tried several choices of a uniform @xmath14 . we stress that the true @xmath14 is likely to vary within clouds , but we stick to this simple approximation exploring the following values : 100  k ( which is a reasonable lower limit in the uniform approximation ) , 250  k and 400  k ( which are the two values indicated by absorption measurements in the outer galaxy by @xcite ) , and the optically - thin approximation ( which yields the lower limit allowed on the atomic column densities ) . the results on the maximum log - likelihood values are summarized in table  [ tab : lnl ] together with the integrated h  emissivities obtained above 100  mev in each region . the evolution of @xmath86 with @xmath14 is plotted in figure  [ fig : logl ] . the h  emissivity varies by @xmath87% for the local arm , @xmath88% for the interarm region , and @xmath89% for the perseus arm with respect to the @xmath13 case . we observe an increase of @xmath86 with increasing spin temperature . considering the fact that @xmath90 is a typical value in the second quadrant of the outer galaxy according to a recent study by @xcite and because @xmath86 saturates at @xmath91 , we regard 250  k as a plausible estimate of the average @xmath14 in our roi . unfortunately , the estimates by @xcite have a rather large uncertainty ( about  @xmath92  k ) in each galactocentric radius bin , and they do not cover the region in the third quadrant we are investigating ( see figure  5 of * ? ? ? * ) . in the following sections , we will concentrate on @xmath13 for comparison with previous @xmath0-ray measurements and on @xmath90 which agrees well with h  absorption and the lat data .", "in figures  [ fig : spectra_125k ] and [ fig : spectra_250k ] ( left panels ) , we report the emissivity spectra found per h atom in the local arm , interarm , perseus arm and outermost regions for @xmath93 and 250  k , respectively . for comparison with the local interstellar spectrum ( lis ) we also plot the model spectrum used in @xcite which agrees well with lat data in a mid - to - high - latitude region ( @xmath94 ) of the third quadrant ( assuming @xmath13 ) . we see that the spectral shape of the local - arm emissivity agrees well with the model for the lis and does not depend on the choice of spin temperature . the integral emissivity of the local arm is 10% lower than that reported by @xcite for the same spin temperature . this difference is not significant given the uncertainties in the kinematic separation of the gas components . the present result is also consistent with the measurement in the second quadrant @xcite . together they show that the cr density along the local arm is rather uniform within 1  kpc around the sun , both in the second and third quadrants . the comparison of the data with the model emissivity expected for the local arm region based on locally - measured crs ( figures  [ fig : spectra_125k ] and [ fig : spectra_250k ] ) indicates a better fit for higher @xmath14 ; @xmath13 gives emissivities 1520% lower than the model , whereas @xmath90 shows better agreement by about 10% . although the theoretical emissivity has uncertainties due to imperfect knowledge of the cr spectrum ( see * ? ? ? * ) , the fact that a high @xmath14 value yields a better match both to the local absolute emissivity and to the spatial distribution of the diffuse emission ( figure  [ fig : logl ] ) leads to larger @xmath14 than a value conventionally used in @xmath0-ray astrophysics ( 125  k ) . this is in accord with independent estimates of @xmath14 as discussed in  [ sec : procedure ] . we also observe that the emissivity spectra do not vary significantly with galactocentric distances in the outer galaxy . to examine the spectral shape more quantitatively , we present the emissivity ratios of the interarm and perseus regions relative to the local arm in the right panels of figures  [ fig : spectra_125k ] and [ fig : spectra_250k ] . the spectral shape in the interarm region is found to be consistent with that in the local arm ; a fit to the data for @xmath13 with a constant ratio gives @xmath95 for 13 degrees of freedom . although the fit is not fully acceptable for the perseus arm ( @xmath96 ) , the large @xmath47 is driven solely by the last bin . we note a possible interplay between the perseus - arm and the adjacent outer - arm emissivities in the highest energy bins ( see left panels of figure  [ fig : spectra_125k ] and [ fig : spectra_250k ] ) . it can be due to a small but non - negligible spatial difference between the modeled templates and data and/or to the presence of unresolved point sources ( generally harder than diffuse emission ) . photon fluctuations from the structured gas components can also lead the fit to a slightly different solution in the spatial separation of the components . one would expect these possible systematic uncertainties to become important at high energy given the limited counts in the overall map . it is difficult to quantitatively test these effects without knowledge of the true model distributions , but we can note that the small deviations seen at 400560  mev and 1.62.2  gev from a constant ratio are not confirmed by the general trend of the other points . they indicate that there are systematic uncertainties not fully accounted for by the statistical errors in the fit . we thus do not claim nor deny the spectral softening of the perseus arm at high energy . a test using @xmath90 for the @xmath12(h ) maps gives the same conclusion on the spectral shape . we thus conclude that the spectral shapes are consistent with the lis in the @xmath97  gev energy band , independent of the assumed @xmath14 . considering that these @xmath0-rays trace cr nuclei of energies from a few gev to about 100  gev ( see , e.g. , figure  [ fig : emissivitygradient ] of * ? ? ? * ) , lat data indicate that the energy distribution of the main component of galactic crs does not vary significantly in the outer galaxy in the third quadrant . we note that @xcite reported a possible spectral hardening in the perseus arm in the second quadrant . this might be due to the presence of the very active star - forming region of ngc  7538 and of crs having not diffused far from their sources , or to contamination by hard unresolved point sources . in fact @xcite did not rule out the possibility that their result is due to systematic effects . high - energy @xmath0-rays are a powerful probe to determine the co - to - h@xmath98 calibration ratio , @xmath9 , if the cr flux is comparable in the different gas phases inside a cloud . since the @xmath0-ray emission from the molecular gas is primarily due to cr interactions with @xmath99 , and since the molecular binding energy is negligible in processes leading to @xmath0-ray production , the emissivity per @xmath99 molecule is expected to be twice the emissivity per h  atom . then , under the hypothesis that the same cr flux penetrates the h-  and co - bright phases of an interstellar complex , we can calculate @xmath9 as @xmath100 . we show @xmath78 as a function of @xmath77 for the local arm and the interarm region in figure  [ fig : xco ] . we do not consider the correlation in the perseus arm , because @xmath78 from this region is affected by large systematic uncertainties ( see   3.2 ) . since the emissivity associated with the co - bright gas is not well determined in the lowest energy range ( see table  [ tab:125k ] and [ tab:250k ] ) because of the poor angular resolution of the lat , and the fit at very high energy is affected by larger uncertainties (   4.1 ) , we have plotted only data in the 200  mev9.05  gev range . the linear correlation supports the assumption that galactic crs penetrate molecular clouds uniformly to their cores . it also suggests that contamination from point sources and cr spectral variations within the clouds are small . we have derived the maximum - likelihood estimates of the slope and intercept of the linear relation between @xmath78 and @xmath77 taking into account that @xmath78 and @xmath77 are both measured ( not true ) values with known uncertainties . the resulting intercepts are compatible with zero . the @xmath9 values we have obtained for @xmath90 are @xmath4 for the local arm ( @xmath101 ) and @xmath102 for the interarm region ( @xmath17 ) . decreasing the spin temperature to 125 k does not affect the @xmath9 derivation in the well resolved , not too massive , clouds of the local arm where we find @xmath103 . on the other hand , the separation in the @xmath0-ray fit between the dense h  peaks and clumpy co cores becomes more difficult for more distant , less resolved clouds where h  and co tend to peak in the same directions . a change in the largest @xmath12(h ) column - densities from the optical depth correction can impact the @xmath9 determination in two ways : first by changing the @xmath77 emissivity , second by modifying the @xmath12(h ) contrast within the cloud , hence the h  and co separation . the global impact is mild since we find @xmath104 in the interarm region for @xmath13 . @xcite reported comparable values of @xmath9 in the second quadrant for @xmath13 : they obtained @xmath105 and @xmath106 for the local arm ( @xmath107 ) and the perseus arm . given the systematic uncertainty in @xmath9 , roughly of the order of @xmath108 , due to h  optical depth correction , the results of both studies point to a rather uniform ratio over several kpc in the outer galaxy . yet , these values are twice larger than found in the very nearby gould - belt clouds of cassiopeia and cepheus , @xmath109 , @xmath13 . however , we confirm that the increase in @xmath9 beyond the solar circle is significantly lower than the trend adopted in the model of @xcite . what fraction of the gould - belt to local - arm difference in the average @xmath9 can be attributed to a difference in the spatial sampling ( resolution ) of the clouds remains to be investigated . nearly the same region has been analyzed by @xcite using egret data . the main difference from their analysis is our improved scheme for the kinematical separation of the ism components along the lines of sight and the inclusion of the reddening residual map . the @xmath9 value measured in the local arm by egret , @xmath110 ( for @xmath13 ) , is statistically compatible with ours . the fact that we excluded the region of monoceros r2 from the analysis can also explain in part this difference .    because of the pile - up of different clouds along a line of sight , the derivation of individual cloud masses is beyond the scope of this study . let us just note that maddalena s cloud , with its very low rate of star formation , seems to share a quite conventional @xmath9 factor . further investigation , including higher resolution @xmath0-ray maps when more high - energy lat data become available , is required to fully understand the mass distribution in the clouds .      in figure [ fig : emissivitygradient ] ( left panel ) we show the emissivity gradient found beyond the solar circle for different spin temperatures . here we do not include the results for the optically - thin approximation which is equivalent to an infinitely high @xmath14 and gives similar emissivities to @xmath111 . the typical statistical errors associated with these measurements are illustrated in the right panel for the @xmath13 case . in the right panel , a shaded area shows the characteristic systematic error due to the lat event selection efficiency , evaluated to be @xmath112 in the energy range under study .    in order to evaluate the impact of the delicate separation of the gas in the outermost region , we have compared two extreme cases . the first one adopts the kinematic @xmath25 kpc boundary and applies no correction for velocity dispersion , the second assigns all the outer - arm gas to the perseus arm . the emissivity in the perseus arm differs by about 5% from the original one , and those in the local arm and interarm regions hardly change . therefore these effects are significantly smaller than the uncertainties due to the optical depth correction of the h  data . we also note that the main effect of the lat selection efficiency uncertainty is to rigidly shift the profile without any significant impact on the gradient . we thus conclude that the most important source of uncertainty in the cr density gradient derivation is currently that in the @xmath12(h ) determination . this is mainly because the optical depth correction is larger for dense h  clouds in the local and perseus arms than for diffuse clouds in the interarm region . the loss in contrast between the dense ( low - latitude ) and more diffuse ( mid - latitude ) h  structures resulting from an increase in spin temperature affects the fit , particularly in the perseus component which is more narrowly concentrated near the plane . when probing the cr densities as the `` ratio '' between the observed numbers of @xmath0-rays to h atoms , at the precision provided by the lat the uncertainties in the ism densities are dominant . an interesting finding of the former egret analysis @xcite was an enhancement of the @xmath0-ray emissivity in the perseus arm compared with the interarm region . this possibility is relevant for models of diffuse @xmath0-ray emissions based on the assumption that cr and ism densities are coupled ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . the local arm emissivity obtained by the egret study for @xmath13 is @xmath113 , which is @xmath114 larger than our lat result . however , the two studies are based on different h  surveys which yield different total @xmath12(h ) column densities integrated along the lines of sight . the column - density ratios between the surveys varies from 0.6 to 1.0 within the roi , with an average value of @xmath115 . the difference is likely due to the improved correction for stray - radiation in the more recent survey , as discussed in @xcite . the egret local - arm emissivity scaled by 0.8 is in good agreement with our result for the same spin temperature . if we do not include the @xmath35 map in the fitting , we obtain an emissivity of @xmath116 which is still consistent with the down - scaled egret result within @xmath1515% . we thus conclude that our result is consistent with the previous study but is more reliable because of higher @xmath0-ray statistics , finer resolution and an improved h  gas survey . we can therefore compare the present emissivity gradient ( for consistency in the case @xmath13 ) with that reported by the egret study , as summarized in figure  [ fig : emissivitygradient ] ( right panel in which the egret results multiplied by 0.8 are also shown ) . although we observe good agreement between the two studies in the local and the perseus arms , this is not true for the arm / interarm contrast . the difference could be due to the simple partitioning in cloud velocity used for the egret study . the h  mass obtained for clouds in the interarm region with the simple partitioning is @xmath117 larger ( for @xmath13 ) than with our separation scheme , exaggerating the amount of gas in the interarm region , and thus lowering the emissivity by the same amount . our emissivity profile is thus consistent with the previous study , but with improved precision ( smaller statistical errors ) and accuracy ( more reliable region separation method and better estimation of the point source contributions ) . we thus do not confirm a marked drop in the interarm region . low spin temperatures yield a smooth decline in h  emissivity to @xmath118 in the outer galaxy , without showing a significant coupling with ism column densities . the perseus - to - interarm contrast is at most of the order of 15%20% for high spin temperatures as shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : emissivitygradient ] . these profiles are similar at all energies , in particular at high energies where the component separation is more reliable thanks to the better angular resolution . the surface density of h  in the perseus arm is on average 30%40% higher than in the interarm region . therefore , even if we adopt @xmath111 which gives the largest arm - interarm contrast , the coupling scale ( or the coupling length ) between the crs and matter ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) required to agree with the lat data would be larger than those usually assumed for this type of model ( @xmath119 . see e.g. , * ? ? ? * figure  7 ) . whether the true emissivity profile exhibits a small contrast between the arms or smoothly declines with distance is beyond our measurement capability without further constraints on the hcolumn - density derivation . new h  absorption measurements will allow us to investigate this issue with better accuracy .      to compare with the second quadrant results @xcite , we have integrated the emissivities above 200  mev for @xmath13 . we find values of @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 for the local - arm , interarm , and perseus - arm regions , respectively . the nearer value is about 20% lower than in the 2nd quadrant ( which , however , samples very nearby clouds in the gould belt ) and the outer ones compare very well with the 2nd quadrant measurement over the same galactocentric distance range . despite the uncertainties due to the optical - depth correction ( that might have a different impact in the two quadrants ) , both lat studies consistently point to a slowly decreasing emissivity profile beyond @xmath123 . let us consider the predictions by a cr propagation model to see the impact of such a flat profile on the cr source distribution and propagation parameters . we adopted a galprop model , starting from the configuration used for the run 54_77xvarh7s which we used to predict the ic contribution . the cr source distribution in this model is ,    @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the distance of the sun to the galactic center . as shown in figure  [ fig : crsourcemodel ] , this function is intermediate between the distribution of supernova remnants ( snrs ) obtained from the @xmath126 relation @xcite and that traced by pulsars @xcite . the boundaries of the propagation region are chosen to be @xmath127 ( maximum galactocentric radius ) and @xmath128 ( maximum height from the galactic plane ) , beyond which free escape is assumed . the spatial diffusion coefficient is assumed to be uniform across the galaxy and is taken as @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the velocity of the particle relative to the speed of light and @xmath131 is the rigidity . we adopted @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( kolmogorov spectrum ) . reacceleration due to the interstellar magnetohydrodynamic turbulence , which is thought to reproduce the observed b / c ratio at low energy , assumes an alfvn velocity @xmath134 . the cr source distribution and propagation model parameters have been used often in the literature ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? we note that the same cr source distribution and similar propagation parameters are adopted in the galprop run used by @xcite . the left panel of figure  [ fig : gradientmodeldata ] compares the calculated profile ( solid line ) with lat constraints ( bow - tie plot bracketing the profiles obtained for different @xmath14 ; see the left panel of figure  [ fig : emissivitygradient ] ) . the model is normalized to the lat measurement in the innermost region . despite the large uncertainties , lat data lead to a significantly flatter profile than predicted by our model ; the lat results indicate to a factor of 2 larger emissivity ( cr energy density ) in the perseus arm even if we assume @xmath135 . the higher @xmath14 makes the discrepancy larger , hence the conclusion is robust . not using the @xmath35 map in the analysis does not change the conclusion , since the emissivities in the interarm region and the perseus arm are almost unaffected by its presence . the discrepancy between the @xmath0-ray emissivity gradient in the galaxy and the distribution of putative cr sources has been known as the `` gradient problem '' since the cos - b era ( e.g. , * ? ? ? it has led to a number of possible interpretations , including , for the specific case of the outer galaxy , the possibility of a very steep gradient in @xmath9 beyond the solar circle @xcite . the emissivities in the outer galaxy were more difficult to determine in the cos - b / egret era due to lower statistics and higher backgrounds . now , thanks to the high quality of the lat data and the improved component separation technique applied to gas line data , we measure a flat h  emissivity gradient in the outer galaxy together with a flat evolution of @xmath9 over several kpc , so the gradient problem requires another explanation . the most straightforward possibility is a larger halo size ( @xmath136 ) , as discussed by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . we therefore tried several choices of @xmath136 and @xmath137 as summarized in the dotted lines in the same figure . the values of @xmath137 are chosen to reasonably reproduce the lis of protons and electrons , b / c ratio and @xmath138 ratio at the solar system , and are similar to those given in @xcite . all models are normalized to the lat data in the local arm . models with @xmath139 or smaller are found to give too steep emissivity gradients . a cr source distribution as in equation  2 with a very large halo ( @xmath140 ) provides a gradient compatible with the @xmath0-ray data , if we fully take into account the systematic uncertainties . we note that @xmath141 is still compatible with @xmath138 measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ? considering the large statistical and systematic uncertainties in the snr distribution , a flatter cr source distribution in the outer galaxy also could be possible . we thus tried a modified cr source distribution , in which the distribution is the same as equation  2 below @xmath142 and constant beyond it ( see a thin solid line of figure  [ fig : crsourcemodel ] as an example ) . figure  [ fig : gradientmodeldata ] right shows the models with several choices of @xmath142 for @xmath128 and @xmath132 . we obtained a reasonable fit to the data using a flat cr source distribution beyond @xmath143 . such a constant cr source density in the outer galaxy is in contrast not only with the ( highly uncertain ) distribution of snrs , but also with other tracers of massive star formation and snrs , like , 1 ) co lines which trace the interstellar phase where massive stars form ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , 2 ) ob star counts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and 3 ) the @xmath144al line which is related to the injection of stellar nucleosynthesis products in the ism by snrs @xcite . however , a very large halo size and/or a flat cr source distribution just beyond the solar circle seem to be favored by the lat data . the above discussion depends on the propagation parameters and the solution is not unique . the exploration could be extended to other regions of the parameter space or to a non - uniform diffusion coefficient ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , but examining propagation models in detail is beyond the scope of our study . our bottom line is that the analysis of lat data presented here and by @xcite consistently show that the cr density gradient in the outer galaxy is flatter than expectations by commonly - used propagation models . in the future , the extension to the inner part and the accurate determination of the gradient over the whole galaxy will be key to constraining the cr origin and transport . we also note that a spin temperature @xmath91 , which is favored by recent studies in the outer galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , gives a small arm / interarm contrast at the 1020% level that is not fully compatible with the propagation models ( including the one we adopted here ) which predict a monotonic cr gradient .    even though the present analysis includes a dust template to account for the abundant missing gas present locally at the interface between the h  and co - bright phases , an alternative way to reconcile the flat emissivity profile and a marked decline in cr density in the outer galaxy is to invoke an increase in missing gas mass with galactocentric distance in the low metallicity environments of the outer galaxy ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) beyond the local correction applied here . we note that the large masses of dark gas in the outer galaxy suggested by @xcite ( outweighing that of h  by a factor of 5 - 15 ) might explain our results , whereas the remarkably constant dark gas fraction of  30% with mild dependence on metallicity suggested by @xcite is not sufficient to explain the large h  emissivities measured by the lat beyond the solar circle .", "we have studied the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission in the third galactic quadrant using the first 18 months of _ fermi _ lat science data . thanks to the excellent performance of the lat , we have obtained high - quality emissivity spectra of the atomic and molecular gas ( traced by @xmath10 ) in the 100  mev  25.6  gev energy range .    at the level of accuracy allowed by the lat , the study of cr densities from @xmath0-ray observations is now mostly limited by the understanding of the ism mass tracers , notably by the uncertainties in the derivation of atomic gas column densities from h  surveys and by the distribution of gas not accounted for by radio and microwave line surveys . in spite of those uncertainties , robust conclusions can be drawn concerning the ism and crs . the molecular mass calibration ratio of the local arm is found to be @xmath145 , significantly larger than that for the very local gould - belt clouds in the second galactic quadrant reported by @xcite . no significant differences of the ratio are found between the local arm and the interarm region . no significant variations in the cr spectra are found across the outer galaxy in the region studied , and no large contrast in emissivity is seen in the interarm region between the local and perseus arms ( a contrast @xmath146 1020% is allowed by data ) . the measured gradient is much flatter than predictions by a widely - used propagation model assuming that the cr source distribution largely peaks in the inner galaxy . a larger halo size and/or a flatter cr source distribution beyond the solar circle than those usually assumed are required to reproduce the lat data , while other scenarios such as a non - uniform diffusion coefficient or vast amounts of missing gas in the outer galaxy are also possible . reliable determinations of the amount of atomic hydrogen in the plane are key to better constraining the property of crs in our galaxy . the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis . these include the national aeronautics and space administration and the department of energy in the united states , the commissariat  lenergie atomique and the centre national de la recherche scientifique / institut national de physique nuclaire et de physique des particules in france , the agenzia spaziale italiana and the istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare in italy , the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) , high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) and japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) in japan , and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the swedish national space board in sweden . this paper makes use of a development version of galprop provided by the galprop team to the lat collaboration solely for interpretation of the lat data . galprop development is supported by nasa grant nnx09ac15 g .

known theoretical approaches based on qcd , for example , heavy quark effective theory  @xcite , qcd factorization  @xcite , the perturbative qcd approach  @xcite and the soft - collinear effective theory  @xcite , which lead to very satisfactory predictions for @xmath7 decays , can not be used to explain data in the case of charmed mesons . furthermore , the charm quark is also not light enough for a chiral expansion to be applicable .    in the absence of any other reliable and effective theoretical methods , the factorization approach is still one of the most successful ways to study two - body charm meson decays  @xcite . however , it is well known now that in the naive factorization approach , calculation of wilson coefficients of effective operators faces the problem of @xmath12- and renormalization scheme dependence . these difficulties can be overcome in the frame - work of the @xmath13generalized factorization approach where wilson coefficients are effective and include important non - factorizable ( nf ) corrections  @xcite .    in the past there was another attempt to explain hadronic d decays using the so called large @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is number of colour degrees of freedom ) approach  @xcite . it was observed that dropping fierz transformed terms characterized by @xmath14 can narrow the gap between predictions and observations up to a satisfactory level . the calculations based on qcd sum rules showed that fierz terms were certainly compensated by the nf corrections  @xcite . there exists another model independent so called @xmath13quark diagram or @xmath13topological diagram approach in the literature  @xcite where all two - body non - leptonic weak decays of heavy mesons are expressed in terms of distinct quark diagrams , depending on the topologies of weak interactions , including all strong interaction effects . it is based on @xmath16 symmetry , and allows extraction of the quark diagram amplitudes by fitting against experimental data . however su(3 ) breaking effects in charmed meson decays have been shown to be important and need to be carefully incorporated  @xcite . the importance of final state interactions ( fsi ) in nonleptonic charm decays had been realized and discussed in several papers  @xcite in the early 80 s , where the authors had been intrigued by the anomalies in the observed branching ratios of the cabibbo favoured ( cf ) , neutral versus the charged @xmath17 modes , the differing rates of the singly cabibbo suppressed ( scs ) @xmath9 and @xmath10 modes , followed by measurements of rates of few other modes that had unexpected suppression / enhancement . many of these were conjectured to be due to fsi . surprisingly , even in the last couple of years , in many of the papers that worried about the charm cp asymmetry problem , these old puzzles were still considered unresolved .    even for the case of hadronic b meson decays , the role of fsi s is being examined rather carefully in the last few years  @xcite . the mass of the charmed meson lies right in the heart of the resonance region . hence , resonant final state rescattering is bound to play a bigger role in the two body hadronic charm decays and needs to be evaluated . of course dynamical calculations of these long distance effects are not possible and hence they can only be determined phenomenologically after comparison of the theoretical estimates with experimental data . unitarity constraints play an important role in providing the theoretical estimates . another contribution in hadronic two body decays that has been debated for a long period is that of the weak annihilation and exchange diagrams . one of rosen s proposal  @xcite had been that the w exchange diagrams may be large and since this appears only in @xmath18 and not in @xmath19 decays , it could account for the difference in the lifetimes of these two mesons . bigi and fukugita  @xcite had then proposed several @xmath20 and @xmath7 meson decay modes that could be the smoking gun signals of the w - exchange contributions and yet , when the mode @xmath21 was observed , it was argued  @xcite that it could have been generated from the decay mode @xmath22 , with this final state rescattering to the @xmath23 mode . annihilation type contributions along with fsi s were incorporated in the hadronic two body vector - pseudoscalar modes of charmed meson decays in ref . studies using the quark diagram approach of ref . @xcite had also indicated that annihilation type contributions are needed to explain the observed data .    in this paper , we study the role of fsi in the two body @xmath20 ( @xmath20 here can be any of the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , or @xmath24 ) meson decays . we assume that fsi effects are dominated by resonance states close to the mass of @xmath20 mesons . in fact , there exist isospin @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 resonances near the @xmath20 mass , that may contribute to rescatterings among different channels in these respective isospin states and enhance / suppress some of the decay rates . in the next section , we give the formalism for the calculation of the un - unitarized amplitudes , using a modified factorization approach , where the effective wilson coefficients include nf corrections . this is in analogy with the qcd factorization approach of beneke - neubert for hadronic @xmath7 meson decays  @xcite , where however , using the hard scattering approach , the nf corrections are calculable in heavy quark approximation . however , for charm , since this approximation fails , these nf corrections are not calculable and are left as parameters . we also indicate our parametrization of the annihilation contributions and discuss our inputs : the decay constants , and the form factors , for which we have used a z - series expansion approach . in sec . [ final state interactions ] , we discuss the need to incorporate additional long distance fsi effects and show how this can be done with a k matrix formalism for coupled channels . using the observed widths , masses and known decay rates of the resonances to the various channels to evaluate the diagonal elements and leaving the unknown elements of the k matrix as parameters , the unitarized amplitudes are calculated ( as discussed in  @xcite ) to estimate the branching ratios of all the scs , cf and doubly cabibbo suppressed ( dcs ) @xmath0 decay modes . in sec . [ numerical analysis ] , we list the isospin decomposition of all the decay modes , the parameters that need to be determined from our fits as well as the errors in theoretical inputs used . we list all the branching ratios after our numerical @xmath28 fits as well as the values of the fitted parameters . finally we conclude in sec . [ conclusions ] .", "the study of weak decays of charmed mesons to two body hadronic modes necessarily requires a careful evaluation of the strong interaction corrections . the weak effective hamiltonian may be expressed in terms of coefficient functions , which incorporate the strong interaction effects above the scale @xmath29 and the current - current operators as : @xmath30+h.c.~. \\label{(hamiltonian)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath31 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the wilson coefficients and the operators are , @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the above are colour indices , while @xmath37 , @xmath38 can be either the @xmath39 or the @xmath40 quark . the quark diagrams dominantly contributing to the branching ratios of @xmath41  @xcite are the colour - favoured tree amplitude @xmath42 , the colour - suppressed amplitude @xmath43 , the w - exchange amplitude @xmath44 and the w annihilation amplitude @xmath45 , shown in fig . [ diagrams ] . penguin contributions in charmed meson decays are highly suppressed as the dominant down type quark contribution to the flavour changing neutral current @xmath46 transition is from the @xmath47 quark which is accompanied by the presence of the tiny product , @xmath48 of the ckm matrix elements . hence , the two operators in eq . ( [ ( hamiltonian ) ] ) are sufficient for calculating the amplitudes and branching ratios of the @xmath0 modes .    in the naive factorization approach , the matrix element of the four - fermion operator in the heavy quark decay is replaced by a product of two currents . the amplitudes for the non - leptonic 2 body decay modes are then the product of a transition form factor and a decay constant . however , nf corrections must exist ; while such corrections for scales larger than @xmath49 are taken into consideration in the effective weak hamiltonian , those below this scale also need to be carefully incorporated . in the qcd factorization approach for @xmath7 meson decays  @xcite , these nf corrections are handled using the hard scattering approach , where the vertex corrections and the hard spectator interactions are added at the next to leading order in @xmath50 and its accuracy is limited only by the corrections to the heavy quark limit . but , in the case of charm decays , where the heavy quark expansion is not a very good approximation , it is best to parametrize these nf corrections and then determine them by fitting the theoretical branching ratios with the experimental data . in the diagrammatic approach of ref . @xcite also , either the wilson coefficients themselves or the nf corrections appearing in the wilson coefficients are determined from fits to data . hence , we write the scale dependent wilson coefficients , modified to include the nf corrections which are parametrized by @xmath51 and @xmath52 with their respective phases @xmath53 and @xmath54 as , @xmath55 the dominant tree and colour amplitudes for @xmath41 , where @xmath56 is the final meson which carries the spectator quark , while @xmath57 represents the meson emitted from the weak vertex ( as depicted in fig . [ diagrams ] ) , are then written as : @xmath58 where , @xmath59 is the @xmath57 meson decay constant and @xmath60 denotes the transition form factor for @xmath61 evaluated at @xmath62 . we follow the prescription of ref . @xcite and choose the scale @xmath49 to be the energy release in individual decay processes rather than fixed at @xmath63 . this scale which is dependent on the final state masses , allows for su(3 ) breaking , additional to that coming from different decay constants and form factors . this scale is taken to be , @xmath64 , where , @xmath65 and @xmath66 is another free parameter . @xmath66 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are taken to be universal for all the decay modes and are fitted from experimental data .      for a long time , w - exchange and w - annihilation contributions used to be neglected due to the so - called helicity suppression . however , observation of many decay modes of charmed and bottom mesons , which are possible only via the annihilation or exchange diagrams have indicated that these contributions could be substantial . these short distance weak annihilation effects were hence included in the diagrammatic approach . in principle these could result from rescattering , even in the absence of annihilation and exchange processes . in fact , weak annihilation topologies were assumed to be induced by nearby resonances through fsi s in ref . the authors in  @xcite as well as ref . @xcite use su(3 ) to relate the couplings of the final state mesons with the resonances . this leads to the result that the long distance w - exchange contribution can be induced by a tree amplitude , while w - annihilation can be induced by a color suppressed internal w - emission . the resonant fsi modify the w - exchange and w - annihilation amplitudes but the t and c amplitudes are unaffected . we emphasize that the assumption of su(3 ) , plays an important role in these results . in a most general coupled channel formalism , all contributions in the various channels will be affected by the resonant fsi , as will be shown in sec . we parametrize the w - exchange and w - annihilation contributions in the amplitudes by @xmath67 and estimate them from phenomenological fits to data . the exchange(annihilation ) amplitudes are hence written as : @xmath68 since the initial charmed meson is annihilated and both the final mesons are produced from the weak vertex , after the production of a quark - antiquark pair from a gluon , these amplitudes are a product of the decay constants of the initial @xmath20 meson ( @xmath69 ) and that of @xmath70 and @xmath71 . apart from this , the strengths of the exchange(annihilation ) amplitudes @xmath72 are assumed to be the same for all modes and the subscripts distinguish the contributions of the pair production of the light quark - antiquark from that of the strange pair . since the annihilation and exchange contributions are necessarily non - factorizable , they depend only on @xmath73 rather than the modified coefficients @xmath74 . we wish to emphasize that for the case of decays to two pseudoscalar mesons , it has been shown in ref . @xcite that in the annihilation contributions the quark - antiquark pair production happens with gluon emission from the initial state quark . hence , this contribution is independent of the fsi effects that obviously involve the final state quarks and are discussed in sec .  [ final state interactions ] . hence inclusion of both weak annihilation / exchange contributions as well as fsi will not amount to double counting , as pointed out in ref . @xcite . the scale of the wilson coefficients for the exchange and annihilation amplitudes must depend on both the mass ratios , @xmath75 and is taken to be , @xmath76  . we start by specifying our convention for the different mesons involved in our analysis : @xmath77    in the @xmath61 transitions , the matrix element of the vector current is written in terms of the form factors @xmath78 and @xmath79 as , @xmath80 where @xmath81 . the matrix element for the production of the second meson @xmath57 , is given by , @xmath82 hence , in the amplitude of the non - leptonic two pseudoscalar decay modes of charmed mesons involving the product of the two matrix elements specified in eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) , only the transition form factor @xmath79 appears . transition form factors can in principle be experimentally measured from the semi - leptonic decays , however , in the massless lepton limit , only the @xmath83 contributes to the semi - leptonic amplitude distributions . however , the semi - leptonic information is still useful , since at zero momentum transfer the form factors obey the kinematic constraint @xmath84 . the @xmath1 dependence of the @xmath79 on the other hand is accessible only with massive leptons in the semileptonic decays or in lattice simulations . simple and modified pole models have been widely used to parametrize the @xmath1 dependence of the form factors , but these have poor convergence properties . recently the z - expansion  @xcite has been introduced as a model independent parametrization of the @xmath1 dependence of form factors over the entire kinematic range and has been shown to have improved convergence properties . in this approach , based on analyticity and unitarity , the form factors are expressed as a series expansion in powers of @xmath85 , where z is a non - linear function of @xmath1 , with an overall mutiplicative function accounting for the sub - threshold poles and branch cuts , @xmath86 the series coefficients and prefactors can only be determined from fits to lattice or experimental data . in fact , cleo collaboration has determined these coefficients for the @xmath87 form factors from the semileptonic decays but , in the massless lepton limit . hence , for @xmath88 , we use lattice results to determine the first two coefficients .    in the becirevic and kaidalov ( bk ) ansatz  @xcite , @xmath89 where , @xmath90 is the mass of the vector meson with flavour @xmath91 or @xmath92 , depending on the transition being @xmath93 or @xmath94 respectively . @xmath95 and @xmath36 are parameters to be fitted to experimental data and in fact , in ref . @xcite , the fermilab and lattice milc collaborations , have fitted these parameters to cleo - c data . the normalization @xmath96 and shape parameter determine the physical observables describing the form factors at large recoil and are given by , @xmath97 using these input parameters we can determine the first two coefficients of the series expansion in eq . ( [ z - exp ] ) for @xmath88 . few details regarding the z series form factor expansion can be found in appendix b. if , the series is rapidly converging , even two coefficients may be sufficient to determine the @xmath1 dependent form factor @xmath88 . equating the normalization and slope obtained using eq . ( [ z - exp ] ) to that obtained from the lattice parameters ( @xmath98 ) , which in turn had been obtained by fits to experimental data , we can obtain the z - expansion series ( up to linear order ) for all the form factors . dependence of the scalar form factors . the plot on the left displays @xmath88 for @xmath99 transition , while that on the right is for @xmath100 transition . ]    in fig . [ plots ] we show the plots for our results for @xmath101 and @xmath100 where the lattice input parameters from ref . @xcite are used . we would like to point out that our @xmath101 and @xmath100 form factor values at @xmath102 are in very good agreement with that given in refs . @xcite which are the most precise published calculations for @xmath103 and @xmath104 form factors , according to lattice review  @xcite . further , the shape of @xmath88 for @xmath105 that we obtain after the z - series expansion are consistent with that of ref . moreover , the @xmath96 values in table  [ tab : bk ] for @xmath99 and @xmath100 are also in agreement with cleo results of ref . @xcite .    regarding @xmath106 and @xmath107 form factors , since in these transitions , only the non -

expansion coefficients , the approximations are used only for the input parameters , @xmath96 and @xmath36 . due to this uncertainty , we have added an additional @xmath120 theoretical error to these form factors . .best fit values of bk parameters for the scalar form factors [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : brvaldcs ]", "for several decades , various ratios of decay rates of many of the @xmath0 modes remained to be a puzzle as these were expected to be one in the @xmath16 limit , but the measured values exhibited large deviations from unity . we have evaluated the bare amplitudes of all the @xmath0 modes using factorization , however , we add non -

vanishing . there have been speculations  @xcite that this mode can arise just from final state interactions , even in the absence of a weak exchange contribution . however , from table  [ table : brvalscs ] it is clear that without the exchange contribution we are unable to generate a large enough rate : both final state interaction and the exchange contribution are necessary for consistency with the measured branching fraction . * we have also evaluated the four ratios of amplitudes that had been specified in a recent paper  @xcite . in su(3 ) limit these are all expected to be unity . our theoretical estimates for these ratios are given below : @xmath128 furthermore , the following combination of these ratios is expected to be vanishing up to @xmath129 order in u -

{"id": "1007.5492", "section_names": ["introduction", "observations", "results", "discussion", "conclusions"], "document": ["when infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) were originally identified as dark extinction features against the galactic background at mid - ir wavelengths @xcite , it was not clear what role , if any , they might play in the process of star formation . their high column densities ( @xmath4@xmath5 @xmath6 ) , together with their cold temperatures ( @xmath7 k ) suggest that if stars do form within irdcs , then irdcs must comprise an early phase in the process ; otherwise the embedded stars would have heated their surrounding gas and dust . recently , compact molecular cores within irdcs have been found to contain embedded young stars or protostars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . a few of these embedded young stellar objects will evolve into high - mass stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . this star - formation activity , along with the similarity in size and mass between irdcs and cluster - forming molecular clumps , has led to the suggestion that irdcs are the birthplaces of all high - mass stars and clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) . one striking feature of irdcs is their filamentary shape , evident in the images from mid - ir galactic surveys such as _ msx _ @xcite , glimpse @xcite , and mipsgal @xcite . similar filamentary structures are also found in familiar examples of associated high - mass star - forming molecular clouds , such as orion ( e.g. , @xcite ) . because these warmer clouds bear a striking resemblance to irdcs , the warm , star - forming filamentary clouds may represent a later evolutionary stage in the life of an irdc . indeed , filamentary clouds may play an important role in high - mass star formation because they allow for enhanced accretion rates onto cores @xcite . an extreme example of a filamentary irdc is the  nessie \" nebula centered near @xmath8 . nessie is identified as a dark mid - ir extinction feature in the glimpse and mipsgal surveys ( figure [ figure1 ] ) . if the mid - ir extinction represents a single object , then this irdc has an unusually large aspect ratio of over 150:1 ( @xmath9 ) . nessie contains a number of extinction maxima which in other irdcs are typically associated with pre - stellar and protostellar cores with masses of order 100 @xmath10 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . if the formation of irdcs , perhaps due to the passage of a spiral shock , results in filaments , then these long , approximately cylindrical structures may produce the necessary conditions for the formation of dense molecular cores , and ultimately of clusters and high - mass stars . indeed , the theory of gravitationally bound gaseous cylinders predicts the formation of such dense cores , which due to the  sausage \" or  varicose \" fluid instability , fragment from the cylinder at roughly regular intervals ( e.g. , @xcite ) . this instability provides an attractive physical mechanism for high - mass star formation and cluster formation in filamentary irdcs .    in this _ letter _ we report on molecular line mapping of the nessie nebula . we compare our results with the theory of self - gravitating fluid cylinders and show that the observations broadly conform to the expectations of the `` sausage '' instability . we speculate that this mechanism may be important in the formation of high - mass stars and star clusters .", "millimeter molecular line observations of the nessie nebula were taken on 2008 august with the australia telescope national facility ( atnf ) 22 m mopra telescope . the backend consisted of the wideband mops correlator configured to observe simultaneously 16 separate passbands covering the frequency range 86 to 93 ghz . each of these passbands was 137.5 mhz wide , with 4096 spectral channels , corresponding to a velocity resolution of 0.11 . we chose individual passbands to include molecular lines of interest . the brightest of the detected lines was ( 10)(90.66 ghz ) . although we detected a number of fainter molecular lines , these yield similar results and will be presented in a subsequent paper . the nebula was mapped in the `` on - the - fly '' mode , in which data are collected while the telescope scans in a raster pattern . the raster rows were chosen to be perpendicular to the galactic plane in order to avoid striping artifacts parallel to the nebula s long axis . the spacing between rows was 12  , or about 1/3 of the mopra beamwidth of 36  fwhm @xcite . flux calibration with a noise diode and an ambient temperature load was performed every 20 minutes . data reduction and analysis utilized the atnf livedata and gridzilla programs . the individual spectra were co - added and gridded onto a uniform 15  grid . linear baselines were removed from line - free channels . all spectra are presented on the antenna temperature ( @xmath11 ) scale . to convert to main - beam brightness temperatures , one should divide the antenna temperatures by the main - beam efficiency of 0.49 @xcite . system temperatures for the observations were @xmath12 k , which yielded a typical rms noise of @xmath13 k in each spectral channel .", "the mopra integrated intensity ( 10)maps closely correspond to the regions of mid - ir extinction ( figure [ figure1 ] ) . the map consists of fainter , uniform emission associated with the filament , upon which compact , brighter regions we call `` cores '' are superposed . gaussian fits to the ( 10)lines demonstrate that every position within nessie has essentially the same radial velocity , @xmath14 @xmath2  ( figure [ figure1 ] ) . if the clemens rotation curve is used , this velocity corresponds to a kinematic distance of 3.1 kpc @xcite . the molecular cores in nessie are often associated star - formation activity . specifically , many cores show the presence of excess 4.5 @xmath15 m emission called `` green fuzzies , '' which indicates shocked gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and bright 24 @xmath15 m point sources , which indicate an embedded protostar ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the cores do not appear to be randomly spaced within the filament , but instead have a characteristic spacing . the filament is thus reminiscent of a string with beads that are spaced sparsely but approximately uniformly along its length . we used the clumpfind2d algorithm with a threshold of seven times the rms noise and 2.5@xmath16 increments @xcite on the ( 10)integrated intensity map to identify 12 molecular cores ( see figure [ figure1 ] ) . the exact choice of clumpfind parameters will result in the identification of slightly more or fewer cores , but the resulting core spacing is quite insensitive to reasonable input parameters . since the cores are relatively isolated and well separated , clumpfind works well and identifies the cores that one would tend to select by eye . the positions and selected properties of the cores are listed in table [ coretable ] . columns 1 and 2 give the galactic coordinates of the position of peak integrated hnc intensity in each core , column 3 the peak hnc integrated intensity , columns 4 and 5 the angular size and physical extent , column 6 the lte mass ( see section [ discussion ] ) , and column 7 whether or not the core contains a 24 @xmath15 m point source . the mean projected spacing between cores is roughly 4.5 pc . although we prefer to use the molecular gas clumps as our indicator of core spacing , since we thereby include pre - stellar cores , another useful indicator of cluster - forming sites would be 24 @xmath15 m point sources , which indicate embedded high - mass stars or protostars . indeed , about half of the molecular cores contain 24 @xmath15 m point sources ( see table [ coretable ] ) . for all of the unresolved 24 @xmath15 m sources associated with the nebula , we find typical spacing of 4.1 pc , a value within 10% of the molecular core spacing . thus , both the spacing of gas clumps and of 24 @xmath15 m sources are in satisfactory agreement .", "the existence of cores that are spaced at approximately a characteristic spacing within a highly filamentary cloud is in broad agreement with the predictions of fragmentation of a self - gravitating fluid cylinder due to the  sausage \" instability . the theory s original presentation by @xcite treated an incompressible fluid . later refinements included an isothermal , thermally supported cylinder with various magnetic field configurations @xcite . although the fragmentation due to the  sausage \" instability of a self - gravitating fluid cylinder is similar to three - dimensional jeans collapse , there are important differences . in spherical gravitational jeans collapse , perturbations of all wavenumbers grow at the same rate , but in cylindrical gravitational collapse perturbations with certain wavenumbers grow more quickly than others . perturbations with the most unstable wavenumber will grow fastest , and hence overdensities ( cores ) will tend to form at a length scale whose wavenumber corresponds to this fastest growing mode . for a cylinder of infinite radius , this length scale is maintained even in the presence of a magnetic field parallel to the filament s axis @xcite . the theory thus predicts ( 1 ) that multiple cores should form within a filament , and ( 2 ) that the spacing between these cores should be roughly periodic , with a characteristic length scale equal to the wavelength of the fastest growing unstable mode of the fluid instability . for an incompressible fluid , this wavelength is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the cylinder s radius @xcite . in an infinite isothermal gas cylinder , the relation is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the isothermal scale height given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the sound speed , @xmath23 the gravitational constant , and @xmath24 the gas mass density at the center of the filament ( @xmath25 ) @xcite . for isothermal cylinders of finite radius @xmath18 surrounded by an external , uniform medium , the spacing depends on the ratio between the cylinder radius and the isothermal scale height , @xmath26 . for @xmath27 the core spacing approaches that for an infinite radius cylinder , @xmath19 , but for @xmath28 the spacing reduces to that of the incompressible case , @xmath17 . we now compare the observations of nessie to this theory under the assumption that nessie is well approximated by an isothermal cylinder . if nessie lies in the limit @xmath28 , the theory reduces to that of an incompressible fluid , and predicts cores spaced at a characteristic length scale @xmath29 . one can estimate the radius @xmath18 of nessie from the radial extent of the sharp extinction edges evident in the glimpse and mipsgal images . this suggests a radius of @xmath30 or @xmath31 pc at the kinematic distance of 3.1 kpc @xcite . thus , one would expect cores to form at a spacing of @xmath32 pc , in satisfactory agreement with the observations if the filament axis is mostly perpendicular to the line of sight . if nessie is treated as an isothermal gas cylinder with a central volume density @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 k , appropriate for cold , dense , molecular gas traced by ( 10)emission , then the isothermal scale height is @xmath36 pc . thus , nessie would be in the regime @xmath27 , and the theoretical spacing between cores should be @xmath37 pc . this is smaller than the observed spacing by about a factor of 5 . this discrepancy may arise from the fact that turbulent pressure dominates over thermal pressure . theoretical studies of self - gravitating cylinders usually assume that thermal pressure is the dominant gas pressure . however , because the observed linewidths in most molecular clouds typically exceed the thermal sound speeds by large factors , turbulent pressure usually dominates over thermal pressure . if one replaces the sound speed @xmath22 with the velocity dispersion @xmath16 to account for turbulent pressure @xcite , the effective scale height @xmath38 is increased considerably over the thermal scale height @xmath20 . assuming a central volume density again of @xmath39 @xmath34 , and a fwhm linewidth of 2.5 , typically observed toward nessie , the effective scale height is @xmath40 pc , which leads to a spacing of @xmath41 pc between the cores . again , the theoretical prediction is in satisfactory agreement with the observations , especially since the central density and hence the scale height @xmath20 is uncertain . moreover , the theoretical assumption of a uniform , isothermal cylinder ( sometimes embedded in a uniform pressure external medium ) is obviously idealized , and the fragmentation length scale may well differ in more realistic treatments . the theory also predicts that self - gravitating cylinders in equilibrium have a maximum , critical linear mass density ( mass per unit length along the cylinder s axis ) . above the critical value , the cylinder would collapse radially into a line . this critical linear mass density is given by @xmath42 ; where @xmath43 is the sound speed @xmath22 in the case of thermal support ( stodolkiewicz 1963 , ostriker 1964 ) and the turbulent velocity dispersion @xmath16 in the case of turbulent support @xcite . if turbulent pressure dominates over thermal pressure in nessie , the critical linear mass density can be estimated as @xmath44 @xmath10 @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is in units of . for typical line widths observed in nessie ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 m@xmath49 pc@xmath50 . [ note that magnetic fields can alter the critical linear mass density , increasing it for poloidal fields and decreasing it for toroidal fields , but probably by small factors @xmath51 @xcite . ] the mass per unit length in the nessie nebula can be estimated from the ( 10)fluxes , although this estimate is difficult due to uncertainties in molecular abundances , depletion of molecules frozen onto cold dust grains , and optical depth effects . nevertheless , assuming optically thin ( 10)emission , lte , a temperature of 10 k , and an hnc abundance of x@xmath52 @xcite appropriate for cold clouds , we arrive at a typical linear mass density in nessie of 110 m@xmath49 pc@xmath50 . because this value is smaller than the maximum predicted by theory , the estimated linear mass density is consistent with theoretical expectations . unfortunately , the reported abundances of hnc vary widely , with values for cold clouds ranging from @xmath53 to @xmath54 @xcite . these hnc abundance values give rise to a wide range in the linear mass density of up to @xmath55 m@xmath49 pc@xmath50 . future observations of the dust continuum will better constrain the linear mass density . it is interesting to compare the value of @xmath56 obtained by theory and estimated in nessie with that measured for the molecular filament associated with orion , @xmath57 m@xmath49 pc@xmath50 , assuming m = @xmath58 m@xmath49 and @xmath59 pc @xcite . this value is within a factor of a few of that estimated for nessie , and also smaller than the maximum value predicted by theory . the maximum mass of the cores can also be estimated from theory . the core masses should roughly be given by @xmath60 . assuming the maximum , critical value for @xmath56 of @xmath61 m@xmath49 pc@xmath50 for the case of turbulent pressure support , and a spacing of 4.5 pc , one expects the cores to have maximum masses @xmath62 . if instead the average linear mass density of 110 m@xmath49 pc@xmath50 derived for nessie is used , the core masses should be no larger than about @xmath63 . for nessie , the estimated core masses based on the integrated ( 10)fluxes over the solid angles range from @xmath64 ( table [ coretable ] ) .    to summarize , if turbulent pressure , rather than thermal pressure , provides the support for nessie , the core spacing ( 4.5 pc ) agrees with theoretical predictions . moreover , both the linear mass density and the core masses in nessie are also consistent with the theory , since they are comparable to , but fall below , the maximum theoretical values . we speculate that all cluster formation arises from the fragmentation of filamentary irdcs due to fluid instabilities that lead to massive , star - forming cores . the periodic spacing of such cores within nessie strengthens this suggestion . moreover , filamentary molecular gas clouds are usually associated with high - mass star - forming regions , such as orion , and these warmer clouds bear a striking resemblance to irdcs . such clouds may represent a later evolutionary stage of a filamentary irdc . a cartoon sketch of the proposed evolution of irdcs is given in figure [ cartoon ] . initially a filamentary irdc is formed . the filament reaches an equilibrium configuration with a linear mass density close to the critical value . the filament then fragments due to the `` sausage '' instability into roughly periodically spaced cores . such dense molecular cores have sufficiently large masses to form clusters . the mass of the cores is set by a combination of the turbulent velocity dispersion , which determines the linear mass density , and the wavelength of the fastest growing mode of the `` sausage '' instability . thus , the cluster - forming core mass , and ultimately , the mass of the resulting cluster , is determined by the physics of the turbulent , self - gravitating cylindrical fluid . within the more massive cores , high - mass protostars form . when an embedded o or an early b protostar eventually reaches the main sequence , it ionizes the surrounding gas and creates a bubble in the interstellar medium @xcite . eventually the embedded cluster emerges .    in the earliest phases , then , filamentary irdcs with several cores would be observed . as the regions form , bubbles would be associated with the irdcs , and eventually the irdc would be segmented and disrupted as the regions grow and overlap . later , the filament would contain one or more bright clusters , and appear similar to the filamentary molecular clouds associated with high - mass star - forming regions such as orion and ngc 6334 @xcite . examples of each of these proposed stages can easily be found , from dark filamentary irdcs like g@xmath65 , sometimes called the snake @xcite , to irdcs containing one or more bubble - like regions such as nessie , to active high - mass star - forming regions like orion and ngc 6334 .", "we have imaged a filamentary irdc , the nessie nebula , in ( 10)molecular line emission with the atnf mopra telescope . because the ( 10)radial velocities are uniform across the filament , nessie is a coherent , single cloud . both ( 10)and mid - ir images reveal that nessie contains numerous dense cores , which appear to have a roughly periodic spacing of 4.5 pc . the theory of self - gravitating , gaseous cylinders shows that they are unstable to a fluid instability , called the `` sausage '' instability , which causes the filament to fragment into cores with a roughly constant spacing . thus , unlike the jeans collapse of uniform media , the fragmentation of cylinders has a preferred length scale . theory predicts that the fastest growing wavelength scales as the radius @xmath18 or the isothermal scale height @xmath20 of the cylinder , depending on the ratio @xmath26 . in the conditions thought to be appropriate to nessie , the spacing between clumps is predicted to be 4 to 6 pc , in good agreement with the observed spacing of 4.5 pc .    because of the ubiquity of the association between filamentary molecular clouds and high - mass star forming regions , it is tempting to suggest that the physics of molecular filaments has a profound influence on cluster formation . indeed , such filaments may be a necessary initial condition to form dense cluster - forming cores with the observed properties . we speculate that the `` sausage '' instability may be the dominant physical mechanism to produce cores from filamentary irdcs . we suggest an evolutionary sequence in which filamentary irdcs fragment into cores , which in turn spawn star clusters and high - mass stars . thus , familiar high - mass star - forming clouds such as orion may have begun their lives as filamentary irdcs . the authors gratefully acknowledge the funding support through nasa grant nag5 -

[ fig1 ] : phase i , the variation yields @xmath119 , @xmath120 or @xmath121 , @xmath122 ; phase ii , the variation yields @xmath123 . it is clear that @xmath59 must be negative for a positive @xmath12 due to the fact that @xmath59 s in eq .

[ phase1 ] , which exhibit clearly characters of the @xmath3 wave state , i.e. the spin - up component is dumbbell - like while the spin - down component forms a torus . the total density on the other hand is isotropic - the sum of @xmath145 and @xmath146 in eq . ( [ ni ] ) relies only on the radius @xmath89 . this spin density calculated on the variational order parameter shows interesting spin texture described by@xmath147 the average value of the spin in the @xmath148 plane is zero , i.e. @xmath149 . the spin texture @xmath150 is depicted in fig . [ phase1 ] and we find that spin density forms a torus near the @xmath148 plane and a bundle of nearly vertical streamlines of spin penetrate the central region of the torus . this skyrmion - like texture has been discussed in ref . @xcite and identified as the ground state in @xmath134 regime for an interaction parameter @xmath151 . et al_. @xcite also found this ground state skyrmion spin texture in weak so coupling case for isotropic interaction @xmath124 . the term `` skyrmion - like '' means the absence of boundary condition at @xmath152 @xcite thus the winding number for the texture is not an integer .    in order to get a deep understanding of the skyrmion nature of this ground state , we notice that the order parameter can be obtained from a local spin rotation from the polarized spinor wavefunction @xmath153 @xmath154 supposing that @xmath155 and @xmath156 . this operation rotates the spin at position @xmath157 by an angle @xmath158 about the axis @xmath159 . the rotation angle is position dependent , i.e. @xmath160 and @xmath161 is the usual spin angular momentum operators for spin-1/2 . it is the explicit form of @xmath162 that determines the specific texture of the skyrmion @xcite . the polarized spinor order parameter @xmath163 has all spins being oriented in the positive @xmath19-direction . after the rotation the order parameter @xmath164 for this skyrmion state is position - dependent . the order parameter is the most symmetrically shaped skyrmion with the symmetric axis unrotated , which is identical with that already discussed in refs . @xcite . in those papers the 3d skyrmion states are proposed as excited states in pseudo - spin @xmath0 or ferromagnetic spin-1 @xcite bose gases although they may be metastable . _ phase ii _ : this phase again contains two degenerate states with @xmath165 and @xmath166 , which are time reversal states of each other . they share similar density distribution and spin texture just like the case of phase i. the order parameter for @xmath167 has the form @xmath168{c}% r_{00}\\left (   r\\right )   -i\\alpha r_{01}\\left (   r\\right )   ( \\cos\\theta + \\sin\\theta e^{-i\\varphi})\\\\ r_{00}\\left (   r\\right )   -i\\alpha r_{01}\\left (   r\\right ) ( -\\cos\\theta + \\sin\\theta e^{i\\varphi } ) \\end{array } \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the particle densities for the two components are@xmath169 the density for each component consists of two parts , one is isotropic that is common for both components , the other is complementary to each other as shown in the second and fourth lines in eq . ( [ p2n ] ) . this leads again to an isotropic total density . the overall density distribution of the two components can be visualized as two cashew nuts perpendicularly crossing and partially overlapping with each other . the distributions in @xmath148 , @xmath144 and @xmath143 planes are shown in fig .

[ phase2 ] . the spin density in this case forms a torus near the @xmath144 plane and the fountain - like streamlines of spin pass through the hole of the torus , which is more or less like a @xmath179 rotation of the torus in phase i about @xmath174 axis . similarly , this ground state can be obtained from a local spin rotation from the spinor order parameter @xmath180 that describes a system with all spins pointing to the positive @xmath171 direction , i.e. @xmath181 the spinor wavefunction @xmath182 is related to @xmath183 by a @xmath179 rotation around @xmath174 . owing to the non - abelian nature of so@xmath184 rotation , the spin texture of phase ii is different from the @xmath179 rotation around @xmath174 of phase i. the difference between these two textures lies in the fact that the spin in the torus of phase i revolves the @xmath19 axis following an elliptical ( oval ) orbits that rotate gradually like the perihelion precession in celestial mechanics , while in phase ii the orbits are closed loops . apart from this , they indeed share the same topology determined by the same @xmath185 as can be seen from the spin streamline plot in fig .

( 2n ) ! ! } \\ { l^{n - d+2n } }       \\int_m { \\cal l}^{(n)}\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath47 ( see @xcite for an interesting review . ) if any of the curvature radii are small compared to @xmath40 , we expect the formula to break down because different sections of the tube associated with different regions of @xmath37 can intersect . this would cause the formula to overcount the volume . it was recently pointed out by labbi@xcite that the curvature invariants appearing in weyl s formula are the same as those appearing in the lagrangian of lovelock s theory . so the volume of a tube coincides with the action of euclidean lovelock theory with a special choice of coupling constants . it would be interesting to generalise the tube formula to a minkowski space background . also , it may be of interest to find a tube formula in ( a)ds space . the generalisation to hyperbolic space is well known@xcite . the first question which arises in generalising to minkowski space is how to define the tube . in the euclidean case the definition is motivated by the intuitive fact that the shortest route from a point to a surface is the line that hits the surface normally . in minkowski space this is no longer true . indeed it would be futile to define the tube as the locus of points of less than @xmath40 spacelike proper distance from @xmath37 for a simple reason . let @xmath48 be a point on @xmath37 . then any points which are infinitesimally close to the lightcone of @xmath48 and which have spacelike separation from @xmath48 must be included in the tube . so a tube thus defined would stretch all the way out to future and past null infinity . however , even though the meaning is not quite the same as as in the euclidean case , we can still define the tube in the same way :    [ minkowski_tube_def ] the tube of @xmath49 in minkowski space @xmath50 is the set of all points of proper distance less than @xmath40 along a geodesic which intersects @xmath49 normally .    according to the above definition , the tube will not extend out towards null infinity unless the normal vector of @xmath49 becomes null at some point . so for an embedded submanifold of strictly minkowski signature , the tube is bounded . it is curious that , although the geometry of minkowskian tubes is quite different compared to their euclidean counterparts , the formula for the volume turns out to be the same . before considering the general proof of this , let us check it explicitly with a pair of examples . first we consider the embedding of an @xmath51-sphere @xmath52 into @xmath53 and then the lorentzian equivalent , de sitter space embedded as a hyperboloid in minkowski space . in the first case , the volume of the tube is the volume contained between two concentric spheres of radius @xmath54 and @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath56 using @xmath57 for the lovelock scalars of the sphere of radius @xmath58 we can expand the tube volume as : @xmath59 } \\frac{l^{2n+1}}{(2n + 1)!}\\int_{m } { \\cal l}^{(n)}\\ ] ] with @xmath60 .    in the second case , we have @xmath61 realised by the embedding @xmath62 in @xmath63 . it is useful to parametrise this by @xmath64 etc . as with the sphere , the normal vectors lie along rays through the origin and one finds that the tube is delimited by two concentric embedded @xmath65 spaces of curvature radii @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively . the volume element is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the volume element on the hyperboloid of unit curvature .. this correctly accounts for the edge effects of the tube , because the lines @xmath70 const . coincide with the normal vectors ( see fig [ dsfig ] ) . ] embedded in minkowski space @xmath71 . a slice through the @xmath72 plane is shown . the tube is the shaded region between concentric @xmath65 spaces of curvature radii @xmath73 and @xmath55 . the normal vectors are aligned with rays through the origin.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    so we obtain for the volume : @xmath74 since the lovelock curvature scalars are the same for @xmath65 as for the sphere , we obtain the same formula ( [ spheretube ] ) . let us now consider the tube of a general lorentzian manifold @xmath75 . since the definition of a tube in terms of the normal vectors is the same as for the euclidean case , one would expect weyl s formula in terms of extrinsic curvatures@xcite to be the same . also , since the gauss - coddazzi equations are the same , we expect the formula ( [ weyl_tube_formula ] ) in terms of intrinsic curvatures to apply also to minkowski space . in order to confirm this , let us briefly revisit the proof of the tube formula , formulating things in a terminology familiar to relativists using minkowskian signature . let us consider an infinitesimal region on @xmath76 and let @xmath77 be a set of orthonormal vectors forming a basis of the tangent space . in a local neighbourhood , this can be extended to an orthonormal basis of @xmath78 which can also be interpreted as a set of direction vectors in @xmath63 , denoted @xmath79 , where the @xmath80 are normal vectors to @xmath49 . consider an infinitesimal @xmath38-cube defined by the vectors @xmath81 @xmath82 , @xmath83 where @xmath84 are the infinitesimal line elements in the direction of the vector . now we displace the vertices of the cube by a vector @xmath85 in a normal direction . if there is extrinsic curvature then @xmath86 will vary from one vertex to another . therefore the displaced infinitesimal vectors will be @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the extrinsic curvature tensor w.r.t . the normal @xmath86 . the displaced @xmath38-volume element is therefore @xmath89 integrating these elements over @xmath90 and over @xmath76 , assuming that they do not intersect each other , gives : @xmath91 the calculation of combinatorial factors amounts to calculating the moments of the @xmath92-ball , @xmath93 , @xmath94 etc . since odd moments vanish , the extrinsic curvatures will always appear in pairs , @xmath95 when we expand out the determinant . in this way , the extrinsic curvatures can always be substituted for intrinsic curvatures using the gauss formula . since the normal space is euclidean , the gauss formula is the same as in the euclidean case @xmath96 . therefore , the same combinatorial factors and signs must arise is of constant curvature , and read off the coefficients . ] . so we conclude :    let @xmath76 be a manifold with metric of minkowski signature embedded in minkowski space @xmath63 . let @xmath97 be the @xmath40-tube of @xmath76 . assuming that every point in the tube has a unique geodesic which connects it with @xmath76 and intersects @xmath76 normally , the world - volume of the tube is correctly described by formula ( [ weyl_tube_formula ] ) .      in this case we have : @xmath98 with @xmath99 we note that the  magic \" combination of coupling constants has the value @xmath100 . for all dimensions @xmath101 this is in the range @xmath102 . the chern - simons gravity theories correspond to @xmath103 and so it is not possible to obtain their action as a tube volume . previously , the value @xmath104 has been shown to be an exceptional case in the context of product spacetime solutions@xcite . also , in the context of the first order theory the value was found to be special , since this fine - tuning permitted compactified solutions with constant torsion on a three - sphere@xcite . here in the context of tube volumes ( torsion - free by construction ) we find @xmath105 , providing further evidence that this value is special in some sense . in fact , since a general 5-manifold may need up to @xmath106 dimensions in order for an embedding to exist , we should take @xmath107 and so @xmath108 to good approximation .    the lovelock theory defined by the above action admits two constant curvature solutions @xmath109 with gaussian curvature given by the roots of a quadratic equation @xmath110 . so for large @xmath111 the characteristic curvature radius of the space - time is given by @xmath112 . therefore the size of the ( 5-dimensional ) universe is much smaller then the thickness of the tube . however , in this regime the tube formula is not valid and so we can not regard the solutions as meaningful . it can be checked that this appearance of an enormous effective cosmological constant is a generic feature of for all @xmath38 . we therefore look for an appropriate term to add to the action , which may cancel the cosmological constant .      if we think of the tube volume as an action functional of the intrinsic metric , it is interesting to ask what are the extrema of the action . if one looks for a maximally symmetric solution , with constant curvature @xmath113 , the lovelock field equations will give a polynomial of order @xmath114 $ ] for @xmath113 . so for @xmath38 odd one always has at least one solution . a preliminary investigation suggests that , for real roots @xmath113 tends to be large compared to @xmath115 i.e. it describes a geometry where the volume formula is expected to break down . also @xmath113 is always negative .    in order to ensure a maximally symmetric solution with small curvature , it seems to be necessary to use the tube area formula . the surface area of the tube is : @xmath116 }       \\frac{(n - d)!!}{(n - d + 2n-2 ) ! ! ( 2n ) ! ! } \\ { l^{n - d+2n-1 } }       \\int_m { \\cal l}^{(n)}\\ , , \\ ] ] a more general action would then be @xmath117 , with @xmath118 constants . the analogy would be with a drop of fluid , whose internal energy has an extensive part and also a contribution from the surface energy . we shall consider the simple choice @xmath119 this choice allows us to cancel completely the term proportional to the area of @xmath37 . the resulting action depends only on the curvature terms , @xmath120 }       \\frac{(n - d-2)!!}{(n - d + 2n ) ! ! ( 2n-2 ) ! ! } \\ { l^{n - d+2n } } \\int_m { \\cal l}^{(n)}\\ , , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and therefore minkowski space will be a solution . more generally , the absence of the bare cosmological constant ( @xmath121 ) term means that there will be a branch of the solutions where the curvature is small compared to @xmath115 . these solutions will be like solutions of einstein s equation with higher order corrections in @xmath122 . solutions for @xmath37 belonging to this branch can have tubes that do not self intersect . normalising so that the coefficient of the einstein - hilbert term is unity , the coefficients of the lovelock series are : @xmath123 etc . generally @xmath124", "to see when determinism breaks down in this theory given initial data @xmath21 and @xmath125 on a space - like hypersurface . as discussed in footnote 1 , this is not always equivalent to the hamiltonian evolution . the former approach will arise naturally when integrating by finite element approximation . as such it is relevant to numerical evolution of solutions . the latter approach is more correct from the point of view of taking limits , for example when we consider classical solutions as arising from the method of stationary phase@xcite . here we follow the definition of ref . @xcite@xcite , because it allows us to restore determinism by imposing a simple inequality on the riemann tensor . for the hamiltonian evolution no such simple condition exists . ] , we need to examine the determinant @xmath126 . first , in order to simplify the expression for @xmath127 , let us introduce lovelock tensors , with two and four free indices , of the spatial components of the curvature : @xmath128 then we obtain the general formula : @xmath129 } n \\alpha_n \\left (   ( \\mathcal { i}^{(n-1)})^{\\ \\ cd}_{ab } - g_{ab } ( \\mathcal { h}^{(n-1)})^{cd }   \\right)\\ , .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] now we shall evaluate this for the choice of coupling coefficients ( [ special_couplings ] ) obtained in the preceeding section . let us assume that the embedding space is high dimensional : @xmath130 . therefore @xmath131 @xmath132 }   \\left(\\frac{l^2}{2n}\\right)^{p } \\frac{1}{p ! }   \\left (   ( \\mathcal { i}^{(p)})^{\\ \\ cd}_{ab } - g_{ab } ( \\mathcal { h}^{(p)})^{cd }   \\right)\\ , .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the determinant will never vanish if all eigenvalues of @xmath35 are much smaller than unity ( in an appropriate frame , e.g. an orthonormal frame , we may say that all the components are much less than unity ) . this will always be the case provided all @xmath133 . determinism will only be in danger of breaking down once riemann tensor components become of order @xmath134 . as mentioned previously , the tube formula breaks down if the tube intersects itself in some way . the tube formula is valid provided every point in the tube has a unique geodesic which connects it with @xmath76 and intersects @xmath76 normally is bijective for normal vectors of length @xmath42 ] . it is easy to check that :    the tube formula in minkowski space breaks down locally around a point @xmath136 if any of the eigenvalues of the extrinsic curvature matrices @xmath137 is greater than or equal to @xmath138 in magnitude . furthermore , at least locally , requiring the absolute value of all the eigenvalues of the @xmath139 to be less than @xmath138 is a sufficient condition for the validity of the tube formula . in view of the gauss relation , this means that the magnitude of components of the riemann tensor in an appropriate basis are certainly less than @xmath134 . in fact , since the sectional curvatures will be less than @xmath115 , the tube formula is expected to break down when the riemann tensor components ( in an orthonormal frame say ) are of order @xmath115 .      although we have only given an order of magnitude estimate , the result is quite compelling . it gives us strong evidence that the domain of validity of the tube formula is contained within the domain of validity of determinism . _ if this is so , it means that in regions where the curvature blows up , the tube formula breaks down before determinism breaks down . _ when the tube formula breaks down , it is because elements of the extrinsic geometry interfere with the simple expression of the volume and area in terms of intrinsic geometry of @xmath37 . if we regard ( [ fundamental ] ) as the fundamental definition of the action , then formula ( [ not_fundamental ] ) is an effective description only when extrinsic curvatures are small . once they become large , there is a phase transition to a regime where the geometrical degrees of freedom are different . therefore , instead of a phase transition to a nondeterministic ( and therefore classically ill - defined ) theory , we have a phase transition to a different sector of the theory where the tube volume and area are not described entirely in terms of the intrinsic geometry of @xmath37 , but where extrinsic geometry of the embedding becomes relevant as a physical degree of freedom .    in all of this we are assuming that in the sector described by ( [ not_fundamental ] ) it is legitimate to vary the action with respect to the intrinsic metric of @xmath37 , rather than w.r.t . the embedding itself . this is potentially a rather big weakness , which we will pick up on again in the concluding section .", "we have treated space - time and its tube as embedded in some minkowski space of higher dimension in such a way that the intrinsic geometry of spacetime coincides with the induced geometry of the embedding . so far we have just assumed that such isometric embeddings ( of the appropriate level of smoothness ) exist . now it is necessary to take this question seriously . for riemannian manifolds , it is a classic result of j. nash that any manifold may be smoothly isometrically embedded into euclidean space of large enough dimension . for manifolds of lorentzian signature , we need to know what kind of manifolds have such an embedding in @xmath63 . fortunately , in recent years a very satisfactory answer to this question has emerged . so how does nash s embedding theorem generalise to minkowski space ? clearly , not every space - time admits such an embedding . for example , if space - time is not time - orientable it can not be embedded with @xmath140 time dimensions . in fact greene@xcite and clarke@xcite independently showed that any pseudo - riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded into @xmath141 for large enough @xmath48 and @xmath142 . however , for the purposes of the tube formula , such embeddings are not acceptable , due to the problem of defining a tube when there are null geodesics in the normal space . ] . using straightforward arguments , penrose showed that the manifold must admit a spacelike surface separating space - time into two disconnected regions ( past and future ) , such that every causal path cuts the surface no more than once and every timelike curve ending on the surface has bounded proper time@xcite ( note that this is weaker than global hyperbolicity- for example take a globally hyperbolic space - time and remove some points or timelike surfaces . the resulting spacetime will not be globally hyperbolic but it will still obey the above condition ) . a highly non - trivial result - almost the converse of penrose s - obtained recently , is the following remarkable theorem@xcite :    [ iff ] any globally hyperbolic space - time manifold @xmath76 admits a global smooth isometric embedding into minkowski space @xmath63 for large enough @xmath111 . the current upper bound for what is a sufficiently large value of @xmath111 is @xmath143 i.e. one higher than the corresponding upper bound for euclidean manifolds . so if we want to study four - dimensional space - times , we should embed them in at least 19 dimensions to be sure that an embedding exists . for five dimensions , we should embed them in 26 dimensions etc .    as mentioned above , global hyperbolicity is not a necessary condition for the embedding . however , the slightly weaker condition of causal simplicity is a necessary condition@xcite . it is quite wonderful that the existence of the embedding is guaranteed by only one requirement- and a very welcome requirement it is too . a globally hyperbolic space - time is the arena for deterministic physics . this complements rather well the ( heuristic ) results of the previous section .", "weyl s formulae for the volume @xmath144 and surface area @xmath145 of a tube in euclidean space have been shown to generalise straightforwardly to a tube surrounding a pseudo - riemannian manifold embedded in minkowski space . the resulting formulae correspond to the action of lovelock gravity , with a special combination of the coefficients . we have focussed on just one spacial case , taking a combination @xmath146 so that the bare cosmological constant term vanishes from the lovelock series . in this case evidence was found that the lovelock description of the tube volume breaks down _ before _ determinism breaks down . therefore , instead of the theory itself breaking down , one would have a phase transformation to a different sector , governed by different geometrical degrees of freedom . for the future , a more careful study of the curvature inequalities is needed to verify this , also taking into account other linear combinations of @xmath144 and @xmath145 .    in order to obtain the equations of lovelock gravity , we have not varied w.r.t . the embedding , but rather the intrinsic geometry of @xmath37 . this means , for instance that we regard translations of the tube in minkowski space as pure gauge . also , in higher dimensions , it is possible to have changes in the extrinsic curvature which preserve the intrinsic metric and curvature . this is known as _ isometric bending_. these are also treated as pure gauge . however , one is at liberty to question this approach . if the embedding is regarded as real rather than just metaphorical , the rigid motions would then be more correctly regarded as zero modes of the theory . also the isometric bending would become something like zero modes . if we follow the string / brane approach in constructing the variational principle , we should regard the embedding coordinates @xmath147 as the degrees of freedom . to derive the field equations , one follows exactly the same argument as with standard regge - teitelboim geodetic brane gravity@xcite@xcite . noting that @xmath148 and using the bach - lanczos identity @xmath149 we get : @xmath150 so we see that the solutions of lovelock gravity would be a subset of the resulting solutions . however , there are also other solutions such as the rather trivial @xmath151 . the possible degeneration of this term multiplying the field equations will affect any conclusions regarding determinism . therefore it may be desirable to avoid varying w.r.t . @xmath147 . more study is needed .    that there is a formal connection@xcite between weyl s tube formula and lovelock gravity is , in the authors opinion , of undoubted interest . it remains to be checked more carefully if this truly provides a resolution to the problem of indeterminism ( or any other physical problems ) . in our method there is perhaps some mixing of philosophies between the realist and the metaphorical interpretation of the embedding space , which needs to be untangled in a satisfactory manner . this work is offered as an introduction and perhaps an invitation to further study of the subject . it is a pleasure to thank j. zanelli for much useful advice and inspiration ; also thanks to e. gravanis and r. troncoso for fruitful discussions . the centro de estudios cientficos ( cecs ) is funded by the chilean government through the millennium science initiative and the centers of excellence base financing program of conicyt . cecs is also supported by a group of private companies which at present includes antofagasta minerals , arauco , empresas cmpc , indura , naviera ultragas and telefnica del sur . this work was supported in part by fondecyt grant 1085323 . n.  deruelle and l.  farina -

time dimensions , what would we expect classical gravity to be like ? it is often stated that the most natural generalisation is lovelock s theory , which shares many physical properties with gr . but there are also key differences and problems . a potentially serious problem is the breakdown of determinism , which can occur when the matrix of coefficients of second time derivatives of the metric degenerates . this can be avoided by imposing inequalities on the curvature . here it is argued that such inequalities occur naturally if the lovelock action is obtained from weyl s formulae for the volume and surface area of a tube . part of the purpose of this article is to give a treatment of the weyl tube formula in terminology familiar to relativists and to give an appropriate ( straightforward ) generalisation to a tube embedded in minkowski space . cecs -

[ fig : principle ] ) . also hadronic showers produced in nc neutrino interactions @xmath10 inside unt sensitive volume can be detected by radiated cherenkov photons . pmt hit times and positions provide with a possibility to reconstruct the track or shower vertex while a charge collected on pmt anodes allows to reconstruct the energy . thus , there can be two main event topologies in unts ( fig . [ fig : topo ] ) :    * * track event * in case of muon of any energy or tau - lepton with energy @xmath112pev ( approximately above this energy tau - lepton is able to propagate remarkable distance before decay thanks to the lorentz factor ) ; * * shower event * in case of electron , tau - lepton with energy @xmath122pev and nc interactions of all flavor neutrinos . however , real events may contain both topologies . track of uhe / ehe muon or tau - lepton is complemented by showers produced by secondaries which are generated in the muon interactions : bremsstrahlung , direct @xmath13-pair production , photonuclear interactions and knock - on electron production . with some probability these showers can take the major fraction of @xmath14/@xmath15 energy and even all the energy ( first of all due to bremsstrahlung ) . thus , a combined topology * track@xmath16shower * takes place . as well as , a tau - lepton track with a subsequent decay create such combined topology . cc muon neutrino ( or tau neutrino if @xmath17 is in multi - pev range or higher ) interaction within unt sensitive volume with an hadronic shower in the neutrino interaction vertex and subsequent charged lepton track also produces a combined topology which is even more complex in case of tau - lepton if it decays inside sensitive volume providing thus with at least two showers : in neutrino interaction point and at the decay point ( so called double bang @xcite ) . on the other hand , at energies below pev range two showers at the tau neutrino interaction vertex and at the tau - lepton decay point are so close to each other that can not be separated at reconstruction ( also tau - lepton track can not be distinguished ) and thus , such an event can be considered as a pure shower one .    the main goal of uhe / ehe neutrino astronomy is to determine the origin of high energy cosmic rays . for this it is needed to detect natural flux of the high energy neutrinos measuring neutrino energy , directional information and intensity . expected sources of uhe / ehe neutrinos are as follows ( more detailed review can be found , e.g. , in @xcite ) :    * steady sources like , e.g. , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , supernova remnants ( snr ) or microquasars ; * transient sources like gamma ray bursts ( gbr ) ; * decay of superheavy particles or topological defects . detection of uhe / ehe neutrinos and identification of their sources would allow to clarify the origination of uhe / ehe cosmic rays and to understand the processes by which the nature fills the universe with the highest energy particles . accuracy of energy measurements in unts is not too high . energy reconstruction is based on the increase of emitted cherenkov light due to muon ( @xmath15 ) catastrophic energy losses above @xmath181tev . also , amount of cherenkov photons produced by both hadronic and electromagnetic shower is more or less proportional to the shower energy . but due to stochastic nature of energy losses and due to the fact that an unt represent a non - dense detector with pmts spaced by typically 10 - 100 m , unts can not be a good calorimeter : for instance , dispersion of the @xmath19 distribution ( where @xmath20 is the true muon energy and @xmath21 is the reconstructed energy , respectively ) is around @xmath220.5 at @xmath235tev and @xmath220.3 for @xmath24100tev which means that the muon energy resolution is at the level of 2 - 3 only ( see fig . [ fig : enerres ] ) . besides , an additional un - avoided error at neutrino energy measurement comes from the fact that fraction of energy that is taken by charged lepton at neutrino cc interaction has a distribution and if neutrino interaction occurs far apart unt sensitive volume and , hence , shower energy can not be reconstructed , reconstructed charged lepton energy is not a good estimator for the neutrino energy . angular resolution for track events at uhe / ehe range is , typically , at @xmath250.1@xmath261.0@xmath26 level ( fig . [ fig : angres ] ) and it is sufficient for search of point - like neutrino sources . the first main background for neutrino events comes from down - going atmospheric muons and it is suppressed by putting unt as deeper as possible to provide with a shield of water or ice ( each 1 km of water suppress the atmospheric muon background by approximately one order of magnitude ) and by selecting of up - going events as neutrino candidates . the second background is due to atmospheric neutrinos . the flux of astrophysical neutrinos is expected to behave like @xmath27 whereas the atmospheric neutrino spectrum falls like @xmath28 , yielding a better signal - to - background ratio at higher energies . thus , atmospheric neutrino background can be suppressed by setting the off - line energy threshold at the level @xmath2910 - 100tev .    except for deep underwater or ice neutrino detection other techniques are also discussed and used ( for more detailed review see @xcite ) :    * detection of coherent cherenkov radio waves emitted by electromagnetic showers @xcite ; * acoustic pulses generated in matter heated by uhe / ehe cascades due to ionization energy losses @xcite ; * detection of neutrino interactions by horizontal air showers ( both with traditional earth - based large extensive air shower arrays @xcite and with satellite space - based detectors @xcite ) . such kind of experiments have a high energy thresholds ( at eev energy range ) and are aimed to detection of highest energy neutrinos . target masses for neutrino interaction are at the level of giga - tons and higher providing with opportunity to detect weak neutrino fluxes .", "all the models for generation of uhe / ehe particles can be divided roughly by two main classes .    _ bottom - up _ models consider initially low energy particles which are accelerated up to uhe / ehe , typically , by shock waves propagating in accretion disks around black holes or along the extended jets emitted perpendicularly to the disk . neutrino are supposed to be produced in decays of mesons which are generated by interaction of accelerated particles with surrounding matter or photon fields . such models predict @xmath27 behavior of neutrino spectrum . by normalization of the neutrino flux to the known cosmic ray flux one can obtain an upper bound of @xmath30 gev@xmath31 @xmath32 s@xmath31 sr@xmath31 ( waxman - bahcall limit @xcite ) to the neutrino flux integrated over all possible sources or _ diffuse _ neutrino flux ( fig .

[ fig : amanda ] ) . the unique feature of amanda is that it continuously works in coincidence with surface air shower experiment spase @xcite which allow to calibrate the angular resolution . given a @xmath40 benchmark neutrino spectral shape , limits @xmath41 gev@xmath31 @xmath32 s@xmath31 sr@xmath31 and @xmath42 gev@xmath31 @xmath32 s@xmath31 sr@xmath31 are set on diffuse neutrino flux in the ranges 1pev@xmath393eev and 50tev@xmath395pev , respectively @xcite . estimated sensitivity to the point - like neutrino sources is at the level of expected neutrino fluxes from agns mrk421 and mrk501 @xcite , as well as from microquasar ss433 for a specific model @xcite . also results on atmospheric muons and neutrinos , wimp and magnetic monopoles search , search for supernovae bursts , primary cosmic ray composition have been published by the amanda collaboration @xcite .    as a next step of development of the neutrino observatory at the south pole creation of neutrino telescope with instrumented volume of 1km@xmath43 ( icecube ) is foreseen @xcite . it will consist of 4800 pmts deployed on 80 vertical strings ( each of 60 pmts ) at the depth from 1400 m to 2400 m . the distance between strings is 125 m , the distance between pmts along the strings 16 m . existing detector amanda - ii will be integrated to icecube . [ fig : icecube ] gives a schematic view of icecube and its position with respect to amanda - ii and the air shower array . deployment operations at the south pole will begin in late 2004 and detector will be completed by 2010 . with 45,000 atmospheric neutrinos recorded per year the ultimate sensitivity to an extraterrestrial @xmath40 neutrino flux after 3 years of data taking is @xmath44 gev@xmath31 @xmath32 s@xmath31 sr@xmath31 ( the first number refers to the 90% limit and the second one to the 5@xmath45 sensitivity ) . this is lower compared to waxman - bahcal and mannheim - protheroe - rachen upper bounds @xcite and to the most popular predictions on diffuse neutrino flux which are based on different models @xcite . nestor ( eutrino xtended ubmarine elescope with ceanographic esearch ) @xcite will be deployed in the mediterranean sea , near pylos ( greece ) at 4 km depth . it is planned to be tower based detector ( fig . [ fig : nestord ] ) . each tower consists of 12 hexagonal floors spaced by 30 m with 6 pairs of up - down looking 15@xmath36 pmts each . the diameter of the floor is 32 m . the effective area of the tower with respect to tev - range muons is about 0.02km@xmath46 . the nestor collaboration has passed through a long phase of site evaluation and technology tests . an 28 km electro - optical cable was put on the seafloor to connect the detector and shore station in 2000 and it was repaired in 2002 . in march , 2003 a prototype floor equipped with 12 pmts was deployed . over 5 millions of muon triggers were recorded during its operation . the antares project @xcite ( stronomy with a eutrino elescope and byss environmental earch ) was formed in 1996 . in 1996 - 99 an intense r&d program was performed . the deployment and recovery technologies , electronics and mechanical structures were developed and tested with more than 30 deployments of autonomous strings . the environmental properties at the detector site were investigated . antares r&d program culminated with deployment and 8 month operation of a 350 m length demonstrator string ( november 1999 - july 2000 ) instrumented with 7 pmts at a depth of 1100 m , 40 km off the coast of marseille . the string was controlled and read out via 37km - long electro - optical cable connected to the shore station . @xmath255@xmath4710@xmath48 seven - fold coincidences from atmospheric muons were recorded . the angular distribution of atmospheric muons was reproduced and the fraction of multi - muon events was found to be in agreement with expectation . after extensive r&d program the collaboration moved into construction of a 12-string detector in the mediterranean sea at 2400 m depth , @xmath2540 km off - shore of la seyne sur mer , near toulon ( 42@xmath2650@xmath49n , 6@xmath2610@xmath49e ) .    each string will be instrumented with 75 pmts housed in glass spheres ( see fig .  [ fig : antaresd ] ) . pmts are grouped in triplets at 25 levels separated by 14.5 m . 3 pmts in each triplet are oriented at 45@xmath26 to the nadir . strings are separated from each other by @xmath2570 m . all the strings are connected to a junction box ( jb ) by means of electro - optical link cables . the jb is connected to the shore station by a 50 km length 48-fiber electro - optical cable . undersea connections are performed with a manned submarine . the deployment of the detector is planned for 2005 - 2007 . the important milestones that have been achieved by the collaboration are :    * the electro - optical cable connecting detector and shore station was deployed in october 2001 ; * the industrial production of 900 oms started in april 2002 ; * since december 2002 the jb is in communication with the shore station ; * in december 2002 and february 2003 the prototype instrumentation string and the prototype detection string ( equipped with 15 oms ) were successfully deployed ( recovered in may and july , 2003 , respectively ) ; * in march 2003 both strings were connected to jb with the nautile manned submarine and data taking started .    the sensitivity of the detector to diffuse neutrino fluxes achieved by rejecting the background with an energy cut of @xmath5050gev allows to reach waxman - bahcall limit in 3 years . the antares sensitivity for point - like source searches ( 90% c.l . ) assuming @xmath51 differential @xmath52 flux is in the range 4@xmath5350@xmath4710@xmath54@xmath32s@xmath31 ( depending on the source declination ) after 1 year , which gives a real hope to detect a signal from the most promising sources . the deployment of the antares neutrino telescope can be considered as a step toward the creation of a 1 km@xmath55 detector in the mediterranean sea . nemo @xcite ( utrino subarine bservatory ) is an r&d project of the italian national institute for nuclear physics ( infn ) for 1km@xmath43 neutrino underwater telescope to be deployed in mediterranean sea near capo passero , sicily , at the depth of 3500 m where transparency and other water parameters are optimal . at the first stage ( 1998 - 2000 ) the nemo collaboration performed an intensive search program ( more than 20 sea campaigns ) to determine the optimal site for the future detector . also r&d program on materials , pmts and mechanical components of the detector were performed . at the second stage which started in 2002 , the advanced r&d and prototyping is done . the laboratory which is connected with test site of - shore catania by 28 km electro - optical cable is used for this purpose . the overall number of pmts in nemo detector may lay between 7000 and 10000 .", "_ _                    thus , during the next decade several 0.11.0 kilometer scale underwater ( ice ) cherenkov neutrino telescopes will be put into operation both in southern and north earth hemispheres being complemented by other technique detectors ( radio , acoustic , air showers ) . expected sensitivity of these detectors to extraterrestrial neutrino fluxes ( see fig .  [ fig : limit2 ] ) gives a hope to open a new era in uhe / ehe neutrino astronomy by detection of high energy neutrino signal . both discovering and _ not _ discovering of extraterrestrial uhe / ehe neutrinos will help to solve one of the oldest astrophysical puzzle - _ origin of highest energy cosmic rays_. but hopefully , it will also lead to discovery of new unexpected phenomena and setting new puzzles that will have to be solved with next generation detectors and next generation of scientists . j.  g.  learned , s.  pakvasa , astropart . phys .  * 3 * ( 1995 ) 267 [ hep - ph/9405296 ] ; j.  f.  beacom _ et al . _ , phys . * d68 * ( 2003 ) 093005 [ hep - ph/0307025 ] ; e.  v.  bugaev _ et al . _ , astropart . * 21 * ( 2004 ) 491 [ hep - ph/0312295 ] . s.  argiro _ et al . _ , nucl . * 125 * ( 2003 ) 230 ; m.  sasaki and m.  jobashi , astro - ph/0204167 ; r.  baltrusaitis _ et al . _ , * d31 * ( 1985 ) 2192 ; s.  yoshida _ et al . _ , in proceedings of 27th icrc ( 2001 ) 1142 . l.  b.  bezrukov _ et al . _ , sov . j.  nucl .

{"id": "1009.0450", "section_names": ["introduction", "data", "analysis", "results", "discussion"], "document": ["we have extended the search of @xcite for periodicities in the intensities of x - ray sources using light curves produced by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ all - sky monitor ( asm ) . @xcite analyzed data accumulated during the first 8.5 years of the mission and detected 41 periodicities and 5 possible periodicities or quasiperiodicities . two of the periodicities detected in their search likely represent neutron star spin and @xmath1 represent the precession of tilted accretion disks or other phenomena that produce superorbital periods . the 33 other periodicities are believed to represent evidence of the orbital motion of a close - binary star system . most of the orbital periods were associated with high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) where the normal type star is either a supergiant or a be star . eight of the periodicities were associated with the orbital periods of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , and one was associated with a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) . the search of @xcite was one of the most comprehensive searches for periodicities in the range of hours to years in the x - ray intensities of the bright galactic x - ray sources . however , relatively few new periods were found in the course of the search in spite of the conventional wisdom that nearly all of the bright galactic sources are accreting binaries with periods in the range of sensitivity of the search . the orbital periods of many galactic sources are still not determined , and so searches for evidence of these presently unknown orbital periods remain of interest . the present search improves on the sensitivity achieved in the earlier search through the analysis of light curves obtained over a longer course of time , i.e. nearly 14 years as opposed to 8.5 years , and through two major changes in the analysis techniques . we have also analyzed subintervals of the mission - long data sets . a preliminary report of the results of this work was presented in @xcite .", "the asm consists of three scanning shadow cameras ( sscs ) mounted on a rotating drive assembly @xcite . each ssc acts as a coded - aperture camera and comprises a position - sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) that detects x - ray photons and provides one - dimension position information via the charge - division technique . the entrance window of each pspc has a total geometric area of about 68 @xmath2 . a mask that is perforated with a pseudorandom pattern of open slits is held 30 cm above the pspc entrance window . the mask open fraction is close to 50% . the field of view of each ssc is @xmath3 ( fwhm ) . the asm observations have almost entirely been made as series of 90-s exposures known as dwells . in each dwell the aspect of the assembly of sscs is held fixed . for each exposure , a coded - aperture analysis of the data from each ssc yields intensity estimates of the sources that are listed in a catalog ( hereafter the asm catalog ) and that fall within that ssc s field of view . the intensity estimates are derived for each of four spectral bands which nominally correspond to photon energy ranges of 1.5 - 3 , 3 - 5 , 5 - 12 , and 1.5 - 12 kev and typically achieve a sensitivity of a few ssc counts s@xmath4 ( the crab nebula produces intensities of 27 , 23 , 25 , and 75 ssc counts s@xmath4 in the 4 bands , respectively ) . any given source has been viewed in a large number , e.g. , 30,000 to 100,000 , of the 90-s exposures over the @xmath0 years of operation of the asm . each exposure generally yields intensity estimates for the four spectral bands . the present search has been carried out , except where otherwise noted , using the asm data acquired from the beginning of operations in early 1996 through 2010 january 28 ( mjd 55224 ; modified julian date = julian date @xmath5 2,400,000.5 ) . the coded - aperture analysis is applied to all asm observations . the results are sorted source - by - source , filtered , and used to construct light curve files for each of 571 potential sources for each of the four energy bands . the intensity measurements contained in these files are the input data for the present periodicity search . the instrument properties have changed over the 14 years of operation in orbit because of at least three effects . first , the gain of ssc 1 ( of sscs 1 - 3 ) increased at about 10% per year for the first 13 years or so because of a leak in the counter entrance window ( the rate of increase appears to have moderated in year 14 ) . this has resulted , first , in progressive reductions in the effective sensitivity of ssc 1 in the 5 - 12 kev band and , recently , to some extent in the 3 - 5 kev band because in the last few years the pulse heights of higher energy events are often saturated and thus unusable . the second of the effects is present because the one - dimensional position - sensing capability of the proportional counters is based on the charge - division technique and the resistivity of carbon - coated quartz - fiber anodes . the process of event detection in the counters results in the redistribution or removal of the carbon . the resistivity of each anode thus evolves over time generally becoming larger and less uniform , and so the functions that relate charge ratio to position have changed over the course of the mission . third , in the last few years there is often a high background of events that have pulse heights that suggest that they are due to the detection of al k@xmath6 photons . we do not understand in detail why this is happening but we speculate that it may be due to leakage of ultraviolet radiation through the al - coated kapton thermal shields that are immediately above the coded mask plates . uv radiation would produce photoelectrons at the counter body surfaces that happen to be , by design of the instrument , at potentials of approximately @xmath7 kv . the photoelectrons would be accelerated toward and would hit , e.g. , the aluminum collimators that are near the ground potential . some fraction of the al k@xmath6 photons that would be produced by this process would then be detected .    both the gain changes and charge ratio to position calibration changes are accounted for in detail in the detector model used in our coded - aperture analysis . however , the calibrations are imperfect and the derived source intensities are therefore somewhat affected by systematic errors on both short and long time scales . the coded aperture analysis is also designed to eliminate the effects of backgrounds that are smooth and slowly - varying with regard to position in the detector ; this is largely but not entirely effective .", "searches for periodicities where large numbers of measurements are involved have generally proceeded by averaging the measured intensities in equally - spaced time bins , fourier transforming the resulting time series , producing a power density spectrum by taking the absolute square of the complex amplitude for each frequency , and searching for peaks in the power spectrum . our search largely follows this outline but we have implemented a few significant modifications as described below . in some searches for periodicities , a lomb - scargle periodogram ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) is used in place of a fourier transform , but , when large numbers of measurements and time bins are being analyzed , the differences between the two are not important except at extremely low frequencies . for the present analyses , the conventional discrete fourier transform is adequate so we do not make use of the lomb - scargle variation . we employ two unusual strategies with the goal of improving the search sensitivity . the first strategy involves the use of weights such as the reciprocals of the variances in fourier and other types of analysis since the individual asm measurements have a wide range of associated uncertainties . since in the present instance the amplitudes in the fourier transforms may be regarded as statistical averages , they may be better determined by the use of appropriate weights . this is discussed briefly in @xcite and at greater length in @xcite . these two reports also discuss the use of weights which involve the intrinsic source variability , but we do not use such weights in the work reported herein . the second strategy stems from the fact that the observations of the source are obtained with a low duty cycle , i.e. , the window function is sparse but nevertheless highly structured . the properties of the window function , in combination with the presence of slow variations of the source intensity , act to hinder the detection of variations on short time scales . the window function power density spectrum ( pds ) has substantial power at high frequencies , e.g. , 1 cycle d@xmath4 and 1 cycle per spacecraft orbit ( @xmath8 minute period ) . since the data may be regarded as the product of a ( hypothetical ) continuous set of source intensity measurements with the window function , a fourier transform of the data is equivalent to the convolution of a transform of a continuous set of intensity measurements with the window function transform . the high frequency structure in the window function transform acts to spread power at low frequencies in the source intensity to high frequencies in the calculated transform ( or , equivalently , the pds ) . this effectively raises the noise level at high frequencies . thus , in most of our analyses , a smoothed version of the light curve is subtracted from the binned data prior to the fourier analysis . the details of the analysis of each asm dwell - by - dwell light curve are as follows . the time of each intensity measurement was adjusted to approximately remove the effects of the motion of the earth around the solar system barycenter and the adjusted times were used to assign the measurements to equally - spaced time bins of duration 5 minutes ( 0.0034722 d ) or more . weights are used in averaging those measurements that fall into a given time bin . the @xmath9 measurements that fall into the time bin which is labelled by the index @xmath10 are denoted with index @xmath11 that runs from 1 to @xmath9 . we denote the @xmath11th measured source intensity in a time bin by @xmath12 and its associated 1-sigma uncertainty by @xmath13 . the averaging in this stage uses weights @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a selected weighting index ( see values in table  [ tbl : mthds ] ) . the weighted - average intensity in bin @xmath10 is then @xmath16 for convenience we denote the denominator of this expression by @xmath17 so that @xmath18 where it should be understood that @xmath19 for those time bins that contain no measurements . the @xmath17 s are used to weight the time bins in the subsequent analysis . lccc unwt & none & 2.0 & 0.0 + wt & none & 2.0 & 2.0 + ungs & gaussian & 2.0 & 0.0 + wtgs & gaussian & 2.0 & 2.0 + wtgs -

white appearance . the effect is strongest for the shortest smoothing time scale , i.e. , 0.3 days . it is not clear how to apply a threshold for detection of a periodicity in a nonwhite spectrum . therefore we added a procedure ( to the code that performs the compression described above ) to compute a `` background '' average power around each compressed frequency bin , and to then obtain whitened maximum values . each whitened maximum value is then the ratio of a maximum value in an unwhitened compressed spectrum to the corresponding background average . the resulting whitened spectra generally appear to have little systematic structure ( see fig . [ fig : whiten ] ) . table  [ tbl : mthds ] lists , at the highest level , the variations of the analysis method that we have used . we found that the results from the methods where both weighting and filtering were applied ( `` wtgs '' , `` wtgs - v4 '' , `` wtgs - v8 '' , and `` wtbx '' ) were almost always nearly equal or superior to the results obtained with the other methods ( `` unwt '' , `` wt '' , `` ungs '' ) . a typical , i.e. , not the extreme best case , of the differences is illustrated in figure  [ fig : pdscalc ] . therefore we did not search for significant peaks in the power spectra obtained using the latter methods . the `` wtgs '' , `` wtgs - v4 '' , `` wtgs - v8 '' , and `` wtbx '' methods were all applied to the 1.5 - 12 kev band light curves , but the results generally produced power spectra that were quite similar in terms of both detailed appearance and sensitivity . therefore only the `` wtgs '' method was applied to the other three energy bands . the results from the four energy bands are , in some cases , quite different from each other . table  [ tbl : tmscls ] lists smoothing time scales and the corresponding bin durations , parameters used for compression and whitening , and parameters used in searching for significant peaks . ccrrrcrr none & 2.0 & 1 & 300 & 3 & 0.0007 & 1.0 & 17.7 + 500.0 & 2.0 & 1 & 300 & 3 & 0.004 & 1.0 & 17.7 + 100.0 & 1.0 & 1 & 300 & 3 & 0.022 & 1.0 & 18.4 + 30.0 & 0.15 & 10 & 60 & 1 & 0.1 & 4.0 & 20.3 + 10.0 & 0.05 & 20 & 30 & 1 & 0.2 & 10.0 & 21.4 + 3.0 & 0.005 & 150 & 12 & 1 & 0.66 & 100.0 & 23.7 + 0.9 & 0.0034722222 & 300 & 6 & 1 & 2.2 & 144.0 & 24.1 + 0.3 & 0.0034722222 & 300 & 6 & 1 & 6.6 & 144.0 & 24.1        the powers in a spectrum of gaussian white noise are expected to be well characterized by an exponential probability distribution . we make the assumption that the powers in the whitened spectra computed as described above similarly follow an exponential distribution . in the present case it is not clear how to precisely compute the number of independent bins that we examined because 1 ) some of the power spectra for a given source involve the same data and differ only on account of slight variations in the analysis procedure , and 2 ) there is a significant degree of dependence among the powers in an oversampled power spectrum . although it is not fully justified on an a priori basis , we simply estimate the number of independent bins @xmath31 by the product of the number of frequency bins that would have applied if the fourier spectrum had not been oversampled , the number of energy bands analyzed ( 4 ; this neglects the non - independent bins among the four slightly different analyses of the 1.5 - 12 kev band ) , and the number of sources ( 571 ) . the neglect of the oversampling factor and the multiple similar analyses of the sum band does not appear to have led to significant underestimates of the detection thresholds , and , thus , this procedure appears to be justified . we have chosen a detection threshold @xmath32 for previously unknown periodicities to limit the expected number of false detections @xmath33 produced by statistical fluctuations ( based on the assumption that the powers are exponentially distributed ) in the power spectra calculated using a given smoothing time parameter . thus we have @xmath34 so that @xmath35 the values of @xmath32 are given in table  [ tbl : tmscls ] for @xmath36 .    as can be seen in figs . [ fig : whiten ] and [ fig : pdscalc ] , the window functions of the light curves often contain strong peaks at or close to particular frequencies . even though the analysis procedure tends to minimize the appearance of these frequencies in the whitened power spectra , there are occurrences of peaks at these frequencies . in the analyses done with filtering based on smoothing time scales of 10.0 days and under , we ignore all peaks in the frequency ranges @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 d@xmath4 . for the other analyses , we ignore all peaks in the frequency ranges @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 d@xmath4 . a substantial fraction of the 571 potential sources are extragalactic targets such as active galactic nuclei , extended galactic targets such as supernova remnants , or x - ray binaries that have been in quiescence since the beginning of the rxte mission and for which we have no expectation of finding detectable periodicities . the power spectra of these sources act effectively as controls that show the actual statistics of the power spectra and that bring attention to periodicities that must be the product of statistical fluctuations or artifacts . indeed , the search procedure described here was tailored in part by examination of the results on the `` controls '' . furthermore , since it would be difficult to understand the reality of peaks that exceed the detection threshold in the power spectra of these sources , the effective number of sources must be less than 571 . we have not adjusted the significance thresholds downward to account for this effect .    since we searched large numbers of bins , the thresholds for the detection of previously unreported periodicities given in table  [ tbl : tmscls ] when a periodicity has previously been reported , it may be confirmed even if the power at or very close to the previously reported frequency is below the threshold given in the table . uncompressed power density spectra are useful for precise estimation of the frequencies of the detected periodicities . since the uncompressed spectra were not saved in the original analysis for smoothing time scales less than or equal to 30.0 days , the analyses that produced the most significant detection of each periodicity were repeated , if necessary , and the resulting uncompressed spectra were saved . for each periodicity a small frequency range around the major peak was fit with a gaussian to obtain estimates of the central frequency , its uncertainty , and the peak width . the uncertainty in the frequency may be estimated based on the result of horne and baliunas ( 1986 ) that @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the length of the time interval covered by the light curve and @xmath53 is the peak power in a normalized pds . we also use the simple estimate @xmath54 which , in most cases , should be a conservative upper limit to the uncertainty ( but , if the periodicity persisted for only a fraction of the time covered by the light curve , the uncertainty could be larger than this value ) . in the estimates of frequencies and periods that we present below , the uncertainty derived using eq . ( 8) is given first and the uncertainty derived using eq . ( 9 ) is given second in square brackets .", "in the present search we find clear evidence of the periodicities in gro j1008@xmath557 and ss 433 that have been previously detected in the asm data but had not been detected in the analysis reported by @xcite . @xcite reported the detection of the 9.56-day period of 4u 2206 + 543 , but did not find evidence of variation with a period of @xmath55 days . such variation was first reported by @xcite . since we now find clear evidence of variation at the @xmath55-d period , we report its detection herein .    in the previous section , we noted that periodicities at previously identified frequencies can be found with better sensitivity than periodicities at undetermined frequencies . therefore we examined the power spectra for peaks at the frequencies corresponding to the periods listed in the catalogs of @xcite and @xcite and thereby identified evidence of the presence of a number of periodicities that were not found by @xcite . table  [ tbl : detect ] lists the periodicities that emerge from the present search that are not listed in tables 1 - 3 of @xcite . only one of these was , when first detected in the course of this search , previously unreported on the basis of optical or other x - ray observations , namely the 18.545-day periodicity in igr j18483@xmath50311 . the photon energy band , filter time scale , and method that yielded the most significant detection are given for each detected periodicity . the estimated frequencies and associated uncertainties are listed in table  [ tbl : detect ] with the exception of the very low frequencies of the sources gro j1008@xmath557 and 2s 1845@xmath5024 . the frequencies or , equivalently , periods of these latter sources are better obtained from epoch - folding analyses and even more precisely from pulse timing studies .    we give in table  [ tbl : ampl ] average source intensities , peak powers seen in the whitened and renormalized power spectra , and estimated average amplitudes of the detected periodic signals . the source names , photon energy bands , and periods are taken from table  [ tbl : detect ] . the estimated average amplitudes of the detected periodic signals were obtained by superposing sine waves onto the measured intensities in the appropriate light curves and redoing the complete analysis using the appropriate method , time scale , and energy band . the sine wave frequencies were chosen to yield peaks in the power spectrum close to , but not on top of , the frequencies of the detected signals . the sine wave amplitudes were chosen to give peak powers close to or above , within a factor of two , the peak powers of the detected signals . the results were then interpolated to estimate the amplitudes that would give rise to the peak powers of the detected signals . the uncertainty in the amplitude for a given source was estimated by the rms dispersion in the amplitudes obtained when sine waves were injected at four to ten different frequencies .    in the last column of table  [ tbl : ampl ] we give the ratio of the inferred average signal amplitude ( a ) to the weighted average source intensity ( i ) . this is an indicator of the fractional variation of the source intensity at the orbital frequency . it does not include the effects of harmonics which are detected in some of the power density spectra and should , therefore , be used only as a general indicator of the degree of modulation . llcccccc    2s0921@xmath5630 & x0921@xmath5630 & 1.5 - 12 & 30.0 & wtbx & 0.110994 ( 13 ;

the differences may be seen in the folded light curves . in this section we briefly discuss our results for each of the periodicities of the lmxbs listed in table  [ tbl : detect ] . the results in table  [ tbl : detect ] show that , with only one exception , the most significant detections of these systems were made in the overall 1.5 - 12 kev energy band . * 2s0921@xmath5630 * is a weak x - ray source in a low - mass system with a relatively long orbital period . photometry of the bright optical counterpart by @xcite and @xcite suggested that the observed variability could be periodic , but did not yield correct estimates of the actual period . x - ray observations with the _ exosat _ satellite showed intensity changes , interpreted as partial eclipses , that were key to obtaining the first relatively precise period estimate @xcite . recent optical observations have also yielded relatively precise estimates of the orbital period ; @xcite obtained @xmath57 d and @xcite obtained @xmath58 d. the orbital period is detected in the present study ; this is shown in the power spectrum plotted in fig .  [ fig : pds0921 ] . we derive an estimate of the orbital period of @xmath59 $ ] d ( see table  [ tbl : detect ] ) that is consistent with these recently reported values . @xcite and @xcite report further work on the binary parameters including the component masses . the folded asm light curves show that the periodic modulation has an amplitude of @xmath6030% relative to the average source strength . however , the average source intensity could be affected by systematic errors in the baseline level of order 0.1 ssc counts s@xmath4 ( 1.5 - 12 kev band ) . nonetheless , the modulation fraction must be rather large , and the periodicity may be easily detectable by other instruments .    630 . the `` wtbx '' method and a 30.0 day smoothing time scale were employed in producing the pds .

[ fig : pds1254 ] ) and derive a value for the period of @xmath64 $ ] h ( see table  [ tbl : detect ] ) . this value is close to that of @xcite but our estimate of the uncertainty is larger . we do not believe that the asm data alone warrant a more precise estimate of the orbital period than we have given . the `` wtgs - v4 '' method and a 3.0 day smoothing time scale were employed in producing the pds .

[ fig : pds1323 ] ) . we derive a value for the period of @xmath67 $ ] h ( see table  [ tbl : detect ] ) . it is interesting to compare this value with the conclusion of @xcite that consideration of the times of dips in two observations separated by one year imply that the period must be more precisely given by @xmath68 h. the ambiguity in this formula reflects an ambiguity in the number of orbital cycles in the one year interval between the observations . the present determination of the orbital period implies @xmath69 and that @xmath70 h where the uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty of the correction for @xmath69 . given that the difference between this period and the asm - derived value is only @xmath71 h and considering the uncertainties in the two measurements , we conclude that the two values are mutually consistent . recent studies of this source may be found in @xcite and @xcite . the `` wtgs '' method and a 3.0 day smoothing time scale were employed in producing the pds .

average intensities . column 7 of the table gives the effective upper limits on the amplitudes as fractions of the average source intensities . @xcite reported modest significance detections of periodicities in asm power density spectra for gro j1655@xmath540 , gx339@xmath54 , v4641 sgr , and 4u1957 + 115 at or very close to the periods previously reported in the literature . in the analyses using the entire asm light curves that we have done recently we do not confirm these possible detections . results of sensitivity analyses for these sources are included in table  [ tbl : uplim ] . table  [ tbl : uplim ] also includes entries for two bright sources , sco x-1 and 4u1735@xmath5444 , with well -

discovery with @xcite of the orbital period of this system . our detections of the orbital periods of 4u1636@xmath5536 and lmc x-1 are the first for these systems , to our knowledge , that have been accomplished on the basis of x - ray observations . it is interesting to compare the present list of detections together with those of @xcite with tables 1.1 and 1.3 of @xcite that list the well - established orbital periods of lmxbs and hmxbs as of 1994 or 1995 . table 1.1 of @xcite lists 32 lmxbs with known orbital periods . of these , seven have been in quiescence through the entire rxte mission and one ( cal 87 ) is a supersoft source that emits at energies below the asm band ; these systems would not be expected to yield periodicity detections in asm data . the periodicities of 17 of the remaining 24 systems have now been detected in the asm light curves if we include sco  x-1 per the results of @xcite even though its orbital period was not detected in the present study . seven systems that are detected by the asm by virtue of their intensities do not yield period detections in the present search . the asm periodicity searches have yielded clear detections of the orbital periods of 13 of the 16 systems listed in table 1.1 of @xcite that had , at that time , shown evidence of the orbital period in x - rays ( see column 5 therein ) . two of the remaining three systems have been in quiescence throughout the rxte mission . the last remaining system is cyg x-2 for which we find no evidence of the 9.8-d period even though it is rather bright in x - rays . table 1.3 of @xcite lists 24 hmxbs with known orbital periods . of these , only one ( x0535@xmath5668 ) has been in quiescence during the entire rxte mission . the orbital periodicities of 16 of the remaining 23 systems have been clearly detected in power density spectra of the asm light curves ; we do not count x0535 + 262 as a clear detection in the power spectrum . the periods of four of the systems ( x0115 + 634 , x0535 + 262 , gx304@xmath51 , and x1145@xmath5619 ) are apparent in the asm light curves as limited sequences of short transient outbursts that are separated by the orbital period or small multiples thereof . the hmxbs x1553 - 542 and x0331 + 530 are evident in the asm light curves during short transient outbursts , but the asm yields no evidence of their orbital periods . we also find no evidence of the 1.7-d period of lmc x-3 even though it detectable over most of the 14-year time of the rxte mission . not unexpectedly , we find that the amplitudes of the variations at the orbital period , when expressed as fractions of the average intensity , are typically low for lmxbs and high for hmxbs ( see tables  [ tbl : ampl ] and [ tbl : uplim ] ) . this is consistent with the relatively low rate of detections of orbital modulation in lmxbs and the high rate in hmxbs . there are some exceptions such as the high fractional modulation of the weak lmxb 2s0921@xmath5630 and the low degree of modulation of the hmxbs lmc x-1 and lmc x-3 . our results for 2s0921@xmath5630 suggest that there could be other weak lmxbs with fractional amplitudes that are not particularly low and that would not be difficult to detect with an instrument somewhat more sensitive than the asm . indeed , it is likely that the maxi instrument on the international space station @xcite will produce light curves useful for extending the search for periodicities in x -

functional codes capable of predicting quantum transport properties of complex systems is an increasingly active field of research@xcite . this is driven in part by the top - down scaling of the active elements within cmos devices , for which quantum effects are becoming important . it is also driven by the bottom - up demands of communities working on single - molecule electronics and low - dimensional systems , where structures and molecules of increasing size and complexity are of interest . in particular , multi - functional codes are needed to describe the fundamental properties of quasi - two - dimensional materials such as graphene , silicene , germanene and their integration into workable devices . the need to understand the interplay between all of the above structures and their surrounding environments creates further demands for such codes . at a more fundamental level , over the past forty years , a standard model of electron transport has been developed , based on computing the scattering matrix of quantum systems connected to external sources and there is a need for a universal code which describes the many realizations of such systems under a common umbrella . a key task of any quantum transport code is to start from the hamiltonian describing a system and calculate the quantum - mechanical scattering matrix @xmath0 , from which a wide range of measurable quantities can be predicted . unfortunately for most nanoscale systems of interest , the full many - body atomistic hamiltonian is too complex to allow this task to be completed and therefore one usually resorts to a description based on a mean - field hamiltonian . the system of interest is then composed of a scattering region , connected to external crystalline leads , which are in turn connected to external reservoirs . the problem of computing the scattering matrix for such a system described by an arbitrary mean - field hamiltonian is solved in reference @xcite . the main question therefore is how to obtain the correct mean - field hamiltonian . the simplest mean - field approach to describing quantum transport through nanostructures is to build a tight - binding hamiltonian , which reproduces key electronic properties near the fermi energy . this approach has been available for more than half a century and is still popular today when describing generic properties of materials such as graphene@xcite . tight binding parameters can be obtained by fitting to known band structures and then varied spatially to describe external fields and other perturbations . however such an approach does not easily capture the effects of interfaces between different materials or edge terminations of finite - size systems , whose properties are distinct from those of bulk materials . nor does it easily describe finite - voltage effects . to capture these additional features of inhomogeneous systems , a more material - specific approach is needed . this problem was solved in part by the non - equilibrium green s function technique@xcite , that combines with density functional theory ( dft)@xcite to obtain the self - consistent mean - field hamiltonian of the system subject to a finite bias voltage and from it , the lesser green s functions providing the non - equilibrium electronic density and current . this approach is utilized within the smeagol code@xcite , which was the first to describe spin - dependent and finite - voltage transport properties of systems with inhomogeneous magnetic moments and in the presence of spin - orbit scattering . it is almost 10 years since the release of smeagol and during this period , we have developed a new code with increased speed , versatility and functionality , which is particularly suited to the modeling of larger - scale nanostructures , interacting with their environments . this new code is called gollum and will be freely available from _ http://www.physics.lancs.ac.uk/gollum _ within the coming weeks . our previous experience in the development of smeagol@xcite allowed us to understand that non - equilibrium transport codes are quite difficult to handle , in part because of their complex input data structures , which can create a steep learning curve , and also because they carry very heavy computational demands . as a consequence , we have devised the new code gollum to be more user friendly , with simple and easy to understand input and output structures , and having no accuracy parameters to tune . we present now a short summary of the features and functionalities of the two programs to better appreciate its differences . smeagol is a negf program that computes the charge and spin transport properties of two - terminal junctions subject to a finite voltage bias . smeagol can not read a user - defined tight - binding hamiltonian . instead , it reads the mean - field hamiltonian from the program siesta@xcite and is tightly bound to the old versions of it . smeagol can read from siesta hamiltonians carrying non - collinear spin arrangements as well as the spin - orbit interaction . siesta and smeagol have indeed been used successfully to simulate the magnetic anisotropies of atomic clusters@xcite and the spin transport functionalities of several atomic chains and molecular junctions subjected to strong spin - orbit interaction@xcite . however , smeagol does not profit from other recent density functionals . examples are the van der waals family of functionals or those based on the lda+u approach . gollum is a program that computes the charge and spin , and the electronic contribution to the thermal transport properties of multi - terminal junctions . in contrast to negf codes , gollum is based on equilibrium transport theory , which means that it has a simpler structure , it is faster and consumes less memory . the program has been designed for user - friendliness and takes a considerable leap towards the realization of ab initio multi - scale simulations of conventional and more sophisticated transport functionalities . the simpler interface of gollum allows it to read model tight - binding hamiltonians . furthermore , gollum has been designed to interface easily with any dft code that uses a localized basis set . it currently reads information from all the latest public flavors of the codes siesta@xcite and fireball@xcite . these include functionals that handle the spin - orbit or the van der waals interactions , or that include strong correlations in the spirit of the lda+u approach . plans to generate interfaces to other codes are underway . two- and three - dimensional topological materials display fascinating spin transport properties . gollum can simulate junctions made of these materials either using parametrized tight - binding hamiltonians@xcite , or dft@xcite . dft does not handle correctly strong electronic correlation effects , that are inherent many nano - scale electrical junctions . as a consequence , a number of negf programs like smeagol underestimate such effects . gollum includes several tools to handle strong correlations . these include the above - mentioned interface to the versions of siesta containing the lda+u functional . a second tool uses a phenomenological but effective approach called the scissors correction scheme . a third tool maps the dft hamiltonian into an anderson - like hamiltonian that is handled with an impurity solver in the spirit of dynamical mean field theory . the lighter computational demands required by gollum make it possible to construct conductance statistics relevant to break - junction and stm measurements of single - molecule conductances , therefore making closer contact with experiments . gollum also incorporates an interface with some classical molecular dynamics programs , which enables it to handle interactions with the environment . gollum makes use of the concept of _ virtual leads _ , that allows it to integrate easily a wide range of phenomena by the use of tight - binding hamiltonians . these include spintronics , superconductivity , kondo physics and topological phases . in contrast with smeagol , which only computes the magnitudes of transmission coefficients of two - terminal junctions , gollum has access to the full scattering matrix of a multi - terminal junction , enabling it to compute scattering amplitudes , phases and wigner delay times and thereby describe the properties of quantum pumps . even though gollum is based on equilibrium transport theory , our experience with the use of the negf code smeagol has enabled us to incorporate non - equilibrium physics into the mean - field hamiltonian . gollum has therefore the ability to compute non - equilibrium current - voltage curves .    in this article , our aim is to describe the structure of the code and then present a set of demonstrator calculations . the latter will illustrate the additional functionality and versatility of gollum and at the same time constitute a set of new results for the transport properties of selected structures . all of the functionalities that will be discussed below are available either in the current public version of the code , or in the current development version , that will be made public in the autumn of 2014 . the layout of this article is as follows . in section ii , we describe the theoretical approach behind the program and outline the theoretical and practical details of the current implementation . the section starts with a detailed description of the generic two - probe and multi - probe junction setups available within gollum and introduces the terminology that will be used throughout the article . this is followed by subsections describing the determination of the surface green s function of each current - carrying lead and the full scattering matrix . we then introduce a convenient method that allows us to describe finite - voltage non - equilibrium effects . a subsection explaining the concept of virtual leads enables us to describe hybrid structures containing non - collinear magnetism or superconductivity within the scattering region . two additional subsections explain two facilities included in gollum that enable us to describe electronic correlation effects beyond dft , including coulomb blockade and kondo physics . we then show how to include a gauge field in the gollum hamiltonian . a final subsection explains the multi - scale methodology used to describe large - scale junctions and environmental effects , using a combination of classical molecular dynamics for the environment and quantum transport for the central scattering region .    in section iii , we present the details and results of the simulations of a series of sixteen different demonstrator systems . the purpose of each demonstrator is to present one or more of the functionalities of gollum . we start with a few model junctions , described by tight - binding hamiltonians , which show basic capabilities and demonstrate how easily and flexibly the program can analyze non - trivial physical effects . these include two and four - terminal normal - metal junctions , a two - dimensional system showing the quantum hall effect , and two hybrid structures , the first containing two superconducting islands sandwiched by two normal metal electrodes , and the second containing a non - collinear spin structure . there follow a series of dft - based calculations , that describe spin - active junctions ; graphene junctions , where the use of van der waals functionals is crucial and junctions enclosing metallo - organic molecules , where a treatment of strong - correlations beyond dft is mandatory . these are handled using three different approaches . in the first , the properties of metalloporphyrin junctions are described using the lda+u methodology ; in the second , the lda spectrum of an ope derivative is adjusted to improve the agreement with experimental data ; in the third , we describe coulomb blockade and kondo features of model or simple gold junctions . the next demonstrator shows how gollum can compute the thermoelectric transport properties of a junction.this is followed by a discussion of the transport properties of a carbon - nanotube - based four - probe junction . the next three examples require the use of multi - scale techniques , where we use a three - step methodology described later in the article . the first demonstrator describes how liquid environmental effects modify the transport properties of a single - molecule junction . the second example demonstrates that single strands of dna can be trans - located though graphene nanopores , where the strands effectively gate the nanopore structure yielding a highly sensitive dna sensor based on field - effect - transistor concepts . a final demonstrator shows how gollum can compute full sequences of pulling and pushing cycles in single - molecule junctions resembling the opening and closing cycles of mechanically controllable break junction ( mcbj ) experiments , enabling the construction of theoretical conductance histograms . the final demonstrator shows how gollum has access to the phase of the full scattering matrix , and describes non - trivial quantum pumping effects related to the phase evolution of the scattered wave function . a concluding section summarizes the features delivered by the program and an appendix illustrates our method to decimate hamiltonians and overlap matrices .", "gollum describes open systems comprising an extended scattering region ( colored dark blue in figs . 1 and 2 ) connected to external crystalline leads ( colored light blue in figs . 1 and 2 ) . depending on the problem of interest and the language used to describe the system , the material ( m ) of interest forming the central part of the scattering region could comprise a single molecule , a quantum dot , a mesoscopic cavity , a carbon nanotube , a two - dimensional mono- or multi - layered material , a magneto - resistive element or a region containing one or more superconductors . figure 1 shows an example of a 4-lead system whose central scattering region ( generically labelled m throughout the paper ) is a molecule . it is important to note that in an accurate ab initio description of such a structure , the properties of the leads closest to the molecule ( or more generally the central scattering material ) will be modified by the presence of the central scattering region ( m ) and by the fact that the leads terminate . in what follows , we refer to those affected portions of the leads closest to the central scatterer as branches and include them as part of the extended scatterer ( denoted em throughout this article ) . consequently within gollum , a typical structure consists of an extended scatterer ( em ) , formed from both the central scatterer ( m ) and the branches . the extended scattering region is connected to crystalline current - carrying leads of constant cross - section , shown in light blue in the figs . 1 and 2 . for an accurate description of a given system , the branches are chosen to be long enough such that they join smoothly with the ( light blue ) crystalline leads . crucially , the properties of this interface region between the central scatterer m and the leads are determined by their mutual interaction and are not properties of either m or the electrodes alone .    , where @xmath1 is an applied bias . ( bottom ) each lead is composed of an infinite chain of identical pl with hamiltonian @xmath2 coupled with each other via coupling hamiltonians @xmath3 . the extended scattering region comprises the actual central scattering region and several pl in each branch up to the tpl . the tpl connect the em region to the leads . the central scattering region consists in this example of the electrodes surfaces and a molecule . ] 2 shows a two - terminal device in more detail and introduces further terminology to be used throughout the paper . the regions in light blue are called electrodes or leads and are described by perfect periodic hamiltonians subject to chosen chemical potentials . each lead @xmath4 is formed by a semi - infinite series of identical layers of constant cross section , which we refer to as principal layers ( pls ) . 2 shows only two pls per lead ( colored white ) , although an infinite number is implied . furthermore in the figure , the leads are identical and therefore the lead index @xmath4 has been dropped . these pls are described mathematically by intra - layer hamiltonians @xmath5 . pls must be chosen so that they are coupled only to their nearest neighbors by the hamiltonians @xmath6 , which means that in the presence of long - range couplings , a pl may contain more than one longitudinal unit cell of the lead . then , if each pl contains @xmath7 orbitals , then @xmath5 and @xmath6 are square @xmath8 matrices . the extended scatterer ( em ) in dark blue is composed of a central scattering region ( m ) and branches . each branch contain several pls . these pls have an identical atomic arrangement as the pls in the leads . however , their hamiltonians differ from @xmath5 and @xmath6 due to the presence of the central scattering region . pl numbering at each branch starts at the pl beside the central scattering region . the outermost pl at each branch of the em region is called the terminating principal layer ( tpl ) and must be described by hamiltonians @xmath9 and @xmath10 which are close enough to @xmath5 and @xmath6 , to match smoothly with the corresponding lead hamiltonian . for this reason , gollum requires that the em contain at the very least one pl . the central scatterer ( m ) itself is described by an intra - scatterer hamiltonian @xmath11 and coupling matrices to the closest pls of the branches . in the example in fig . 2 , the central scattering region m comprises a molecule and the atoms forming the electrode surfaces . the surfaces in gollum include all atoms belonging to the electrodes whose atomic arrangements can not be cast exactly as a pl , due to surface reconstructions , etc . for simplicity , fig . 2 shows the case of a symmetric system , although no such symmetries are imposed by gollum . all hamiltonians are spin- dependent , but again for notational simplicity , the spin index @xmath12 will not be written explicitly here . this means that the hamiltonian @xmath13 for a given lead @xmath4 can be written as the semi - infinite matrix : @xmath14 when using a non - orthogonal basis set , overlap matrices must be defined with the same structure as the hamiltonian matrices : @xmath15 and @xmath16 . it is convenient to introduce the notation @xmath17 for notational simplicity , from now we will consider the case where all leads are equal so that the super - index @xmath4 can be omitted , although gollum imposes no such restrictions . the program can assume either open or periodic boundary conditions in the plane perpendicular to the transport direction . in this last case , unit cells are chosen in the plane perpendicular to the transport direction and the hamiltonians and overlap matrices acquire a specific dependence on the transverse k - vector , @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 label the @xmath22 orbitals in the unit cell ( ie pl ) at the origin of @xmath23 , while @xmath24 denote orbitals equivalent to @xmath21 , but placed in adjacent unit cells located at transverse positions @xmath23 . for @xmath25 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 must belong to the same pl @xmath26 , while for @xmath27 , @xmath24 must belong to the pl @xmath28 . finally @xmath23 are vectors in the two - dimensional bravais lattice , joining the unit cell taken as origin with its neighboring unit cells .    to illustrate how an em is connected to leads , we now consider the 4-lead example of fig.1 , where we assume that the tpl is the third pl in each branch . to describe such a multi - terminal setup , the hamiltonian matrix @xmath29 of the em is arranged in a non - conventional way . the first matrix block corresponds to the central scattering region @xmath30 , the second matrix block corresponds to the pls in the em branch connecting to lead 1 , the third matrix block to the pls in the em branch connecting to lead 2 , and so on . @xmath31    finally , the em described by @xmath29 and the leads described by @xmath32 are coupled via matrices @xmath33 to yield a four - terminal junction described by the infinite matrix : @xmath34    where , @xmath35 couple @xmath29 and for example , @xmath36 this arrangement of the hamiltonian enables the straightforward generalization of the approach to an arbitrary number of leads . the transport properties of the junction are encapsulated in its scattering matrix @xmath37 , which can be obtained by computing the green s function of the whole junction @xmath38 by solving the infinite system of equations @xmath39 this equation can be simplified by replacing the semi - infinite lead greens functions @xmath40 by their surface green s functions @xmath41 , whose dimensions are @xmath42 . the remaining system of equations takes the form    @xmath43    where the coupling hamiltonians are now @xmath44 and the surface green s functions of the isolated leads @xmath45 can be obtained as described in section ii.a.3 below . the equation for the full green s function can be written in a more compact form as    @xmath46    the scattering matrix can be computed using the green s functions matrix elements @xmath47 connecting the different leads , which can be obtained by inverting only the upper matrix box in eq . ( [ gf ] ) @xmath48 in contrast , access to the local electronic and current densities at the em region is obtained from @xmath49    the above expressions for the hamiltonians are very general . any appropriate tight - binding hamiltonian could be introduced by hand to allow computation of the transport properties of a parametrized model . alternatively , any dft code using localized basis sets can provide them . in this case the dft program produces the hamiltonians and fermi energy of the em region @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and of each lead @xmath53 , @xmath15 and @xmath54 in separate runs . gollum has an interface to the latest versions of the dft program siesta ( siesta 3.1 , siesta vdw and siesta lda+u ) and of fireball and more interfaces will be developed in the future . spin degrees of freedom in spin - active systems are handled as follows : if the spins are all collinear , then we compute separate hamiltonians and perform separate transport calculations for the spin - up and -down degrees of freedom . however , if the junction has non - collinear spins or is subject to spin - orbit interactions@xcite , then the spin - up and down - degrees of freedom are regarded as two distinct sets of orbitals in the hamiltonian , whose distinct labels allow the computation of spin - currents or magneto - resistive behaviors . ( color online ) infinite system used to generate the leads hamiltonians @xmath55 and @xmath56 . a positive direction is defined to be towards the scatterer . ] each of the lead green s functions @xmath45 is determined following the procedures described in refs . [ ] with some minor modifications . to do so , we start by associating to each semi - infinite lead @xmath4 a periodic infinite system , whose unit cell contains a single pl , as sketched in fig . ( [ fig : lead - generation ] ) . @xmath55 and @xmath56 can then be created for this infinite system by hand as model hamiltonians , or can be generated by a dft program in a dedicated simulation . notice that we will drop the @xmath4 super - index until the end of the section for simplicity .    by expanding the bloch eigenstates of the infinite system in a localized basis set @xmath57 where @xmath26 , @xmath20 are indices for its unit cells and the orbitals within them , and @xmath58 is a dimensionless , longitudinal bloch wave - vector , the following secular @xmath42 equation can be deduced @xmath59 where the column vector @xmath60 contains the wave - function coefficients @xmath61 . the above equation is usually solved by choosing a wave vector @xmath58 and solving for the eigen - energies and the corresponding eigenvectors . however , in the present transport problem , we do the opposite : we choose the energy @xmath62 and solve for the allowed wave vectors and corresponding eigenstates . for a given energy @xmath62 , the above equation has @xmath63 solutions with either real or complex wave vectors @xmath64 , @xmath65 . to obtain the latter , the equation can be recast as @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the @xmath42 identity and zero matrices , @xmath69 and @xmath70 is a n - component column vector . gollum solves equation ( [ gep ] ) as it is superior in numerical terms to equation ( [ gep1 ] ) . we compute the group velocities of the states corresponding to real wave vectors as @xmath71 note that @xmath72 has units of energy and therefore the real , fully - dimensioned group velocity is @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the spacing between neighboring pls in a given lead . we now divide the @xmath63 wave vectors obtained from eq . ( [ gep ] ) into two sets , each containing n values.the first set denoted \\{@xmath64 } are real ( complex ) wave vectors that have @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) and therefore propagate propagate ( decay ) to the right of the figure . they are consequently called positive open ( closed ) channels . the second set denoted \\{@xmath77 } are real ( complex ) wave - vectors that have @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) propagate ( decay ) to the left of the figure . they are called negative open ( closed ) channels . we introduce the dual vectors @xmath80 , @xmath81 , which satisfy @xmath82 and @xmath83 . these can be found by inverting the @xmath42 matrices @xmath84 the above eigenvectors can be used to construct the following transfer matrices @xmath85 these transfer matrices allow us to build the coupling matrix @xmath1 , the self - energies @xmath86 , and the surface green s functions @xmath45 : @xmath87    the procedure described above to compute the lead green s functions can fail , because of the singular behavior of the hamiltonians matrices @xmath27 , which lead to numerical inaccuracies in the solution of eq . ( [ gep ] ) , and is usually manifested in the program producing a number of positive and negative channels different from @xmath22 . notice that if the number of positive and negative channels is different from @xmath22 , then the dual vectors can not be found by inverting @xmath88 and @xmath89 . there exist several schemes to regularize @xmath27 , based on decimating out the offending degrees of freedom . these procedures are explained in detail in refs . [ ] . gollum uses a suitable adaptation of these methods , which is described in the appendix . ( color online ) infinite system whose unit cell is the em region . this is linked to neighboring em cells by periodic boundary conditions . ] ( color online ) super cell containing the extended scattering region em . the em region is surrounded by buffer vacuum regions to its left and right . ] as noted above , @xmath90 can be provided as a model hamiltonian , or generated by a dft or other material - specific program . one of the strengths of gollum is an ability to treat interfaces with high accuracy . in a tight - binding description , tight - binding parameters of a particular material are often chosen by fitting to a band structure . however this does not solve the problem of choosing parameters to describe the interface between two materials . often this problem is finessed by choosing interface parameters to be a combination of pure - material parameters such as an arithmetic or geometric mean , but there is no fundamental justification for such approximations . therefore we describe here methods to generate @xmath90 using a dft program , where the inclusion of branches as part of the extended scatterer occurs naturally . ( [ fig : em1 ] ) shows an example of a junction where the electrodes are identical . the system is composed of super cells formed from a central scatterer and pls . there are periodic boundary conditions in the longitudinal direction , such that the tpl of one branch of a super - cell is linked smoothly to the tpl of a neighboring super - cell . running a dft program for such a super - cell then automatically generates @xmath90 . provided the super cells contain sufficient pls , the hamiltonians @xmath91 and @xmath92 associated with the tpls will be almost identical to those generated from a calculation involving an infinite periodic lead . if the hamiltonians @xmath25 and @xmath27 associated with the pls are generated from a calculation involving an infinite periodic lead , then provided the super cells contain sufficient pls , these will be almost identical to @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively . in this case then there will be minimal scattering caused by the junction between the tpl and the lead . clearly there is a trade - off between accuracy and cpu time , because inserting more pls increases the size and cost of the calculation . in practice , the number of pls retained in such a super - cell is increased in stages until the results do not change significantly as the number of pls is increased further . there exist situations where the electrodes are dissimilar , either chemically , or because of their different crystalline structure , or because their magnetic moments are not aligned . in these cases , there can not be a smooth matching between tpls of neighboring super cells in fig . 4 . to address this situation , we use a setup similar to that displayed in fig . ( [ fig : em2 ] ) , where additional pls are appended to the branches in the em region . these additional pls are terminated by artificial surfaces and surrounded by vacuum . the tpls are then chosen to be one of the pls near the middle of each branch and should be surrounded by enough pls both towards its artificial surface and towards the central scattering region . then the pls placed between the tpl and the artificial surface are discarded . these sacrificial pls ensure that the chosen tpl is unaffected by the presence of the artificial vacuum boundary . clearly , calculations of this sort are more expensive in numerical terms than those performed with super cells generated as in fig . ( [ fig : em1 ] ) , because they contain many more atoms .      in an ab initio calculation of the transport properties of a junction , the dft program produces the hamiltonians and fermi energy of the em region @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath93 , and of each lead @xmath53 , @xmath15 and @xmath54 in separate runs . notice that the hartree potential is defined up to a constant , which is usually different for the em and for each lead this usually means that the energy origin of the em and of the corresponding lead pls , as well as their fermi energies do not agree with each other , so eq . ( 2 ) must be rewritten as follows : @xmath94 where we have referred the energy of each lead to its own fermi energy . to fix the hamiltonian mismatch we define a realignment variable for each lead as follows : @xmath95 where @xmath20 indicates a relevant orbital or group of orbitals . then , the hamiltonian of each lead is realigned with that of the em @xmath96 it turns out that the renormalized @xmath97 and bare @xmath54 fermi energies of each lead do not match perfectly with each other if the number of pls in the em region is not sufficiently large . this is the case when for efficiency reasons , it is desirable to artificially minimize the size of the em . sometimes it is advisable to choose the fermi energy of one of the leads @xmath98 as the reference energy . in this case , a second overall shift can be performed using either @xmath99 or the quantity @xmath100 . we note that the most general scattering state in a given lead @xmath4 at a given energy @xmath62 can be written as a linear combination of open and closed channels as follows @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 denote here open positive and negative channels and @xmath104 and @xmath105 are their normalized kets . here , the contribution of all the closed channels in lead @xmath4 is described by the ket @xmath106 . consequently , the number of electrons per unit time flowing between two adjacent pls within the lead is @xmath107 we pick in this section the convention that positive direction in the lead means flow towards the em region and vice versa . so positive ( negative ) open channels are also called incoming ( outgoing ) channels of lead @xmath4 . with this notation . the wave - function coefficients of the incoming open channels of a given lead are determined by the properties of the reservoir connected to the lead . the wave function coefficients of the open outgoing channels of lead @xmath4 are obtained from the amplitudes of all incoming channels by @xmath108 where @xmath103 ( @xmath109 ) is an outgoing ( incoming ) dimensionless wave - vector of lead @xmath4  ( @xmath110 ) . it is therefore convenient to assemble the wave - functions of the @xmath111 outgoing and @xmath111 incoming open channels of a given lead @xmath4 in the column vectors @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and all the scattering matrix elements connecting leads @xmath4 and @xmath110 into the matrix block @xmath114 . notice that the dimensions of @xmath114 are @xmath115 . then the above equation can be written more compactly as @xmath116    by normalizing the bloch eigenvectors @xmath60 , @xmath117 and their duals to unit flux , @xmath118 the matrix elements of the scattering matrix block connecting leads @xmath4 and @xmath110 can be written as . @xmath119 here @xmath120 is the off - diagonal block of the surface green s function defined in eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) , that connects leads @xmath4 and @xmath110 and @xmath121 is the matrix defined in eq . ( 20 ) .    with the above notation , if the incoming channel @xmath102 of lead @xmath4 is occupied with probability @xmath122 ( ie if in eq . ( [ ok ] ) , @xmath123 with probability @xmath122 ) then the number of electrons per unit time , entering the scattering region from reservoir @xmath4 along channel @xmath102 with energy between @xmath62 and @xmath124 is @xmath125 and the number per unit time , per unit energy leaving the scatterer and entering reservoir @xmath4 along channel @xmath126 with energy between @xmath62 and @xmath124 is @xmath127    in many cases , the incoming and outgoing channels of each lead @xmath4 can be grouped into channels possessing particular attributes ( ie quantum numbers ) labeled @xmath128 etc . this occurs when all incoming channels of a particular type @xmath129 in lead @xmath4 possess the same occupation probability @xmath130 . for example , all quasi - particles of type @xmath129 in reservoir @xmath4 may possess a common chemical potential @xmath131 and @xmath132 may take the form @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the fermi function . in this case , if the incoming and outgoing channels of type @xmath129 belonging to lead @xmath4 possess wave - vectors @xmath135 , @xmath136 , then the number of quasi - particles per unit time of type @xmath129 leaving reservoir @xmath4 with energy between @xmath62 and @xmath124 is    @xmath137    where @xmath138 and @xmath139 is the number of open incoming channels of type @xmath140 , energy @xmath62 in lead @xmath4 . note that in the above summation , @xmath141 runs over all outgoing wave - vectors of energy @xmath62 and type @xmath129 of lead @xmath4 and @xmath142 runs over all incoming wave - vectors of energy @xmath62 and type @xmath143 in lead @xmath110 . if @xmath4 and @xmath110 are different leads , then @xmath144 is often called the transmission amplitude and denoted @xmath145 , while if they are the same lead , then @xmath146 is called the reflection amplitude @xmath147 . similarly , for @xmath148 , it is common to define the transmission coefficient @xmath149 as @xmath150 and for @xmath151 , we define the reflection coefficient as @xmath152 so that @xmath153f^i_{\\beta_i}(e ) \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\sum _ { { j\\ne i},{\\beta_j}}t^{i , j}_{\\alpha_i,\\beta_j } f^j_{\\beta_j}(e)\\}\\label{x1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that unitarity of the scattering matrix requires @xmath154    hence the sum of the elements of each row and column of the matrix @xmath155 is zero : @xmath156 or equivalently , @xmath157 and @xmath158    from eqs . ( [ x1 ] ) and ( [ x3 ] ) , if @xmath159 is independent of @xmath110 and @xmath143 then @xmath160 for all @xmath4 and @xmath129 , as expected . for this reason , in the above equations , @xmath159 can be replaced by @xmath161 , where @xmath134 is an arbitrary function of energy , which in practice is usually chosen to be a fermi function , evaluated at a convenient reference temperature and chemical potential . when comparing theory with experiment , we are usually interested in computing the flux of some quantity @xmath88 from a particular reservoir . from eq . ( [ xxx ] ) , if the amount of @xmath88 carried by quasi - particles of type @xmath129 is @xmath162 , then the flux of @xmath88 from reservoir @xmath4 is @xmath163 in the simplest case of a normal conductor , choosing @xmath164 , independent of @xmath129 , the above equation yields the electrical current from lead @xmath4 . within gollum @xmath129 may represent spin and in the presence of superconductivity may represent hole ( @xmath165 ) or particle ( @xmath166 ) degrees of freedom . in the latter case , the charge @xmath167 carried by particles is -e , whereas the charge @xmath168 carried by holes is + e.      gollum starts from a mean - field hamiltonian provided either by the user or by an outside material - specific dft code . it then computes the scattering matrix and its related transport properties . when finite voltages are applied to the electrodes , they change the distribution of incoming and outgoing electrons and therefore the underlying hamiltonian . for example , a finite voltage in a two - terminal device may introduce an electrostatic potential , which should be included in the hamiltonian . a key feature of many negf codes including smeagol is that such effects can be treated self - consistently , albeit at the cost of a greatly increased computing overhead . to avoid this overhead , gollum assumes that the user is able to provide a modified hamiltonian at finite voltages .    based on our experience on the development and usage of negf programs and as demonstrated in in section iii.j below , we have found that in many cases , the following intuitive modification of the initial zero - voltage hamiltonian yields reasonable - accurate voltage - dependent transmission coefficients @xmath169 connecting leads @xmath4 and @xmath110 . the scheme enables the simulation of non - trivial @xmath170 curves which compare favorably to those obtained using negf techniques and enables the modeling of generic non - equilibrium transport phenomena such as negative differential resistance ( ndr ) and current rectification in close agreement with negf codes@xcite . consider the case where each lead has a different voltage @xmath121 . then the finite - voltage hamiltonian takes the form    @xmath171    we find that @xmath29 needs only be computed at zero voltage in most cases ; the effect of a finite bias can be accounted for by a suitable re - alignment of the energies of the orbitals in the em region with the shifted energy levels of the electrodes . mathematically , we apply a simple shift to the hamiltonian matrix elements at each orbital @xmath26 in the em region @xmath172 where these local shifts @xmath173 depend on the junction electrostatics , which in many cases are known . for example , in the case of a highly - transparent junction , the shifts can be modeled by a linear voltage ramp connecting the matrix elements of the orbitals at the tpls of the em region . in contrast , when the central scattering region hamiltonian @xmath174 is connected to the pl hamiltonians @xmath175 in each branch of the em region by weaker links @xmath176 , the voltage drop and therefore the resistance is concentrated at these spots . in this case , we take @xmath177 for all orbitals in branch @xmath4 , starting at the tpl and up to the linker atoms , and @xmath178 for all the orbitals inside the m region itself . this scheme performs specially well for systems where the states around the fermi level ( homo or lumo ) are localized at or close to the contact atoms . it enables us to mimic accurately junctions displaying non - trivial negative differential resistance , as well as rectification effects for asymmetric molecules@xcite .      what is the difference between a lead and a channel ? from a mathematical viewpoint , channels connect an extended scattering region to a reservoir and the role of lead @xmath4 is simply to label those channels @xmath179 , which connect to a particular reservoir @xmath4 . conceptually , this means that from the point of view of solving a scattering problem at energy @xmath62 , a single lead with @xmath180 incoming channels can be regarded as @xmath180 virtual leads , each with a single channel . gollum takes advantage of this equivalence by regarding the above groups of channels with wave - vectors @xmath181 as virtual leads and treating them on the same footing as physical leads . from this viewpoint , ( [ xxx ] ) and ( [ x1 ] ) yield the number of quasi - particles per unit time `` from virtual lead @xmath129 '' entering the scattering region with energy between @xmath62 and @xmath124 . this viewpoint is particularly useful when the hamiltonians @xmath182 , @xmath183 describing the pls of the physical lead @xmath4 are block diagonal with respect to the quantum numbers associated with @xmath181 . for example , this occurs when the leads possess a uniform magnetization , in which case the lead hamiltonian is block diagonal with respect to the local magnetization axis of the lead and @xmath140 represents the spin degree of freedom @xmath12 . this occurs also when the leads are normal metals , but the scattering region contains one or more superconductors , in which case the lead hamiltonian is block diagonal with respect to particle and hole degrees of freedom and @xmath140 represents either particles @xmath184 or holes @xmath185 . more generally , in the presence of both magnetism and superconductivity , or combinations of singlet and triplet superconductivity , @xmath140 would represent combinations of spin and particles and holes degrees of freedom .    in all of these cases , @xmath182 , @xmath183 are block diagonal and it is convenient to identify virtual leads @xmath129 with each block , because gollum will compute the channels @xmath181 belonging to each block in separate calculations and therefore guarantees that all such channels can be separately identified . this is advantageous , because if all channels of @xmath182 , @xmath183 were calculated simultaneously , then in the case of degeneracies , arbitrary superpositions of channels with different quantum numbers could result and therefore it would be necessary to implement a separate unitary transformation to sort channels into the chosen quantum numbers . by treating each block as a virtual lead , this problem is avoided . examples of this approach are presented below , when describing the scattering properties of magnetic or normal - superconducting - normal systems .      in the presence of non - collinear magnetic moments , provided the lead hamiltonians are block diagonal in spin indices ( in general relative to lead - dependent magnetization axes ) choosing @xmath186 and @xmath164 in eq . ( [ xxxx ] ) yields for the total electrical current @xmath187 note that in general it is necessary to retain the subscripts @xmath188 associated with @xmath189 or @xmath190 , because the leads may possess different magnetic axes . similarly the thermal energy from reservoir @xmath4 per unit time is @xmath191    for the special case of a normal multi - terminal junction having collinear magnetic moments , @xmath192 for all @xmath4 and since there is no spin - flip scattering , @xmath193 . in this case , the total hamiltonian of the whole system is block diagonal in spin indices and the scattering matrix can be obtained from separate calculations for each spin . we assume that initially the junction is in thermodynamic equilibrium , so that all reservoirs possess the same chemical potential @xmath194 . subsequently . we apply to each reservoir @xmath4 a different voltage @xmath195 , so that its chemical potential is @xmath196 . then from equation ( [ xxx ] ) , the charge per unit time per spin entering the scatterer from each lead can be written as @xmath197 and the thermal energy per spin per unit time is @xmath198 where @xmath199 and @xmath200 is the deviation in fermi distribution of lead @xmath4 from the reference distribution @xmath201 .    in the limit of small potential differences or small differences in reservoir temperatures , the deviations in the distributions from the reference distribution @xmath202 can be approximated by differentials and therefore to evaluate currents , in the presence of collinear magnetism , gollum provides the following spin - dependent integrals @xmath203    in the presence of two leads labeled @xmath204 , the spin - dependent low - voltage electrical conductance @xmath205 , the thermopower ( seebeck coefficient ) @xmath206 , the peltier coefficient @xmath207 and the thermal conductance @xmath208 can be obtained as @xmath209 so that the equivalent spin - summed magnitudes are @xmath210    note that the thermal conductance is guaranteed to be positive , because the expectation value of the square of a variable is greater than or equal to the square of the expectation value . for a two - terminal system , the above expressions allow us to obtain the electronic contribution to the thermoelectric figure of merit@xcite : @xmath211        a phenomenological scheme that improves the agreement between theoretical simulations and experiments in , for example , single - molecule electronics consists of shifting the occupied and unoccupied levels of the m region downwards and upwards respectively to increase the energy gap@xcite of the m region . the procedure is conveniently called spectral adjustment in nanoscale transport ( saint ) . at the request of a user , gollum modifies the hamiltonian operator of the m region as follows : @xmath212 where @xmath213 are energy shifts and ( @xmath214 , @xmath215 ) denote the occupied and unoccupied states , respectively . by using the definition of the density matrix operator of the m region @xmath216 the above hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath217 the equation can also be written in matrix form as @xmath218 to find the density matrix , we first solve the generalized eigenvalue problem : @xmath219 where @xmath220 is the @xmath221 identity matrix , and we have arranged the eigen - energies @xmath222 into a diagonal matrix @xmath223 . then @xmath224 in the simplest case , for a single - molecule junction , the shifts @xmath225 are chosen to align the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ( ie the homo and lumo ) with ( minus ) the ionization potential ( ip ) and electron affinity ( ea ) of the isolated molecule @xmath226 however the coulomb interactions in the isolated molecule are screened if the molecule is placed in close proximity to the metallic electrodes . currently , gollum takes this effect by using a simple image charge model@xcite , where the molecule is replaced by a point charge located at the middle point of the molecule and where the image planes are placed 1  above the electrodes surfaces . then the shifts are corrected by screening effects as follows : @xmath227 where @xmath74 is the distance between the image plane and the point image charge . many nanoscale - scale junctions are expected to show coulomb blockade behavior , and in specific situations also kondo features @xcite . these features can be demonstrated by gating the junction , and should appear as coulomb and kondo diamond lines in contour density plots of the low - voltage conductance as a function of bias and gate voltages . these strong correlation effects are completely missing in conventional dft . accurate parametrizations of the ground - state energy density functional of the single - channel anderson model exist that allow a correct description of those phenomena@xcite . however , most nanojunctions are better modeled in terms of a multi - channel anderson model as we have chosen to do in gollum . this model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath228 where the hamiltonian at the central scattering region is given by @xmath229 here the @xmath230-sum runs over the @xmath231 correlated degrees of freedom and includes the spin index , @xmath232 denote the on - site energies and @xmath233 is the electronic coulomb repulsion , that is assumed to be the same for all degrees of freedom . we map the central scattering region hamiltonian @xmath30 in eq . ( 4 ) into @xmath234 to extract the self - energies @xmath235 of the correlated degrees of freedom , in the spirit of dynamical mean field theory@xcite . following ref . ( ) , our correlated degrees of freedom are a subset of the eigenstates of @xmath30 , that we will call here molecular orbitals . this contrast with the approach followed in ref . ( ) where the correlated degrees of freedom where taken to be atomic orbitals of transition metal atoms . for a four - lead device , the details of our implementation are as follows . we take the em hamiltonian @xmath236 where @xmath174 has dimensions @xmath237 and therefore describes @xmath155 molecular orbitals . we first solve the generalized eigenvalue problem at the m region as in eqs . ( 54 - 57 ) in the previous section to find the rotation matrix @xmath238 that diagonalizes @xmath174 : @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the @xmath221 identity matrix . we then perform the direct product @xmath241 to enlarge the size of the matrix @xmath238 to the dimensions of the em hamiltonian matrix . we then rotate the em hamiltonian and compute the green s function of the em region @xmath242 we now choose which molecular orbitals @xmath243 with associated on - site energies @xmath244 are the correlated degrees of freedom , and use the projectors @xmath245 to find their projected green s functions and occupancies @xmath246\\,f(e_f)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath247 is the em fermi level . we then shift the on - site energy of the correlated orbitals by the conventional double counting term@xcite @xmath248    as a consequence , we have to recompute again the green s functions @xmath249 this is cast in the form @xmath250 which allows us to extract the hybridization function @xmath251 . the initial ingredients in the solution of the multichannel anderson model are the set @xmath252 . they allow us to extract the self - energies @xmath253 using a impurity solver . these are added again to the on - site energies @xmath254 leading to a new em hamiltonian @xmath29 and associated green s function @xmath255 . from here we compute a new hybridization function @xmath256 with which new self - energies @xmath257 are determined . the cycle is repeated until self - consistency in @xmath258 and @xmath257 is achieved . the resulting @xmath29 is inserted back into eq . ( 12 ) and the surface green - function matrix @xmath259 is computed to extract the transport properties of the correlated junction .    we have decided to include in gollum a finite-@xmath233 impurity solver . this way , we can subtract the double - counting terms and place the molecular orbitals at their correct bare energy positions by using eq . ( [ eq : double_counting ] ) . there exist a variety of finite-@xmath233 impurity solvers based on perturbation expansions on the coulomb interaction @xmath233 , on the hybridization function @xmath251 , on interpolative approaches , on monte - carlo algorithms ( see ref . ( ) for a detailed account of some of these solvers ) , or on numerical renormalization group techniques@xcite ( nrg ) . nrg techniques have superior accuracy , but they bring high computational demands . slave - boson - based expansions on @xmath251 like the oca@xcite are rather accurate and less expensive numerically .    the impurity solver used in gollum is based on the interpolative perturbation theory approach@xcite , where the second - order in @xmath233 expression for the electron self - energy is interpolated to match the atomic self - energy , and adjusted to satisfy consistency equations for the high - energy moments together with luttinger s theorem . this approach is computationally very simple , but has been proven to provide reasonable results for the multi - channel finite-@xmath233 anderson model@xcite . its main shortcoming is that it overestimates the kondo temperature , as we discuss in section ( [ section_kondo ] ) . specifically , the impurity solver that we have implemented to handle the multi - channel hamiltonian ( [ eq : anderson - hamiltonian ] ) is described in ref . ( ) , although we have corrected errors in some of the equations in that reference . we note that this impurity solver handles @xmath260 spin - degenerate correlated degrees of freedom , so that @xmath231 must be an even number . in other words , these channels must come as kramers pairs . we stress that other impurity solvers can be implemented straightforwardly , due to the modular nature of gollum . to compute transport properties in the presence of a magnetic field gollum allows the user to introduce a peierls substitution by changing the phase factors of the coupling elements@xcite between atomic orbitals . for example in the case of a nearest - neighbor tight - binding hamiltonian , the inter- site matrix element @xmath261 between site i and site j is replaced with the modified element , @xmath262 where @xmath263 and @xmath264 are the positions of site i and j and @xmath265 is the vector potential . the gauge is chosen such that the principal layers of the leads remain translational invariant after the substitution . as an example , below we demonstrate how gollum describes the quantum hall effect in a disordered square lattice , with a perpendicular uniform magnetic field . and @xmath266 connected to a superconductor ]    figure [ fig : superconductor](a ) shows a two - probe normal - superconductor - normal ( n - s - n ) device with left and right normal reservoirs connected to a scattering region containing one or more superconductors . if the complete hamiltonian describing a normal system of the type shown in fig . 2 is @xmath267 , then in the presence of superconductivity within the extended scattering region , the new system is described by the bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian @xmath268 where the elements of the matrix @xmath269 are non - zero only in the region occupied by a superconductor , as indicated in figure [ fig : superconductor](b ) . physically , @xmath267 describes particle degrees of freedom , @xmath270 describes hole degrees of freedom and @xmath269 is the superconducting order parameter . the multi - channel scattering theory for such a normal - superconducting - normal ( n - s - n ) structure was first derived by lambert in ref . [ ] , where the following current - voltage relation was presented : @xmath271 where @xmath272 ( @xmath273 ) is the current from the left ( right ) reservoir , @xmath274 ( @xmath275 ) is the difference between the chemical potential of the left ( right ) reservoir and the chemical potential @xmath20 of the superconducting condensate and the voltage difference between the left and right reservoirs is @xmath276 . this expression is the low - voltage limit of more general current - voltage relations discussed in [ ] . the generalization to multi - probe structures is described in refs . , to thermoelectric properties of superconducting nanostructures in refs . [ ] and to ferromagnetic - superconducting structures in refs . [ ] . in this equation , @xmath277 where @xmath278 ( @xmath279 ) is the number of open channels in the left ( right ) lead , @xmath280 ( @xmath281 ) are normal ( andreev ) reflection and transmission coefficients for quasi - particles emitted from the right lead , @xmath282 ( @xmath283 ) are normal ( andreev ) reflection and transmission coefficients from the left lead and all quantities are evaluated at the fermi energy @xmath284 . as a consequence of unitarity of the scattering matrix , these satisfy @xmath285 and @xmath286 . the current - voltage relation of equ . ( [ x7 ] ) is fundamentally different from that encountered for normal systems , because unitarity of the s - matrix does not imply that the sum of each row or column of the matrix @xmath74 is zero . consequently , the currents do not automatically depend solely of the applied voltage difference @xmath276 ( or more generally on the differences between incoming quasi - article distributions ) . in practice such a dependence arises only after the chemical potential of the superconductor adjusts itself self - consistently to ensure that the current from the left reservoir is equal to the current entering the right reservoir . insisting that @xmath287 , then yields @xmath288 and therefore the two - probe conductance @xmath289 takes the form of @xmath290    the above equation demonstrates why a superconductor possesses zero resistivity , because if the superconductor is disordered , then as the length @xmath291 of the superconductor increases , all transmission coefficients will vanish . in this limit , the above equation reduces to @xmath292 . in contrast with a normal scatterer , this shows that in the presence of andreev scattering , as @xmath291 tends to infinity , the resistance ( = 1/conductance ) remains finite and therefore the resistivity ( ie resistance per unit length ) vanishes .    in the notation of eqs . ( [ xxx ] ) and ( [ x1 ] ) , the above current - voltage relations and their finite - temperature , finite voltage generalizations can be obtained from eq . ( [ xxxx ] ) by writing @xmath293 or @xmath294 to yield @xmath295 since @xmath296 and @xmath297 , this becomes @xmath298   \\bar f^j_{\\beta_j}(e )   \\label{x6}\\ ] ] since , in the low - bias limit , @xmath299 , where @xmath134 is the fermi distribution with chemical potential @xmath20 , this simplifies to @xmath300 where @xmath301 \\label{x77}\\ ] ] the total current is obtained by multiplying eq . ( [ x6 ] ) by a factor of 2 to account for spin . on the other hand , in the limit of zero temperature , @xmath302 hence in this limit , the current - voltage relation ( [ x6 ] ) reduces to eq . ( [ x7 ] ) . simulation of the transport properties of a nanoscale - scale junction involves three distinct tasks . first , model geometries must be generated . secondly , the hamiltonian for each geometry must be constructed . thirdly , the s - matrix can be calculated and transport properties of the junction calculated . gollum separates these three tasks into three different processes . an overview of the work - flow of a generic gollum calculation is shown in figure [ multiscale ] . the three consecutive stages of the work process are denoted by the three dotted rectangular boxes . the initial step consists usually of modeling the atomistic arrangement of the junction . an initial structure is usually guessed , followed by geometry optimization or molecular dynamics simulations to obtain a more realistic atomic arrangement . this task can be performed by either ab - initio or classical molecular - dynamics methods . for systems containing a few hundred atoms , a quantum - mechanical dft - based simulation is usually the method of choice . however , experiments are often performed under ambient conditions or in a liquid environment . in these cases that the microscopic model should include the atomic structure of the environment , as we show below in section iii.gollum addresses this task by using classical molecular dynamics to model the environment and in the spirit of the born - oppenheimer approximation , feeding snapshots of the associated electrostatic field into the the dft - based mean - field hamiltonian . a similar approach is used to model the evolution of mechanically - controlled break junctions upon stretching , where the atomistic arrangement of the junction evolves slowly in time . in this case , if the same experiment is repeated a number of times , the junction geometry will be slightly different each time . therefore , a proper statistical analysis of the junction geometries is mandatory and calculations of the associated distribution of transmission coefficients is required . the task of generating junction geometries is also better suited for classical molecular dynamics situations . gollum also facilitates the use of combined dft and classical molecular dynamics approaches to gain accurate , yet quicker simulation results@xcite . a non - comprehensive set of software tools is listed in figure [ multiscale ] . once the atomic arrangements are generated , these are fed into the second stage , where the hamiltonian matrix is generated . this stage is in practice independent of the previous geometry construction and can be run separately , taking only the output geometries of the first stage . the junction hamiltonian can be generated using a variety of tools , some of which are listed in box ii in figure [ multiscale ] . a popular approach is the use of dft codes that are able to write the hamiltonian in a tight - binding language . in this way , model tight - binding hamiltonians can also be easily generated . other approaches involve the use of slater - booster or semi - empirical methods . in addition , gollum has the ability to modify suitably these hamiltonian matrices as discussed above . for example , the hamiltonian matrix can be modified to include scissor corrections , coulomb - blockade physics , a gate or bias voltage , a magnetic phase factor or a superconducting order parameter . finally , stage iii is the actual quantum transport calculation . this takes the hamiltonian matrix as an input and calculates the s - matrix and associated physical quantities , such the electrical or spin current , the conductance , or the thermopower .", "in this section , we present a diversity of calculations , which demonstrate the broad capabilities of gollum . for simplicity , we begin with a set of calculations on model hamiltonians , which demonstrate that gollum can easily handle tight - binding models for a range of physical systems . we then move on to more material - specific calculations , in which the hamiltonian is obtained from dft . these include examples exhibiting kondo physics , coulomb blockade and non - linear , finite - voltage effects . next we present more computationally challenging calculations involving van der waals interactions , environmental effects and series of geometries associated with break - junction measurements . finally an example of a quantum pump is presented , which requires access to the phase of scattering amplitudes . we define the conductance quantum @xmath303 , that will be used frequently below .      , @xmath304 , @xmath305 and @xmath306 ( taken in arbitrary units ) . ]    ( a ) as a function of the energy . energies are referred to the fermi energy @xmath247 and are given in units of @xmath307 . ] ( b ) that has four one - dimensional chain leads . as a function of the energy energies are referred to the fermi energy @xmath247 and are given in units of @xmath307 . ]    as a first example , we consider a simple one - dimensional tight - binding chain containing a single orbital per pl and a single impurity orbital in the em region , as shown in fig [ fig:2 - 4probetb](a ) . we take the following parameters , that are given in arbitrary units . within the leads , the site energies are @xmath308 , and the nearest neighbor couplings are @xmath309 . the impurity has a site energy @xmath304 and is coupled to the leads by a hopping element @xmath310 . results are shown for @xmath305 and @xmath306 . the transmission coefficient for this chain is shown in figure [ fig:2probetb ] .    as a second example , we consider the four - probe structure of fig . [ fig:2 - 4probetb](b ) , that shares the same set of parameters as the two - probe model above . the various transmission coefficients for this structure are shown in figure [ fig:2probetb4 ] . by symmetry , these are all identical . as an example of a quantum transport calculation with a magnetic field , we demonstrate the quantum hall effect within the simple tight - binding square lattice shown in the inset of fig . [ quantumhall ] . the lattice constant is set to @xmath311  . the onsite energies of the perfect lattice are @xmath312 ev , the hopping integrals at zero magnetic field are @xmath305 ev and the fermi energy is set at zero . the red area in the figure denotes a disordered portion of the lattice . in this disordered area , the onsite energies are randomly varied as @xmath313 , where @xmath314 is a random number distributed with uniform probability in the range @xmath315 , @xmath316 and @xmath317 ev ( red , green and blue dashed curves , respectively ) . the transport direction is chosen to be the @xmath318 axis ( e.g. : from bottom to top ) while the @xmath319 axis goes along the horizontal direction . to demonstrate the quantum hall effect we introduce a homogeneous magnetic field perpendicular to the square lattice , pointing out of the paper , which is expressed in units of @xmath320 tesla . with this setup the vector potential is chosen so that the lead remains translationally invariant along the @xmath318 direction . this means that we implement a peierls substitution of the form @xmath321 where @xmath322 and @xmath323 are the coordinates of the site i. with this modified hamiltonian the conductance calculated by gollum is shown in fig .

( 1 ) and ( 2 ) correspond to parallel and anti - parallel configurations , respectively . ] gollum can describe voltage - dependent spin - polarized transport in spin - active junctions , made from a variety of metals , including iron @xcite , platinum or palladium @xcite . to demonstrate this , we describe here the voltage - dependent spin - filtering and magneto - resistive behavior of a two - terminal junction where ( 001 ) fcc nickel electrodes with parallel ( p ) or anti - parallel ( ap ) spin orientations are connected by a nickel atomic chain@xcite . notice that because we may have electrodes with ap spin orientations , we are forced to use em setups such as those shown in fig . we sketch in fig . ( [ em_victor1 ] ) the scattering region used in the present calculation . it comprises a 6-atom - long nickel chain , the electrodes surfaces and the two branches . the electrodes surfaces contain 2/3 atomic layers with 4 atoms each . the left and right branches contain two pls that have 4 atoms each . the second pl is followed by vacuum . we have checked that the transport results in this example are reasonably converged if we choose pl1 as the tpl , which means that pl2 is sacrificial .    to find the junction hamiltonian , we use the program siesta . we use the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) functional@xcite and take the theoretical gga lattice constant of 3.45    for the pls as well as inter - atomic distances of 2.27    along the chain . we have employed a single-@xmath359 ( sz ) basis set to span the valence states and a mesh cutoff of 400 ry to define the real - space grid where the density , potential and matrix elements are calculated .    ) in the ( a ) p and ( b ) ap spin configurations as a function of the bias voltage applied to the junction . the different curves correspond to different numbers of @xmath18-points . ]    to understand the spin - polarized transport properties of the junction , we will analise below the spin - dependent transmission coefficients @xmath360 , together with the spin - dependent charge currents . these are computed using the approximate expression @xmath361 the above approximation is quantitatively accurate for small enough bias voltages ( @xmath362 v ) and also shows the expected qualitative behavior at larger voltages . we have found that the transmission coefficients and currents depend sensitively on the number of transverse @xmath18-points taken along the plane perpendicular to the transport direction . as we will show below , we need to use at least 16 @xmath18-points to achieve convergence . in other words , a @xmath363-point calculation provides a poor estimate of the transport properties of these junctions . we plot @xmath360 as a function of the energy referred to the fermi energy of the scattering region for p and ap spin orientations in fig . ( [ fig : victor2 ] ) . the upper panel of the figure shows that the transmission coefficients for the p configuration are strongly spin - polarized . this polarization remains at the fermi level , which suggests that these junctions could act as spin filters . the bottom panel of the figure shows the transmission coefficients for the ap configuration . the fact that these are different from those of the p spin orientation hints that these junctions could show significant gmr ratios . to quantify these statements , we compute the charge current of the junction in the p and ap configurations @xmath220 and @xmath364 and plot them in fig . ( [ fig : victor3 ] ) . the figure shows that indeed these junctions show magnetorresistive properties . the figure also demonstrates that the currents depend on the number of @xmath18-points . to further give quantitative estimates of the spin activity of the junctions , we define the spin polarization in the p arrangement and the gmr ratio as @xmath365 where @xmath366 are the spin - dependent currents for the p orientation . we show in fig . ( [ fig : victor4 ] ) these two magnitudes as a functions of the bias voltage applied to the junction . we indeed find large spin signals for these devices . furthermore , the figure demonstrates that at least 16 @xmath18-points are needed to achieve converged results .     and ( b ) gmr ratio plotted as a function of the bias voltage applied to the junction shown in fig . ( [ em_victor1 ] ) . the different curves correspond to different numbers of @xmath18-points . ] gollum can profit from the improved chemical accuracy delivered by the most advanced density functionals . as an example , we discuss here the transport properties of the junction shown in fig . ( [ fig : graphene - junction ] ) , where a single phthalocyanine trimer molecule bridges two graphene electrodes separated by a physical gap of length 17.265  . these graphene sheets are armchair - terminated and passivated by hydrogen atoms . periodic boundary conditions are applied in the two directions across the graphene plane . the phthalocyanine units are linked by butadiyne chains . the planar anchors couple to the graphene via interaction of the @xmath367-clouds and therefore an accurate description of the chemical bonding and transport properties can only be achieved by the use of a van der waals density functional . we use here the implementation of dion et al . in the siesta program @xcite . we have computed the hamiltonian and overlap matrix elements using a double - zeta basis set for all the elements in the simulation , together with a grid fineness of 200 rydberg . by minimizing the energy , we find that the molecule sits at a height of 3.4  above the sheets . we have studied the impact of the length of the electrode gap on the transport properties of the junction by attaching additional armchair layers to the edges of both sheets ; these layers are made of two carbon rows , and have a width of 2.502  . the transmission coefficients for several gap widths are shown in fig . ( [ fig : graphene - gap ] ) . we find several breit - wigner resonances associated with molecular levels of the trimer . remarkably , these do not shift in energy as the gap width varies@xcite . however , deep dips appear for several gap widths . these are associated with interference among the different paths whereby electrons can propagate between the molecule and the electrodes . we have also studied the change in the transmission curves as the molecule is displaced laterally and longitudinally across the physical gap . we show representative examples of the transmission curves for longitudinal displacements in fig . ( [ fig : graphene - y ] ) . the figures show that the energy positions of the molecular breit - wigner resonances remain almost constant . we have found the same behavior for other graphene - based junctions : the energy position of the breit - wigner resonances for a given graphene - based junction does not depend on the molecule position relative to the physical gap , provided that the bonding mechanism is by physisorption . this universality arises because physisorption carries no charge transfer between the molecule and the sheets . furthermore the electrodes are made from the same material and therefore there is no dipole moment associated with the contacts . finally , the @xmath368 hybridization between molecular orbitals and the electrode states is weaker than for the bonds present in most noble - metal / single - atom contacts , and does not have a large impact on the nature of the molecular orbitals .      as an example of a gollum calculation using a lda+u density functional@xcite , we describe in this section a case where strong electronic correlations may affect the transport properties of a nanoscale - scale junction . we discuss the junction shown in fig . ( [ fig : ldau - geometry ] ) . here gold ( 001 ) electrodes bridge either a porphyrin ( p ) or a metallo - porphyrin molecule ( cup or cop ) . electron flow through any of these three porphyrin molecules is carried by molecular orbitals that hybridize strongly with the gold s - orbitals . this gives rise to broad breit - wigner resonances in the transmission coefficients that are identical for the three molecules . however , for the cup and cop junctions , additional electron paths are created whereby electrons hop into and off the localized d - orbitals of the transition metal atom . the interference between direct and d - orbital - mediated paths creates sharp fano resonances that can however be masked by the much wider breit - wigner resonances@xcite . we see below how including strong correlations in the d - orbitals of the co and cu atoms in terms of a lda+u approach produces strong shifts in the energy dependence of those resonances . we have computed the hamiltonian using the siesta code , where we have picked a single zeta basis for the gold atoms at the electrodes , a double - zeta - polarized basis set for all the atoms in the molecule and a gga functional . we have included a @xmath233 correction term for the d - orbitals of the cu and co atoms in a mean - field fashion , in the spirit of the lda+u approach@xcite . we present here our results for values of @xmath233 equal to 0 , 2.5 and 4.5 ev .     of the junction shown in fig . ( [ fig : ldau - geometry ] ) , where the central molecule is cup . @xmath369 is plotted as a function of the energy @xmath62 referred to the fermi energy @xmath247 of the scattering region . the different panels correspond to the different @xmath233 corrections added to the dft hamiltonian ( see text ) . the green and gold ellipses encircle masked fano resonances . they are originated by paths hopping onto the cu 3d@xmath370 or d@xmath371 orbitals . the red ellipse circles a sharp breit - wigner resonance coming from c and n atoms . ] we find that the transmission coefficients of the three molecules display the same wide breit - wigner resonances , that correspond to molecular orbitals hybridizing strongly with the electrodes . these are shown in figs . ( [ fig : ldau - cup ] ) and ( [ fig : ldau - cop ] ) for cup and cop respectively . in addition , the three molecules show a sharp breit - wigner resonance that is marked by a red ellipse in the figures . this resonance corresponds to a molecular orbital encompassing c and n atoms that is weakly bonded to the electrodes . interestingly , this sharp breit - wigner resonance shifts in energy if we change the value of the coulomb interaction @xmath233 for the cup and cop junctions . to understand this phenomenon , we have looked at the density of states of the junction projected onto each atomic orbital , and the local density of states integrated in a narrow energy window around the red resonance . we have found that the n- and c - based molecular orbital hybridizes with the d@xmath372 orbital of the copper or cobalt atoms and is therefore affected by the @xmath233-term . we have found additional sharp peaks appearing in @xmath373 for the cup and cop junction that do not show up for the simple porphyrin junction . these are marked by green , blue and gold circles in figs . ( [ fig : ldau - cup ] ) and ( [ fig : ldau - cop ] ) . these seem to be sharp breit - wigner resonances also . however , we have demonstrated@xcite that they are actually fano resonances , where the fano dip is masked by the transmission of the neighboring wide breit - wigner resonances . by plotting the density of states of the junction projected in each orbital , we indeed find that they correspond to the copper d@xmath370 or d@xmath371 orbitals . because these fano resonances are associated with atomic d - orbitals strongly localized in the transition metal atom , we expect that adding a @xmath233-term will have a strong impact on their energy position . ( [ fig : ldau - cup ] ) shows how these resonances indeed shift in energy as @xmath233 is increased . note that one of the fano resonances coming from the d@xmath370 copper orbital is strongly pinned to the fermi energy , while other resonances rapidly move down in energy . we analyze in this section the transport properties of a series ( 111 ) gold junctions that are bridged by ope derivatives . the backbone of these molecules has a varying number of rings ranging from one to three . the molecules may be oriented fully perpendicular to the electrodes surfaces , or making a tilting angle , as we show in fig . ( [ tricene45 ] ) it is well established by now @xcite that gold junctions that contain conjugated thiol - terminated molecules like opes have a larger conductance when the molecule is tilted . this is due to the increased overlap of the @xmath374 states of the sulfur atoms when the angle between the molecule and the normal to the surface increases . we show in this section that a plain dft - based calculation predicts that the largest conductance occurs when the molecule is oriented perpendicular to the electrodes . this deficiency is remedied by the use of the saint method . this method is an efficient semi - empirical correction that allows us to obtain quantitative agreement between dft calculations and experiments@xcite , as we have already stressed in section ii . ( color online ) a ( 111 ) gold junction sandwiching a tricene - dithiol molecule . the molecule is coupled to one ad - atom on one side and to a hollow gold site at the other end , and its orientation is titled with respect to the electrodes normal line . ] the hamiltonian of the junction has been obtained with the code siesta and a local density approximation ( lda ) functional@xcite . we have picked a single - zeta basis for the gold atoms of the electrodes , and a double - zeta - polarized basis for the atoms in the molecule . the pls of the electrodes contain three atomic layers , each having @xmath375 atoms . we have chosen junction geometries where the molecular derivatives are oriented either perpendicularly to the gold surfaces or making a 45 degrees angle , as shown in fig . ( [ tricene45 ] ) . due to this tilting angle , we had to use a non - periodic scattering region , as in fig . the scattering regions consisted therefore of the molecule , the two surfaces containing two atomic layers each and 3 pls on each branch followed by vacuum . we chose pl2 as the tpl , so all hamiltonian matrix elements of pl3 were chopped off . ( color online ) transmission of the junction shown in fig . ( [ tricene45 ] ) , containing an ope molecule with 3 rings . @xmath373 has been calculated ( a ) without and ( b ) with saint corrections . continuous and dashed lines correspond to perpendicular and tilted ( 45 degrees ) molecules , respectively . ] we have computed the transmission curves @xmath373 for the referred ope derivatives using conventional dft , and have found for all of them that the conductance ( computed from @xmath376 ) is larger if the molecule is oriented perpendicular to the electrodes . the upper panel in fig . ( [ t_saint_1 ] ) demonstrates this behavior for an ope containing three rings . the figure shows that the higher conductance is originated by the position of the homo level of the molecule , that is placed only slightly below the fermi energy of the scattering region . in contrast , the homo level of the tilted molecule is shifted farther away from @xmath247 . this situation demands for the use of the saint correction scheme , that will reposition the molecular orbital levels at their correct energies . we show in the bottom panel of the figure that this is indeed the case , and that by the use of the saint scheme , the correct experimental trend is recovered , where tilted molecules show larger conductances . we have verified that the same change happens for ope molecules containing one and two rings . finally , we plot in fig . ( [ t_saint_2 ] ) @xmath373 for the three molecules ( containing one , two and three rings ) for perpendicular and tilted orientations . ( [ g.saint ] ) we show the transmission of the ope derivatives with a number of rings between 1 and 3 and two tilting angles , 0 and 45 degrees . the figures show that all those junctions where the derivative is oriented perpendicularly to the gold surface ( defined here to be 0 degrees ) show a larger transmission at the fermi level than the tilted cases in contrast with our expectations discussed above @xcite . ( color online ) transmission of the junction shown in fig . ( [ tricene45 ] ) , containing an ope molecule with ( a ) 1 , ( b ) 2 and ( c ) 3 rings . @xmath373 has been calculated with saint corrections . continuous and dashed lines correspond to perpendicular and tilted ( 45 degrees ) molecules , respectively . ] .[tabsaint.2 ] corrections entering the saint scheme for occupied and unoccupied levels given in ev . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the physical mechanism whereby the conductance of the tilted configuration is higher , is due to the higher hybridization between the molecular orbitals and the electrodes in the tilted configuration . this increases the width of the transmission resonances and therefore decreases the effect of opening the gap with the saint correction . on the other hand , the image charge correction is also larger in the tilted configuration , since the molecule is closer to the surfaces , and therefore the reduction in the opening of the gap is also larger , which means the final gap ends up smaller in the tilted configuration . the conductance of each case is summarized in fig . ( [ g.saint ] ) . notice that the saint correction scheme changes qualitatively the physical picture in this junction . our procedure for the saint correction scheme is as follows . we first calculate the ionization potential ( ip ) and electron affinity ( ea ) of the molecules in the gas phase . these gas phase corrections open the dft homo - lumo gap . however , these bare shifts need to be corrected because of image charge effects . the final values for the correction shifts are summarized in table ( [ tabsaint.2 ] ) . notice that the corrections are very similar in magnitude and have opposite signs@xcite . as noted above , gollum has a simple and flexible input data structure so that model hamiltonians can be utilized easily . as a simple example of a simulation exhibiting kondo and coulomb blockade behavior , we show here results obtained from gollum for a tight - binding single - level anderson model coupled to two semi - infinite chains , that corresponds to taking @xmath377 in eq . ( [ eq : anderson - hamiltonian ] ) . due to the coupling to the two leads , the correlated level acquires a finite bandwidth @xmath378 where @xmath379 is the density of states in the leads . for vanishing @xmath363 the model is in the so - called atomic limit which is characterized by sharp peaks in the @xmath380-level density of states @xmath381 at @xmath382 and @xmath383 . this limit corresponds to the coulomb blockade regime in an actual junction where the conductance is strongly suppressed except at the charge degeneracy points . however , when the coupling to the leads increases ( @xmath363 becomes larger than the temperature @xmath369 , but is still smaller than @xmath233 ) , virtual processes allow the charge and spin in the molecule to fluctuate and a resonance close to the fermi energy appears due to the kondo effect . this simple model therefore captures relevant physics of molecular junctions such as the appearance of the coulomb blockade effect , and the crossover from the coulomb blockade to the kondo regime as the temperature is lowered below the kondo temperature @xmath384 where the last expression holds in the so - called symmetric limit @xmath385 . the interpolative impurity solver implemented in gollum provides a good quantitative description of the above phenomena in the weak coupling regime and is also qualitatively correct in the intermediate and strong coupling regimes . it however overestimates the width of the kondo resonance . we show in fig . [ fig : anderson - t ] ( a ) the zero - voltage transmission curve @xmath373 computed with gollum , and using the single - level anderson hamiltonian ( [ eq : anderson - hamiltonian ] ) in the symmetric limit . we take the following parameters : @xmath386 ev , @xmath387 and @xmath388 so that @xmath389 and @xmath390 , placing the junction in the strong correlation regime . these parameters yield a kondo temperature @xmath391 . the figure shows that the interpolative solution provides a transmission curve featuring the lower and upper hubbard bands placed at their correct position and having the right width , together with a sharp kondo resonance at low temperatures which progressively smoothens and eventually disappears as the temperature is raised . however , the interpolative solution provides a kondo temperature @xmath392 , e.g. : two orders of magnitude larger than the exact one . we now show the results obtained from gollum for a similar junction , shown in fig . ( [ fig : anderson - molecule ] ) , where a hydrogen atom bridges two gold ( 001 ) electrodes . in this case , the input hamiltonian is generated by the dft code siesta and the leads are repeated periodically in the plane perpendicular to the transport direction , using pl unit cells in ab stacking and @xmath393 atoms in each atomic layer . we have used a single - zeta basis set and a generalized gradient approximation functional . we have adjusted the distance @xmath380 between the hydrogen atom and the leads to reproduce a coupling similar to that set for the above anderson model which is achieved with @xmath394  . the generated transmission curve is shown in fig . [ fig : anderson - t ] ( b ) for the same three temperatures used for the anderson hamiltonian . we find that the shape of the transmission curves remains qualitatively the same . however , both the lower and upper hubbard bands and the kondo resonance are now sharper at their tips . using gollum , we subsequently apply a gate voltage @xmath395 to the gold - hydrogen - gold junction and compute the low - voltage conductance @xmath324 as a function of @xmath395 to compare the results using plain dft versus dft in combination with the interpolative method . the results are shown in fig . ( [ fig : anderson - gate ] ) . we have not included the double - counting term to make the comparison between both approaches more explicit . the figure nicely shows how the interpolative method splits the single dft peak into two coulomb blockade peaks and also a kondo peak . the figure also shows how the kondo peak disappears at temperatures above @xmath396 leaving only the coulomb blockage features . finally , we subject the gold - hydrogen - gold junction to the combined effect of finite bias @xmath1 and gate @xmath395 voltages . fig . ( [ fig : anderson - diamond ] ) shows density - contour plots of the low - voltage conductance as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath395 . this figure demonstrates that gollum can nicely reproduce coulomb blockade diamonds , as well as the kondo line , that disappears as the temperature is raised above @xmath396 . we demonstrate with two examples how gollum incorporates finite - voltage effects . in the first , we have computed the current - voltage characteristics of a gold ( 001 ) junction sandwiching an alkane molecule , that we show in fig . ( [ alkane4 ] ) . we have computed the zero - bias hamiltonian of the junction using the siesta code , with a double - zeta - polarized basis for all the atoms , and a gga functional . the pls contain two atomic layers , with @xmath393 atoms each . we have applied periodic boundary conditions across the plane perpendicular to the transport direction and have computed @xmath397 at the @xmath363 point .    for every given voltage @xmath1 , we modify the em hamiltonian as described in eq . ( [ voltage ] ) . all the orbitals @xmath26 at the left branch in the em region in fig . ( [ alkane4 ] ) are shifted by @xmath398 , starting at the tpl and stopping at the linking sulfur atom . similarly , the orbitals at the right branch in the em region are shifted by @xmath399 all , starting at the linking sulfur atom and including those at the tpl . the current @xmath400 is then computed from the modified hamiltonian @xmath401 . the resulting @xmath170 curve is shown as a red dashed line in fig . ( [ alkane5 ] ) . for comparison , the black line in the same figure shows the @xmath170 curves obtained with a full negf simulation using the code smeagol . finally , the dot - dashed green line shows the current - voltage curve obtained from gollum by integrating the zero - voltage transmissions obtained from @xmath402 . the figure demonstrates that our proposed method reproduces rather accurately the features found in the full negf calculation , including the ndr feature at @xmath403 volt , while the plain equilibrium calculation fails to reproduce the gross features of the current - voltage characteristics . it underestimates the low - voltage conductance by a factor of two .    as a second example , we have calculated the current - voltage characteristics of a ( 111 ) gold junction sandwiching a porphyrin molecule . the junction geometry is similar to that shown in fig . ( [ fig : ldau - geometry ] ) . the sulfur atoms attach to the electrodes at a hollow site . the porphyrin molecule does not have in the present case a metallic atom at the center , but has two saturating hydrogen atoms instead . we have performed two series of calculations . in the first , the geometry and physical gap distance has been relaxed and the calculations have been done at the most stable configuration . in the second , we have pulled the electrodes and sulfur atoms away . to do so , we have increased the sulfur - molecule distance by 0.3  . the current - voltage curves are shown in fig . ( [ porphirin ] ) . these characteristics do not show non - trivial features . we note again that the plain calculation using zero - voltage transmissions fails to reproduce the negf curve , underestimating the conductance by a factor close to 2 . in contrast , our prescription provides characteristics that reproduce accurately the negf results .    to understand the difference between the dot - dashed green lines and the finite - voltage results of figs . ( [ alkane5 ] ) and ( [ porphirin ] ) , we have analyzed the evolution of the transmission coefficients @xmath404 as the voltage bias @xmath1 is ramped . we have found running negf simulations that the main non - equilibrium effect that affects the current for the two junctions above is an energy shift of the molecular homo resonance , that moves up as the voltage is increased . our prescription not only captures the effect , but also follows accurately the evolution of the resonance shifts dictated by the negf calculation , at least at low voltages . by shifting the homo resonance upwards in energy , a larger weight of the resonance enters into the energy integration window used to compute the current integral , hence increasing the current . in contrast , this effect can not be captured at all if one uses the plain @xmath405 transmission coefficients . ( color online ) a junction where a butane - dithiol molecule is sandwiched by ( 001 ) gold electrodes and subjected to a finite bias potential . ]      in this section , we show how gollum can compute the thermoelectric properties of complex junctions formed by trapping a c@xmath406 molecule between gold electrodes . in a previous paper @xcite we have demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically that @xmath407-based nanojunctions show promisingly - high values for the thermopower and figure of merit . however the temperature dependence of these values and the fluctuations caused by the exact geometrical details have not been thoroughly investigated , partly due to the computationally - expensive nature of the calculations . here we show that the fast and efficient implementation of gollum allows us to undertake a more complete exploration of the transport properties of these c@xmath406-based junctions .    the systems of interest consist of two ( 111 ) gold leads that can be tilted an angle @xmath21 relative to each other . each lead is terminated using either a flat surface or a pyramid , as shown in fig . ( [ fig : c60 ] ) . we have performed dft calculations using the code siesta , with a double - zeta - polarized basis set , and the lda functional@xcite . we have relaxed the molecular geometries using a force tolerance of 0.02 ev /  and have found the equilibrium distance between the leads and the c@xmath406 molecule to be of about 0.22 nm , depending on the exact orientation of the molecule . this result is in good agreement with other previously reported distances @xcite . we have kept this distance fixed in all subsequent transport calculations . however , we have taken for completeness five possible orientations of the @xmath407 molecule relative to the electrodes . these are : ( a ) a c - c bond between a hexagon and a pentagon facing the au surface ; ( b ) a hexagon facing the au surface ; ( c ) a pentagon facing the au surface ; ( d ) a bond between two hexagons facing the au surface ; and ( e ) a single atom facing the au surface . we have also tilted one of the electrodes in steps of 15 degrees between 0 and 60 degrees to see the interference effects caused by the exact position of the tip on the surface of the fullerene , recalculating the thermoelectric properties at each step . the starting position ( for @xmath408 ) for the c@xmath406 against the electrodes is such that one of its pentagons is facing the au surfaces .     molecule . the electrodes are terminated as either a flat surface ( upper panel ) or a pyramid ( lower panel ) , and can be tilted an angle @xmath21 relative to each other . ]    ) having flat or pyramid - terminated electrodes ; @xmath21 is the rotation angle . figs . ( a)-(b)-(c)-(d ) show two - dimensional contour plots of the conductance @xmath324 ( measured in units of @xmath325 ) , the thermopower @xmath409 ( measured in @xmath410 ) , the thermal conductance @xmath411 ( measured in nw / k ) , and the figure of merit @xmath412 ( dimensionless ) . the vertical and horizontal axes are the temperature t measured in kelvin and the tilting angle @xmath21 for flat - electrode junctions ( e)-(f)-(g)-(h ) show the same magnitudes for pyramid - terminated electrodes . note that the color code is different for each figure . ] the results of our calculations are shown in figure ( [ fig : c60 - 1 ] ) . by taking horizontal cuts through these surfaces , we can see clear evidence of quantum interference as the angle changes and the tip is repositioned around the fullerene surface . for the conductance @xmath324 , these oscillations are almost temperature independent , whereas in the case of the thermopower @xmath409 , the thermal conductance @xmath411 and the electronic figure of merit zt , these oscillations are almost negligible at low temperatures and then grow with @xmath369 . comparing the conductance obtained with flat electrodes against that with pyramid - terminated electrodes , we can clearly see that @xmath324 decreases substantially when using the pyramid - like electrodes , in agreement with ref . furthermore in the case of flat electrodes the conductance fluctuates with the angle @xmath21 by about half an order of magnitude , whereas for the pyramid - terminated electrodes we find a larger change of almost one order of magnitude . this again demonstrates that the pyramid - terminated electrode scans the molecular surface like an stm tip , with improved detail , while part of these features are blurred when using a flat electrode . the flat - electrode junctions possess conductances values of about 0.6 - 1.2 @xmath413 , while junctions with pyramid tips have conductances of order 0.015 - 0.15 @xmath413 . we overestimate the experimental values for @xmath324 @xcite , by about one order of magnitude , a known problem associated with the underestimation of the homo - lumo gap inherent to the plain dft approach . as expected , the thermopower @xmath409 is more sensitive to the angle @xmath21 when using pyramid - terminated junctions compared with the case of flat - surfaced junctions . interestingly , @xmath409 is quite high especially at the higher temperatures , achieving values of of about @xmath414 to @xmath415 .      ab - initio force - relaxation simulations show that it is possible to sculpt complex three - dimensional structures of nanoscale - scale dimensions by cutting shapes into a graphene bilayer @xcite . we find that the edges of the two graphene sheets coalesce in order to saturate dangling bonds and to maximize the degree of @xmath416 hybridization . for example , by cutting a cross shape in a bilayer graphene sheet , the resulting sculpturene is the three - dimensional crossbar carbon nanotube ( cnt ) shown in fig . ( [ fig : four - probe - cnt ] ) , which is an example of a four - terminal electronic device . this four - terminal device is composed of two armchair and two zigzag cnt electrodes . these become perfectly periodic cnt leads ( shown with blue ) far enough from the junction . to perform a gollum - based four - terminal calculation , we obtain the mean - field hamiltonian of this structure using the siesta code , with a double - zeta - polarized basis set and a gga functional@xcite . we start with the referred cross - shaped bilayer graphene sheet and after relaxing the inter - atomic forces to tolerances below 0.02 ev /  , we find the crossbar shaped device shown in figure ( [ fig : four - probe - cnt ] ) . we feed the resulting ab - initio hamiltonian into gollum , and compute the transmission coefficients @xmath417 between every possible combination of pairs of leads . notice that the armchair cnt leads are semiconducting , while the zigzag cnts are metallic . we therefore expect different qualitative behaviors for the transmission properties among the different arms . this is shown in fig . ( [ fig : t-12 - 34 ] ) , where the transmission coefficients between the two armchair arms @xmath418 are much smaller than those connecting the zigzag arms @xmath419 . in addition , the figure indicates that the central cross area , where the two arms join together is not transparent , but introduces strong scattering . similarly , the transmission from lead 1 to lead 3 also shows a reduced transmission at low energies due to the semiconducting behavior of the armchair lead 1 , see fig ( [ fig : t-12 - 34 ] ) . this figure shows that @xmath420 due to the junction symmetry . and leads 3 and 4 @xmath419 ( solid black and dashed red lines respectively ) . energies are measured in ev and referred to the fermi energy of the scattering region . ]    , solid black line ) and between lead 1 and lead 3 ( @xmath421 , dashed red line ) . energies are measured in ev and referred to the fermi energy of the scattering region . ]      in the literature , most theoretical analyses of phase - coherent transport properties assume that the junction is immersed in vacuum and therefore ignore the effects of the surrounding environment . in contrast , many experiments are carried out under ambient conditions , which can have a marked effect on transport properties@xcite . if surrounding environmental molecules possess a dipole moment , then the scattering region will be subject to a fluctuating electrostatic field . previous work to investigate the impact of environmental water on the transport properties of a a single - molecule junction@xcite also took into account the effect of a solvation shell of water molecules surrounding the junction . gollum describes these effects systematically , by noting that for nanostructures such as single - molecule junctions , the timescale for such fluctuations is typically longer than the time taken for an electron to pass through the device and therefore one can adopt the born - oppenheimer approximation and freeze the environment during each electron transit . however , successive electrons experience different environmental snapshots and therefore are subjected to different instantaneous mean field hamiltonians leading to different instantaneous conductances . the measured ( time - averaged ) electrical conductance will hence be an ensemble average over these snapshots . to obtain a series of environmental snapshots , gollum uses classical molecular dynamics to describe the environmental molecules and for each snapshot , feeds the resulting geometries into a dft code to compute the corresponding self - consistent hamiltonian . the resulting mean field hamiltonian is then used to compute the scattering matrix and related transport properties .        ) for 100 snapshots . ]    to illustrate this approach , we compute here the ensemble averaged conductance of the junction shown in fig . ( [ fig : solvent - molecule ] ) , where two pi - stacked monothiol terminated oligophenyleneethynylenes form a bridge between two gold ( 001 ) electrodes . the bridging molecule is surrounded by two different solvents : decane and 1,4-dioxane,1,2,4-trichlorobenzene ( tcb ) . an example of a junction surrounded by a shell of tcb molecules is shown in the lower panel of fig . ( [ fig : solvent - molecule ] ) . we have tested here the classical molecular dynamics packages lammps@xcite and dlpoly@xcite , but gollum is flexible enough to accept coordinates from other classical molecular dynamics packages . in what follows , we show results obtained with lammps , where we have used the dreiding force field to describe the intra- and inter - molecular interactions and have employed the reaxff forcefield to obtain the initial charges . to create the environment , we place two hundred solvent molecules surrounding the backbone molecule . we perform the simulations using a constant temperature and volume ( nvt ) ensemble and subsequently a constant temperature and pressure ( npt ) thermostat . we equilibrate the junction for 150 ps with 0.1 fs time steps continuously raising the temperature to 290 k. we do not include the gold electrodes in the molecular dynamics simulation , so to simulate the binding of the anchor groups , we hold the positions of the two terminating atoms which connect to the electrodes fixed . we record between 350 and 500 snapshots of the junction , that have been taken every 2ps . for each snapshot , we feed the atomic coordinates into the dft code siesta and generate the dft hamiltonian . we then feed the hamiltonians into the transport code to compute the electrical conductance . some example transmission curves for 100 snapshots of the junction with a tcb solvent are shown in the right panel in fig . ( [ fig : solvent - molecule ] ) . we note that the the room - temperature dynamics of the atoms at the junction lead to a large spread in the transmission curves , and therefore to many different values of the low - voltage conductance . we therefore assemble conductance histograms to help identify the most probable conductance values . the resulting histograms in the presence of decane and tcb solvents are shown in fig . ( [ fig : solvent - histogram ] ) . the fact that the most probable conductance values are different shows that ambient - conditions or liquid - immersed molecular electronics experiments are affected by the surrounding solvent . notice that in these simulations we kept fixed the molecule - electrode geometry , so the spread in @xmath324 is due entirely to environmental effects .    ) for two different solvents : decane ( left ) and tcb ( right ) . ] the fact that the transport properties of nanoscale junctions depends on the surrounding environment leads to a wide range of possible sensing applications . in this section , we demonstrate the versatility of gollum by showing how it can be used to predict the change in conductance of a nanopore , when a single dna strand is trans - located through it . deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) is a molecule that encodes the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms and many viruses . dna molecules are double - stranded helices , consisting of two long biopolymers composed of simpler units called nucleotides . each nucleotide is composed of one of the four nucleobases guanine ( g ) , adenine ( a ) , thymine ( t ) and cytosine ( c ) , which are attached to a backbone made of alternating sugar and phosphate groups . the two polymer strands are bound together by non - covalent bonds that link base pairs and are easily separated to form two single - stranded dna molecules ( ssdna ) molecules . dna sequencing aims at identifying the sequence of the dna bases in a sample of ssdna . many researchers are actively seeking new methods to sequence dna with improved reliability and scalability and that are economically viable . biological nanopores made from protein such as a - hemolysin have been shown experimentally to sense the presence of dna @xcite , but are also very sensitive to temperature and ph , and can only be used within a limited voltage bias window@xcite . as an alternative , solid state devices which can be integrated into existing semiconducting circuitry technology and that are robust to the chemical environment have been proposed as sensors @xcite .            to demonstrate the versatility of gollum , we examine here the potential for dna nucleobase sensing of the sculpturene device shown in fig . ( [ fig : ttht ] ) , which comprises a torus - like nanopore connected to two cnt electrodes@xcite . the torus in the figure has an inner pore with a diameter of 1.6 nm , whereas the leads are two ( 6,6 ) armchair nanotubes having a diameter of about 5  . we have selected for our study six short strands of ssdna containing three bases , that are shown in fig . ( [ fig : base - sequences ] ) . we have first relaxed the coordinates of the nucleotides that are threading the pore , using the dft code siesta with a double - zeta basis set and a lda functional@xcite . since the pore diameter is slightly larger than the strand width , the strand and its nucleotides can adopt different conformations and orientations inside the pore . we accumulate snapshots of these different conformations and orientations for each of the six ssdna strands as they trans - locate the pore . for each snapshot , we compute the current - voltage curve and subtract the current for the empty pore @xmath422 . the current averaged over snapshots @xmath423 for each ssdna strand is plotted in fig . ( [ fig : ivcurves - sequences ] ) . the sizable height of the curves demonstrate that the conductance of the pore is sensitive to the gating effect produced by the presence of ssdna strands inside the pore . furthermore , the different behavior of the curves means that , armed with a proper statistical analysis , the sculpturene device can distinguish different nucleotide sequences , so that this kind of device could be utilized potentially as a discriminating dna sensor . curves for each of the six sequences shown in fig . ( [ fig : base - sequences ] ) , where the current has been averaged over different pore - nucleotide relative angles and the current of the empty pore has been subtracted . ]      a large body of experiments in single - molecule electronics is performed using the mechanically - controlled break junction ( mcbj ) technique , in which a metallic strip is pulled slowly until it breaks into two separate pieces . this process enables the formation of electrodes with molecular - scale gaps , which can be bridged by a single molecule . experimentally , these two electrodes are repeatedly pulled away or pushed towards each other . by applying a small bias voltage and recording the current passing through the junction , the low - voltage conductance can be measured as a function of the distance between the electrodes . when the distance is small enough , a single molecule can bridge the gap between the electrodes and its conductance can be measured . in the literature , most theoretical studies are confined to small numbers of ideal geometries and binding configurations . in this section , our aim is to demonstrate that the versatility of gollum allows us to compute whole pulling curves of conductance versus electrode separation .        the single - molecule junction that we discuss here is shown in fig . ( [ fig : pulling - example ] ) and consists of gold ( 111 ) electrodes . the electrodes in the simulation are terminated by pyramids and bridged by a bipyridine molecule . to simulate a stretching process we have created one hundred geometries of the junction , each with a different distance @xmath380 between the center of the end atoms of the two leads . to optimize the atomic arrangement of each of the hundred geometries , we start from an idealized setup consisting of the two pyramids surrounded by vacuum ( e.g. : not attached to the gold leads ) . we place the molecule slightly shifted to one side to break the symmetry and keep an au - n bond - length of about 2  . we then relax the inter - atomic forces with the siesta code using a gga functional@xcite and a double - zeta - polarized basis set until each individual force is smaller than 0.02 ev /  . we keep fixed the atomic positions of the bottom two layers of the pyramids during this geometry optimization . ( [ fig : pulling - geometries ] ) shows four of the hundred relaxed configurations achieved .    ) for four different distances @xmath380 . ] we then reattach the crystalline gold leads , and impose periodic boundary conditions along the plane perpendicular to the transport direction . we use a sz basis for the gold atoms of the leads , together with a simplified pseudo - potential , where only the 6s channel is included to speed up the simulations . however , we use a double - zeta - polarized basis set for the atoms at the gold pyramids and in the molecule . siesta then creates the hamiltonian of each of the hundred junctions that we feed into gollum . figure ( [ fig : pulling - curve ] ) shows the low - voltage conductance @xmath324 versus the electrode separation @xmath380 . this pulling curve shows that during the pulling process the conductance possesses a plateau , in agreement with many experiments using mcbjs . this simulation also reveals that the aromatic rings contact directly the gold surface , therefore increasing the molecule - gold coupling and the molecular conductance .    ) . @xmath324 is measured in units of @xmath325 and plotted as a function of the distance @xmath380 . each of the conductance points displayed correspond to one of the hundred relaxed configurations of the mcbj simulation . the figure also shows the four different distances @xmath380 corresponding to the relaxed geometries displayed in fig . ( [ fig : pulling - geometries ] ) . ] so far , all calculated quantities have been obtained from the modulus squared of the scattering matrix elements . to demonstrate that gollum also provides information about transport properties associated with the phases of the scattering matrix , we now examine an example of a quantum pump . quantum pumps are time - dependent electron scatterers , which are able to transport electrons between two external reservoirs subjected to the same chemical potential . the pump process is adiabatic if the frequency of the pump cycle is smaller than the inverse of the characteristic timescale of the scatterer , the wigner delay time@xcite . experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies of adiabatic quantum pumps have examined the conditions for optimal pumping and the effects of noise and dissipation . adiabatic pumping can be understood in terms of the parametric derivative of the full scattering matrix @xmath409 at fixed chemical potential @xcite . an adiabatically - slowly time - varying scatterer connected by ideal channels to external reservoirs , produces a current @xmath424 pumped into the @xmath110th channel , where @xmath425 is the energy shift matrix defined by @xmath426 with @xmath409 being the full scattering matrix and @xmath427 the fermi energy . pumping can occur if the @xmath428-matrix depends on time through a parameter @xmath429 . hence currents can be expressed in terms of parametric derivatives @xmath430 where @xmath431 is the parametric current entering channel @xmath110 . since gollum gives us access to the full scattering matrix @xmath432 , it offers the possibility of investigating adiabatic pumping in nanostructures . we demonstrate this capability by calculating the charge pumped in a double - walled carbon nanotube nano - electromechanical device shown in fig . ( [ fig : shuttle ] ) @xcite , that mimics the experimental setup of ref . ( ) . since an electron current travelling along the inner tube can cause a chiral outer tube to rotate @xcite , the quantum pump shown in fig . ( [ fig : shuttle ] ) represents the inverse effect , in which rotation of the outer tube causes a current to flow along the inner tube . the position and orientation of the inner tube is kept fixed , while the shorter outer tube rotates slowly . the angle @xmath433 describes the real space rotation angle of the outer tube and also plays the role of the pumping parameter in this system .  surrounds concentrically an inner tube , with an inter - layer spacing @xmath434   corresponding to the van der waals distance . the inner wall remains fixed , while the outer tube is rotated about the tube axis by the angle @xmath433 . a slow variation of @xmath433 results in a parametric current @xmath435 . finite charge can be pumped in one rotational cycle depending on the chiralities of the constituent tubes . ]    to reveal the rich behavior of this family of quantum pumps , fig . ( [ fig : paremplot ] ) shows the parametric current , as a function of the rotational angle @xmath433 for a typical device . depending on the particular angle , charge may be pumped either from left to right or vice versa . the integral of this parametric emissivity within a full parametric cycle of @xmath436 is the number of electrons pumped per cycle .     for a device consisting of a ( 5,5 ) carbon nanotube surrounded by a ( 14,6 ) outer nanotube . the outer tube rotates slowly around the inner one . the contour plot shows the current as a function of the rotational angle @xmath433 measured in degrees and the fermi energy @xmath427 measured in units of the hopping integral @xmath307 between carbon atoms . the orange color indicates charge being pumped from left to right and vice versa . ]    in fig . ( [ fig:14 - 6plot ] ) we show the charge pumped in a ( 5,5 ) carbon nanotube with a ( 14,6 ) outer nanotube rotating slowly about it . the average pumped charge clearly drops by several orders of magnitude as the fermi energy is increased from zero . therefore for a most efficient pumping , the fermi energy should be close to the dirac point . note however , that the pumped charge could again increase if the fermi level is large enough to open another channel . beyond this average behavior , there exist numerous sharp peaks in the pumped charge . the location of these peaks correlates with fabry - perot resonances in the reflection coefficient . this suggests that the largest pumping occurs at those resonances . in other words , when the transmission is high , pumping is low , and vice versa .     through the device discussed in fig . ( [ fig : paremplot ] ) as a function of the fermi energy measured in units of the hopping integral @xmath307 between carbon atoms at the cnts . the green solid line shows the charge pumped towards the left ; the red solid line shown the charge pumped towards the right . at certain energies , the pumped charge is very high . these peaks correlate with the fabry - perot resonances in the reflection coefficient @xmath238 . @xmath238 is shown as a solid blue line . ]      finally , to demonstrate that gollum can handle the disordered systems , we calculate the ensemble - averaged conductivity @xmath12 of a two - terminal system on a square lattice , with leads attached to a disordered scattering region as shown in fig . ( [ fig : bd1 ] ) . the width of the system is @xmath437 unit cells and the length is varied between @xmath438 to @xmath439 unit cells . the conductivity is defined as @xmath440 , where @xmath441 is the transmission from the left lead to right lead evaluated at the fermi energy , @xmath442 ev . the tight - binding hamiltonian of the system has a single orbital per site , with nearest neighbour couplings . @xmath443 the site energies within the leads are @xmath444 ev , while the random site energies within the scattering region are uniformly distributed over the interval @xmath445 $ ] ev .        figure ( [ fig : bd2 ] ) shows the the ensemble - averaged conductivity ( @xmath12 ) and transmission coefficient ( @xmath376 ) for the system shown in fig . ( [ fig : bd1 ] ) . it contains three regions . within the ballistic regime between @xmath446 and approximately @xmath447 , the conductivity increases linearly with length . in the diffusive region ( @xmath448 ) , the conductivity exhibits ohmic behavior and is almost independent of length . finally for @xmath291 greater than 100 , there is a cross over to the anderson localized regime . and transmission coefficient @xmath376 as a function of the number @xmath291 of unit cells in the transport direction , for the two probe square lattice shown in the previous figure . ]      we end this article by showing how the spin - orbit interaction induces gaps at certain band crossings in the one - dimensional electronic structure of infinite nickel chains . these gaps may appear or not depending on the orientation of the atomic spins relative to the axis of the chain . they lead to dips in the transmission coefficient @xmath373 of the chain at the gap energies . we have simulated linear nickel chains using the dft program siesta . the chains have a single atom per unit cell and are oriented along the z - axis . we have used a standard set of pseudopotential parameters , a double - zeta basis set and simple lda for the exchange - correlation potential . we have checked that the electronic structure and @xmath373 are the same for any spin orientation if the spin - orbit interaction is set to zero , as is should due rotational invariance . however , if the spin - orbit interaction is switched on , then a finite yet small magnetic anisotropy barrier appears . we have found that if we choose the atomic spins to lie along the chain axis , then there are no spin - orbit gaps close to the fermi energy . as a consequence , the transmission coefficients with and without the spin - orbit interaction are indistinguishable from each other ( as shown in fig . ( [ fig : ni - chain - so ] ) ) . in contrast , when the atomic spins are oriented in a plane perpendicular to the chain axis , then several small gaps open around the fermi energy . these gaps are seen as dips in fig . ( [ fig : ni - chain - so ] ) .", "we have developed a new quantum transport code , which is fast , easy to use and versatile . this flexibility has been demonstrated by presenting a wide range of example calculations , encompassing charge , spin and thermal transport , corrections to density functional theory such as lda+u and spectral adjustments , transport in the presence of non - collinear magnetism , the quantum - hall effect , kondo and coulomb blockade effects , finite - voltage transport , multi - terminal transport , quantum pumps , superconducting nanostructures , environmental effects and pulling curves and conductance histograms for mechanically - controlled - break - junction experiments . further developments are in the pipeline , including the incorporation of phonon transport . gollum will soon be freely available from the following web site _ http://www.physics.lancs.ac.uk/gollum _ and the authors of this article are available to help potential users access the code . the research presented here was funded by the spanish ministerio de economa y competitividad through the grant fis2012 - 34858 , by the uk epsrc and by the european commission fp7 itn `` molesco '' project no . 606728 vmgs thanks the spanish ministerio de economa y competitividad for a ramn y cajal fellowship ( ryc-2010 - 06053 ) . lo has been supported by the hungarian scientic research fund no . jf wishes to thank useful discussions with n. lorente and a. kormanyos .", "we have described in section ii.a.2 the method employed by gollum to find the surface green s function @xmath259 of each lead . however , the solution of eq .

"conclusions"], "document": ["in the last years gaussian states have received a tremendous interest @xcite@xcite , due to the fact that most quantum operations can be performed with continuous variables , of which gaussian states represent the most important class . the advantage with respect to discrete variables ( qubit ) is that the optical implementation of continuous variables is available and robust . a relevant application of gaussian states is given by quantum communications ( qc ) , which in practice are implemented by coherent states , the most important subclass of gaussian states . often in qc coherent states are not related explicitly to gaussian states @xcite@xcite , but their recent developments lead to a very elegant and powerful theory , so that it seems important to revisit qc using this theory .    in this context we reconsider qc having as information carrier gaussian states and we assume that a finite set ( constellation ) of gaussian states has a special form of symmetry , called _ geometrically uniform symmetry _ ( gus ) . a constellation having the gus is generated starting from a single reference state through a unitary operator , called _ the gus has the advantage , not only of simplifying the theory of qc , but also to derive the optimal decision measurements , otherwise not possible . it is worth to remark that the standard form of gus is enjoyed by almost all constellations considered for practical qc , namely _ phase shift keying _ ( psk ) and _ pulse position modulation _ ( ppm ) . also _ quadrature amplitude modulation _ ( qam ) verifies a generalized form of gus . since we want to establish completely general results , valid for multimode gaussian states , a fundamental preliminary is a clear and compact formulation of the most general gaussian state and of the most general gaussian transformation ( gaussian unitary ) . to this end we follow the theory developed by ma and rhodes in a seminal paper published in 1990 @xcite . this theory has the advantage to handle , through an appropriate algebra of operators , the general @xmath0-mode gaussian states in much the same way as the single  mode gaussian states . substantially it proves that the most general gaussian unitary is given by a cascade combination of a squeezing , a displacement , and a rotation . finally we will prove that , starting from an arbitrary @xmath0-mode gaussian state , we can generate a gus constellation , where the symmetry operator is provided by the rotation operator with an appropriate amount of rotation .    in the literature only qc systems using coherent states have been considered and little attention has been devoted to the appealing possibility of using squeezed states @xcite . to this end we revisit qc , where the main problem is the optimization of quantum detection to achieve the minimum error probability . as known , this problem is very difficult and exact solutions are established only in few cases . to overcome this difficulty , suboptimal solutions are considered , the most important of which is given by the square - root measurements ( srm ) , introduced by hausladen _ at al . _ @xcite and subsequently developed as least square measurement ( lsm ) by eldar and forney @xcite @xcite . this technique is not in general optimal , but gives a good approximation of the optimum ( `` pretty good '' is the judgment given by the authors and very often echoed in the literature ) . the srm / lsm can be applied with any constellation , but in the presence of gus it provides the optimal solution in an easy and explicit form . this holds when the detection is based on pure states ; with mixed states the srm technique is suboptimal , but gives a very accurate overestimate of the error probability , surely better than the quantum chernov bound usually considered with gaussian states @xcite . the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ gauss ] we introduce the @xmath0-mode gaussian states and gaussian transformations and discuss their most general representations in terms of unitary gaussian transformations . section  [ gus ] is devoted to gaussian states equipped with the gus . in section  [ applications ] we present an application of the theory to the quantum detection for ppm , which requires a non trivial analysis in a multimode hilbert space . explicit examples of error probability are carried out considering as quantum carrier in ppm both coherent and squeezed states . we adopt the following notation : @xmath1 denotes transposition , while @xmath2 has the multiple role of adjoint for operators , hermitian conjugation for matrices , and complex conjugation for numbers . the * normalization * follows the notation of @xcite , where in particular the reduced planck constant is set to @xmath3 .", "in an @xmath0-mode bosonic space @xmath4 quantum states are represented in general by density operators @xmath5 . any density operator has an equivalent representation in the _ phase space _ @xmath6 given by a characteristic function and wigner function . in particular , gaussian states are defined with reference to their characteristic and wigner functions , which should have a multivariate gaussian form . for an @xmath0-mode gaussian state with mean @xmath7 and covariance matrix @xmath8 the characteristic function has the following form

gaussian state is often indicated in the form @xmath12 . a _ quantum transformation _ or _ quantum operation _ maps the state of the system @xmath13 into a new state @xmath14 . in general a quantum transformation defines a quantum channel , which may refer to an open system @xcite , while in closed quantum systems the map is provided by a unitary transformation according to @xmath15 a quantum transformation is * gaussian * when _ it transforms gaussian states into gaussian states_. when the gaussian transformation is performed according to the unitary map ( [ t40 ] ) it is called * gaussian unitary*. it can be shown @xcite that gaussian unitaries are generated in the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a hamiltonian , which is a second  order polynomial in the field operators

, which has the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a @xmath24 real matrix and @xmath25 . @xmath23 has the property ( symplectic matrix ) @xmath26 . a symplectic transformation modifies the mean vector @xmath27 and the covariance matrix @xmath8 in the form @xmath28 these are the key results because they allow us to specify a gaussian transformations in terms of the parameters @xmath29 , which `` live '' in the phase space @xmath6 .      in the literature we find a plethora of forms for the gaussian unitaries with specific expressions in the single - mode , in the two - mode and in the @xmath0-mode . here we follow the unified form developed by ma and rhodes @xcite for the @xmath0-mode . this form , using appropriate matrix notations , turns out to have extremely similar algebraic properties as that of the single mode and is very useful to establish general results . there are only three fundamental gaussian unitaries , which are specified by the following unitary operators :

the @xmath36 symmetric matrix @xmath37 can always be written in the forms @xcite @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are @xmath36 hermitian ( in general non commuting ) matrices and @xmath39 is positive semidefinite . a particular case of ( [ u24 ] ) with @xmath41 gives the beam splitter , while the most popular forms of squeezing ( single mode and two - mode ) are particular cases of ( [ u26 ] ) for @xmath42 . note that the above fundamental unitaries are special cases of the general gaussian unitary @xmath43 with @xmath17 a hamiltonian , quadratic in the creation and annihilation operators collected in @xmath44 and @xmath45 . as we shall see below , all gaussian transformations are obtained as combination of these operators , and the corresponding gaussian states are typically generated starting from replicas of vacuum states or of coherent states . we are particularly interested in the cascade combination , where one can switch the order of operators with an appropriate change in the parameters @xcite @xmath46      the importance of the fundamental unitaries lies in the following :    [ p5 ] the most general gaussian unitary is given by the cascade combination of the three fundamental gaussian unitaries : @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , cascaded in any arbitrary order by a proper adjustments of the parameters . the proof can be obtained for the general multimode using the lie algebra : ma and rhodes @xcite , generalizing a previous result obtained for the single mode @xcite@xcite , proved that a unitary operator @xmath50 , where @xmath17 is a general @xmath0-mode quadratic hamiltonian , can be written in the form @xmath51 where the phasor @xmath52 with @xmath53 is irrelevant for the state generation . on the other hand we can apply the switching rules ( [ sra][src ] ) to change the order of the fundamental unitaries in ( [ k16 ] ) , with appropriate modifications of the parameters .    in the phase space a gaussian unitary is equivalent to a symplectic map ( [ t42 ] ) , specified by the pair @xmath29 . the gaussian unitary can always be written in the form @xmath54 , where @xmath55 corresponds to the map @xmath56 and the displacement operator @xmath48 in the phase space provides the displacement @xmath57 , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 ,      the most general gaussian state can be derived by combination of the _ thermal decomposition _ and theorem  [ p5 ] .    in a gaussian state with the pair @xmath60 , the covariance matrix @xmath8 and the mean vector @xmath61 can be handled separately . the covariance matrix @xmath8 is fully described by powerful williamson s theorem , which states that an @xmath0-mode covariance matrix @xmath8 can be decomposed in the form @xmath62 $ } \\label{w2}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is a @xmath64 symplectic matrix and the @xmath65 are positive real values , called the * symplectic eigenvalues * of @xmath8 . application of williamson s theorem gives the so called _ thermal decomposition _ of a gaussian state @xcite , that is , an arbitrary @xmath0-mode zero  mean gaussian state can be generated by the * tensor product of @xmath0 single - mode thermal states * , with covariance matrix @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the @xmath68 identity , and number of thermal photons @xmath69 . in fact , a single  mode thermal state is specified by a covariance matrix @xmath70 , with average photon number @xmath71 . now , according to ( [ w2 ] ) , the @xmath0-mode gaussian state with the diagonal covariance matrix @xmath72 , is given by @xmath73 however , by theorem  [ p5 ] , we know that @xmath55 can be written as the cascade combination @xmath74 or @xmath75 . then , a zero  mean gaussian state with covariance matrix @xmath8 is generated from @xmath76 in the form @xmath77 , where @xmath55 is the unitary operator corresponding to the symplectic transformation @xmath63 of decomposition ( [ w2 ] ) .    a gaussian state with * non  zero mean * is generated by introducing in @xmath78 an appropriate displacement operator . in conclusion , by combination of the previous statements :    [ h4 ] the most general @xmath0-mode gaussian state is generated from thermal state ( [ w8 ] ) by application of the three fundamental unitaries as @xmath79 where the order @xmath80 can be permuted according to ( [ sra])([src ] ) . for the particular case of pure states , the thermal decomposition degenerates into the product of @xmath0 replicas of the vacuum state , say @xmath81 , and then @xmath82 , with @xmath83 . but we can invert the order of squeezing and rotation with the rules ( [ sra])([src ] ) and after the change , @xmath84 . in conclusion :    [ h5 ] the most general @xmath0-mode pure gaussian state is obtained from the @xmath0 replica of the vacuum @xmath81 as @xmath85    in words , the most general @xmath0-mode gaussian pure state is a squeezed  displaced state or a displaced  squeezed state .", "the context of gus is provided by _ qc systems _ where the transmission of classic information uses quantum states as physical carriers . a classical source emits a symbol @xmath86 belonging to a set of @xmath87 elements , @xmath88 , with assigned _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath89 $ ] , @xmath90 . the transmitter ( alice ) encodes the symbol @xmath86 into a quantum state @xmath91 in a _ constellation _ of @xmath87 pure states @xmath92 , and more generally , in a constellation of mixed states with density operators @xmath93 . the receiver ( bob ) performs a quantum measurement from the received state @xmath94 with povm measurement operators @xmath95 . on the basis of the measurement bob estimates the state sent by alice . the _ correct decision probability _ is @xcite @xmath96 the choice of the measurement operators maximizing @xmath97 is a ( generally difficult ) key problem in qc . in particular , if alice uses pure states , i.e. , @xmath98 , according to kennedy s theorem @xcite , the optimal povm have rank one , @xmath99 , where the @xmath100 are called _ measurement vectors _ and ( [ b42 ] ) becomes @xmath101      since the beginning of qc @xcite@xcite particular attention has been paid to constellations enjoying a high degree of symmetry with uniform _ a priori _ probabilities . the interest of this case resides both in the fact that it corresponds to many practical situations and that the optimal measurements is easy to obtain @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . we now define the gus for pure states and we assume equiprobable symbols , @xmath102 , but the definition can be extended to generic a priori probabilities @xmath103 substituting the states with the weighted states @xmath104 or @xmath105 ( see @xcite ) . a constellation of @xmath87 pure states @xmath106 has the _ geometrically uniform symmetry _ when the two properties are verified : 1 ) there exists a unitary operator @xmath107 with the property @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the identity operator of @xmath4 , and 2 ) the @xmath87 states @xmath110 are obtained from a single reference state @xmath111 in the following way @xmath112 the operator @xmath107 , which is given by a @xmath87-th root of the identity operator , is called _ symmetry operator_. thus , in the presence of the gus , the specification of the constellation is limited to the symmetry operator @xmath107 and to the reference state @xmath111 . in addition , it simplifies the quantum decision , because we can choose the povms of the form @xmath99 , where the @xmath100 ( measurement vectors ) have the same symmetry as the states , that is , @xmath113 , @xmath114 . we now investigate the possibility that a constellation of gaussian states have the gus . let @xmath115 be a class of pure quantum states , dependent on a parameter @xmath116 . the class is * closed with respect to rotations * if @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the rotation operator . with such a class we can construct constellations of any order @xmath87 with the gus property . in practice in the single mode we get a @xmath87ary psk constellations , by choosing an arbitrary reference state @xmath119 in @xmath120 and using as symmetry operator @xmath121 . in the multimode a relevant application is given by the ppm ( see below ) . we know that the new state is still gaussian , but we want to find the new parameters @xmath122 and @xmath37 determined by the rotation . we apply relation ( [ src ] ) to get @xmath123 . next we apply ( [ srb ] ) to get @xmath124 . hence @xmath125 but @xmath84 , so that the rotation can be dropped . in conclusion the rotation modifies the parameters in the form @xmath126 and we have :    [ pp2 ] the class of pure displaced  squeezed states is closed under rotations . _ r__otated  displaced  squeezed state can be obtained from a _ _ d__isplaced  squeezed state by modification of the squeeze factor and of the displacement amount as @xmath127    with reference to the class @xmath128 the statement of theorem  [ pp2 ] can be formulated as follows . the class @xmath120 becomes explicitly the class of squeezed displaced states with the correspondence @xmath129 if @xmath130 is an arbitrary value of @xmath116 , after the rotation , the parameter becomes @xmath131 the statement can be reformulated also in the phase space as follows . let @xmath132 be the covariance matrix of the squeezed displaced state @xmath133 , then the rotation provides the change @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the symplectic matrix of the rotation transformation , which is given by @xcite @xmath136      first , the definition of gus can be extended to mixed states as follows . a constellation of @xmath87 density operators @xmath137 has the gus when the two properties are verified : 1 ) there exists a unitary operator @xmath107 with the property @xmath138 and 2 ) the @xmath87 density operators @xmath139 are obtained from a single reference density operator @xmath140 in the following way @xmath141 this extension is in harmony with the fact that with pure states the density operators become @xmath142 . in addition , with the factorization of the density operators , @xmath143 , relation ( [ w42 ] ) gives @xmath144 , which generalizes ( [ c36 ] ) . in the context of optimal decision @xcite the povms can be chosen in the form @xmath145 , where the _ measurement factors _ have the symmetry @xmath146 , @xmath114 .    in terms of the characterization of gaussian states , the previous results obtained for pure states can not be extended straightforwardly to the whole class of mixed gaussian states . in fact the critical point in the proof of theorem  [ pp2 ] is represented by the relation @xmath84 , in which the ground state @xmath81 `` absorbs the rotation '' . this property does not hold when the ground state is replaced by a general thermal state . we remind that a general gaussian channel @xcite is completely specified by a triplet @xmath147 , where @xmath148 and @xmath149 are @xmath150 real matrices and @xmath151 . a gaussian channel transforms the mean @xmath7 and the covariance matrix @xmath8 of an input state @xmath13 in the form @xmath152    to get useful results we have to limit the class of mixed state to a suitable subclass of gaussian states obtained in the following way , which comprises all the cases of interest for the applications . we suppose that a pure gaussian state @xmath153 is sent through a gaussian channel specified by the triplet @xmath147 . at the output the noisy state is still gaussian , but mixed , with a density operator @xmath154 as in fig . [ gq10 ] .     is sent through a gaussian channel specified by the triplet @xmath147 . the state at the output is still gaussian , but in general mixed and described by the density operator @xmath154 . ] we denote by @xmath155 this restricted subclass of gaussian mixed states . [ pp2acnew ] the class of states @xmath156 , obtained at the output of a gaussian channel with input pure gaussian states , is closed under rotations , provided that the matrix @xmath148 commutes with the rotation matrix @xmath135 and @xmath149 has the form @xmath157 , with @xmath158 a scalar . the mean vector is modified as @xmath159 , while the covariance matrix is modified as @xmath160    consider a generic generic pure state @xmath161 in the class @xmath120 with covariance @xmath162 . let @xmath163 be the covariance matrix after the rotation @xmath164 in the class @xmath120 , obtained according to ( [ vrot ] ) . then @xmath165 in fact @xmath166 where @xmath135 verifies the condition @xmath167 . hence the conclusion . this model includes the most relevant cases @xcite @xcite , such as :    1 . the _ classical noise channel _ , which merely adds classical gaussian noise to a quantum state , i.e. , @xmath168 , @xmath169 . the _ lossy ( or attenuation ) channel _ in which @xmath170 and @xmath171 , with @xmath172 so that @xmath173 . this is the model for example for the propagation along an optical fiber , where each photon is lost with probability @xmath174 . the _ amplification channel _ in which @xmath170 and @xmath175 , with the gain @xmath176 , so that @xmath177 . the _ thermal noise channel _ called sometimes also _ attenuation channel _ @xcite , with @xmath170 and @xmath178 , with @xmath172 and @xmath179 , @xmath180 , is the covariance matrix of a thermal state with average photon number @xmath181 . * remark * note that in these channels the assumption is that the parameters are the same for all the @xmath0 modes . in particular , for the thermal noise channel , in all the modes the average number of thermal photons is considered the same . in general , denoting by @xmath182 the thermal contribution in the @xmath183-mode , the matrix @xmath149 in the covariance relation should be modified as @xmath184 however , the assumption @xmath185 is acceptable for ppm or other modulations in quantum communications .", "in this section we recall the quantum detection based on the square - root measurements ( srm ) in general and then in the presence of gus . finally we give an explicit application to ppm .      in the case of pure states , the measurement vectors @xmath186 are chosen with the criterion of making the differences between the states and the measurement vectors , @xmath187 , as small as possible and we look for * the measurement vectors @xmath186 which minimize the quadratic error * @xcite @xmath188 with the constraint of the resolution of the identity @xmath189 .    the evaluation of the measurement vector is obtained computing the inner products @xmath190 between the states of the constellation , thus obtaining the _ gram s matrix _ @xmath191\\;,\\qquad i , j=0 , \\ldots , k-1 % \\qmatrix{\\langle\\gamma_0|\\gamma_0\\rangle & \\ldots & \\langle\\gamma_0| %                                                 \\gamma_{k-1}\\rangle\\cr %                    \\vdots                        & \\ddots & \\vdots            \\cr %                         \\langle\\gamma_{k-1}|\\gamma_0\\rangle & \\ldots &   %            \\langle                  %                  \\gamma_{k-1}|\\gamma_{k-1}\\rangle\\cr}\\;.   \\label{c20x}\\ ] ] then we evaluate , by eigendecomposition , the square root and the inverse square root @xmath192 . the measurement vectors are given explicitly by @xmath193 the transition probabilities result in @xmath194 , from which we obtain the correct decision probability @xmath195 the advantage of the srm method is that it gives explicit results for any constellation , that is , for any modulation format . when the constellation has the gus , the gram s matrix becomes _ circulant_. in fact , the inner products result in @xmath196 and depend upon the difference @xmath197 . this property provides two advantages : 1 ) the performance evaluation becomes easier with the technique of the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) , and 2 ) the corresponding quantum detection becomes optimal @xcite @xcite . the eigendecomposition of the circulant gram matrix is simply given by @xmath198 , where @xmath199 $ ] collects the eigenvalues and @xmath200 is the @xmath201 dft matrix @xmath202 $ ] , @xmath203 , with @xmath204 . moreover , the eigenvalues are given by the dft of the first row of @xmath205 @xmath206 the square roots of @xmath205 are simply obtained as @xmath207 and the transition probabilities are @xmath208 in particular , the diagonal transition probabilities are all equal @xmath209 ^ 2 $ ] , independent of @xmath210 , and the correct decision probability ( [ c29 ] ) becomes explicitly @xmath211 ^ 2\\;. \\label{cz26}\\ ] ] it is possible to obtain the explicit expression of the measurement vectors @xmath212 , given by @xmath213 . the srm method can be extended to mixed states . the preliminary step is the factorization of the density operators @xmath143 and it can be shown @xcite that the measurement operators can be factored as the density operators , @xmath214 , where the rank of @xmath100 is the same of @xmath215 .    in this case the error is considered between the state factors and the measurement factors , @xmath216 . from the factors @xmath215 , we first form the gram matrix @xmath217_{i , j=0,1,\\ldots , k-1}$ ] , then from the square roots @xmath192 we can obtain both the measurement factors @xmath100 and the transition probabilities in a similar way as for the pure states . the srm method always leads to explicit results and , in general , provides a good overestimation of the error probability , also compared with other sub - optimal methods such as the chernoff bound @xcite . pulse position modulation ( ppm ) is widely adopted in free space optical transmission , and is a candidate for deep - space transmission , also in quantum form . here we evaluate the error probability in @xmath87ary quantum optical ppm systems , considering the most general gaussian states .    in the quantum ppm the modulation format and the states belong to a composite hilbert space , given by the tensor product @xmath218 of @xmath87 equal hilbert spaces @xmath219 @xcite@xcite , where @xmath220 has dimension @xmath221 and @xmath222 has dimension @xmath223 @xmath224 considering gaussian states , with the most general squeezed - displaced states , symbolized by @xmath225 , the natural choice for ppm is to associate the symbol 0 to the ground state @xmath226 and to the symbol 1 the generic state @xmath227 . with this choice ( [ w4 ] ) represents a constellation of @xmath87-mode gaussian states . for instance for @xmath228 we have explicitly latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }        note that , without loss of generality we can choose a real displaced parameter @xmath122 , while we let a generic complex squeezing factor @xmath230 . the application of gus to ppm is not trivial because the states are multimode . the symmetry operator @xmath107 is given by @xcite@xcite @xmath231 where @xmath232 is the kronecker s product , @xmath233 is a column vector of length @xmath221 , with null elements except for one unitary element at position @xmath183 and @xmath234 is the @xmath235 identity matrix . then @xmath107 has dimension @xmath223 and the property @xmath236 . now , it is not immediate to see that @xmath107 is a rotation operator , that is , of the form @xmath237 , with @xmath164 an @xmath36 hermitian matrix . to find the `` phase '' @xmath164 we use the eid of @xmath23 written in the form @xmath238 where @xmath239 are the @xmath87 distinct eigenvalues and @xmath240 are @xmath87 orthogonal projectors . in this eid the eigenvalues are known , while the projectors should be evaluated from the the expression ( [ p2a ] ) , which defines a complicate permutation matrix . the alternative is the evaluation through the powers of @xmath107 , @xmath241 . according to this relation , @xmath242 $ ] turns out to be the dft of @xmath243 $ ] . thus , taking the inverse dft one gets @xmath244 , which is easy to evaluate . next we recall that @xmath107 is unitary and therefore it can be written in the form @xmath245 , where @xmath164 is a hermitian matrix . then , by comparison with the eid of @xmath107 we find that the eid of @xmath164 is given by @xmath246 where the eigenvalues become @xmath247 and the projectors are the same as in the eid of @xmath107 . * example * we give an example with @xmath228 and @xmath248 , where the matrices are @xmath249 . the symmetry operator is @xmath250 \\label{qppm}\\ ] ] the projectors @xmath251 $ ] are obtained by the dft of @xmath252 $ ] and finally we have the phase matrix @xmath164 from ( [ hk20 ] ) . it reads    @xmath253\\label{phippm}\\ ] ]    we can verify ( e.g. with mathematica ) that @xmath254 and that @xmath255 .      to evaluate the error probability of qc systems with ppm we need the following statistics of the single  mode state @xmath225 :    * the mean photon number , which is given by @xcite @xmath256 then all the @xmath87 ppm symbols have the same _ mean number of photons per symbol _ , given by @xmath257 * the inner product between two states was evaluated by yuen @xcite and reads @xmath258          \\label{yy2}\\ ] ] where @xmath259 , @xmath260 , @xmath261 , @xmath262 , @xmath263 . the analysis of a quantum ppm system ( limited to coherent states ) has been done in a famous article by yuen , kennedy and lax @xcite who found the optimal elementary projectors using an algebraic method developed `` ad hoc '' for this kind of modulation . in @xcite we proposed an original method based on the srm which given the minimum error probability for the gus of the quantum ppm . also in @xcite the analysis was limited to coherent states . here we extend the evaluation to general gaussian states .    in the srm the error probability depends only on the inner product between the single  mode states @xmath225 and @xmath264 . in fact the gram matrix is given by @xmath265 where @xmath266 . the squared inner product can be written in the form @xmath267\\label{gg1}\\ ] ] where @xmath268\\,\\cos\\theta\\ \\;.\\label{fr2}\\ ] ] clearly , for @xmath39 and @xmath122 given , @xmath269 has a minimum for @xmath270 , as shown in fig .

baryonic . evidence for this standard cosmology includes the microwave background anisotropies @xcite and the power spectrum of density fluctuations on galactic scales @xcite . the `` dark matter '' is of unknown composition , but indirect evidence from particle physics and cosmology indicates that it is likely to consist of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) in the mass range 30 gev to 3 tev . such particles would be expected to annihilate slowly in galactic halos . in most wimp models , a large fraction of the annihilation radiation is expected to be gamma rays from the decays of the @xmath0 meson , produced copiously in any energetic interaction involving hadrons .    in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm @xcite , it is well known that structure forms hierarchically : the dark halos of galaxies such as the milky way are expected to contain large numbers of sub - halos . for wimps , the sub - halo mass spectrum is expected to extend down to @xmath1 @xcite . the substructure is expected to be nearly isotropic , thus annihilation in the sub - halos can be away from the galactic plane , where astrophysical sources are concentrated . the brightest source of wimp annihilation radiation is expected to be the galactic center ( gc ) , where the wimps are most concentrated . the hess collaboration has concluded that dark matter annihilation radiation is at most a small fraction of the emission coming from the gc above 100 gev @xcite . the magic collaboration has confirmed these results @xcite . to explain these data in terms of dark matter annihilation , wimps of order 10 tev mass would be required . we will proceed with the plausible assumption that the gc emission is predominantly astrophysical . in fact it has been shown that there is only a narrow window in which dark matter annihilation could be discovered at the gc , given the hess source and its extrapolation below 100 gev @xcite . this emphasizes the point that galactic satellites may be the most promising sources of wimp annihilation radiation . many authors have discussed the possibility of annihilations in galactic substructure @xcite ; in this letter , we will illustrate that wimp annihilation sources are distinguishable from all known ( observed ) astrophysical source classes . the detection of a steady , extended high latitude source with a wimp annihilation spectrum ( e.g.  by the glast satellite ) would provide strong evidence that the dark matter in the galaxy actually consists of particles in the 100 gev mass range , a crucial piece of the dark matter puzzle .", "collisions of relativistic hadrons , such as when cosmic ray protons impinge on the interstellar medium ( ism ) , are typically inelastic . energy is lost mostly to @xmath2 mesons , in roughly equal numbers . the decays of the @xmath0 mesons dominate the gamma rays from hadronic interactions . the @xmath0 has a mass @xmath3 mev , and it has two common decay modes : @xmath4 ( 98.8% ) and @xmath5 ( 1.2% ) with rare modes contributing less than 0.01% . as a pseudoscalar particle , it decays isotropically . the photons emitted in @xmath6 have energies of @xmath7 mev in the @xmath0 rest frame . in the lab frame , the energies are @xmath8 . the isotropy of the decay implies that @xmath9 is uniformly distributed , and thus the spectrum @xmath10 is constant between the minimum and maximum energies @xmath11 . the spectrum @xmath12 is symmetric about @xmath13 , because @xmath14 . the observed spectrum from a source will have this property if the pion distribution is isotropic , true for both wimp annihilation and cosmic ray interactions . the photon spectrum from a single pion energy must be convolved with the pion spectrum . we consider the process @xmath15 , the annihilations of pairs of self - conjugate dark matter particles to pairs of @xmath16 quarks . the process is non - relativistic , giving monochromatic quarks with energy @xmath17 . the quarks each form `` jets '' dominated by @xmath18 mesons . in figure  [ fig : fullspectrum ] we plot the photon spectra from annihilations as calculated by darksusy @xcite , which uses results from pythia @xcite . the spectrum is universal : even @xmath19 gives similar results . only the @xmath20 channel differs appreciably @xcite , but this is difficult to arrange for wimps from supersymmetry .    in figure  [ fig : fullspectrum ] we show the photon spectra from several power - law proton sources as calculated by galprop @xcite . this illustrates that the power - law proton beams typical of astrophysical sources can _ not _ easily mimic the gamma ray spectrum from wimp annihilations .", "the glast satellite @xcite is well suited to measuring gamma rays from dark matter annihilations . it has an effective area of @xmath211 m@xmath22 , a solid angle acceptance of @xmath23 sr , and a point spread function ( psf ) of 0.4@xmath24 at 1 gev energy . it will measure gamma ray energies between 20 mev and 300 gev . most data will be taken in survey mode , mapping the sky with equal coverage with a large duty cycle . the exposure to any source will reach roughly @xmath25 cm@xmath22 s in a 5 year mission . we have estimated the number of milky way dark matter satellites observable by glast . the calculation was performed with the semi - analytic method of  @xcite . the satellite mass distribution has the expected @xmath27 @xcite , cutting off below @xmath28 due to computational limitations . the spatial distribution of satellites is roughly spherically symmetric about the galactic center and extends well beyond the solar orbit , thus the dark matter satellites are located mostly out of the galactic plane . individual sources have nfw density profiles @xcite , with central @xmath29 cusps . satellites with steeper profiles , e.g.  @xcite , would be easier to detect . we find that the brightest sources have masses in the @xmath30 range . these brightest sources have tidal radii of order 100 pc , typically corresponding to @xmath31 on the sky . we note that most of these objects are severely stripped . they have scale radii @xmath32 much larger than their tidal truncation radii @xmath33 , thus they have nearly pure @xmath29 density profiles out to @xmath34 . the surface brightness in gamma rays is proportional to the parameter @xmath35 @xcite . for a stripped nfw clump , at a fixed angular distance from its center , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the distance . if the mass spectrum of clumps is @xmath38 and the tidal radius @xmath39 , the surface brightness of the nearest clump ( @xmath40 ) is @xmath41 . our simulations indicate that @xmath42 and @xmath43 , thus @xmath44 . lower mass clumps are brighter , but they appear smaller ( @xmath45 ) . less massive clumps would be seen as point sources . these results are sensitive to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , thus extrapolations are difficult .    as a fiducial case , we assume a wimp mass of 100 gev and an annihilation cross - section to @xmath48 of @xmath49 @xmath50 s@xmath51 , giving 14.2 photons per annihilation above 1 gev . assuming a 5 year glast mission , and integrating a @xmath31 radius around the source , the number of background counts is 375 ( based on the egret extragalactic background @xcite ) . the typical brightest clump has @xmath52 . for an example of such an object take @xmath53 , 3 kpc distant , tidal radius 50 pc , thus subtending @xmath31 on the sky . the number of signal counts above 1 gev within @xmath31 for 30 , 60 , 100 , 150 , 200 , 300 gev wimps is 3450 , 1680 , 900 , 520 , 345 , 190 respectively . the number of detectable dark matter satellites is shown in figure  [ fig : nclumps ] .", "a pure dark matter galactic satellite has four distinguishing characteristics : hadronic spectrum from monochromatic quarks , spatial extent , lack of variability , and no emission at other wavelengths except for very diffuse inverse compton and synchrotron @xcite . we will focus on the energy spectrum , but we note that a satellite with an nfw profile has a brightness proportional to @xmath54 , meaning equal flux in equal width annuli . with the @xmath55 psf of glast above 1 gev , and the typical @xmath31 size , we expect that the spatial extent should be detectable . naively , emission between @xmath56 and @xmath57 has @xmath58 of the total significance .    to mimic a galactic satellite , a source would need to have a broken power law spectrum , no counterparts in other wavelengths , and degree - scale extended emission constant in time . each of these is exhibited by known sources , but none exhibits them all . a class of such sources would need to have identical spectra ( as measured ) , as dark matter satellites would .    in figures  [ fig : mockdata30]-[fig : mockdata200 ] we plot the spectrum of the typical brightest clump @xmath59 with 30 , 100 , and 200 gev wimps together with fits for several astrophysical source classes . the @xmath60 errors for glast are shown as shaded boxes . in figure [ fig : nclumps ] we illustrate the detection significance required to distinguish dark matter from molecular clouds and pulsars . the gamma ray spectrum from molecular clouds is generated by cosmic ray protons , which have a featureless power - law spectrum over many decades in energy . this is are exactly what is plotted with dotted lines in figure  [ fig : fullspectrum ] . the long dashed lines in figures  [ fig : mockdata30]-[fig : mockdata200 ] show the best fit molecular cloud spectra , ruled out at high confidence in each case . gamma rays from molecular clouds are expected to be extended and non - variable ; it would be comforting to rule out counterparts , e.g. co emission . in fact , glast is likely to detect extended , high - latitude molecular clouds @xcite . gamma ray pulsars are potentially the most problematic of the astrophysical sources . their spectra can be parameterized as @xmath61 $ ]  @xcite . the few known examples have @xmath62 . in fact , most models for gamma ray pulsars require this ( e.g. the outer gap model @xcite ) , but @xmath63 is in principle possible .    the short dashed lines in figures  [ fig : mockdata30]-[fig : mockdata200 ] show the best fit gamma ray pulsar spectra . the @xmath64 spectrum is ruled out except in the 200 gev case , where it is consistent at the 8% level . if the low energy slope @xmath65 , the spectra become nearly impossible to disentangle for any wimp mass . gamma ray pulsars tend to have multi - wavelength counterparts and also tend to be near the galactic plane . a notable exception is 3eg j1835 + 5918 which is located at high latitude , but does have a faint x - ray counterpart  @xcite . the well known radio quiet gamma ray pulsar geminga is located within @xmath66 of the galactic plane . the variability of the pulsar is difficult to determine in a blind search of the period - period derivative plane . to mimic an extended galactic satellite , a cluster of pulsars would be required , with no counterparts in other wavelengths . plerions will typically have multi - wavelength counterparts , especially in x - rays , and are located close to the galactic plane . they are compact sources in x - rays ( @xmath67 ) , but at glast energies they may be detected as extended sources . supernova remnants will have power - law spectra , convincingly ruled out . they will also have multi - wavelength counterparts and are likely to be near the galactic plane . blazars are variable point sources with a power - law gamma ray spectrum , and have counterparts . they contradict all four necessary qualities of dark matter satellite emission .", "we have shown that the brightest dark matter satellites seen by glast should be distinguishable from other known types of astrophysical sources , for wimps less massive than about 150 gev and cross sections of @xmath68 @xmath50 s@xmath51 . sub - substructure could enhance these signals by a factor of a few @xcite , extending the accessible masses and cross sections . dimmer sources ( extended only , to minimize pulsar contamination ) could be stacked , improving the discrimination . any sources mimicking dark matter annihilation would be very interesting , and would be compelling targets for study in a multiwavelength campaign . dark matter sources are excellent targets for imaging atmospheric cerenkov telescopes ( iacts ) . the mass of the wimp must be above the iact analysis threshold , at the present time around 100 gev . the sensitivity of iacts is currently limited by the charged particle background .    a follow - up campaign of 500 hours with an iact of 0.2 km@xmath22 on our brightest clump , taking the 100 gev model , can provide a 5@xmath69 detection of line emission from the process @xmath70 , for a branching ratio of @xmath71 this assumes 99% rejection of hadrons and 15% energy resolution . if the hadron rejection were improved by a factor of 10 , the electron background dominates and line sensitivity improves to @xmath72 . if the electron background were also eliminated , the extragalactic gamma - ray background would limit the sensitivity to @xmath73 . the predicted branching ratio is @xmath74 . obviously , the detection of a line at these energies would demonstrate the existence of particle dark matter . the large hadron collider ( lhc ) may discover a candidate wimp , and measure its mass at the 10% level on a timescale that matches the glast program . a simple estimate shows that glast can constrain the mass at the 25% level , for a 100 gev wimp . if the glast and lhc mass estimates match , the wimp hypothesis would be greatly strengthened . with strong evidence for particle dark matter in hand , including accelerator measurements of cross sections @xcite , it would become possible to map the galactic dark matter in the gamma ray sky . we thank roger blandford , elliott bloom , jim chiang , stephan fegan , stefan funk , joni granot , tune kamae , michael peskin , roger romani , marek sikora and ping wang for comments . this work was supported in part by the department of energy contract de"], "summary": "the nature of the cosmic dark matter is unknown . the most compelling hypothesis is that dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) in the 100 gev mass range . such particles would annihilate in the galactic halo , producing high -

ray spectrum is nearly unique ; separation of the brightest wimp sources from known source classes can be done in a convincing way by including spectral and spatial information . candidate wimp sources can be further studied with imaging atmospheric cerenkov telescopes . finally , large hadron collider data might have a crucial impact on the study of galactic dark matter . slac -

formation , the forming accretion disks are likely to be very massive because of a strong infall from the parent molecular cloud . these massive disks are subject to the development of gravitational instabilities which transport angular momentum outward ( laughlin , korchagin , & adams 1998 ) . in addition , when sufficiently ionized , the disks are also unstable to the mri ( balbus & hawley 1991 , 1998 ) . the simultaneous development of these instabilities in disks may significantly affect their evolution . we have undertaken a study of self - gravitating magnetized tori by means of numerical simulations .    in section 2 , we describe the numerical methods we have used . in section 3 , we present the results of the 2d simulations , focusing on the properties of the mri in a self - gravitating environment . in section 4 , we review preliminary results obtained in 3d calculations , and we discuss the implications of our results in section 5 .", "we used the code zeus-2d ( stone

differencing and the constrained transport method to evolve the magnetic field . the poisson solver used to calculate the gravitational potential @xmath1 involves two steps : we first calculate @xmath1 on the boundary , using the legendre functions well - suited to the cylindrical geometry ( cohl 1999 ) , and we apply the successive over - relaxation method to update @xmath1 everywhere on the grid ( hirsch 1988 ) .", "we have built an initial equilibrium structure using the self  consistent field ( scf ) method ( hachisu 1986 ) . the inner and outer radii of the torus are @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively . we set the angular velocity @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the cylindrical radius . a central mass having half the mass of the disk is present . the equation of state is adiabatic .    in the following , we compare the evolution of this torus to its zero mass counterpart , the gravitational potential of the latter being only that of a central point mass . at the beginning of the simulation , a weak poloidal magnetic field is added to the equilibrium structure , with the toroidal component of the vector potential being :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the mass density . the components of the magnetic field are then scaled such that the volume averaged ratio of gas to magnetic pressure ( hereafter called @xmath8 ) equals @xmath9 for the self - gravitating model and @xmath10 for the zero mass one . the resolution in both model is @xmath11 in the radial and vertical directions , respectively . we found the mri grows in both models , developing approximately the same maxwell stress ( defined by @xmath12 ) . in the self - gravitating case , the evolution is very similar to what was found in previous non self  gravitating calculations ( e.g. hawley [ 2000 ) ] . namely , the initial linear growth of the instability is followed by a turbulent phase during which angular momentum is transported outward . turbulence then gradually decays because of the anti - dynamo theorem . we show in figure @xmath13 the logarithm of the density field in the @xmath14 plane during the turbulent phase for both models . in the self - gravitating case ( _ left panel _ ) , the initial torus has developed a two - component structure , composed of an inner thin disk fed by an outer thick , massive torus . figure @xmath15 shows the angular momentum @xmath16 radial profile in the equatorial plane during this phase ( _ solid line _ ) . as shown by the dashed line , the inner disk is in keplerian rotation around the central mass . the dotted line is a fit of the outer part of the disk with a power law dependence @xmath17 , very close to the mestel profile @xmath18 . coming back to figure @xmath13 , the comparison between both models is striking : although the maxwell stress is similar in the two cases , the self - gravitating torus presents a much more featureless structure than its zero mass counterpart . this result is due to the large scale coherence of the self - gravitating potential , which smoothes mri fluctuations . we shall see that this effect persists in 3d .", "in this section , we present the results of our 3d simulations . as above , we have used the scf method to compute the disk model , but with different parameters . here the central mass is twice that of the disk , and the specific angular momentum @xmath16 in the disk is chosen such that    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the mass inside the radius @xmath5 divided by the total disk mass . the density contours of this disk model are shown in figure @xmath21 ( left panel ) . we introduce the toomre parameter @xmath22 defined by :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the sound speed , @xmath25 the epicyclic frequency and @xmath26 the surface density of the disk . linear studies have shown that a disk becomes gravitationally unstable when @xmath22 is of the order of @xmath13 . the radial profile of @xmath22 in our disk model is shown on the right panel of figure @xmath21 . we have @xmath27 over a large range of radii . we therefore expect the disk to be gravitationally unstable . we have performed hydrodynamical simulations to check that our code behaves as expected in this regime . in the simulations presented here , the resolution is @xmath28 in cylindrical coordinates . the azimuthal domain is restricted to @xmath29 $ ] , which prevents the growth of modes with odd values of the azimuthal number @xmath30 . time is measured in units of the orbital period at the initial outer edge of the disk . the time evolution of the fourier component of the density in the equatorial plane is shown in figure @xmath31 for the modes @xmath32 ( from top to bottom ) . the @xmath0 mode grows at the beginning of the simulation and saturates after @xmath31 orbits . the development of this 2  arms spiral structure can be seen on figure  @xmath33 , which shows the logarithm of the density in the equatorial plane after @xmath34 orbits .    during the simulation , matter is driven toward the center of the disk by the gravitational torque associated with the spiral arms . as the surface density in the disk decreases , the toomre @xmath22 parameter increases . as a result , the instability dies away after 8  orbits . these results are in agreement with earlier simulations of similar disks . next , we have performed a 3d mhd calculation of the evolution of the disk in an axisymmetric gravitational potential , i.e. a potential for which we have retained only the @xmath35 component . this prevents the growth of gravitational instabilities and enables us to check the behavior of our code in the mhd regime . the resolution used for this run is @xmath36 and the azimuthal domain is @xmath37 $ ] . a toroidal magnetic field with @xmath38 is added to the equilibrium model . the left panel of figure  6 shows the time evolution of the volume averaged maxwell and reynolds stress tensors . the maxwell stress rises during the early part of the evolution ( corresponding to the linear development of the instability ) before the mri breaks down into turbulence after 4  orbits . the reynolds stress is smaller during the whole simulation . the right panel of figure  6 shows the radial profile of the @xmath39 parameter ( defined as the ratio of the total stress to the thermal pressure ) at the end of the simulation . it has a typical value of a few times @xmath40 , similar to values seen in 3d simulations of zero mass disks starting with similar magnetic field configurations ( steinacker & papaloizou 2002 ) .      in this section , we present the results of the simulation in which both the mri and gravitational instabilities can develop . we include the fourier components of the gravitational potential up to @xmath41 . the toroidal magnetic field that we add to the equilibrium structure is the same as that described in the previous section . for this calculation , the resolution is @xmath42 and the azimuthal domain is @xmath43 $ ] . as expected , we observe the simultaneous appearance of mhd turbulence along with the @xmath0 spiral arm reminiscent of the hydrodynamical calculation . to analyze the angular momentum transport properties , we compare the time evolution of the volume averaged gravitational and maxwell stress tensors obtained in this simulation with that obtained in the runs described above . note that the gravitational stress tensor is defined by :    @xmath44    the left panel of figure  7 shows @xmath45 as a function of time for this simulation ( _ dotted line _ ) and during the hydrodynamical run ( _ solid line _ ) . we can see that the presence of mhd turbulence decreases the strength of the gravitational stress by a factor of about @xmath15 . this result shows that mhd turbulence and the gravitational instability strongly interact with each other . the time evolution of the maxwell stress is shown on the right panel of figure  7 for the full simulation ( _ dotted line _ ) and for the mhd run in an axisymmetric potential ( _ dashed line _ ) . we see that the maxwell stress increases when the gravitational instability develops . this appears to be due to the accumulation of the magnetic field along the spiral arms . when the gravitational instability disappears after about 7  orbits ( because of a decrease of the mass density ) , the maxwell stress goes back to its `` turbulent '' value .    to test the sensitivity of our results to the initial field topology , we have run the same calculation with an initial poloidal magnetic field . we found the same qualitative results .", "we have presented here the first global simulations of massive , magnetized disks .    using 2d axisymmetric numerical simulations , we have shown that the properties of the mri are similar in self  gravitating and zero mass disks . we observe that these disks quickly develop a dual structure composed of an inner thin disk in keplerian rotation around the central mass , and a thicker outer torus whose rotation profile is close to a mestel profile . we have then used 3d simulations to study the angular momentum transport properties in disks when both mhd turbulence and gravitational instabilities are present . we have found that the gravitational instability is affected by the presence of the turbulence : the gravitational stress tensor is decreased by roughly a factor of @xmath15 when compared with hydrodynamical simulations . this results in a smaller mass accretion rate toward the central object . gravitating disks may therefore have a longer lifetime than previously thought . note that the simulations presented here use an adiabatic equation of state . in this case , all the energy generated in shocks and compression is locally converted into heat . this prevents the formation of bound objects by gravitational collapse . the opposite case would correspond to the use of a locally isothermal equation of state , for which all the energy generated is immediately radiated away . several authors ( mayer et al . 2002 , rice et al . 2003 , boss 1997 & 1998 ) have indeed reported gravitational collapse in isothermal calculations of disks , although

dependent response yields valuable information on various processes , like the structural ( maxwell - wagner ) polarization effects @xcite . the polarization is characterized by a variety of the characteristic frequency - dependent changes . while the polarization of biological cells can be investigated by the method of dielectric spectroscopy @xcite , conventional dielectrophoresis and electrorotation ( er ) analyze the frequency dependence of translations and rotations of single cells in an inhomogeneous and rotating external field , respectively @xcite . with the recent advent of experimental techniques such as automated video analysis @xcite as well as light scattering methods @xcite , the cell movements can be accurately monitored . in er , the frequency dependence of the polarization leads to a phase shift between the induced dipole moment and the rotating field , giving rise to a torque acting on the particle which causes the rotation of the individual cell . the phenomenon of er can be developed into a useful technique known as er assay . the er assay combines antibody technology with er to detect analytes in aqueous solutions . the analyte to be detected is bound to a latex bead of known dielectric properties to form the analyte - bead complex , which causes a change in the dielectric properties . the change can be detected by er technique , thus allowing the rapid and accurate detection of analytes in aqueous solutions . this method can be used to detect various analytes , the selection of which can be controlled by the proper choice of binding agents .    in this work , we propose the use of the spectral representation @xcite for analyzing the electrorotation of particles in suspensions . the spectral representation is a rigorous mathematical formalism of the effective dielectric constant of a two - phase composite material @xcite . it offers the advantage of the separation of material parameters ( namely the dielectric constant and conductivity ) from the cell structure information , thus simplifying the study . from the spectral representation , one can readily derive the dielectric dispersion spectrum , with the dispersion strength as well as the characteristic frequency being explicitly expressed in terms of the structure parameters and the materials parameters of the cell suspension ( see section ii.b below ) . the actual shape of the real and imaginary parts of the permittivity over the relaxation region can be uniquely determined by the debye relaxation spectrum , parametrized by the characteristic frequencies and the dispersion strengths . so , we can study the impact of these parameters on the dispersion spectrum directly . the same formalism has been used recently to study the dielectric behavior of cell suspensions @xcite .    in this connection , we mention alternative methods , namely , by solving the laplace s equation directly and gimsa s approach based on equivalent circuits @xcite . to our knowledge , none of these methods separate microstructure parameters from material information .", "we regard a suspension as a composite system consisting of spherical or spheroidal particles of complex dielectric constant @xmath0 dispersed in a host medium of @xmath1 . a uniform electric field @xmath2 is applied to the composites along the @xmath3-axis . we briefly review the spectral representation theory of the effective dielectric constant to establish notations . the spectral representation is a mathematical transformation of the complex effective dielectric constant @xmath4 . in its original form @xcite , a two - phase composite material is considered , in which inclusions of complex dielectric constant @xmath0 and volume fraction @xmath5 are randomly embedded in a host medium of @xmath1 . the complex effective dielectric constant @xmath4 will in general depend on the constituent dielectric constants , the volume fraction of inclusions as well as the detailed microstructure of the composite materials . the essence of the spectral representation is to define the following transformations . if we denote a complex material parameter = ( 1 - _ 1_2 ) ^-1 , then the reduced effective dielectric constant w()=1 - _ e_2 , can be written as w ( ) = _ n f_n -s_n , [ fs ] where @xmath6 is a positive integer , i.e. , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are the @xmath6-th microstructure parameters of the composite materials @xcite . in eq.([fs ] ) , @xmath10 is a real number , while @xmath8 satisfies a sum rule @xcite : _ n f_n = p , where @xmath5 is the volume fraction of the suspended cells .    as a result , the spectral representation is a useful theory which helps separate the material property from the geometric information . in what follows , we illustrate the spectral representation by the capacitance of simple geometry . in particular , a parallel - plate capacitor is considered as an example . we will discuss two cases , namely , the series combination and the parallel combination .    in the first case , if one inserts a dielectric slab of dielectric constant @xmath0 and thickness @xmath11 , as well as a dielectric of @xmath1 and thickness @xmath12 ( both of the same area @xmath13 ) , into a parallel - plate capacitor of total thickness @xmath14 , the overall capacitance @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , @xmath13 being the area of a plate . on the other hand , we may define the equivalent capacitance as @xmath19 , where @xmath4 is the effective dielectric constant . that is , we replace the composite dielectric by a homogeneous dielectric of dielectric constant @xmath4 . let @xmath20 , we can express @xmath15 in the spectral representation , @xmath21 in accord with the spectral representation , one may introduce @xmath22 , which is in fact the same as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the capacitance when the plates are all filled with a dielectric material of @xmath1 , namely , @xmath25 . thus we obtain @xmath26 from which we find that the material parameter is separated from the geometric parameter . the comparison of @xmath27 with eq.([fs ] ) yields @xmath28 we should remark that @xmath29 obtained herein is just equal to the volume fraction of the dielectric of @xmath0 , and that @xmath30 satisfies @xmath31 , as required by the spectral representation theory . next we consider the parallel combination . if one inserts a material of dielectric constant @xmath0 and area @xmath32 as well as a dielectric of @xmath1 and area @xmath33 ( both of the same thickness @xmath34 ) , into a parallel - plate capacitor of total area @xmath35 , the overall capacitance @xmath15 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 . similarly , after introducing the effective dielectric constant @xmath4 , we may define the overall capacitance as @xmath19 . again , in the spectral representation , let @xmath20 , then @xmath39 writing @xmath23 , we obtain @xmath40 from this equation , the material parameter is also found to be separated from the geometric parameter . it is clear that @xmath41 , i.e. , the volume fraction of the dielectric of @xmath0 , and @xmath42 .      for inclusions of arbitrary shape , the spectral representation can only be solved numerically @xcite . however , analytic solutions can be obtained for isolated spherical and ellipsoidal particles . for dilute suspensions of prolate spheroidal particles , the particles can be regarded as noninteracting . the problem is simplified to the calculation of @xmath9 with a single particle , which can be solved exactly . in fact , the suspension of shell - spheroidal particles dispersed in a host medium is a three - component system . although the spectral representation is generally valid for two - component composites , we have recently shown that it also applies to composites of shelled spheres randomly embedded in a host medium @xcite . similarly , we will show that the spectral representation also applies to the suspension of spheroidal particles of complex dielectric constant @xmath0 coated with a shell of @xmath43 dispersed in a host medium of @xmath1 , where = + /i2f where @xmath44 is the frequency of the applied field . in what follows , we will show that from the spectral representation , one can obtain the analytic expressions for the characteristic frequency at which the maximum electrorotation velocity occurs . the depolarization factors of the spheroidal particles will be described by a sum rule l_z+2l_xy=1 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the depolarization factors along the @xmath3- and @xmath47- ( or @xmath48- ) axes of the spheroidal particle , respectively . in fact , @xmath49 just indicates a spherical particle . the phenomenon of electrorotation is based on the interaction between a time - varying electric field @xmath50 and the induced dipole moment @xmath51 . the dipole moment of the particle arises from the induced charges that accumulate at the interface of the particle . as the prolate spheroidal particles are easily oriented along their long axes by the rotating field , we consider the orientation in which the long axis lies within the field plane @xcite . in fact , the extension of our theory to deal with oblate spheroid is straightforward . in doing so , it suffices to consider @xmath52 and the formlism will remain unchanged .    the angle between @xmath51 and @xmath50 is denoted by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 time and @xmath55 is angular velocity of the rotating electric field . the torque acting on the particle is given by the vector cross product between the electric field and the dipole moment , so that only the imaginary part of the dipole moment contributes to the electrorotation response . in the steady state , the frequency - dependent rotation speed @xmath56 , which results from the balance between the torque and the viscous drag , is given by @xmath57where @xmath58 is the strength of the applied electric field and @xmath59 is a coefficient which is inversely proportional to the dynamic viscosity @xmath60 of the host medium . for spherical cells , @xmath61 . in eq.(7 ) , @xmath62 indicates the imaginary parts of @xmath63 , and the angular brackets denote a time average . since the angular velocity of the rotating field is much greater than the electrorotation angular velocity , i.e. , @xmath64 , the time averages are just equal to 1/2 . for a single shelled spheroidal particle , the dipole factor @xmath65 is given by @xcite _ z= where @xmath48 is the volume ratio of the core to the whole shelled spheroid , while @xmath66 can be obtained by replacing @xmath67 with @xmath46 in eq.(8 ) . we are now in a position to represent @xmath68 and @xmath66 in the spectral representation . let @xmath69 , and assume @xmath70 , we obtain _ z = n.p.+ where @xmath71 denotes the nonresonant part @xcite which vanishes in the limit of unshelled spheroidal cells . in eq.(9 ) , the various quantities are given by @xmath72 note that we have assumed @xmath47 to be a real number , which will be justified below . after substituting @xmath73 into eq.[9 ] , we rewrite @xmath65 after simple manipulations _ z=(n.p.+)+ with @xmath74 and @xmath75 , where @xmath76 similarly , we may rewrite @xmath77 as _ xy=(n.p.+)+ . therefore , we obtain    @xmath78    note that @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are obtained by replacing @xmath67 with @xmath46 in the expressions for @xmath71 , @xmath30 and @xmath29 , respectively .    we have thus predicted that two characteristic frequencies may appear for unshelled or shelled spheroidal particles . previous theories were often limited to spherical particles , i.e. , @xmath49 . therefore , only one characteristic frequency exists . we should remark that even though two characteristic frequencies are predicted , only one of them is dominant ( see below ) .", "the model put forward in the previous section applies to various situations such as biological cells and polystyrene beads , etc . here we perform numerical calculations to investigate the characteristic frequency . let @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the dielectric constant of the vacuum . in fig.1 , we investigate the effect of particle shape on @xmath30 and @xmath86 ( upper panels ) , and @xmath80 and @xmath87 ( lower panels ) , for @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where @xmath90 , and @xmath91 reflects the thickness of the shell ( or coating ) . as is evident from the figure , an increase in the dielectric constant ratio @xmath47 leads to a red - shift of the characteristic frequency . for a certain @xmath47 , a small depolarization factor , i.e. , the particle is largely deviated from spherical shape , may yield a red - shift too .    in fig.2 , we investigate the effect of the depolarization factor on the quantities @xmath92/2 $ ] and @xmath93 $ ] . it is evident that the effect of @xmath66 on the peak is small as @xmath67 is small , whereas it gives a large effect as @xmath67 is large . generally speaking , the dipole moment along the x-(or y- ) axis strongly affects both the location and the magnitude of the peak of rotation speed . for spheroidal particles , only one peak is found , and the other peak predicted by the theory may be too small to observe .    in order to validate our theory , here we considered the spherical particles as a limiting case of our model . in fig.3 , @xmath30 and @xmath94 are plotted versus @xmath47 for a spherical bead ( @xmath95 ) , for different @xmath3 as @xmath96 . for large @xmath47 , the shell thickness has only a minor effect on the characteristic frequency . moreover , a thick shell leads to a red shift ( blue shift ) of the characteristic frequency appearing when @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) . also , all the @xmath94 predicted by different @xmath3 are smaller ( larger ) than that predicted one at @xmath99 ( i.e. , unshelled bead ) for @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) .    at @xmath100 , i.e. , the shell has the same dielectric constant as the host , all the characteristic frequencies predicted by different thickness of shell are the same . similar conclusions can be obtained not only for spherical shape , but also for prolate spheroidal shape ( not shown here ) . we attempt to fit our theoretical predictions with experimental data , which are extracted from an assay @xcite . in this assay , three cases were studied , all dealing with spherical particles : that is , unshelled beads , beads coated with an antibody with specificity for giardia ( shell 1 ) , and beads coated with an antibody with specificity for cryptosporidium ( shell 2 ) . the bead diameter is @xmath101 according to burt et al @xcite , while giardia and cryptosporidium are both @xmath102 in diameter . let @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 ( shell 1 ) and @xmath106 ( shell 2 ) , and @xmath107 ( without shell ) , @xmath108 ( shell 1 ) and @xmath109(shell 2 ) . good agreement between our theoretical predictions and the assay data is shown in fig.4 . from our theory , it is easy to find the corresponding characteristic frequencies at which maximum rotational angular velocity occurs , @xmath110 ( without shell ) , @xmath111 ( shell 1 ) and @xmath112 ( shell 2 ) . from this , we find that the coating leads to a red shift of the characteristic frequency . it is because the dielectric properties of the bead - coating complex have been changed . we used @xmath97 in our fitting , i.e. , @xmath105 and 4.63 for bead coated with an antibody with specificity for giardia and cryptosporidium , respectively . it is known that , for biological cells , such as giardia and cryptosporidium , they have structures such as the cell wall , plasma membrane and the cytoplasm , among which the cell wall has a larger conductivity than the suspending medium . hence , we may safely take @xmath97 .", "here we would like to add some comments . we would like to clarify the assumptions with our model in more detail . in fact , there is only one ( rather than two ) peak for each polarization in our theory . it is because we assumed the ratio of the shell to host dielectric constant @xmath47 to be a real and positive number . if we had retained the ( indeed small ) imaginary part of @xmath47 in our calculation , then we would have two peaks for each polarization . the conductivity - dominated peak would have occured at substantially lower frequency . thus , the neglect of the imaginary part of @xmath47 is to drop the lower frequency peak . moreover , according to our calculations , there is one dominant pole associated with @xmath68 and two ( degenerate ) sub - dominant poles associated with @xmath66 in the spectral representation . thus , for shelled particles in the present work , only one peak has been shown . we developed simple equations to describe the electrorotation of particles in a suspension from the spectral representation . these equations serve as a basis which describe the parameter dependence of the polarization and thereby enhances the applicability of various cell models for the analysis of the polarization mechanisms . in this connection , the shell - spheroidal cell model may readily be extended to multi - shell cell model . however , we believe that the multi - shell nature of the cell may have a minor effect on the electrorotation spectrum .    we have considered the isolated cell case , which is a valid assumption for low concentration of cells . however , for a higher concentration of cells , we should consider the mutual interaction between cells . for a randomly dispersed cells suspension , we may replace the dielectric constant of the host medium by the effective dielectric constant of the whole suspension .    when a strong rotating electric field is applied to a suspension , the induced dipole moment will induce an overall attractive force between the polarized cells , leading to rapid formation of sheet - like structures in the plane of the rotating field . in reality there is a phase shift between the induced dipole moment of the structure and the applied field , and this can lead to electrorotation . however , the situation will be much more difficult than the single - cell case that we have studied because the many - body as well as multipolar interactions between the particles will produce a complicated electrorotation spectrum . fortunately , our recently developed integral equation formalism @xcite can definitely help to solve for the maxwell - wagner relaxation spectrum .    in summary , we have presented a theoretical study of electrorotation assay based on the spectral representation theory . we consider unshelled and shelled spheroidal particles as an extension to spherical ones . from the theoretical analysis , we find that the coating can change the characteristic frequency at which maximum rotational angular velocity occurs . by adjusting the dielectric properties and the thickness of the coating , it is possible to obtain good agreement between our theoretical predictions and the assay data .", "this work was supported by the research grants council of the hong kong sar government under grant cuhk 4245/01p . j. p. h. is grateful to dr . l. gao and dr . c. xu for fruitful discussion . k. w. y. acknowledges the hospitality of prof . hong sun when he visited the university of california at berkeley and useful discussion with prof . g. q. gu .    for a review , see j. gimsa and d. wachner , biophys . j. * 77 * , 1316 ( 1999 ) . j. gimsa , ann . sci . * 873 * , 287 ( 1999 ) . k. asami , t. hanai and n. koizumi , jpn . * 19 * , 359 ( 1980 ) . g. fuhr , j. gimsa and r. glaser , stud . biophys . * 108 * , 149 ( 1985 ) . j. gimsa , p. marszalek , u. lowe and t. y. tsong , biophys . j. * 73 * , 3309 ( 1991 ) . g. de gasperis , x .- b . wang , j. yang , f. f. becker and p. r. c. gascoyne , meas . * 9 * , 518 ( 1998 ) . d. j. bergman , phys . rep . * 43 * , 379 ( 1978 ) . j. lei , jones t. k. wan , k. w. yu and hong sun , phys . e * 64 * , 012903 ( 2001 ) . k. p. yuen and k. w. yu , j. phys . : condens . matter * 9 * , 4669 ( 1997 ) . it is not always necessary that prolate particles orient with their longest axis in the field plane . depending on frequency , object and medium properties also a perpendicular orientation can be observed , see e.g. , j. gimsa , bioelectrochemistry * 54 * , 23 ( 2001 ) . l. gao , jones t. k. wan , k. w. yu and z. y. li , j. phys . : matter * 12 * , 6825 ( 2000 ) . j. p. h. burt , k. l. chan , d. dawson , a. parton and r. pethig , ann . biol . clin . * 54 * , 253 ( 1996 ) ; see also http://www.ibmm.informatics.bangor.ac.uk/pages/science/rot.htm for the basic science of electrorotation ."], "summary": "we have presented a theoretical study of electrorotation assay based on the spectral representation theory . we consider unshelled and shelled spheroidal particles as an extension to spherical ones . from the theoretical analysis , we find that the coating can change the characteristic frequency at which the maximum rotational angular velocity occurs . the shift in the characteristic frequency is attributed to a change in the dielectric properties of the bead -

( @xcite,@xcite or @xcite ) . or , similarly , is it the log of the number of ways , in which the bh might be formed . or is it the log of the number of horizon quantum states ? ( @xcite,@xcite ) . does it stand for information , lost in the transcendence of the hallowed principle of unitary evolution ? ( @xcite,@xcite ) . he then claims that the usefulness of any proposed interpretation of bh - entropy depends on how well it relates to the original `` statistical '' aspect of entropy as a measure of disorder , missing information , multiplicity of microstates compatible with a given macrostate , etc . quite a few workers in the field argue that the peculiar dependence of bh - entropy on the area of the event horizon points to the fact that the degrees of freedom ( dof ) , responsible for bh - entropy , are situated near the event horizon . this seems to be further corroborated by the corresponding behavior of the so - called entanglement entropy , i.e. its ( apparent ) linear dependence on the area of the dividing surface ( cf . , just to mention a few sources , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite or the lively debate in @xcite , concerning entanglement entropy in a more general setting , @xcite,@xcite ) . this linear dependence does however not generally hold without further qualifications . it does in particular not hold for excited states ( see @xcite ) ! that is , while some particular sort of entanglement certainly plays an important role in this context , the real question is in our view the scale of resolution of space - time where this entanglement becomes effective and the nature of the quantum vacuum on this level of resolution . + remark : we want to emphasize the in our view crucial ( but frequently apparently not fully appreciated ) point that the entropy content of a bh is maximal . + we think , the usual version of entanglement , we observe on the scales of ordinary quantum theory , is only an epiphenomenon , representing rather the coarse - grained effect of a hidden structure which lives on a much more microscopic scale . i.e. , we are sceptical whether on such a microscopic scale the quantum vacuum can still be treated in the way of an ordinary quantum field theory vacuum as suggested in some of the papers cited above . we think , the maximum - entropy property of the bh - interior suggests another interpretation . we will come back to this point in more detail in section [ 4 ] ( cf . also the sceptical remarks in some of the review papers by wald , e.g. @xcite ( see in particular sect.6 , open issues ) , @xcite ( see in particular sect.4 , some unresolved issues and puzzles],@xcite ) . as bh - entropy is widely regarded as an observational window into the more hidden and primordial quantum underground of space - time , it should be expected that it can be naturally explained within the frameworks of the leading candidates of such a theory , i.e. , to mention the most prominent , string theory or lqg . for certain extreme situations string theory manages to give an explanation of the bh - entropy - area law . whether the explanation is really natural is perhaps debatable ( it relies in fact on a number of assumptions and correspondences as e.g. peculiar intersections of various classes of p - branes ) . in a sense , it is rather a correspondence between bh - behavior and the configurational entropy of certain string states . to mention some representative papers , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in lqg , on the other hand , it is assumed from the outset ( at least as far as we can see ) that the corresponding dof are sitting at the bh - horizon . therefore the observed area dependence of bh - entropy is perhaps not so surprising ( cf . e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) .    in the enumeration of the most promising candidates for a theory of quantum gravity one approach is usually left out which , we nevertheless think , has a certain potential . one may , for example , tentatively divide quantum gravity candidates into roughly three groups , the relativisation of quantum theory ( with e.g. lqg and causal set theory as members ) , the quantisation of general relativity ( string theory being a prominent candidate ) or third , theories which underlie both general relativity and quantum theory but are in fact more fundamental and structurally different from both and contain these two pillars of modern physics as derived and perhaps merely effective sub - theories , living on coarser scales ( cf . e.g. @xcite ) . in the following we want to develop such a model theory in more detail . as far as we can see , such a philosophy is also shared by  t hooft who emphasized this point in quite a few papers ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) . we quote from @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  it may still be possible that the quantum mechanical nature of the phenomenological laws of nature at the atomic scale can be attributed to an underlying law that is deterministic at the planck scale but with chaotic effects at all larger scales  since , according to our philosophy , quantum states are identified with equivalence classes  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    furthermore :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  it is the author s suspicion however , that these hidden variable theories failed because they were based far too much upon notions from everyday life and ` ordinary physics ' and in particular because general relativistic effects have not been taken into account properly . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    while t hooft usually chooses his model theories from the cellular automaton ( ca ) class , we are adopting a point of view which is on the one hand more general and flexible but , on the other hand , technically more difficult and complex . instead of a relatively rigid underlying geometric substratum in the case of ca ( typically some fixed regular lattice ) on which the ca are evolving according to a given fixed ( typically local ) ca - law , we are employing quite irregular , dynamic geometric structures called by us cellular networks , the main point being that connections ( edges or links ) between the respective nodes or cells can be created or annihilated according to a dynamical law which , in addition , determines the evolution of the local node- and edge - states .    to put it briefly , the ` matter distribution ' ( i.e. the global pattern of node - states ) acts on the geometry of the network ( the global pattern of active edges ) and vice versa . thus , as in general relativity , the network is supposed to find both its internal geometry and its matter - energy distribution with the help of a generalized dynamical law which intertwines the two aspects ( cf . e.g. @xcite or @xcite and further references given there ) . technically , the geometric substructure can be modelled by large , usually quite irregular ( random ) graphs .    to make our point clear , this approach should not be confused with e.g. the spin network approach in lqg or various forms of ( dynamical ) triangulations . our networks are usually extremely irregular and wildly fluctuating on a microscopic scale , resembling rather wheeler s space - time foam , and smooth geometric structures ( as e.g. dimensional notions ) are hoped to emerge via some sort of a geometric renormalisation process ( in fact a very particular organized form of coarse - graining steps ) . some of the interesting deeper mathematical aspects can for example be looked up in @xcite .    in our dynamical network approach to quantum space - time physics the nodes are assumed to represent cells of some microscopic size ( presumably planck size ) , the internal details of which can not be further resolved in principle or are ignored and averaged over for convenience and will be represented instead by a simple ansatz for a local ( node ) state . it can perhaps be compared with the many existing spin - models which are designed to implement certain characteristic features of complex solids . this is more or less the same philosophy as in the ca - framework . the elementary connections between the nodes ( the edges in graph theory ) are assumed to represent elementary interactions or information channels among the cells and also carry simple edge - states . we made a detailed numerical analysis of the behavior of such networks in @xcite . + remark : we would like to emphasize however , that our approach does not really rely on this particular framework . it rather serves as a means to illustrate the various steps in our analysis within a concrete model theory . the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we analyse the basic substratum , i.e. the microscopic patterns of vacuum fluctuations , in particular the negative energy fluctuations . in section [ worm ] we describe the three different roads which lead ( in our view : inevitably ) to the concept of wormhole space . the preparatory sections 2 and 3 are then amalgamated in section 4 into a detailed analysis of the microscopic distribution pattern of short - cuts or wormholes and their consequences for the number of effective dof in a volume of space . we introduce a new type of dimension , the so - called holographic dimension . furthermore , we explain the microscopic basis of the holographic principle in general and the bulk - boundary correspondence between the dof in the interior of e.g. a bh and the dof on the boundary . some apparent counter examples concerning the area - scaling property ( see e.g. @xcite ; wheeler s bag of gold-spacetimes ) are very briefly addressed . in the last section we briefly comment on a number of immediate applications of our microscopic holographic approach and ( open ) problems which can be settled with the help of our framework .", "a characteristic feature of the dynamical network models we investigated is their undulatory character . as a consequence of the feedback structure of the coupling between node ( cell ) states and wiring diagram of edges ( i.e. the pattern of momentary elementary connections or interactions ) the network never settles in a static , frozen final state . the network may of course end up in some attracting subset of phase space but typical are wild fluctuations on a small ( microscopic ) scale with possibly some macroscopic patterns emerging on a coarser scale forming some kind of superstructure ( see e.g. @xcite ) . it is in our view not sufficiently appreciated that , in contrast to most of the other systems being studied in physics , the quantum vacuum is in a state of eternal unrest on a microscopic scale , with , for all we know , short - lived excitations constantly popping up and being reabsorbed by the seething sea .    it therefore seems reasonable to regard our above network model ( investigated in e.g. @xcite to @xcite ) as a ( toy ) model of the quantum vacuum with the energy - momentum fluctuations on short scales being associated with the fluctuations of the local node and edge states .    in the following we adopt the working hypothesis of a parallelism of network behavior and microscopic behavior of the quantum vacuum . we now come to a detailed analysis of the microscopic pattern of vacuum fluctuations . in sect.4 of @xcite we made a calculation which shows that , given the huge number of roughly planck - size grains in a macroscopic piece of space and assuming that the individual grains are allowed to fluctuate almost independently , more precisely , some grain variable like e.g. the local energy , the total fluctuations in a macroscopic or mesoscopic piece of space of typical physical quantities are still so large ( i.e. macroscopic ) that they should be observable . note that with the number of nodes of roughly planck - size , @xmath0 , in a macroscopic volume , @xmath1 , being gigantic , its square root is still very large ( for the details of the argument see @xcite ) . more precisely , with @xmath2 some physical quantity belonging to a microscopic grain ( e.g. energy , momentum , some charge etc . and taking for convenience @xmath3=0 ) and @xmath4 being the observable belonging to the volume @xmath1 , the fluctuation of the latter behaves under the above assumption as @xmath5 with @xmath6 the number of grains in @xmath1 . this is a consequence of the central limit theorem . as such large integrated fluctuations in a macroscopic region of the physical vacuum are not observed ( they are in fact microscopic on macroscopic scales ) , we conclude :    the individual grains or supposed elementary dof do not fluctuate approximately independently . remark : we note that this fact is also corroborated by other , independent observations . we can refine the result further ( cf . @xcite ) by assuming that the fluctuations in the individual grains are in fact not independent but correlated over a certain distance or , more precisely , are short - range correlated . in mathematical form this is expressed as integrable correlations . this allows that `` positive '' and `` negative '' deviations from the mean value can compensate each other more effectively . letting e.g. @xmath7 be the density of a certain physical observable and @xmath8 the integral over @xmath1 . in order that @xmath9 we proved in @xcite that it is necessary that @xmath10    we made a more detailed analysis in @xcite under what physical conditions property ( [ fluc ] ) can be achieved , arriving at the result :    nearly vanishing fluctuations in a macroscopic volume , @xmath1 , together with short - range correlations imply that the fluctuations in the individual grains are anticorrelated in a fine - tuned and non - trivial way , i.e. positive and negative fluctuations strongly compensate each other which technically is expressed by property ( [ fluc ] ) . remark : in @xcite we extended such a vacuum fluctuation analysis and applied it to measurement instruments , being designed to detect ( possibly ) microscopic fluctuations of distances due to passing gravitational waves . we hence infer that the fluctuation pattern of e.g. energy - momentum has to be strongly anticorrelated . but under the above assumption it is possible that the underlying compensation mechanism which balances e.g. the positive and negative energy fluctuations is of short - range type , viz . , individual grain - energies may still fluctuate almost independently if their spatial distance is sufficiently large . we show in the following that the true significance of the so - called holographic principle is it , to enforce a very rigid and long - ranged anticorrelated fluctuation pattern in the quantum vacuum . as we are at the moment only interested in matters of principle , we assume the simplest case to prevail , called the space - like holographic principle ( holding in contexts like e.g. quasi - static backgrounds or asymptotic minkowski - space ; see e.g. the beautiful review @xcite ) .    there exists a class of scenarios in which the maximal amount of information or entropy which can be stored in a spherical volume is proportional to the area of the bounding surface . the same holds then for the number of available dof in @xmath1 . this is the spacelike holographic principle .    in a series of papers brustein et al . developed a point of view that relates typical fluctuation results of quantum mechanical observables in quantum field theory with the area - law - like behavior of entanglement entropy and bh - entropy ( cf . e.g. @xcite ) . we already made a brief remark to this approach in @xcite . we note that we arrived at related results using different methods in another context ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) . as a more detailed comment would lead us too far astray , we plan to discuss this subject matter elsewhere . what we are going to show in the following is that the mechanism leading to the strange area - behavior of the entropy of an enclosed volume , @xmath1 , is considerably subtler as usually envisaged . on the one hand , we will show that the number of elementary dof contained in @xmath1 is in principle proportional to the volume . on the other hand we infer from observations on the macroscopic or mesoscopic scale that the fluctuations of e.g. the energy are strongly anticorrelated . however , as long as this compensation mechanism is short - ranged , we would still have a number of nearly independently fluctuating clusters of elementary dof which again happens to be proportional to the volume as the cluster size is roughly equal to the correlation length . so the conclusion seems to be inescapable that the patterns of vacuum fluctuations must actually be long - range correlated on a microscopic scale . but we showed in @xcite or @xcite in quite some detail that even systems , displaying long - range correlations , will usually have an entropy which is proportional to the volume . a typical example is a ( quantum ) crystal ( @xcite,@xcite ) . it is certainly correct that below a phase transition point a system of particles in the crystal phase has a smaller entropy than in the liquid or gas phase , but still the entropy happens to be an extensive quantity . the reason is in our view that the system develops , as a result of the long - range correlations , new types of collective excitations ( e.g. lattice phonons ) which serve as new collective dof . approximately they may be treated as a gas of weakly interacting elementary modes with the usual extensive entropic behavior . that is , the holographic principle entails that the elementary dof have to be long - range anticorrelated ( cf . also the remarks in @xcite or sect.7 of @xcite ) . but we see that this is only a necessary but not a sufficient property for an entropy - area law to hold . we hence arrive at the preliminary conclusion :    from our preceding arguments and observations we conclude that the holographic principle implies that the fluctuation patterns in @xmath1 are long - range anticorrelated in a fine - tuned way on a microscopic scale and are essentially fixed by the state of the fluctuations on the bounding surface . the dynamical mechanism , which generates these long - range correlations must however , by necessity , have quite unusual properties ( cf . subsection [ bulkboundary ] ) . before we derive the wormhole structure of the quantum vacuum on a primordial scale in the next sections , we continue with the general analysis of the pattern of vacuum fluctuations and derive some useful properties of it .    a particular role is usually played by the energy and its fluctuations furthermore , vacuum fluctuations are frequently discussed together with the so - called zero - point energies . while they are not exactly the same , they are closely related . both occur also in connection with the cosmological constant problem ( to mention only a few sources see e.g. @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .    in the simplest examples like e.g. the quantized harmonic oscillator or the electromagnetic field we have @xmath11 and with @xmath12 in the groundstate , @xmath13 , we have @xmath14 with @xmath15 which follows from @xmath16=-i\\hbar$ ] . in the same way we have in ( matter - free ) qed : @xmath17 with @xmath18 so that again @xmath19 is a sum over pure vacuum fluctuations of the non - commuting quantities @xmath20 and @xmath21 . one should however note that in the quantum field context products of fields at the same space - time point have to be wick - ordered ( in order to be well - defined ) . it is , on the other hand , frequently argued that with gravity entering the stage , these eliminated zero - point energy fluctuations have to be taken into account again . in our view , this problem is not really settled . we now come to an important point . it is our impression that in some heuristic discussions ( vacuum fluctuations as virtual particle - antiparticle pairs ) the consequences of the fact that the vacuum state is an exact eigenstate of the hamiltonian in a hilbert space representation of some quantum field theory are not fully taken into account . i.e. , we have @xmath22 ( provided the ground state energy is for convenience normalized to zero ; note however that this may be problematical in a theory containing gravity ) . eigenstates , however , have the peculiar property that the standard deviation is necessarily zero , @xmath23 according to the standard interpretation of quantum theory combined with spectral theory , @xmath24 , this implies that in each individual observation process the total energy of the vacuum which is , according to conventional wisdom , the ( hypothetical ) sum or superposition of local ( small scale ) fluctuations , happens to be exactly zero . in other words , the elementary fluctuations have to exactly compensate each other in an apparently fine - tuned way . put differently    if there are positive local energy fluctuations , there have to be at the same time by necessity negative energy fluctuations of exactly the same order . that is , at each moment , the global pattern of energy fluctuations in the quantum vacuum is an array of rigidly correlated positive and negative local excitations . remark : note the similarity of this independent observation to what we have said above in connection with the holographic hypothesis . + it should be mentioned that hawking in @xcite invoked exactly this picture of a particle pair excitation near the event horizon with the virtual particle , having negative energy , falling into the bh while the one with positive energy escapes to infinity . it would be useful to get more quantitative information on the spectral properties of the local observables , in particular estimates on negative fluctuations . one could try to make an explicit spectral resolution of these quantities , e.g. of the energy , contained in a finite volume , @xmath1 , but this turns out to be difficult in general , even if one has given an explicit model theory in some hilbert space . as we prefer a more general , model independent approach ( not necessarily based on hilbert space mathematics ) , we proceed by using ( similar to bell in his papers ) a general probabilistic approach which rather exploits the statistics of individual measurement results . unfortunately , we found that the standard estimates , known to us in this context ( e.g. the markov - chebyshev - inequality ) , always go in the wrong direction ( see e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) . therefore we present in the following our own estimate . the strategy is the following . we take an observable , @xmath25 , localized in @xmath1 with , for convenience , discrete spectral values , @xmath26 , and corresponding probabilities denoted by @xmath27 . if we assume that the expectation of @xmath25 is zero ( which can always be achieved by a simple shift ) we have @xmath28 furthermore , we assume its standard deviation in e.g. the vacuum , @xmath29 , to be finite ( which is automatically the case for bounded operators , but we want to include also more general statistical variables ) @xmath30    in a first step we make the simplifying assumption ( taking e.g. a bounded function of the energy )    @xmath31    we are interested in the amount of negative ( e.g. energy ) fluctuations we will observe in measurements . a reasonable quantitative measure of it is @xmath32 with @xmath33 the negative spectral values and their corresponding probabilities . we then have ( with @xmath34 ) @xmath35 for the lhs we have @xmath36 as the expectation of @xmath37 was assumed to be zero . this yields @xmath38 i.e. @xmath39 on the other hand ( cauchy - schwartz ) @xmath40 we hence arrive at the result    if the observable , @xmath37 , is bounded , so that its spectral values fulfill @xmath41 , we have the estimate @xmath42 with @xmath43 the probabilities that the negative spectral values @xmath26 occur in an observation . that is , we manage to bound a quantity , which is difficult to measure directly , by quantities , which are usually more easily accessible . we can generalize this result to situations where the @xmath26 are not exactly bounded by some @xmath44 but are bounded in at least an essential way . we assume that there exists some @xmath44 so that @xmath45 we then have @xmath46    under the above assumption of an essentially bounded @xmath37 we have @xmath47    another , rigorous , but not quantitative , argument can be derived from axiomatic quantum field theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) . it follows from the so - called reeh - schlieder theorem that there are no local observables or fields which can annihilate the vacuum ( where by local we mean that the objects commute for space - like separation ) . i.e. , we have for any local @xmath48 ( with @xmath49 ) @xmath50 we take now as local observable the energy density integrated over a certain spatial region , @xmath1 , @xmath51 one usually normalizes @xmath52 to @xmath53    the classical expression of the energy density , being derived in lagrangian field theory , is positive . the corresponding quantized expression , after a necessary wick - ordering ( see e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) is however no longer positive definite as an operator ( density ) . this can be seen as follows . if the quantized energy density were still positive , one can take the square root ( via the spectral theorem ) of e.g. the positive operator @xmath54 and get : @xmath55 hence @xmath56 as @xmath57 is also a local observable this is a contradiction due to the reeh - schlieder theorem . @xmath54 is not a positive operator , hence its spectrum contains negative spectral values . it is then easy to construct hilbert - space vectors , @xmath58 , so that the measurement of @xmath54 in @xmath58 yields negative values for the local energy . remark : we recently learned that this argument is originally attributed to epstein ( unpublished;@xcite or see @xcite ) , while the derivation which can be found in @xcite is a completely different one . the important message ( in our view ) of all this is that , perhaps in contrast to naive expectation , the quantum vacuum contains a lot of negative energy excitations which globally exactly balance the positive excitations . one may now speculate about the possibility of making use of this observation .", "in this section we want to describe ( very ) briefly and sketchily the three different lines of reasoning which lead us to the concept of wormhole spaces . the first line originated from our investigation of the structure and dynamical behavior of the networks we described above . in e.g. @xcite we analyzed in some quantitative detail the unfolding of the network structure and the various network epochs under the inscribed microscopic dynamical laws and developed the two - level concept of the network structure ( or , rather , a multi - scale structure ) , which , under the right conditions , is relatively smooth on a sufficiently coarse - grained level ( level 2 ) with , among other things , a distant measure ( metric ) of the more ordinary type and ( hopefully ) an integer - valued geometric dimension , while on a more microscopic scale ( level 1 ) the network structure is expected to be very erratic with possibly a lot of links ( elementary interactions or information channels ) connecting regions which may be far apart with respect to the metric on level 2 . the association of these links with microscopic wormholes thus suggests itself ( cf . in particular observation 4.27 in @xcite ) . note furthermore that our network dynamics implies that these translocal connections are dynamically switched on or off . compare this observation with the point of view expounded in e.g. @xcite    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  but if a wormhole can fluctuate out of existence when its entrances are far apart  then , by the principle of microscopic reversibility , the fluctuation into existence of a wormhole having widely separated entrances ought to occur equally readily . this means that every region of space must , through the quantum principle , be potentially `` close '' to every other region , something that is certainly not obvious from the operator field equations which , like their classical counterparts , are strictly local.it is difficult to imagine any way in which widely separated regions of space can be `` potentially close '' to each other unless space - time itself is embedded in a convoluted way in a higher - dimensional manifold . additionally , a dynamical agency in that higher - dimensional manifold must exist which can transmit a sense of that closeness . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the quantitative network calculations in the mentioned papers have mainly been performed within the framework of random graphs . important mathematical tools for the network analysis in the transition from microscopic , strongly fluctuating and geometrically irregular scales to coarse - grained and , by the same token , smoother scales have been the concepts of cliques of nodes , the clique - graph of a graph and an important network parameter which we dubbed intrinsic scaling dimension ( we later learned , @xcite , that this concept plays also an important role in geometric group theory or cayley - graphs where it is called the growth degree ) . to give a better feeling what is actually implied , we give the definitions of clique , clique - graph and internal scaling dimension ( more about graph theory can e.g. be found in @xcite , @xcite , notions and properties of graph dimension were studied in e.g. @xcite ) . a simplex in a graph is a subset of vertices ( nodes ) with each pair of nodes in this subset being connected by an edge . in graph theory it is also called a complete subgraph . the maximal members in this class are called cliques . the clique graph , @xmath59 , of a graph , @xmath60 , is built in the following way . its set of nodes is given by the cliques of @xmath60 , an edge is drawn between too of its nodes if the respective cliques have a non - empty overlap with respect to their set of nodes . graphs carry a natural neighborhood structure and notion of distance . the neighborhood @xmath61 of a node @xmath62 is the set of nodes @xmath63 which can be reached , starting at @xmath62 in @xmath64 consecutive steps , i.e. there exists a path of @xmath64 consecutive edges connecting the nodes @xmath62 and @xmath63 . [ dist]the canonical network or graph metric is given by @xmath65 here @xmath66 is the number of consecutive edges of the path . the above definition fulfills all properties of a metric . thus graphs and networks are examples of metric spaces . [ dim ] let @xmath62 be an arbitrary node of @xmath60 . let @xmath67 denote the number of nodes in @xmath61.we consider the sequence of real numbers @xmath68 . we say @xmath69 is the _ lower _ and @xmath70 the _ upper internal scaling dimension _ of g starting from @xmath62 . if @xmath71 we say @xmath60 has internal scaling dimension @xmath72 starting from @xmath62 . finally , if @xmath73 @xmath74 , we simply say @xmath60 has _ internal scaling dimension @xmath75_.    we proved in @xcite ( among other things ) that this quantity does not depend on the choice of the base point for most classes of graphs . it turns out that this geometric notion is a very effective characteristic of the large - scale structure of graphs and networks . this topic was further studied in greater generality in e.g. @xcite .    in @xcite we developed what we called the geometric renormalization group , to extract important geometric coarse grained , that is , large scale information from the microscopically quite chaotically looking network and its dynamics . the idea is , at least in principle , similar to the block spin transformation in statistical mechanics . that is , certain characteristic properties of the system are distilled from the microscopically wildly fluctuating statistical system by means of a series of algorithmic renormalization steps ( i.e. coarse - graining plus purification ) . the central aim is it to arrive in the end at a system which resembles , on the surface , a classical space - time , or , on the other hand , to describe the criteria a network has to fulfill in order that it actually has such a classical fixed point .    in the course of this analysis we observed ( cf . section viii of @xcite ) that the so - called critical network geometries , i.e. the microscopic network geometries which are expected to play a relevant role in the analysis , are necessarily in a very specific way geometrically non - local , put differently , they have to contain a very peculiar structure of non - local links , or short - cuts , that is , in other words , the kind of wormhole structure , we already described above . relations to non - commutative geometry were established and studied in @xcite . we mention in particular section 7.2 `` microscopic wormholes and wheeler s space - time foam '' and section 8 `` quantum entanglement and quantum non - locality '' . the possible relevance for quantum theory is in fact quite apparent ( as has also been emphasized in the papers by t hooft ) , as these microscopic wormholes may be the origin of the ubiquitous entanglement phenomena in quantum theory . the following figures describe pictorially the nested structure of the cliques of nodes in consecutive renormalization steps and overlapping cliques of nodes , defining the local near - order of physical points together with shortcuts which connect distant parts of the coarse - grained surface structure . a second complex of ( related ) phenomena emerges in the field of small world networks . this is a particular class of networks of apparently quite a universal character ( described and reviewed in some detail , for the first time , in @xcite ) with applications in many fields of modern science . they consist essentially of an ordinary local network with its own local notion of distance superimposed by a typically very sparse network of so - called short - cuts living on the same set of nodes and playing a structural role similar to the microscopic wormholes described above . a typical example ( with dimension of the underlying lattice @xmath76 ) is given in the following figure . some further ( in fact very few ) references , taken from quite diverse fields are e.g. @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . its , in our view , crucial characteristic is the existence of two metrics over the same network or graph . the first , @xmath77 , is defined ( cf . definition [ dist ] ) by taking into account the full set of edges ( i.e. , including the short - cuts ) and a second ( local ) metric , @xmath78 , taking into account only the edges of the underlying local network . it hence holds @xmath79    remark : the metric @xmath78 may then be associated ( after some renormalisation or coarse - graining steps ) with an ordinary macroscopic metric defined on a smooth space ( without wormholes ) like our classical space - time . @xmath77 , on the other hand , should be regarded as a microscopic distance concept which employs the existence of wormholes .    while , on the surface , the origin of this concept of small world networks seems to be quite independent of the wormholes in general relativity , it is the more surprising that on a conceptual meta level various subtle ties do emerge . to mention only one ( in our view ) important observation . in @xcite it is for example shown , that a sparse network of shortcuts superimposed upon an underlying local network , has the propensity to stabilize the overall frequency pattern ( phase locking ) of so - called phase - oscillators which represent the nodes of the networks , the links representing the couplings . the oscillators are assumed to oscillate with ( to a certain degree ) independent frequencies . if we relate these local frequencies with some local notion of time ( or clocks ) , we may infer that ( microscopic ) wormholes create or stabilize some global notion of time !    we now come to the third strand , viz . the real wormholes of general relativity or quantum gravity . we mainly concentrate on the wormholes in true , i.e. lorentzian space - time . euclidean wormholes also ( may ) play an important role and have been discussed extensively in the context of the ( nearly ) vanishing value of the cosmological constant ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) . of particular relevance in the lorentzian context are the so - called traversable wormholes . their study started ( as far as we know ) with two seminal papers by thorne and coworkers ( see @xcite ) . the geometric construction of such solutions is in fact not so difficult if performed by the so - called g - method . that is , one constructs a geometric wormhole , e.g. of the static type , and , in a second step , computes the energy - momentum tensor being consistent with this solution .    giving a rough outline , this can be done in following way . two open balls are removed from two different pieces of e.g. approximately flat 3-space . their boundaries are glued together with the junction being smoothed . as a consequence of the smoothing process a tube emerges interpolating between the two spheres ( see e.g. @xcite ) . it is a remarkable fact that in this process the weak energy condition ( wec ) has to be violated , the latter implying that @xmath80 that is , the matter - energy density is positive in any reference system . put differently ,    in order to get a traversable wormhole , one has to violate the wec . the wec is always satisfied by classical matter . therefore quantum effects are needed . the kind of negative energy needed is also called exotic matter . we showed in quite some detail in the preceding section that the quantum vacuum abounds with negative energy fluctuations . therefore the speculation in section h of the first paper in @xcite does not seem to be too far - fetched . in a next step one can study networks of such traversable wormholes . in @xcite it is speculated that such a network , existing in the early universe , may solve the horizon problem . the same situation was discussed from the point of view of our network approach in section 4.1 ( the embryonic epoch ) of @xcite . all this comes already quite near the general picture we envoked in the beginning of this section . furthermore one can envisage solutions combining black and white holes . this corresponds to some of our networks where the orientation ( direction ) of the links connecting two nodes can change under the dynamics . a review of lorentzian wormholes can be found in the book by visser ( @xcite ) . some other references are e.g. @xcite and @xcite .    the above picture of a hypothetical network of wormholes sitting in the deep structure of the quantum vacuum is beautifully complemented by an approach ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) which investigates within a ( semi)classical approximation the energy of a quantum vacuum state containing such an array of wormholes ( or , rather , a gas of such wormholes ) and compare it with a vacuum state which in zeroth order is flat minkowski space . it comes out ( apparently being a kind of casimir effect ) that the quantum vacuum containing the wormhole gas has in this semiclassical approximation a lower energy compared to the state , being a perturbation of minkowski space . one should note however that this is a first order quantum effect ! anyhow , this observation seems to corroborate the space - time foam picture of e.g. wheeler and we conclude this section with    from our analysis in this and the preceding section emerges a model of the ground state of some preliminary version of quantum gravity which contains as an essential ingredient a network of microscopic wormholes . these wormholes can be created and annihilated and are in our picture the carriers of information between distant parts of classical space - time . we call such a physical structure a wormhole space and regard our cellular or small world networks , discussed above , as models , encoding and representing the typical characteristics of such systems . the typical characteristic is the existence of two types of distance , a microscopic one and an ordinary local one , being similar to ordinary macroscopic metrics on smooth spaces .", "we learned in the preceding sections that two ( presumably crucial ) properties govern the behavior of the quantum vacuum on a microscopic scale . first , the vacuum fluctuations are strongly long - range anticorrelated on a microscopic scale , i.e. there exists a fine - tuned pattern of positive and negative ( energy ) fluctuations . second , a quantum mechanical stability analysis seems to show that the quantum vacuum is pervaded by a network of microscopic wormholes . we argued above that these two features are not independent phenomena but rather are the two sides of the same medal . furthermore , the presumed wormhole structure has been supported by observations coming from other fields of research like e.g. cellular or small - world networks .    in this ( central ) section we will now combine these observations and show that they underlie ( among other things ) the holographic principle and the entropy - area law of bh - thermodynamics . in the following we will use ( for convenience ) the language of our networks with the nodes of the network representing microscopic grains of space ( or space - time ) of roughly planck - size . leaving out other details we treat our quantum vacuum as a wormhole space , i.e. as a ( small world ) network consisting of an ordinary local network structure being superimposed by a ( presumably ) sparse random network with edges consisting of short - cuts , i.e. links , connecting regions of space or space - time , which may be quite a distance apart with respect to the metric , belonging to the underlying local network these short - cuts represent the wormholes of ordinary space - time . the crucial characteristic , from which everything is expected to follow , is the pattern and distribution of these short - cuts being immersed in the underlying local network . that is , we randomly select a node @xmath62 in the network @xmath60 ( @xmath60 standing for graph ) and study the distribution of short - cuts connecting @xmath62 with nodes @xmath63 on spheres of radius @xmath81 around @xmath62 ( measured with respect to some macroscopic metric or the natural metric of the underlying local network ) . we expect that the precise distribution law will depend on the concrete type of space - time we are dealing with . this holds in particular if the space - time is not static . that is , our microscopic approach to holography makes it possible to understand how holography may depend on the concretely given type of space - time ( cf . e.g. the covariant entropy bound of bousso , @xcite ) . remark : we emphasize that the network or the quantum vacuum it is representing , is basically a statistical system with all local dof fluctuating . that means , most of our statements in the following are about mean values or averages over finer statistical details . one can arrive at the law , describing the distribution of short - cuts or wormholes around some arbitrary but fixed generic node ( viz . some fixed place in space - time ) in roughly two ways . one can e.g. motivate the distribution law by appealing to certain fundamental principles like e.g. scale - freeness or absence of a particular and in some sense unnatural length scale on a fundamental level . alternatively , one can show that a reasonable choice leads to far - reaching consequences and corroborates the findings and observations made on a more macroscopic level . to keep the discussion as briefly as possible we adopt in this section the second point of view . in the following we want to concentrate , for the sake of brevity , on a simple type of quantum vacuum , that is , the vacuum belonging to ordinary minkowski space or a space - time which is asymptotically flat ( e.g. a schwarzschild space - time ) . we postpone the analysis of more general space - times as they occur in general relativity . we make the following conjecture :    on the average the number of short - cuts from a central node @xmath62 to nodes @xmath63 , sitting on the sphere , @xmath82 about @xmath62 is independent of @xmath81 . denoting this number by @xmath83 , we hence have @xmath84    remark : as this number is a statistical average , it need not be an integer . + the situation is depicted in the following picture . [ bb ] we will show in subsection [ bulkboundary ] in a detailed quantitative analysis that this result approximately holds as well for nodes , not sitting exactly in the center of the spheres @xmath85 ( see the following picture ) . we denote the cluster of nodes in the ball @xmath86 being connected to an @xmath62 by short - cuts by @xmath87 . we previously introduced the internal scaling dimension of a network ( see definition [ dim ] ) . it roughly describes how fast the network is growing with respect to some base node . as this growth degree is to a large degree independent of the base node ( see e.g. @xcite ) it is a global characteristic of a given network , in fact of a whole class of similar networks ( @xcite ) . it is well known that the generalization of the concept of dimension away from smooth geometric structures is not unique . the above type of dimension has the tendency to grow if additional short - cuts are inserted into a given network geometry . we now introduce another dimensional concept which catches other important network properties being more closely related to the phenomena we want to analyze in this paper . it uses in an essential way the two metrics , @xmath88 , introduced above .    from the above we infer that the number of nodes in the cluster @xmath87 is approximately equal to @xmath89 . furthermore , if the network of short - cuts is very sparse , the clusters @xmath90 with @xmath91 are essentially disjoint ( the overlap is empty or very small ) . this is the phenomenon called _ spreading _ in the theory of random graphs . hence , the following concept is reasonable . we define a holographic dimension , @xmath92 , of a network in the following way . we take some ball @xmath86 with macroscopic radius @xmath81 around some fixed but arbitrary node @xmath62 with respect to the local metric @xmath93 . we then form the @xmath94-neighborhoods around the nodes @xmath95 with respect to the microscopic metric @xmath96 . we construct a minimal cover of @xmath86 by such @xmath97 , i.e. a minimal selection of such @xmath98 s.t . @xmath99 the cardinality of such a minimal set we denote by @xmath100 . we take the limit @xmath81 large or @xmath101 ( in an infinite network ) and define    we call @xmath102 the holographic dimension of the graph ( network ) , provided the limit exists . in the more general situation we can , as in definition [ dim ] , define upper and lower dimensions etc .    as for the previously defined graph dimension , the limit is independent of the selected base point , @xmath62 , if the network or graph is homogeneous on the average or in the large .    due to the sparseness of the embedded subgraph of short - cuts , which yields the spreading property mentioned above , the number @xmath100 scales for the wormhole spaces or small - world networks as @xmath103 with @xmath104 the dimension of the local network or its coarse - grained continuum limit space . proof : the @xmath94-neighborhoods consist of nodes lying in the neighborhoods with respect to the local metric , @xmath93 , @xmath105 , plus the vertices connected by short - cuts with @xmath63 . the cardinality of @xmath105 is independent of @xmath81 and typically ( at least in our models ) a small number . for @xmath101 @xmath106 will therefore consist mainly of nodes connected to @xmath63 by short - cuts . sparseness of the short - cut graph and spreading yield the result . @xmath107    for the type of wormhole spaces or small - world networks , defined above , we then have @xmath108 that is , in this case we have the important result @xmath109    we now come to the holographic principle and the bh - entropy area law . as already mentioned , we discuss in this paper only the example of 4-dim . asymptotically flat ( minkowski ) space - time . in planck units a macroscopic ball , @xmath86 , contains approximately @xmath110 dof or grains of planck size . the typical cluster size is @xmath111 due to the mentioned spreading property the number of ( effectively ) independent cluster in the above minimal cover is approximately @xmath112 with @xmath113 denoting the area of @xmath85 . the number of effectively independent clusters , @xmath114 in @xmath86 is @xmath115 with the typical cluster size @xmath111    to show now that the number of effective dof in a generic volume ( where by generic we mean a region in space with the diameter in all directions being roughly of the same order ) is proportional to the surface area , @xmath116 , of its boundary , we employ a general observation , made e.g. in statistical mechanics . an important tool for the analysis of systems in statistical mechanics are correlation functions . correlations decay usually for large separation of the respective dof , but what is on the other hand certainly the case is , that nearest neighbors are strongly correlated ( near order versus far order ) . we expect that the dof in each of the @xmath117 are strongly correlated . we hence take it for granted , that they act effectively as a single collective dof . remark : it may be possible , that this near order in the immediate neighborhood of the grains can be finally destroyed by the insertion of a huge amount of localized energy , but this does not seem possible with present means . due to the existence of wormholes or short - cuts , distributed in space - time , the number of effective dof ( affiliated with the respective clusters @xmath114 ) in e.g. a ball @xmath86 equals @xmath100 , that is @xmath118    this is the area - law behavior of entropy or number of dof in a volume of space found in e.g. bh - entropy . we note however , that this law , in our formulation , is essentially a statement about the collective behavior of the elementary dof in ( the interior of ) a volume of space . i.e. , the respective dof are not really sitting on the boundary of @xmath1 . as to the details of the bulk - boundary correspondence see the following subsection . if we adopt the entropy - area law of bh - thermodynamics , which is , expressed in planck units , @xmath119 we have the possibility to fix our parameter @xmath120 , which gives the number of wormholes connecting a central grain of space with the grains on a surrounding sphere @xmath85 for any @xmath81 . however , entropy is not exactly identical to number of dof . to relate the two , we have to make a simple model assumption . one frequently makes the assumption of boolean dof , i.e. the dof on an elementary scale are two - valued .    with this assumption we have the relation @xmath121 with @xmath122 the entropy , @xmath123 the number of dof .    with the help of this identification we get @xmath124 which can in qualitative arguments be approximated by one !    that is , in planck units , there exists roughly one short - cut between a central vertex and a surrounding sphere of radius @xmath81 . this shows that on an extremely microscopic scale , the network of short - cuts is indeed very sparse . however the picture changes considerably if we go over to more accessible length scales . if we use , for example an atomic length - scale of e.g. @xmath125 , we have approximately @xmath126 grains of planck - size in a volume element of diameter @xmath127 . if we then choose , instead of a sphere @xmath85 , a spherical shell of radius @xmath81 and thickness @xmath127 we have approximately    the number of wormholes or short - cuts between a central volume element of size @xmath128 and a corresponding spherical shell of radius @xmath81 is approximately @xmath129 which is quite a large number . if we choose for example @xmath130 , we see that roughly @xmath131 grains in the shell are the endpoints of about @xmath132 short - cuts coming from the central volume element of size @xmath128 . if we replace @xmath81 by the approximate diameter of the universe , i.e. @xmath133 ly , we get ( with @xmath134 ) : @xmath135 and for the number of planck - size grains in a spherical shell of this radius : @xmath136 with still @xmath132 short - cuts ending there . that is , only one in @xmath137 grains is the endpoint of a respective short - cut . but if we select a volume element of size @xmath128 in this shell , we have still    the number of wormholes ( short - cuts ) between two volume elements of size @xmath128 being a distance @xmath138 apart , is still the large number @xmath139 that is , even over such a large distance there exist still a substantial number of wormholes connecting the two volume elements . but nevertheless , the network is sparse , viewed at planck - scale resolution . we now come to the last point of this section . from what we have learned above , it is intuitively clear , that the dof sitting on the boundary @xmath85 of e.g. a ball @xmath86 should fix ( or slave ) the dof in the interior . but we note that in order that this can hold , we have to verify our statement made in observation [ bb ] . furthermore , it is of tantamount importance to understand in more quantitative detail the influence of different shapes of the region under discussion and the effect of different space - time geometries . the prerequisites for this enterprise will be derived in the following .    as an example we employ , as we already did above , the simple geometry of the spacelike holographic bound . for reasons of simplicity we place the center of the ball in the origin , i.e. @xmath140 . it is of great help if we can transform the problem into a problem of ordinary continuous analysis . to this end we introduce the probability that a node in the interior of @xmath86 and an arbitrary node on the boundary @xmath85 are connected by a short - cut . with @xmath141 and @xmath142 there spatial euclidean distance in three dimensions is @xmath143    the edge probability is given by @xmath144    here @xmath145 is the number of nodes ( or planck - scale grains ) on the sphere around @xmath146 with radius @xmath147.this follows directly from what we have learned in the previous sections . what we are actually doing in the following is the calculation of the average number of short - cuts between an arbitrary node @xmath146 in the interior of @xmath86 and the nodes on the boundary @xmath85 . this will be done within the framework of random graphs . the above @xmath148 is the so - called edge probability ( for the technical details see @xcite or @xcite,@xcite ) . the sample space is the space of graphs with node set comprising the node in @xmath146 and all the nodes sitting on the boundary @xmath85 and edge set all possible different sets of short - cuts connecting @xmath62 with the nodes on @xmath85 . the probability of each graph in the sample space is calculated with the help of the above elementary edge probability @xmath148 and its dual @xmath149 . we choose @xmath146 arbitrary but fixed in @xmath150 and let @xmath151 vary over the sphere @xmath152 . the integral over @xmath152 will then give the mean number of short - cuts between @xmath146 and the grains on @xmath152 . the guiding idea is that the dof in the interior are fixed by the dof on the boundary if this integral is essentially @xmath153 , as according to our philosophy , developed previously , in that case every node in the interior has on average at least one partner on the boundary as nearest neighbor with respect to the microscopic metric @xmath96 .    to make the integration easier we choose , without loss of generality , @xmath154 with @xmath155 . a straightforward calculation ( using polar coordinates and appropriate variable transformations ) yields for the average number of short - cuts , @xmath156 , @xmath157    note that the integrand @xmath158 is always positive . furthermore , our choice of a coulomb - like law ( in three dimensions ) for the distribution of short - cuts in the previous subsection , i.e. @xmath159 , makes the above integral independent of @xmath81 . we can find a closed expression for the definite integral , i.e. @xmath160 note that the position of the point @xmath146 relative to the center and the boundary can be regulated by the value of the parameter @xmath161 . we have tabulated the integral for @xmath162 from @xmath163 to @xmath164 in the following table . +    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      + we see that the number of short - cuts is almost constant through the whole interior of @xmath86 apart from a thin shell near the boundary . but this is not really surprising because there the main contribution comes from the near side of the boundary and is no longer of a true short - cut character . taking into account the additional prefactor , @xmath165 , in front of the integral which is @xmath166 we have    the number of short - cuts from an arbitrary node @xmath146 in @xmath86 to the boundary @xmath85 is approximately @xmath167 for most of the nodes . furthermore for our coulomb - like distribution law it is independent of the radius of the sphere and is therefore consistent with the expected holographic behavior for this geometry . it is instructive to evaluate the above formula for @xmath168 , i.e. , the influence via short - cuts of the sphere @xmath85 on a dof in the exterior of @xmath85 . for @xmath162 large , the integral is dominated by the first term in the integrand , viz . for @xmath162 large we have @xmath169    for nodes , @xmath62 , lying outside of @xmath85 , the effect of the short - cut connections between @xmath62 and @xmath85 decays like a coulomb - law . that is , the dof in the exterior are no longer fixed by the dof on @xmath85 . what remains instead is a statistical influence in form of a correlation which decays with increasing distance . by the same token , there can not be an entropy - area law for the exterior of the sphere relative to its internal boundary . anyhow , this example does not really contradict the correctness of the spatial holographic principle as being presented in this paper . it would be interesting to relate our findings to the covariant holographic principle of e.g. bousso , @xcite    this simple observation has an important consequence for arguments being sometimes invoked against the general nature of the spatial holographic principle ( cf . e.g. @xcite ) . while we do not intend to discuss the holographic principle for more general space - times in this paper , we mention one counter - example which one finds frequently in the literature , i.e. a universe containing a closed spatial slice , @xmath122 with a small inner subregion , @xmath170 ( see the following picture ) . the area - law in the usual form applies for the subregion @xmath170 relative to its boundary . however , according to our ( microscopic ) version of spatial holography , the dof on the inner boundary can not slave the dof in the large region @xmath171 if the inner boundary becomes too small . they only establish some kind of correlation in the exterior . the quantitative details are given by integrating our coulomb - like influence law over the inner surface . another , related , class of interesting ( but perhaps pathological ) apparent counter examples ( which we plan to address in greater detail elsewhere ) is discussed in e.g. @xcite , i.e. spacetimes which are called by marolf bag - of - gold spacetimes. an essential ingredient is some frw - spacetime hidden in the interior of a region which resembles an ordinary bh . the innner frw - universe has of course an entropy which is proportional to its volume while from the outside the whole configuration looks like a bh . this seeming contradiction can be easily understood with the help of our microsopic holographic law as the frw - spacetime is actually only weakly coupled with the exterior of the bh via wormholes . the technical arguments are the same as above .", "in the preceding sections we developed only the groundwork of our approach . to keep the paper within reasonable size , we had to postpone a more detailed discussion of the many consequences and immediate applications . in this final section we at least undertake to briefly comment on a number of important points . it is however obvious that a more detailed discussion of each point would require a paper of its own . + i ) the possible connections to the ubiquituous phenomenon of entanglement in ordinary quantum theory are obvious . interesting in this respect is e.g. the well - known tension in quantum theory between the locality and causality principle of special relativity and the instantaneous state reduction , accompanying the measurement process ( cf . the respective sections in e.g. @xcite ) . we think , similar to e.g. t hooft , that ( the microscopic form of ) holography ( we developed in this paper ) is the common basis which may unite quantum theory and gravitation . + ii ) the consequences of the bh - entropy being maximal , which is quite uncharacteristic for the ground state entanglement entropy in say ordinary quantum theory , should be further analysed . + iii ) the ads - cft - correspondence is regarded in string theory as the paradigm for bulk - boundary correspondence ( we mention only the review @xcite and the popular account @xcite ) . in it two , at first glance , fundamentally different theories are related to each other , the one living in the bulk , the other living on the boundary at infinity . we must however say that the concrete physical epistemology of this latter notion is not entirely clear to us . the use of boundaries at infinity is wide spread in holography and is mathematically well - defined , in particular for certain well - adapted coordinate systems being in use in hyperbolic geometry . but in general it is rather an asymptotic property and not a concrete place . note that in our approach full information about the interior of a ( spatial ) region is distributed essentially everywhere in the exterior of the region via wormholes , but usually not in the form of another field theory ! + iv ) a virulent problem ( the unitarity problem ) in bh - thermodynamics is the question whether a pure state goes over into a mixed state or not , that is , if the laws of ordinary quantum theory are possibly violated in bh - thermodynamics ( instead of the many published papers we mention only the reviews by wald , cited above ) . this is a quite intricate epistomological problem somewhat similar to the quantum measurement problem . we think , part of the problem is that frequently pure states and mixtures are regarded as complete opposites . but this is not really correct . it is here not the place to go into more details . but in some respect it lies rather in the eye of the beholder . that is , it is the problem of dealing with the complete microscopic information of a state , or rather with some coarse - grained form . note that in our approach microscopic information is widely scattered via short - cuts or wormholes over essentially the whole space . i.e. , it is not fully accessible to a local observer . we recommend the study of some older classics on the ergodic theorem in quantum statistical mechanics ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) . + v ) our analysis should be extended to more general space -

perturbative features and are studied on the lattice ( e.g. at this conference baryon number violating sphalerons have been discussed by @xcite , spontaneous cp violation by @xcite , whereas this contribution mostly studies the out of equilibrium condition ) . it is rather easy to see the necessity of the first two conditions . without baryon number violation no net baryon asymmetry can be generated . c and cp violation are needed to give a direction to the processes . the standard picture concerning the third condition is the turn - off of the baryon number violating rate after the phase transition , which means a smaller sphaleron rate than the hubble rate . inspecting the formula for the sphaleron rate one needs a strong enough phase transition , thus @xmath4 . this ratio is of particular interest and both perturbative and lattice studies have the main goal to determine it . the first - order nature of the ewpt for light higgs bosons can be shown within perturbation theory . however , perturbation theory breaks down for higgs boson masses ( @xmath5 ) larger than about 60 gev due to bad infrared behavior of the gauge - higgs part of the electroweak theory @xcite . solutions of gap - equations even suggest an end - point scenario for the first order ewpt @xcite . numerical simulations are needed to analyze the nature of the transition for realistic higgs bosons . one very succesfull possibility is to construct an effective three dimensional ( 3d ) theory by using dimensional reduction , which is a perturbative step . the non - perturbative study is carried out in this effective 3d model @xcite . the end - point of the phase transition is determined and its universality class is studied @xcite .    another approach is to use 4d simulations . the complete lattice analysis of the sm is not feasible due to the presence of chiral fermions , however , the infrared problems are connected only with the bosonic sector . these are the reasons why the problem is usually studied by simulating the su(2)-higgs model on 4d lattices , and perturbative steps are used to include the u(1 ) gauge group and the fermions . finite temperature simulations are carried out on lattices with volumes @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are the temporal and spatial extensions of the lattice , respectively . systematic studies were carried out for @xmath8 20 gev , 35 gev , 50 gev and 75 gev @xcite . the lattice spacing is basically fixed by the number of the lattice points in the temporal direction ( @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the critical temperature in physical units ) ; therefore huge lattices are needed to study the soft modes . this problem is particularly severe for higgs boson masses around the w mass , for which the phase transition is weak and typical correlation lengths are much larger than the lattice spacing . in this case asymmetric lattice spacings are used @xcite .", "the 4-d su(2)-higgs model is studied on both symmetric and asymmetric @xcite lattices , i.e. lattices with equal or different spacings in temporal ( @xmath11 ) and spatial ( @xmath12 ) directions . the asymmetry of the lattice spacings is given by the asymmetry factor @xmath13 . the different lattice spacings can be ensured by different coupling strengths in the action for time -

point the scaling law @xmath33 . in order to pin down the end - point we are looking for a @xmath34 value for which @xmath35 vanishes . in practice we analytically continue @xmath23 to complex values of @xmath31 by reweighting . small changes in @xmath34 were taken into account by reweighting . the dependence of @xmath35 on @xmath34 @xcite is shown in fig . 1 . to determine the critical value of @xmath34 i.e. the largest value , where @xmath36 , we have performed fits linear in @xmath34 to the non - negative @xmath35 values . = 0.85    in the isotropic case @xcite , we have used @xmath37 . the lee - yang analysis gave @xmath38 for the end - point . performing @xmath39 simulations with the same parameters this can be converted to @xmath40gev . in the anisotropic lattice simulation case @xcite we also performed a continuum extrapolation for @xmath41 ( fig . 2 ) , moving along the lines of constant physics ( lcp ) , and obtained @xmath42 gev , which is our final result for the end - point in the su(2)-higgs model .    based on previous 4d simulation results one can determine the phase diagram of the finite temperature ewpt and compare it with the 3d analysis ( fig . 3 . ) as it has been done in ref . @xcite . the phase transition lines @xmath43 , are in perfect agreement for @xmath44 gev . for strong first order phase transition close to the coleman - weinberg limit the 3d approach seems to be less accurate . the error bars on the endpoints are on the few percent level , thus uncertainty of the dimensional reduction around the end - point is also in this range . this indicates that the analogous perturbative inclusion of the fermions results also in few percent error on @xmath5 . = 1.10    one can determine what is the endpoint value in the full sm . as it was shown previously the perturbative integration of the heavy modes is correct within our error bars . therefore we use perturbation theory to transform the su(2)-higgs model endpoint value to the full sm . we obtain @xmath1 gev , where the dominant error comes from the measured error of @xmath45 . the error on @xmath46 is eliminated by calculating the relationship between the coupling definitions used in perturbation theory ( @xmath47 ) and lattice simulations ( from static potential ) @xcite . the calculation of this relationship and a comparison of the perturbative and lattice results on the ewpt will be shortly discussed in the next section . the full sm result needs some explanation . based on vacuum stability the measured top mass ( @xmath48 gev ) results in a lower bound for the higgs boson mass ( approx . 130 gev ) . this value is higher than the previously mentioned @xmath1 gev . for the pure su(2)-higgs model the endpoint higgs mass is @xmath42 gev . the inclusion of the fermions , especially the top increases the endpoint slightly . for a hypothetical top quark mass less than approximately 150 gev the lower bound is less than @xmath49 gev , thus it is below the endpoint and it gives a reliable theory . increasing the top quark mass the lower bound gets larger than the endpoint . this means that independently of the direct experimental bounds on the higgs boson mass no ewpt exists in the sm .", "despite the fact that the perturbative and lattice approaches are systematic and well - defined , it is not easy to compare their predictions . the reason is that in lattice simulations the gauge coupling constant is determined from the static potential , whereas in perturbation theory the @xmath47 scheme is used . one can calculate the static potential on the one - loop level in the su(2)-higgs model @xcite . as expected the numerical difference between the two conventions is not that large , it is within a few percent , for details see @xcite . with this connection we could perform a precise comparison between the predictions of perturbative and lattice approaches ( fig . 4 ) .    in @xcite the existing lattice data was reanalyzed and a continuum limit extrapolation was performed whenever it was possible . the only quantity which is measured so precisely that the definition of the gauge coupling constant is essential is the ratio of the critical temperature to the higgs boson mass . as it has been observed already for @xmath50 gev the perturbative value of @xmath10 is larger than in lattice simulations . this sort of discrepancy disappears for larger higgs boson masses . a plausible reason for this fact is the convergence of the high temperature expansion used in the perturbative approach .    the most dramatic differences appear clearly as we get closer to the end point . the perturbative approach gives non - vanishing jump of the order parameter , non - vanishing latent heat and interface tension , while the lattice results suggest rapid decrease of these quantities and no phase transition beyond the end - point .", "as it was demonstrated in the previous sections the sm is not suitable for baryogenesis , not even for a first order ewpt . several extended models were studied in order to obtain a stronger first order phase transition and a reliable baryon asymmetry . the most popular model is the mssm , which perturbatively shows a much stronger phase transition than the sm @xcite ( even an intermediate colour breaking phase transition is possible in these scenarios ) . lattice studies in a 3d reduced model ( with one higgs doublet ) basically confirmed the perturbative results @xcite . we performed a 4d lattice study with the bosonic sector of the mssm @xcite . the lattice action is too long to be presented here , thus only the fields involved are listed . both of the higgs doublets , the stop , sbottom scalars and su(2 ) , su(3 ) gauge fields were included . it is of particular importance to keep both of the higgs doublets , since according to the standard scenario the generated baryon asymmetry is directly proportional to the change of the ratio of their expectation values @xmath51 . here the length squared of the higgs field ( @xmath52 ) is integrated over the bubble wall . the ratio of the expectation values of the two higgs fields is @xmath53 , and the difference between the @xmath54 values are taken in the `` symmetric '' and in the `` broken '' phases . we had simulations at @xmath41 and moved along the line of constant physics . our simulation point corresponds to @xmath55 , and the mass of the lightest higgs bosons is approx . 35 gev ( in the bosonic theory ) . two values of @xmath56 were taken ( the physical and a smaller one ) . the physical @xmath56 resulted in @xmath57 , whereas the smaller value of @xmath56 gave a stronger phase transition @xmath58 . perturbation theory predicts just the opposite behaviour ( stop - gluon setting sun graphs are proportional to the strong coupling and they are responsible for the strengthening of the phase transition ) . the reason can be the difference between the renormalization effects in the stop sector . we measured the @xmath54 parameter in both phases at the phase transition . one obtains @xmath59 , @xmath60 , which gives @xmath61 . this result is far below the perturbative prediction @xmath62 .", "the endpoint of hot ewpt with the technique of lee - yang zeros from simulations in 4d su(2)-higgs model was determined . the phase transition is first order for higgs masses less than @xmath42 gev , while for larger higgs masses only a rapid cross - over is expected . the phase diagram of the model was given . it was shown non - perturbatively that for the bosonic sector of the sm the dimensional reduction procedure works within a few percent . this indicates that the analogous perturbative inclusion of the fermionic sector results also in few percent error . in the full sm we get @xmath1 gev for the end - point , which is below the lower experimental bound . this fact is a clear sign for physics beyond the sm . cohen , a. de rujula , s.l . glashow , astrophys . j. 495 ( 1998 ) 539 . kuzmin , v.a . rubakov and m.e . shaposhnikov , phys . b155 ( 1985 ) 36 . d. bdeker , g.d . moore , k. rummukainen , hep -

mass members . the key observational questions of interest in open star cluster research include whether or not mass segregation exists in a given star cluster and , if so , what the extent of this effect is in relation to the cluster s age . for cluster samples as a whole , the similarities and differences of the effects of mass segregation for clusters of various ages , abundances and galactocentric distances are of great interest . all of these properties are related to the formation process as well as the dynamical evolution of clusters . they are also ( sometimes significantly ) influenced by the galactic tidal fields , in particular in the outer regions of a given cluster . young open clusters are important stellar systems for our understanding of the star - formation process . in very young clusters , most of the low - mass stars will still be in their pre - main - sequence ( pms ) evolutionary stage , and one may expect to derive global stellar initial mass functions ( imfs ) that are not yet significantly affected by the effects of stellar and dynamical evolution . however , if a significant amount of `` primordial '' mass segregation ( i.e. , mass segregation intrinsic to the star - formation process itself ) is present , this would seriously complicate the interpretation of an observed stellar luminosity function ( lf ) at a given position within a star cluster in terms of its imf @xcite .    in this paper , we use photographic plate material with longer time baselines than published previously , in order to determine the proper motions and membership probabilities of stars in the regions of two very young galactic open clusters ngc 2244 and ngc 6530 . we aim to quantify the possible effects of mass segregation and place these objects in the context of their expected future evolution . ngc 2244 ( also referred to as ngc 2239 ) is the core ob cluster of the monoceros ob2 ( mon ob2 ) association , embedded in the rosette nebula ( ngc 2237/2246 ) , a well - developed `` blister '' hii region . this system is located in the northwest quadrant of the rosette molecular cloud complex , which itself is one of the most massive giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) complexes in the milky way ( see @xcite ) ; such gmc complexes are particularly conducive to the formation of massive ob stars . because of the strong ionizing radiation from the massive ob stars in the core of ngc 2244 ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a census of the ob stars in the cluster ) , the cluster has excavated the gmc complex , allowing us a deeper look into the cloud than otherwise possible . ngc 2244 represents the youngest of two or three subgroups of ob stars and stellar aggregates in the mon ob2 association @xcite . since ngc 2244 is one of the youngest star - forming open clusters in the milky way , and relatively nearby , it has been the subject of a number of detailed studies . using the webda open cluster database @xcite as our guide , the equatorial coordinates of the cluster center are @xmath3 , and the galactic coordinates @xmath4 , i.e. , the cluster is located quite close to the direction of the galactic anticenter . @xcite , using near - infrared imaging from the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) , estimated a mean visual extinction , @xmath5 mag within a radius of 10 arcmin centered on the apparent center of the hii region . they pointed out that this independent low near - infrared extinction estimate was consistent with previous estimates in the optical , which is also supported by results from co and c@xmath6o maps ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the optical , the most comprehensive extinction analysis for the cluster was published by @xcite , who reported a mean reddening of @xmath7 mag , with a non - negligible amount of differential reddening across the cluster : their reddening values for individual cluster stars range from @xmath8 to 0.98 mag . this is fully consistent with the results of @xcite ; and references therein ) , who found @xmath9 mag from the individual reddening values for 28 cluster member stars brighter than @xmath10 mag , and a smaller amount of differential reddening , ranging from @xmath11 to 0.56 mag . they also found that ngc 2244 is most likely characterized by a `` standard '' reddening law , with a total - to - selective extinction ratio of @xmath12 . as such , we adopt a foregound reddening of @xmath7 mag in this paper .    the distance to ngc 2244 is reasonably well established , at @xmath13 kpc , and generally consistent among different distance indicators used in the literature ( see also @xcite for a review ) . for instance , @xcite obtained @xmath14 pc from the distance moduli of the individual ob - type stars in the cluster . more recently , @xcite derived a distance of @xmath15 kpc to the cluster based on spectroscopic observations of one of the cluster member stars , the eclipsing binary v578 mon ( hd259135 ) . @xcite derived a distance modulus of @xmath16 based on @xmath17 photometry , corresponding to @xmath18 kpc . this larger distance value seems to be favoured by many authors in the field ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and as such we will adopt it here as well .    for the age of ngc 2244 , most authors agree on a value of 24 myr for the main sequence ( ms ) turn - off age ( @xcite and references therein ) . in addition , recently an age estimate of @xmath19 myr was derived from the age of the eclipsing binary v578 mon @xcite . based on high spatial resolution multi - filter photometry of ngc 2244 , @xcite concluded that while most of the cluster stars are aged up to 3 myr , significantly younger low - mass stars ( 5% or more of the cluster stars ) exist in the cluster as well , indicating that star formation is still in progress in the rosette nebula / ngc 2244 region ( see also @xcite , the latter authors found a ms turn - off age of 1.9 myr , but a pre - ms age spread of about 6 myr ) . however , they also note that up to 45% of the cluster stars may be older than 3 myr , thus suggesting an earlier star - forming episode in the region . moreover , the dynamical age of the nebula is just @xmath20 myr @xcite , while the dynamical age of the hi shell is as old as 4 myr ( see @xcite ) . the first proper motion study of this cluster @xcite identified 22 probable members . subsequently , @xcite performed more precise proper motion measurements of 287 stars down to @xmath21 mag and selected 89 stars with membership probabilities , @xmath22 , and data quality , @xmath23 , in an area of @xmath24 arcmin@xmath25 . however , @xcite cautioned that their `` member '' sample may contain several non - cluster members of the mon ob2 association because of the large rectangular field of view employed by the @xcite study compared to the cluster s angular size of @xmath26 arcmin and the roughly spherical shape described by @xcite . using the @xcite astrometric membership determinations , combined with spectroscopically determined stellar mk classifications of 193 stars by @xcite , @xcite redetermined the membership probabilities of the brightest cluster stars ( 30 ob stars and 21 pre - ms members and candidates brighter than @xmath27 mag ) . @xcite and @xcite redetermined the cluster s stellar membership probabilities based on the early astrometric data first analyzed by @xcite . they confirmed 92 ( out of 202 ) stars as physical members of the cluster , with @xmath28 . in this paper , we will analyze high - quality , wide - field photographic plates of shanghai astronomical observatory , with an maximum likelihood algorithm involving careful assessment of the distributions of both the proper motions and the positions , thus allowing us to arrive at a valuable , independent estimation of membership probabilities . ngc 6530 is another prime example of an extremely young open cluster that has been the subject of a number of previous studies . as the core cluster of the sgr ob1 association , it is projected onto the eastern part of the lagoon nebula ( m8 ) , which is one of the brightest nearby nebulae and hii regions @xcite . the lagoon nebula is the illuminated part of the gmc from which the cluster formed by generating a `` blister '' hii region due to the ionizing radiation from its hot massive stars ( e.g. , @xcite . once again , this allows us to probe into the depths of this gmc region much better than would have been possible otherwise . the equatorial coordinates of ngc 6530 are @xmath29 and the galactic coordinates @xmath30 , i.e. , the cluster is located in the direction not far from that of the galactic center . this implies that one has to be very careful in disentangling cluster members from field interlopers ( see also @xcite . as a case in point , in early work on this cluster , @xcite obtained photo - electric magnitudes and colors for 118 stars in the ngc 6530 region and proposed that a band of its low - mass members above the ms in color - magnitude space may be pms stars that are still in the stage of gravitational contraction . it has since been shown ( e.g. , @xcite ) that many of these pms candidates are , in fact , foregound or background field stars ( see the discussions in @xcite , and @xcite ) . subsequently , the properties of this very young cluster have been studied extensively by different authors , leading to an age estimate of 1.53.0 myr @xcite , and the cluster s distance to the sun has been estimated to be in the range from 0.62.0 kpc @xcite . the most recent median age estimate for the cluster , based on ground - based @xmath31 photometry down to @xmath32 mag @xcite is 2.3 myr , i.e. , well inside the range quoted by previous authors , although the same team also derived a much younger median age of 0.8 myr ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for the pre - ms stars ; @xcite ) . both estimates are not necessarily in conflict with each other , because the cluster appears to host stars formed over a significant length of time . while @xcite argued that star formation in the cluster may have been ongoing since a few @xmath33 ago , until the present , @xcite  based on their detailed study of low - mass pms stars  argue that the time - scale for star formation in ngc 6530 must have been much shorter , starting only a few @xmath34 yr ago . nevertheless , this clearly implies that the cluster environment has been an active star - forming environment for a significant period ( see also @xcite ) . more specifically , @xcite conclude , based on a detailed analysis of the distribution of optical / infrared - excess stars throughout the region , that star formation has proceeded rather undisturbed and for a longer period in the northern cluster region than near the cluster center . this is in support of suggestions by @xcite and @xcite that the star - formation activity may have proceeded from north to south in the cluster region , which is further supported by a spatial age segregation analysis by @xcite . the most recent distance estimate to ngc 6530 , based on @xmath31 photometry , was derived by @xcite , @xmath35 pc , corresponding to a distance modulus @xmath36 mag . this is towards the bottom end of the range in possible distances quoted by a variety of authors , @xmath37 pc ( @xcite , their table 1 ) , generally obtained photometrically from the brightest cluster member stars . in contrast , it is significantly larger than the distance obtained from hipparcos parallaxes of seven member stars , @xmath38 pc @xcite . in other recent studies , both @xcite and @xcite determined a best distance estimate to ngc 6530 of @xmath39 kpc [ @xmath40 mag , based on optical photometry and a detailed consideration of the extinction across the cluster ( see also @xcite ) . in this paper , we opt to use the @xcite distance determination , @xmath35 pc . following the webda compilation of cluster parameters , we adopt a mean reddening @xmath41 mag ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , in addition to a foreground reddening of @xmath42 to 0.20 mag @xcite . there is significant variation in reddening across the ngc 6530 region , as is evident from both the distribution of stars in color - magnitude space and from the spatial variation of stellar density ( @xcite , and references therein ) . in fact , the amount of differential reddening ranges from @xmath43 to 0.50 mag across the cluster ( @xcite ; also @xcite , but see @xcite ) , although @xcite also uncovered evidence for the presence of a large number of heavily reddened objects , characterized by @xmath44 mag . @xcite were the first to determine the membership probabilities of 363 stars in a @xmath45 region centered on ngc 6530 from relative proper motion data with a time baseline of 34 years . they found 76 stars with membership probabilities , @xmath46 , greater than 0.5 with @xmath47 mag . more recent studies resulted in firm membership determinations for 451 stars with @xmath48 @xcite , and 237 stars @xcite , the latter study based on spectroscopic observations around the lithium and h@xmath49 lines . @xcite has suggested that the cluster may contain @xmath50 members . it should be noted that a reliable stellar membership determination is crucial for resolved star cluster studies . the shanghai astronomical observatory has in its archives wide - field photographic plates with a long time baseline of these two open clusters , thus providing valuable , independent observational materials for high - accuracy measurements of stellar proper motions , and for the determination of cluster membership . this constitutes a strong starting point for further detailed cluster studies , including those dealing with the effects of mass segregation , as we show in this paper .    in this paper , we use photographic plate material with longer time baselines or higher quality than published previously , in order to determine the proper motions and membership probabilities of stars in the regions of both clusters ( sect . [ obs.sec ] ) . we present a new , detailed investigation of these two clusters based on our membership determination ( sect . [ members.sec ] ) , of their stellar luminosity functions and the observed effects of mass segregation ( sect . [ results.sec ] ) . in sect . [ discussion.sec ] we discuss the clusters in the context of their evolutionary state and summarize the main results obtained in this paper .", "for the open clusters ngc 2244 and ngc 6530 , all photographic plates used for the proper motion reduction were taken by the 40-cm refractor telescope ( with a focal length of 6895 mm ) at the sheshan ( z  s ) station of the shanghai astronomical observatory , operated by the chinese academy of sciences . for ngc 2244 , four plates for each of the first and second epochs were taken in 19631964 , and 19981999 , respectively , spanning a time baseline of 35 years . for ngc 6530 , two first epoch plates and four second plates were taken in 1912 and 1999 , respectively , spanning 87 years . the field of view achieved is @xmath51 and @xmath52 , for the first and second epoch plates , respectively . no filter was used to obtain these plates ; their sensitive wavelength region is close to the @xmath53 band and the 30 min exposure time resulted in a brightness limit of about 16 mag . the stellar coordinates on the plates of both clusters were measured with the photometrics data systems ( pds ) microdensitometer @xcite at the dominion astrophysical observatory ( dao ) in canada . for each plate , raster scanning was performed over the full @xmath54 central regions of the clusters . the scanning diaphragm used had a size of @xmath55 m squared , with both a step length and line separation of @xmath56 m ; a speed of 15 mm s@xmath2 was used . in the region where we performed the full scan , stellar images were extracted and their rectangular coordinates , @xmath57 , obtained using the processing software provided by dao . after the preliminary identification , the measured coordinates on each plate were transformed linearly to a unified system using six plate constants , and those with residual errors @xmath58 m were excluded . the cross - identification resulted in a final set of 498 stars for ngc 2244 and 365 stars for ngc 6530 , respectively , with each star appearing on at least one plate of both the early _ and _ later epochs .", "in the reduction of our proper motion data , an iterative central - overlap technique @xcite was used . for ngc 2244 , 78 tycho-2 stars were selected as reference stars ; their reference positions and proper motions were adopted based on the tycho-2 catalogue @xcite . during the iterative solution , three stars with extraordinarily large residual errors were removed . the final solution provided us with robust position and proper motion data of 495 stars in the cluster region . similarly , 79 tycho-2 catalogue stars were used as reference stars for ngc 6530 , and only 1 star with an extremely large residual error in the iterative solution was removed . this resulted in a total of 364 stars with final position and proper motion values . the internal levels of uncertainty on the position and proper motion of the individual stars are given in table 1 . estimating the membership probability of the observed cluster stars involves a careful assessment of the distributions of both the proper motions and the positions . we assume that in position space the surface number density of the field stars follows a uniform distribution , @xmath59 , while the cluster members approximately follow a gaussian profile ( see , e.g. , @xcite , for a preliminary analysis of the stars in the ngc 6530 region with membership probabilities @xmath60 ) , @xmath61 , with a central density , @xmath62 , and a dispersion , @xmath49 . then , @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the distance of the @xmath65 star to the cluster center . let @xmath66 and @xmath67 be the normalized @xmath59 and @xmath61 , respectively , and @xmath68 . then we have @xmath69 ( by definition ) , and    @xmath70    both the field stars and the cluster members have independent proper motion and position distributions . we assume that the field star proper motion is characterized by an elliptical gaussian distribution , and that of the cluster stars is a circular gaussian function . the overall distribution function for the field stars , @xmath71 , and for the cluster stars , @xmath72 , can then be written as : @xmath73\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath74\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath75 is the reduced proper motion of the @xmath65 star and @xmath76 are the estimated observational errors . @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the distribution centers of the field stars and cluster members in the vector point diagram ( vpd ) , respectively , whereas @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the intrinsic proper motion dispersions of the field stars and the cluster members respectively , and @xmath81 is the correlation coefficient . together with the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath82 , there are 10 parameters awaiting determination . these parameters were estimated by means of a maximum likelihood method . when searching for the maximum of the likelihood function , a bipartition algorithm was adopted @xcite , and the ( internal ) uncertainty of the parameter estimation was evaluated based on the second derivatives of the likelihood function @xcite . in order to get a handle on the external uncertainty of our proper motion determinations , we compared our derived proper motion values to those derived from the tycho-2 catalogue , for the 78 stars in ngc 2244 and the 79 stars in ngc 6530 in common in both data sets . this resulted in a mean deviation of @xmath83 mas yr@xmath2 , with a dispersion of @xmath84 mas yr@xmath2 , in very good agreement with the internal level of accuracy of the tycho-2 catalogue . after the distribution parameters are determined , the membership probability of the @xmath65 star can be calculated as : @xmath85    table 2 gives the maximum likelihood estimates of the distribution parameters , and the corresponding uncertainties , for both clusters . we used the distribution parameters to calculate the membership probabilities of the individual stars in the ngc 2244 and ngc 6530 regions . figure 1 shows the vpd for both ngc 2244 and ngc 6530 ( see also the preliminary analysis by @xcite ; the solid points represent the stars with membership probabilities , @xmath60 , whereas the crosses indicate the @xmath86 . the open circles have @xmath46 values in between these boundaries . the vpds already show that our membership determination appears to be quite effective . to underscore this point , fig . 2 shows the histograms of the membership probabilities ; the left - hand panel is for ngc 2244 and the right - hand panel for ngc 6530 . returning to the clusters vpds , both @xcite and @xcite published vpds for ngc 2244 based on independent proper motion analyses . although their samples of cluster members are much smaller than ours ( of order 100 member stars ) , the vpds are qualitatively similar in extent as well as morphology . we note , however , that in particular the @xcite vpd appears somewhat more elongated in the @xmath87 direction than our vpd in fig . 1 . we will return to this issue below .    from fig . 2 , one can deduce _ quantitatively _ that the discrimination of membership for ngc 2244 is quite effective . of the total of 495 stars , about 16% , or 78 stars , have probabilities in the range of @xmath88 . as an aside , we note that a comparison of the membership histograms in @xcite and fig . 2 shows that our membership determination is more efficient than theirs . meanwhile , for ngc 6530 , the separation of members from the field stars is even more effective , with only a few stars having probabilities around @xmath89 , i.e. , only 4.4% ( or 16 stars ) have @xmath88 ; 451 stars have @xmath60 ( see also @xcite for a discussion of the results in relation to the earlier work by @xcite ) . we note that in the context of ngc 6530 , the @xcite and @xcite studies cover a much smaller field of view ( diameter @xmath90 arcmin ) than our observations presented here ( sect . [ obs.sec ] ) , although at a higher spatial resolution . secondly , the @xcite sample , which  in essence  only covers the cluster core , is fainter ( @xmath91 mag ) than ours ( @xmath92 mag ) . as such there is virtually no overlap between both data sets .", "star counts allow us to statistically determine the properties of clusters with respect to the surrounding stellar background . the cluster radius itself is one of the most important cluster parameters , and particularly useful for dynamical studies . from our results , the member stars of both ngc 2244 and ngc 6530 show an obvious concentration on the sky , while this is clearly not the case for field stars . in essence , this supports the result for ngc 2244 by @xcite based on the cluster s vpd . they determined robust membership probabilities for 92 stars in the area using both the cluster s vpd and its membership probability histogram , akin to our fig . 2 . in the vpd they clearly showed the ( elliptical ) distribution of the proper motions of the cluster members around a centroid , and the very small dispersion of stars with @xmath93 , clearly setting them apart from the field stars , with @xmath94 ( see also @xcite ) . as regards ngc 6530 , @xcite and @xcite provided compelling evidence for the superiority of the membership determinations in the present data set compared to that presented by @xcite .    in order to derive the radial stellar surface density , we first chose the cluster center as the median coordinates of all the member stars with @xmath95 . the adopted centers are at the ( j2000.0 ) equatorial coordinates of @xmath96 for ngc 2244 and @xmath97 for ngc 6530 , respectively . these updated center positions are slightly different from the values provided by webda , although the displacements between our new center coordinates and those provided by webda are well inside the respective cluster core radii ( see below ) . for comparison , @xcite determined the 2mass center position of ngc 2244 as being very close to the centroid determined from our proper motions , resulting in j2000.0 equatorial coordinates of @xmath98 . the radial number density profile , shown in fig . 3 , was constructed by performing star counts inside increasing concentric annuli around the cluster center and normalized by the surface areas covered by the respective annuli . figure 3 shows the radial surface number density profiles of the cluster members @xmath99 and the field stars @xmath100 in our observational fields of view , on the left - hand side for ngc 2244 and on the right - hand side for ngc 6530 . in each panel , the profiles for the cluster members and the field stars are completely different , with the field star distributions essentially flat , whereas the cluster members exhibit obvious concentrations towards the cluster centers . this result shows once again that our membership determinations are reasonably robust and reliable . the basic structural parameters were derived by fitting the two - parameter surface density @xcite profile to our observational data in a least - squares sense . we used fitting radii of 32 and 33 arcmin for ngc 2244 and ngc 6530 , respectively . the core radii thus obtained are @xmath101 arcmin for ngc 2244 and @xmath102 arcmin for ngc 6530 , corresponding to @xmath103 and @xmath104 pc , respectively . meanwhile , the half - number radii ( i.e. , the radii on either side of which half of the member stars are located ) of the clusters were also determined , as 14 arcmin for ngc 2244 and 21 arcmin for ngc 6530 , or @xmath105 and @xmath106 pc , respectively . our main reason for using the clusters half - number radii instead of their half - light radii is practical : the position and proper motion information , eventually leading to membership probabilities , is based on the results from the pds scans . during this process , some of the brightest stars had to be avoided because of saturation effects on the photographic plates ( which would lead to unacceptably large positional uncertainties for our analysis ) . in other words , our sample of cluster members is incomplete at bright magnitudes , and the membership probabilities of the ( few ) brightest stars are unknown . the half - number radii are not significantly affected by the omission of these few stars , which would have an extraordinarily large contribution to the clusters total fluxes , however . although @xcite found that the radial profile in the near - infrared of the ngc 2244 member stars disappears into the background field star population at a radius of about 20 arcmin , our radial profile in fig . 3 clearly shows that we can follow the cluster s profile out to almost 30 arcmin . this is in keeping with the cluster radius of 11.8 pc derived by @xcite , which  at an assumed distance of 1.4 kpc  corresponds to about 29 arcmin . our size determination for ngc 6530 is less clear - cut , as fig . 3 shows : the radial profile composed by its member stars appears to merge with the field star population at a radius of around 20 arcmin , although this value is rather uncertain . we believe , therefore , that our result is in reasonable agreement with the diameter of roughly 35 arcmin quoted by @xcite .    for both clusters , the model profiles tend to roughly follow the observational data points in the outer regions , but not in detail . this suggests that both clusters do not have well - defined outer radii , but are instead characterized by a significant amount of substructure . there is , in fact , strong evidence that ngc 2244 possesses distinct substructures . @xcite , using 2mass near - infrared imaging , found that the cluster is resolved into an extended distribution of stellar sources associated with its compact core in the south center of the blister hii region , but also into a clear elongated density enhancement in the west . 6530 also exhibit distinct substructures : in a region towards the northwest of the actual cluster center there appears to be a density enhancement of slightly older stars than in the rest of the cluster ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in addition , the vpds of both clusters ( fig . 1 ; see also @xcite , in particular ) appear to have axial ratios significantly deviating from unity .    finally , @xcite and @xcite point out that instead of using a @xcite profile , a more appropriate radial density profile might be represented by a @xmath107 profile , following suggestions by @xcite regarding the radial density distributions of embedded star clusters . in fig . 3 , we show the best - fitting @xmath107 profiles for both clusters . for ngc 2244 , the best - fitting profile follows @xmath108 , while the equivalent profile for ngc 6530 is @xmath109 . we note that whereas the fit to the ngc 6530 radial profile is statistically good , the ngc 2244 distribution is better approximated by a king profile . @xcite provided their @xmath110 observations centered on ngc 2244 with the kpno 0.9 m telescope and a tektronix 2048@xmath1112048 ccd , covering a 2800 arcmin@xmath25 area . this resulted in accurate photometric data for a total of 773 stars in the cluster region , down to @xmath112 mag . by matching our photographic plate observations to the @xcite sample using a conservative matching tolerance of 0.3 arcsec , 323 stars in common were identified . furthermore , using a quadratic function , our initial instrumental magnitudes , @xmath113 , were converted to the @xmath53 magnitudes in the @xcite system . as regards ngc 6530 , @xcite performed @xmath31 observations of the ngc 6530 region using the eso 2.2 m telescope at la silla , characterized by a field of view of @xmath114 arcmin@xmath25 . the limiting magnitude of their work is @xmath115 mag . we compared our @xmath113 instrumental magnitudes with the @xmath53 magnitudes of 62 stars in common with @xcite s sample . except for a few stars , we found an obvious linear correlation between the magnitudes , which we used to convert our @xmath113 photometry to the b magnitudes in the @xmath110 system . figure 4 shows the comparison between our instrumental @xmath113 photometry and the @xmath53 magnitudes of @xmath110 system , for both clusters . the photometric uncertainties in both our own data and those taken from the literature are small : @xcite state that their uncertainties are @xmath116 mag for stars brighter than @xmath117 mag , and `` do not become appreciable until @xmath118 mag '' . the photometric uncertainties in the @xcite data have a mean value of 0.02 mag , with a maximum error @xmath119 mag .    for member stars in a given open cluster , all at roughly the same distance , the range in visual magnitudes corresponds to that in luminosity . in addition , when only main - sequence stars are considered , the stellar luminosity is a proxy for the stellar mass . in order to assess the effects of mass segregation , we first examined the luminosity functions of the member stars in different ( radial ) ranges of the clusters . figures 5 and 6 show the @xmath120 luminosity functions of stars with membership probabilities @xmath121 in the two cluster regions . figures 5a ( top ) and b ( middle ) show the luminosity functions of the ngc 2244 cluster members in the inner @xmath122 and outer @xmath123 areas of ngc 2244 , where @xmath124 arcmin is the half - number radius derived from our full sample of 216 member stars . 5c ( bottom ) shows the cumulative distributions for both radial regions . figures 6a ( top ) , b ( middle ) , and c ( bottom ) show the equivalent results for ngc 6530 ( see also @xcite ) . here , we derived a half - number radius of @xmath125 arcmin from our total sample of 250 member stars .    from these two figures , the effects of mass segregation are evident : the relative fraction of brighter stars ( or , equivalently , more massive stars ) is higher in the inner than in the outer regions . as an alternative approach to investigate these mass segregation effects , we calculated the half - number radii for member stars in different absolute magnitude ranges , i.e. , for @xmath126 and @xmath127 mag . the results of this exercise are listed in table 5 ( see @xcite for a complementary discussion related to ngc 6530 ; in particular their table 6 ) . it can be seen that for both clusters , the brighter members are characterized by smaller half - number radii  another indication of the existence of mass segregation in these clusters .    to further examine the mass segregation effects , we also investigated the radial density distributions of member stars ( @xmath95 ) in different luminosity ranges in the clusters , which are shown in figs . 7 ( for ngc 2244 ) and 8 ( for ngc 6530 ) . in each cluster , a position - dependent lf is found . in essence , the fainter ( i.e. , lower - mass ) stars are spread throughout the entire cluster in both objects , while the brighter ( massive ) stars are predominantly located in the inner region . if the mass segregation effects solely result from the process of two - body relaxation and the associated energy equipartition , one should find some evidence for this effect not only in the spatial distribution of the cluster members , but also in their velocity distribution : the more massive members will have a smaller velocity dispersion than the less massive stars . accordingly , for true cluster members ( with @xmath128 ) in different magnitude ranges , the intrinsic proper motion dispersions @xmath129 as derived from the observed dispersions @xmath130 , and the mean errors intrinsic to the stellar proper motions were investigated . the final results are shown in figs . it can be seen from these figures that the intrinsic proper motion dispersions are not significantly different for various magnitude groups . thus , our data do not support any significant velocity ( dispersion)-mass correlation , neither in ngc 2244 , nor in ngc 6530 ( see also @xcite ) .", "the traditional explanation for ( position dependent ) mass segregation in an open cluster is that it results from a situation in which all cluster stars approach energy equipartition . however , this is unlikely the case for ngc 2244 and ngc 6530 , since both clusters are very young , low - density objects ( but see @xcite for counterarguments ) . with ages of only around 23 myr , their ages are comparable to the time - scale of about only one or two crossing times . theoretically , the nature and degree of `` primordial '' mass segregation , i.e. , mass segregation intrinsic to the star - formation process itself , is presumably determined by the properties of the interactions of protostellar material during the star - forming episode in a cluster . more massive stars are subject to more mergers , hence accrete even more mass ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) , and therefore dissipate more kinetic energy . in addition , they tend to form near the cluster center , in the highest - density region , where the encounter - rate is highest @xcite . this will lead to an observed position - dependent stellar mass function containing more low - mass stars at larger radii compared to the mass function in the cluster center ( although low - mass stars are still present at small radii , see also the discussions in @xcite ; but see @xcite for arguments in favor of excluding primordial mass segregation to explain recent observations of the arches cluster near the galactic center ) .    from an observational point of view , the study of very young star clusters still embedded in the molecular clouds from which they originated might give us a handle to constrain the degree of primordial mass segregation . in the milky way , in three such young star clusters mass segregation effects have been studied in great detail in the past two decades . while @xcite suggested , based on ground - based observations , that the brighter stars in ngc 2024 ( and the mon r2 complex at large ) seem to be more centrally concentrated than the fainter cluster members , this evidence was deemed inconclusive by @xcite . they argued that this result was based on an incomplete sample of cluster members , although mass segregation might be limited to the massive , bright ob stars forming in the very center . these same authors argued that for masses below @xmath131 , mass segregation effects in the mon r2 complex amount to only a @xmath132 result . secondly , a combination of both ground - based ( e.g. , @xcite and _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) of the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) , and in particular of its very core , the trapezium stars , have presented clear evidence for mass segregation for the @xmath133 component , with some evidence for general mass segregation down to @xmath134@xmath135 ( @xcite ; see also the review by @xcite ) . finally , r136 , the central cluster in 30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ; age @xmath136 34 myr ; cf . @xcite ) , has been studied extensively , both from the ground and with the _ a variety of techniques have revealed a significant overabundance of high - mass stars in its very center , thus supporting strong mass segregation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . thus , in most of the ( still partially embedded ) young star clusters that can be resolved in individual stars , mass segregation effects are observed , although to varying degrees . this underlines the importance of our understanding of the physical processes involved in the formation and evolution of star clusters , and in particular of the imf , which will ultimately determine the time - scale on which a young star cluster will eventually be destroyed .    we may conclude from the above discussion that the observed spatial mass segregation in the young open clusters ngc 2244 and ngc 6530 might have resulted from a combination of both initial conditions in the early stages of evolution and , possibly , two - body relaxation process . the latter process will lead to a manifestation of cluster - wide mass segregation on the half - mass relaxation time - scale . however , it will proceed much faster in higher - density regions in the cluster , and among the more massive stars  both of these conditions favor an decreased time - scale in the cluster center . finally , we will consider the long - term fate of the two young clusters discussed in this paper in relation to their ( observed ) imf and velocity dispersion . both clusters have been scrutinized with the aim of determining their stellar make - up . because of their very young ages , the stellar content in essence reflects the mass distribution at the time of their birth , as insufficient time has passed for any significant number of stars to have undergone a full cycle of stellar evolution ( and neither for significant dynamical evolution to have occurred , as argued above ) . @xcite determined the imf of ngc 2244 in the mass range @xmath137 . they found a flat imf slope , with @xmath138 , where the equivalent slope of the @xcite imf would be @xmath139 . their result is in close agreement both with that of @xcite in the range from @xmath140 to @xmath141 , and with that of @xcite for stars with masses in excess of @xmath142 , @xmath143 . such a flat imf implies that the cluster s stellar population contains too many massive stars with respect to their lower - mass counterparts for it to survive the dynamical effects leading to cluster dissolution for any significant amount of time ( see , e.g. , @xcite in the context of the young massive cluster m82-f ; and @xcite for theoretical arguments in support of this notion ) . the precise dissolution time - scale depends sensitively on the imf mass range ( kouwenhoven et al . , in prep . ) this conclusion is supported by arguments related to the cluster s velocity dispersion . its intrinsic overall velocity dispersion is @xmath144 mas yr@xmath2 ; at the adopted distance , @xmath18 kpc , this is equivalent to @xmath145 km s@xmath2 . myr by @xcite . ] this large linear velocity dispersion is significantly in excess of the `` typical '' velocity dispersions older open clusters in the milky way characterized by a salpeter - type imf , or equivalent ( de grijs et al . , in prep . ) . thus , the combination of these arguments leads us to conclude that ngc 2244 will most likely dissolve on a short time - scale ( see also @xcite for a more conservative back - of - the - envelope calculation supporting our conclusion ) .  if not due to internal two - body relaxation effects , then most likely because of external shocks expected to operate near its location in , or close to , the galactic disk ( although we note that these effects may not be very significant in the galactic anticenter direction )    ngc 6530 , on the other hand , exhibits a power - law imf slope of @xmath146 for stellar masses between 0.6 and @xmath147 @xcite , fully consistent with the @xcite imf . they note that the cluster imf peaks towards smaller masses and then declines . this is in keeping with the detailed photometric study of @xcite , who quote an imf slope of @xmath148 , largely independent of the mass to luminosity conversion employed . its intrinsic velocity dispersion is @xmath149 mas yr@xmath2 ; at the adopted distance , @xmath35 pc , this is equivalent to @xmath150 km s@xmath2 , i.e. , much closer to the dynamical state required for longer - term survival , although still fairly large ( de grijs et al . , in prep . ) . in the absence of sizeable external perturbations , we speculate , therefore , that ngc 6530 has the potential to survive for a significant length of time , possibly of order a few @xmath151 yr . however , we also note that the cluster is situated very close to the galactic plane in the direction of the galactic center , such that external perturbations are unlikely to remain insignificant for any length of time .    finally , we point out that the large velocity dispersions obtained for both young clusters imply that these objects are unlikely to survive for any significant length of time . the velocity dispersions of ` classical ' old ( @xmath152 yr ) bound open clusters are of order @xmath153 km s@xmath2 as shown by , e.g. , @xcite in what is probably the most comprehensive study of open cluster velocity dispersions available to date . a small subset of these measurements have since been confirmed in more recent studies of individual objects ( de grijs et al . , in prep . ) . for instance , the velocity dispersion of the @xmath154 myr - old @xcite central cluster in coma berenices is @xmath155 km s@xmath2 ( @xcite ; cf . @xmath156 km s@xmath2 measured in the cluster core by @xcite ) ; that of m67 ( at an age of @xmath157 gyr ; @xcite ) ranges from @xmath158 km s@xmath2 , with a best estimate of @xmath159 km s@xmath2 ( see * ? ? ? * de grijs et al . , in prep . ) , while the velocity dispersion of praesepe ( m44 ) is @xmath160 km s@xmath2 @xcite , at an age of @xmath161 myr @xcite . m35 ( @xmath162 ; @xcite ) is characterized by @xmath163 from @xmath164 km s@xmath2 @xcite to @xmath165 km s@xmath2 @xcite . although we refer the reader for further details on the kinematic structure and long - term stability of galactic open clusters to a forthcoming paper ( de grijs et al . , in prep . ) , these examples show that in order for an open cluster to survive for a few @xmath151 yr , its velocity dispersion needs to be sufficiently small so as to prevent early dissolution of the cluster due to internal kinematic effects . neither of the clusters discussed in this paper satisfies this empirical condition . the only old ( @xmath166 ; @xcite ) galactic open cluster with a measured velocity dispersion in excess of the range indicated above is m11 , with @xmath163 from @xmath167 km s@xmath2 @xcite to 2.9 km s@xmath2 @xcite ; the latter measurement was later reduced to 2.0 km s@xmath2 @xcite . this high velocity dispersion , for an ostensibly stable _ massive _ open cluster , is still more than a factor of two below that of ngc 6530 , which is both significantly less massive and less compact than m11 , and thus less stable to kinematic dissolution .      1 .   from the photographic plate data of the shanghai astronomical observatory , the proper motions of stars in the region of the open clusters ngc 2244 and ngc 6530 were reduced by means of a central - overlapping technique , and the distribution parameters of the clusters as well as the membership probabilities of the individual stars in the cluster region were determined using a maximum likelihood principle . both clusters show clear evidence of mass segregation , but there is no definite evidence for a velocity ( dispersion)-mass ( or , equivalently , a velocity - luminosity ) dependence in these clusters . the observed mass segregation might be due to a combination of both initial conditions and relaxation processes . based on arguments related to the clusters imfs , in conjunction with our new measurements of their internal velocity dispersions , we provide strong arguments in favor of the dissolution of ngc 2244 on very short time - scales , while we speculate that ngc 6530 may be more stable against the effects of internal two - body relaxation . rdg was partially supported by an `` international joint project '' grant , jointly funded by the royal society in the uk and the chinese national science foundation ( nsfc ) . lc & jlz want to thank dr . peter stetson of dao for his kind help in measuring plates with the pds machine . lc and jlz are supported by the nsfc ( grant nos . 10333050 , 10333020).this research has made use of the webda database , operated at the institute for astronomy of the university of vienna . baba , d. , et al . 2004 , apj , 614 , 818 berghfer , t . w. , & christian , d. j. 2002 , a&a , 384 , 890 blitz , l. , & stark , a . a. 1986 , apj , 300 , l89 bonnell , i. a. , bate , m. r. , clarke , c. j. , & pringle , j . e. 1997 , mnras , 285 , 201 bonnell , i. a. , & davies , m. b. 1998 , mnras , 295 , 691 bonnell , i. a. , bate , m. r. , & zinnecker , h. 1998,mnras , 298 , 93 bonnell , i. a. , bate , m. r.,clarke , c. j. , & pringle , j. e. 2001a , mnras , 323 , 785 bonnell , i. a. , clarke , c. j. , bate , m. r. , & pringle , j . e. 2001b , mnras , 324 , 573 brandl , b. , sams , b. j. , bertoldi , f. , eckart , a.,genzel , r. , drapatz , s. , hofmann , r. , lwe , m. , & quirrenbach , a. 1996 , apj , 466 , 254 campbell , b. , et al . 1992 , aj , 104 , 1721 carpenter , j. m. , meyer , m. r. , dougados , c. , strom , s . e. , & hillenbrand , l. a. 1997 , aj , 114 , 198 chen , w. p. , chiang , p.s . & 2004 , chjaa , 4 , 153 chernoff , d. f. , & shapiro , s. l. 1987 , apj , 322 , 113 chernoff , d. f. , & weinberg , m. d. 1990 , apj , 351 , 121 chini , r. , & neckel , t. 1981 , a&a , 102 , 171 cudworth , k. 1976 , aj , 81 , 519 damiani , f. , et al . 2004 , , 608 , 781 damiani , f. , prisinzano , l. , micela , g. , & sciortino , s. 2006 , a&a , 459 , 477 de grijs , r. , gilmore , g. f. , johnson , r. a. , & mackey , a. d. 2002a , , 331 , 245 de grijs , r. , gilmore , g. f. , mackey , a. d. , wilkinson , m. i. , beaulieu , s. f. , johnson , r. a. , & santiago , b. x. 2002b , , 337 , 597 girard , t. m. , grundy , w. m. , lpez , c. e. , & van altena , w. f. 1989 , aj , 98 , 227 goodwin , s. p. 1997 , mnras , 284 , 785 hensberge , h. , pavlovski , k. , & verschueren , w. 2000 , a&a , 358 , 553 higuera g. , m. a. , uribe , a. , & barrera , r. s. 2002 , rev . . de conf . ) , 14 , 33 hillenbrand , l. a. 1997 , aj , 113 , 1733 hillenbrand , l. a. , & hartmann , l. e. 1998 , apj , 492 , 540 hg e. , fabricius c. , makarov v.v . , urban s. , corbin t. , wycoff g. , bastian u. , schwekendiek p. & wicenec a. 2000 , a&a , 355 , l27 hunter , d. a. , shaya , e. j. , holtzman , j. a. , light , r. m. , oneil , e. j. , & lynds , r. 1995 , apj , 448 , 179 jones , b. 1971 , aj , 76 , 470 kalirai , j. s. , fahlman , g. g. , richer , h. b. , & ventura , p. 2003 , aj , 126 , 1402 king , i. 1966 , aj , 71 , 64 lada , c. j. , gottlieb , c. a. , gottlieb , e. w. , & gull , t. r. 1976 , apj , 203 , 159 lada , e. a. , depoy , d. l. , evans , n. j. , & gatley , i. 1991 , apj , 371 , 171 larson , r. b. 1991 , in : fragmentation of molecular clouds and star formation , iau symp . 147 , falgarone , e. , boulanger , f. , & duvert , g. , eds . , dordrecht : kluwer , p. 261 larson , r. b. 1993 , in : the globular cluster  galaxy connection , smith , g. h. , & brodie , j. p. , eds . , asp conf . 48 , ( asp : san francisco ) , p. 675 larson , r. b. 2003 , asp conf . ser . , 287 , 65 li , j. z. 2005 , apj , 625 , 242 li , j. z. , & smith , m. d. 2005a , a&a , 431 , 925 li , j. z. , & smith , m. d. 2005b , aj , 130 , 721 lohman , w. 1972 , astron . nachr . , 293 , 259 loktin , a. v. , & beshenov , g. v. 2001 , astr . , 27 , 386 malumuth , e. m. , & heap , s. r. 1994 , aj , 107 , 1054 marschall , l. a. , van altena , w. f. , & chiu , l .- t . 1982 , aj , 87 , 1497 massey , p. , johnson , k. e. , & degioia -

{"id": "astro-ph9911184", "section_names": ["introduction", "mapping positron annihilation emission", "longitude and ple cuts", "model-fitting the galactic center region", "discussion"], "document": ["one of the primary objectives of the osse instrument on nasa s compton observatory has been to understand the nature of galactic positron annihilation radiation . through 8@xmath0 years of observations , 511 kev line emission has been detected , but the emission has never been unambiguously attributable to a given discrete source . the galactic center ( gc ) region s 511 kev emission was monitored by the gamma - ray spectrometer on - board the solar maximum mission ( smm ) ( 1980 - 1988 ) , the transient gamma - ray spectrometer ( tgrs ) on - board the wind mission ( 1995 - 1997 ) and with multiple osse observations ( 1991-present ) . none of these detections require variable sources in addition to the two component models discussed here to explain the measured fluxes ( share et al . 1990 , harris et al . 1998 , purcell et al . 1997 ) . these results have supported the suggestion that the majority of the emission is diffuse . reported here are preliminary results of the extension of the osse analysis into three new areas : the inclusion of observations in regions with no @xmath1 expectations of positron annihilation radiation , the extension of the analyzed region to include a larger fraction of the galaxy , and the mapping of the positronium continuum component ( pcont ) of the total annihilation emission . the derived pcont flux values have a stronger dependence upon fitting the underlying continuum than do the 511 kev line flux values , and thus detailed analyses ( model - fitting & 1d cuts ) are only performed upon the 511 kev data - set in this preliminary presentation . previously published osse results have focussed upon the 511 kev line emission emanating from the central radian of the inner galaxy , mapping emission from @xmath2 @xmath3 33@xmath4 , @xmath5 @xmath3 17@xmath4 , and model - fitting on a @xmath2 @xmath3 90@xmath4,@xmath5 @xmath3 45@xmath4 , 1@xmath4x1@xmath4 grid . in a result first reported at the fourth compton symposium and based on 6 + years of osse data , purcell et al . 1997 ( hereafter purc97 ) , showed evidence for three components to the 511 kev line emission , ( 1 ) an intense slightly extended emission centered in the direction of the gc , ( 2 ) a fainter planar emission , and ( 3 ) an unexpected enhancement of emission from positive latitudes ( ple ) . to generate that data - set , two basic types of data were used ; ( 1 ) standard & offset pointing data where the scan angle crossed the gc and/or was perpendicular to the galactic plane , and ( 2 ) mapping data which searches for emission by observing a large sky region at regularly spaced intervals along a scan path . the live - time from mapping observations is spread over many more pointings ( 16 or 32 for mapping versus 3 - 9 for standard ) , so the sensitivity per source pointing achieved is inferior to the standard or offset observations . the present work relaxes all selection criteria , initially including all observations whose source and background pointings are within the @xmath2 @xmath3 90@xmath4 , @xmath5 @xmath3 45@xmath4 region . to extract the positronium component from the total emission , three spectral models have been fit to each spectrum ( from 60 kev to 700 kev ) ; ( 1 ) a single power - law + 511 kev line + pcont ( as fit by purc97 , though they fit from 50 kev -4 mev ) , ( 2 ) a power - law with an exponential fall - off + 511 kev + pcont , ( 3 ) a thermal bremsstrahlung model + 511 kev + pcont . if the best - fitting model ( of the three ) is deemed to provide an acceptable fit , then that result is selected for subsequent mapping analysis . this has been done for the 1153 observations in the data - set . fewer than 20 observations have been rejected in this preliminary , all - inclusive analysis . the combination of including archival data and the use of new data collected in the 2 + years since the purc97 paper has increased the total gc exposure from 1.9 x 10@xmath6 det@xmath7s to 8.6 x 10@xmath6 det@xmath7s , as seen in figure 1 . as a result of this exposure , the fraction of the gc region ( @xmath2 @xmath3 90@xmath4 , @xmath5 @xmath3 45@xmath4 ) mapped above our exposure threshold has increased from 22% to 83% . [ exp ]    the combined osse / smm data - sets are used rather than the osse - only data - set because the osse background - subtraction technique leads to differential rather than absolute fluxes . osse is insensitive to both isotropic emission and modest intensity gradients . the smm fluxes are not absolute either , being insensitive to isotropic emission . assuming isotropic emission to be zero , the smm data contributes an overall normalization ( share et al . the smm fov is wide ( @xmath8130@xmath4 fwhm ) , but it does contribute limited spatial information as the response peak swept through the gc region along the ecliptic . one important difference between the purc97 data - set and this one is the use of tgrs data . purc97 used the tgrs data from teegarden et al . that data has since been re - analyzed by harris et al . ( 1998 ) , with the resultant 511 kev line flux reduced by almost 20% . the harris et al . ( 1998 ) data - set is used for the model - fitting studies shown in table 1 . svd maps of the combined osse / smm / tgrs data - set were not ready for these proceedings , but a rl map of the osse / smm / tgrs data - sets ( not shown ) is in general agreement with the osse / smm map .", "two techniques have been employed to map the osse data - set : minimizing @xmath9 with an adaptation of the richardson - lucy algorithm ( rl ) , and response matrix inversion using truncated singular valued decomposition ( svd ) . svd was described in purc97 , rl will be described in detail in an upcoming work . lowers . ] differences between the two resulting maps suggest the level of the uncertainties involved . [ maps ]    the upper and middle panels of figure 2 shows the svd and rl 511 kev maps of the combined osse and smm data - sets . both maps show three principle features , intense emission centered near the gc ( hereafter called bulge emission ) , a fainter planar emission ( hereafter called disk emission ) , and emission from the negative longitude / positive latitude region ( hereafter called a ple ) . the ple is more pronounced in the svd map than in the rl map . the hatched region does not meet a minimum exposure threshold ( or maps negative intensity ) . we emphasize the level to which the emission is concentrated in these three components . although a far larger fraction of the inner radian is mapped than in purc97 , there is no indication of intense emission from any of these newly mapped regions . the apparent dominance of the bulge and disk emissions along with a contribution from the ple drive the use of two and three component models when model - fitting . shown in the lower panel of figure 2 is a rl map of the fitted positronium continuum fluxes of the osse data - set . in most astrophysical environments , more pcont photons are produced in annihilation events than 511 kev line photons . for a positronium fraction of 0.95 , the pcont:511 ratio is 3.7:1.=0.97@xmath100.03 at the gc ( kinzer et al . this value is consistent with the tgrs measured value , f@xmath11=0.94@xmath100.04 ( harris et al . ] as a result , the pcont map is more intense . as explained in the introduction , this map is preliminary as a number of potential biases have not yet been addressed . nonetheless , the dominance of intense bulge and fainter disk components appears to agree with the 511 kev maps . the principal difference is the lack of evidence of ple emission , as will be discussed in the next section .", "a measure of the planar structure in the 511 kev emission can be seen by taking a cut along the galactic plane of the rl and svd maps . cuts for the rl and svd maps , as well as a model combining an r@xmath12 bulge and the dirbe 100 disk are shown in the upper panel of figure 3 . each is the sum of the @xmath5 @xmath3 2@xmath4 pixels . the svd data is plotted with 1@xmath13 error bars per degree . the svd and rl 511 maps show rough agreement , except in the + 18@xmath4 to + 27@xmath4 region , where the peaks and valleys are exaggerated in the svd map relative to the rl map . the model is more centrally peaked and the centroids of the maps are slightly offset towards negative longitude , but general agreement exists between the model and the maps . a systematic survey of the inner galactic plane scheduled for cgro cycle 9 will improve the sensitivity of the longitudinal cut .    [ cuts ]    the lower panel of figure 3 shows a cut through the ple at an angle of 60@xmath4 relative to the negative - longitude galactic plane ( an angle suggested by the svd map ) . as seen in the longitudinal cut , the r@xmath12 shape is more centrally peaked . in the anti - ple direction , all three maps agree , all falling smoothly . both the svd-511 and the rl-511 are brighter in the + 3@xmath4 @xmath14 + 8@xmath4 region than the corresponding negative region . beyond + 8@xmath4 , the sensitivity becomes poor , and there is little significance to the differences between the svd and rl maps . the pcont map ( not shown ) does not show a corresponding enhancement , though interpretation of this result as being due to annihilation physics , or alternatively being due to fitting systematics is not justified in this preliminary analysis.k ( bussard , ramaty & drachman 1979 ) . however , the absence of broad emission in the tgrs spectra provides a constraint to this scenario ( harris et al .", "the maps of 511 kev line emission support the purc97 representation of the galactic emission as being due to bulge , disk and ple components . to quantify the contributions by the bulge and disk components , three bulge shapes have been combined with 28 disk shapes and compared with the osse , then the osse / smm , then the osse / smm / tgrs 511 kev data - sets . the bulge shapes tested are ; a gc point source , a gaussian , and the projection of a truncated r@xmath12 function . shown in the left panel of figure 4 are the chi - squared values for best - fitting bulges of each shape paired with 28 disk models and fit to the osse data - set . the disks have been ordered by the equivalent latitude fwhm of a gaussian profile . , hf light & disk light ( higdon & fowler 1987 ) , the m31 maps ( ciardullo et al . `` 90x10 '' , etc . refer to the fwhm of gaussian disks . ] in the fits , the fwhm of the gaussian bulges have been permitted to vary ( best - fit fwhm values range from 3.9@xmath4 to 5.7@xmath4 ) . the r@xmath12 radial function has been truncated to a constant value inside of a radius ( r@xmath15 ) . function is @xmath16(r @xmath3 0.24 ) = a@xmath7r@xmath17@xmath7\\{exp(-b@xmath7r@xmath12 ) } , @xmath16(r @xmath18 0.24 ) = 5/4@xmath7a@xmath7r@xmath19 \\{exp(-b@xmath7r@xmath12)-c@xmath7r@xmath20 , where r = radial distance from gc in kpc , and a , b , c are constants . ] r@xmath15 has been constrained to be between 50 pc and 700 pc . the radial distribution has then been projected onto the line of sight assuming the gc to be 8 kpc distant . for all r@xmath15 , the r@xmath12 has extended wings relative to the gaussian shape ; for small r@xmath15 , the r@xmath12 is also more centrally peaked . for every disk tested , the extended bulges are strongly favored over the gc point source . the r@xmath12 bulge shows a slight preference for thin disks , while the gaussian bulge shows a stronger preference for thicker disks . this is interpreted as a hint of emission separated from both the galactic plane and the gc . for the r@xmath12 bulge shape , the extended bulge wings account for this emission . for the gaussian , a thicker disk is required . [ modfit ]    in the right panel of figure 4 , the smm data is combined with the osse data . the fits for the r@xmath12 solutions are similar to the osse - only plots . however , only the thicker disk - gaussian bulge solutions are able to approximate the quality of the r@xmath12 fits . as seen in table 1 , the b / d ratios are larger for r@xmath12 solutions than for gaussian solutions . the total flux of the r@xmath12 solutions change little when smm and then tgrs data is added , but for the gaussian solutions the total flux can change considerably . for many gaussian bulge - disk combinations , the osse data would not permit insertion of the smm or tgrs - required flux without violating osse constraints , leading to poor fits . these solutions do not necessarily span the range of possible bulge - disk combinations , nor are they unique , but they do suggest ranges of plausible b / d ratios and total fluxes . the uncertainties of the parameters are not shown in table 1 due to concern about them being misinterpreted . the standard approach is to fix all but a single parameter , and calculate the degradation to the fit that results from varying that single parameter . the uncertainties that result do not account for the effect of varying the other parameters , nor does it account for other potential model shapes . in this paper , the uncertainties are evident in table 1 , but are not calculated . llccclccclccc models & & & + & r@xmath15&b / d & f@xmath21 & @xmath22 & r@xmath15 & b / d & f@xmath21@xmath23 & @xmath22 & r@xmath15 & b / d & f@xmath21@xmath23 & @xmath22 + hp & 100pc & 1.6 & 25.7 & 1.18 & 200pc & 1.7 & 28.3 & 1.20 & 200pc & 1.2 & 27.6 & 1.20 + co & 50pc & 2.6 & 30.0 & 1.18 & 50pc & 1.2 & 28.9 & 1.20 & 50pc & 3.3 & 31.3 & 1.20 + dl & 50pc & 2.7 & 25.2 & 1.18 & 50pc & 1.5 & 29.0 & 1.20 & 50pc & 0.8 & 28.2 & 1.20 + 90x10 & 50pc & 0.6 & 27.4 & 1.18 & 50pc & 0.9 & 27.9 & 1.20 & 50pc & 0.6 & 26.8 & 1.20 + & fwhm & b / d & f@xmath21@xmath23 & @xmath22 & fwhm & b / d & f@xmath21@xmath23 & @xmath22 & fwhm & b / d & f@xmath21@xmath23 & @xmath22 + 60x15 & 4.4@xmath4 & 0.2 & 20.9 & 1.19 & 4.3@xmath4 & 0.2 & 26.4 & 1.21 & 4.3@xmath4 & 0.2 & 26.4 & 1.21 + 90x15 & 5.1@xmath4 & 0.3 & 21.6 & 1.19 & 4.8@xmath4 & 0.2 & 29.6 & 1.32 & 5.7@xmath4 & 0.2 & 29.9 & 1.21 + drb12 & 5.5@xmath4 & 0.1 & 29.9 & 1.28 & 5.7@xmath4 & 0.2 & 31.3 & 1.33 & 5.7@xmath4 & 0.2 & 31.4 & 1.22 + & & 38.3 & 1.13 & & 0.63 & 37.0 & 1.14 & & & & + @xmath24 & & 31.1 & 1.15 & & 0.49 & 25.8 & 1.18 & & & & +    the results shown in table 1 have ignored the existence of a ple and its potential influence upon the b / d and f@xmath25 parameters . purc97 quantified the ple flux by two methods ; ( 1 ) by subtracting the mirror region from the outputs of the mapping techniques , and ( 2 ) by fitting the data - set with three components ( bulge , disk and ple ) , all with gaussian profiles . the two methods yield very different ple flux results . the purc97 maps suggest the ple flux to be ( 1.3 - 1.5 ) x 10@xmath26 phot @xmath27 s@xmath28 . the 3-gaussian fitting suggests ( 5.4 - 8.8 ) x 10@xmath26 phot @xmath27 s@xmath28 . the current maps suggest ( 1.2@xmath100.5 ) x 10@xmath26 phot @xmath27 s@xmath28 , in agreement with the purc97 maps . quantifying the ple by mirror - region subtraction , the b / d ratios for the rl and svd maps are 0.63 and 0.49 , as shown in table 1 . the b / d values are intermediate to the r@xmath12 and gaussian solutions , suggesting a general agreement between mapping and two component modeling . the purc97 3-gaussian solution , when inserted with quoted parameters , is not an acceptable solution for the current osse / smm / tgrs data - set ( @xmath9/@xmath29 = 1.34 ) , but the same method can be applied to examples of better - fitting models from table 1 . when a gaussian representing the ple is added to a 4.3@xmath4 gaussian bulge + 60@xmath4x15@xmath4 gaussian disk , and the b / d re - optimized , the b / d rises from 0.163 to 0.169 ( @xmath30=-16.4 ) . the ple centroid for this gaussian fit is determined to be ( @xmath31 ) = -2@xmath4 , + 8@xmath4 , and the ple flux is 1.1 x 10@xmath26 phot @xmath27 s@xmath28 . when a ple gaussian is added to the r@xmath12 + co smooth model , the b / d lowers slightly from 3.3 to 2.6 ( @xmath30=-12.3 ) , and the parameters become : ( @xmath31 ) = -2@xmath4 , + 1@xmath4 , ple flux = 0.7 x 10@xmath26 phot @xmath27 s@xmath28 . these values are given not to suggest a refinement of the ple , but rather to demonstrate that the b / d depends more on the bulge shape than on the ple ( and vise versa ) . the current modeling of the ple lowers the flux values to better agreement with the mapping fluxes , but the interpretation must be that the characteristics of any possible ple are too poorly constrained and too model dependent to claim flux values and emission centroids ( and the corresponding uncertainties ) .", "osse investigations of galactic positron annihilation have recently been expanded into three new areas ; utilization of archival data near the gc , utilization of archival data away from the gc and mapping the positronium continuum emission . this expansion makes the results more dependent upon the spectral analysis , which is currently in its preliminary stage . the portion of this analysis least dependent upon these new complications are the 511 kev line flux values . although the spatial coverage of maps from these values has increased , characterization of the emission with three components ( bulge , disk and ple ) remains adequate . an extended bulge emission has been shown to be favored over point - like emission from the gc for a collection of 28 disk models . comparing two approximations of the bulge shape , gaussian bulges require thick disks to fit the data - sets , while r@xmath12 bulges are less dependent upon the disk thickness , slightly favoring thin disks . the bulge shape must be better resolved with future measurements to improve the constraints upon the b / d ratio ( currently ranging from 0.2 -3.3 for the combinations tested ) . the total flux is better constrained , ranging between ( 20.9 - 31.4 ) x 10@xmath26 phot @xmath27 s@xmath28 . the effect of a potential ple upon these parameters is shown to be less than the bulge - shape uncertainty when the ple is approximated by a gaussian . positron astronomy is 30 years old but remains in its infancy . of current generation gamma - ray telescopes , osse is the best - suited to investigate the sky distribution of this emission . the time allotted to osse annihilation studies has increased in recent cycles of the cgro mission . this time , combined with the expanded osse analysis , and the impending launch of the integral telescopes should produce significant improvements of our understanding of the nature of galactic positron annihilation . bussard , r.w . , ramaty , r. & drachman , r.j . , _ apj _ * 228 * , 928 ( 1979 ) . cheng , l .- x . , et al . , _ apj _ * 481 * , l43 ( 1997 ) . ciardullo , r. , et al . , _ apj _ * 318 * , 520 ( 1987 ) . dame , et al . , _ apj _ * 322 * , 706 ( 1987 ) . dermer , c.d . & skibo , j.g . , _ apj _ * 487 * , l57 ( 1997 ) . harris , m.j . , et al . , _ apj _ * 501 * , l55 ( 1998 ) . hauser , m.g . , et al . , _ cobe ref pub no . 98-a _ * greenbelt , md : nasa / gspc * , ( 1998 ) . higdon , j.c . & fowler , w. a. , _ apj _ * 317 * , 710 ( 1987 ) . kinzer , r.l . , et al . , _ a & as _ * 120 * , 317 ( 1996 ) . milne , p.a . , et al . , _ proceedings of the 3rd integral workshop _ * in press * , ( 1998 ) . purcell , w.r . , et al . , _ apj _ * 413 * , l85 ( 1993 ) . purcell , w.r . , et al . , _ apj _ * 491 * , 725 ( 1997 ) . share , g.h . , et al . , _ apj _ * 326 * , 717 ( 1988 ) . share , g.h . , et al . , _ apj _ * 358 * , l45 ( 1990 ) . teegarden , b. , et al . , _ apj _ * 463 * , l75 ( 1996 ) ."], "summary": "by combining osse , smm and tgrs observations of the galactic center region , purcell et al .

'' such a device has been used to stop a beam of metastable neon , molecular oxygen , and atomic hydrogen  @xcite . once the atoms are magnetically trapped , they can be further cooled using a method of single -

life .", "we consider an experiment to observe the @xmath0 decay of ultracold atomic tritium . the decay produces an outgoing @xmath4he@xmath5 ion and a @xmath0 , both of which can be detected . we need a spectrometer to measure the energy of the @xmath0 , along with a non - invasive technique for measuring two components of its momentum . by utilizing the coincidence between the @xmath0 and the @xmath4he@xmath5 ion , we can determine the ion s three momentum components from its time - of - flight . measurement of the four - momenta of the ion ( @xmath6 ) and the @xmath0 ( @xmath7 ) yields the neutrino mass squared : @xmath8    the advantages of this approach include : an extremely thin source that results in low scattering ; an atomic tritium source with simple final state effects ; a coincidence measurement with the @xmath0 to reduce background ; a direct neutrino mass peak reconstruction ; and the utilization of at least 500  ev of the @xmath0 energy spectrum . nevertheless , this approach faces several experimental challenges , particularly regarding the measurement of the @xmath0 momentum to sufficient precision , and trapping enough tritium atoms to obtain sufficient statistics . we address these challenges with a proposed experimental setup that would consist of three detectors shown in figure 1 : a microchannel plate ( mcp ) to detect the helium ion , a spectrometer to measure the @xmath0 s energy , and an optical lattice of rubidium rydberg atoms capable of measuring two of the @xmath0 s three momentum components . we can place the @xmath0-spectrometer close to the source , with the mcp for the @xmath4he@xmath5 ion detection several meters away from the source . using the @xmath0 event detected by the spectrometer as the initial time , we can determine the time - of - flight of the ion to the mcp . combining the time - of - flight with the mcp hit position yields the three momentum components of the helium ion . for example : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are reconstructed from the mcp hit position assuming the tritium decay came from the center of the source . here @xmath13 is the distance from the mcp to the source . the background event rate from the mcp would be @xmath14  event/@xmath15/s  @xcite , where cosmic ray events are eliminated either by deploying the detector in an underground laboratory or by implementing an efficient veto . although the coincidence in the @xmath0-spectrometer would be helpful , for any given @xmath0 event of the correct energy there will be a @xmath16 chance of seeing a background mcp hit , given that the coincidence time between the @xmath0 and the ion will be on the order of 0.3  ms . in order to evaluate our ability to discriminate true events from backgrounds , we simulated data in which the mcp hit position was randomized , and we studied how our reconstruction algorithm evaluated the neutrino mass squared for such random events . such events typically reconstruct to be more negative than @xmath17  ev@xmath18 and would be clearly separated from true helium ion hits . our simulations indicate it is possible to reduce backgrounds to @xmath19x@xmath20 , not including the rejection due to the coincidence requirement , simply by cutting any events that reconstruct the neutrino mass squared to be more negative than @xmath21  ev@xmath18 . this cut introduces negligible bias into the neutrino mass squared peak .    in order to measure the momentum of the @xmath0 without significantly altering its energy , we propose exploiting the effect of a passing electron on rydberg atoms  @xcite . in the @xmath0 s flight path before it reaches the spectrometer , we create an optical lattice filled with rubidium atoms in the ground state  @xcite . using laser excitation , we can excite the atoms to a high rydberg state  @xcite , such as 53s . when the @xmath0 passes one of these atoms , it can excite the atom from a 53s state to a 53p state , and the atom will remain trapped in its optical lattice position . we propose slowing the electrons with a controlled voltage soon after they leave the source so that by the time they reach the optical lattice , they have a maximum energy of 900  ev , which increases their cross section for exciting a rydberg atom to 0.36 x 10@xmath22 @xmath15 times larger than the transition energy , and the transition is dipole allowed . we numerically computed the radial part of the transition matrix element by using a numerov algorithm to compute the radial orbitals on a square root mesh in @xmath23 . we numerically integrated the radial orbitals times the bessel function , @xmath24 , for the transition operator using 4th order integration . to obtain the total cross section , we numerically integrated over the momentum transfer @xmath25 from @xmath26 to a @xmath27 using equally spaced points in @xmath25 with a @xmath28 = 0.01/@xmath29 . ] . when a @xmath0 signal is detected downstream in the spectrometer , the 53s atoms are optically de - excited using stirap ( stimulated raman adiabatic passage )  @xcite , and an electric field of 100 v / cm is ramped within @xmath30130  ns to ionize any rydberg atoms in a 53p state . once the atoms are ionized , they will be detected by a multi - hit position - sensitive mcp . based on realistic density limits , the @xmath0 will excite several rydberg atoms as it passes through the optical lattice , so we will be able to obtain the projection of a track from the passing @xmath0 .    in order to obtain the two @xmath0 momentum components necessary for reconstruction , we need to have a second optical lattice to project the momentum component in a direction orthogonal to the first . by combining the track projections from these two mcps with the energy measurement from the spectrometer , we can reconstruct the momentum of the @xmath0 that traversed the optical lattices using equation ( 2 ) and the reconstructed velocity : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the kinetic energy of the @xmath0 as measured in the spectrometer and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are obtained from the @xmath0 tracks in the optical lattices . using rydberg atoms with a principal quantum number n=53 would result in a negligible change in the @xmath0 s four - momentum as it passes . we estimate that we can obtain a density of 10@xmath33 atoms/@xmath34 in the optical lattice  @xcite , and we expect the passing @xmath0 to excite an atom within 5 @xmath35 m , leading to a high spatial resolution . the two major sources of backgrounds that must be eliminated for this rydberg technique are collisions and black body excitations . holding the rydberg atoms in an optical lattice eliminates collisions that could cause spurious transitions to the 53p state  @xcite . by surrounding the optical lattice with a wire mesh , we can eliminate most of the black body radiation that could excite atoms from the 53s to the 53p state . the spacing of the mesh would be small compared to the microwave wavelength , suppressing blackbody emission of the mesh itself . additionally , the rubidium atoms can be periodically cycled back to the ground state and then up to the rydberg 53s state  @xcite , which will prevent background 53p events from accumulating , while still allowing the atoms to spend most of their time in the 53s state . this non - invasive method may find other applications in the detection of low - energy electrons .", "our current experimental simulation makes several assumptions about detector precision in order to determine the required equipment . we assume an mcp of 15  cm x 15  cm with a timing resolution of 20  ps and a high spatial resolution of 2  @xmath35 m  @xcite . it is placed 5  m from the tritium source and has a 44@xmath36 efficiency for detecting an ion when it is hit . the tritium source is modeled as a 100  @xmath35 m sphere at a temperature of 1  @xmath35k . given that the density of the source can not exceed 10@xmath37 atoms/@xmath34 and that the radius of the source is 50  @xmath35 m , the column density of the source is less than 10@xmath38 atoms/@xmath15 . we therefore estimate multiple scattering within the source to be small and do not include it in the simulation . the @xmath0-spectrometer is a hemispherical analyzer with an energy resolution of 5  mev , which is reasonable given current devices  @xcite . simulations indicate that the rydberg atom method of measuring the @xmath0 momentum results in a resolution that varies from 40  mev / c to 2.8  ev / c depending on the @xmath0 s four - momentum . we assume a large rydberg atom optical lattice with dimensions 10 cm x 10 cm x 1 cm placed 2 m from the source , which optimizes the detector s resolution and solid - angle acceptance . our simulated @xmath0 spectrum includes first - order final state corrections . in tritium @xmath0-decay , the helium ion is formed in the ground state in 70@xmath36 of the decays , and our simulation simplifies the true spectrum of final states by assuming that the helium ion goes into the first excited state for the remaining 30@xmath36 of the decays . for more than 99.9@xmath36 of the events , the magnitude of the reconstructed neutrino mass is larger when the wrong state is assumed for the helium ion , which provides us with a simple method of determining the true state of the helium ion . this method does not bias the neutrino mass fit in any significant way . both the neutrino s reconstructed mass peak and the shape of its @xmath0-spectrum contain information about its mass . in order to utilize all of this information , we perform a maximum - likelihood fit using two - dimensional probability density function ( pdf ) . we create a series of 2d pdfs using much higher statistics than we use for our simulated data . each of the six pdfs we create has a different assumed neutrino mass , and the assumed mass values are @xmath39  ev apart . figure 2 shows the 2d pdf for the case of zero neutrino mass . by interpolating between the pdfs , we find the most likely value for the neutrino mass for a particular data set .    unlike previous tritium @xmath0-decay experiments that utilize information only a few ev away from the endpoint , our fit extends back to 18.1  kev , a full 500  ev from the endpoint . the statistics gained by moving away from the endpoint substantially improve the precision on the neutrino mass even as the spread in reconstructed mass gets broader . figure 3 shows how individual detector and reconstruction uncertainties contribute to broadening the reconstructed neutrino mass squared peak , especially the @xmath0 momentum measurement and the initial @xmath4h temperature . these smearings create large uncertainties for each reconstructed event , but the uncertainty in the mean of the peak decreases with added statistics . combining this neutrino mass peak information with the information from the beta spectrum fit allows for a sub - ev determination of the neutrino mass . clearly , systematic shifts in the mean of the reconstructed mass spectrum would have to be controlled at a very high level , but calibrations of the spectrometer using the conversion electron from @xmath40kr as well as information from the energy spectrum itself should allow us to mitigate these effects . .minuit fit results and minos errors for simulated data runs which had different assumed neutrino masses .

storage systems@xcite , rechargeable high - energy batteries , electrochromic devices , ( see ref.@xcite for a review ) , and superconductors @xcite .    the insertion process can be viewed ( at least , in some aspects ) as an adsorption of guest particles on the host lattice . for charged particles the ionic charge inside the matrix is compensated by the electrons . for that reason the electrochemical intercalation is also similar to a three - dimensional adsorption of neutral species . based on this analogy the intercalation is traditionally described within the lattice gas ( lg ) model . in this approach all the properties ( intercalation isotherm or capacity - concentration dependence ) are connected with an ordering the guest on different adsorption sites of a rigid host lattice - the _ configurational _ transitions .    however , the host response to the accommodation of the guest species is not negligible . for instance , the insertion induces the stress into the host matrix . this may lead to segregation effects @xcite or even to instabilities@xcite of the host - guest system . also a loading path is shown@xcite to influence the guest uptake efficiency . due to this the host may undergo an expansion or local distortion . typical examples are the hydrogen sorption by metals @xcite , or the intercalation of @xmath2 ions into layered materials @xcite . quite often the host undergoes structural transformations @xcite due to intercalation . these are the _ structural _ transitions . in such cases the standard lg approach also operates with several sublattices @xcite corresponding to each configuration of the host . however , such a restructuring suggests that the elastic effects should be taken into account . a general thermo - mechanical theory of the stress - composition interaction is developed by larche and cahn @xcite . this implies the existence of a coupling between the elastic properties of the host material and the structure and/or the dynamics associated with the guest species . in other words the configurational and structural transitions should be considered to be coupled . in our previous papers we have investigated such a coupling for two - dimensional @xcite as well as for three - dimensional systems@xcite . the main advantage of our approach is its capability in describing various ( microscopically different ) intercalation systems within a common framework . despite of the fact that some microscopic details are omitted , the theory agrees well with experimental data on layered @xmath3 and crystalline @xmath1 and @xmath4 compounds at equilibrium conditions .    in this study we focus on a correlation between the equilibrium properties ( isotherms and differential capacity ) and the concentration dependence of the chemical diffusion coefficient . our purpose is to determine the impact of the thermodynamics to the kinetic properties . following our previous works we combine the lg model , describing the configurational transitions and the linear elasticity theory that accounts for the loading mechanism and the volume dilatation in the course of the structural transitions ( expansion or restructuring ) . this allows us to derive an effective chemical potential , involving the concentration dependent stress and strain fields . then , assuming that the diffusion flux is proportional to the gradient of the chemical potential , we investigate the behavior of the chemical diffusion coefficient .", "the host material is described as a three - dimensional lattice of adsorbing sites with their positions given by a set vectors @xmath5 . due to the elastic properties of the real host each site ( for instance , an interstitial site ) of this `` auxiliary '' lattice may deviate from its equilibrium position @xmath6 , such that we deal with the displacements @xmath7 . therefore , the host properties are described by the hamiltonian @xmath8 $ ] . note however that a connection between the elastic properties of the real matrix and those of the adsorbing lattice , is not straightforward@xcite .    a distribution of the intercalants on the host sites is given by a set of occupation numbers @xmath9 , with @xmath10 or @xmath11 . the guest subsystem is characterized by the chemical potential @xmath12 and the nearest neighbor interaction parameter @xmath13 ( at equilibrium positions ) . for the electrochemical insertion , chemical potential @xmath12 gives a deviation of the electrode potential @xmath14 from its standard value @xmath15 . in this way an arrangement of the intercalants on a rigid host lattice is governed by the lg hamiltonian @xmath16 that describes the configurational transitions of the intercalated species . these could be the droplet formation for attractive interactions ( @xmath17 ) or the order - disorder transition for repulsive interactions ( @xmath18 ) . in the latter case one introduces the sublattice concentrations as appropriate for the symmetry of a given system .    the coupling between the host and the guest is given by hamiltonian @xmath19 $ ] which takes into account a dependence of the binding energy on the site displacement and also the pairwise interaction between the guest particles through the host lattice . the overall hamiltonian is now written as @xmath20+h_g[\\{t_i\\}]+h_c[\\{{\\bf u}_i\\},\\{t_i\\}]\\ ] ] the free energy @xmath21 corresponding to the above hamiltonian is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the intercalant concentration . here @xmath24 is the host free energy in the absence of intercalation , @xmath25 is the guest free energy in a case of the rigid host lattice . the latter term can be calculated using the mean field approximation to obtain the well - known relation@xcite for the chemical potential @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the coordination number of the host lattice and @xmath28 . the coupling term @xmath29 requires the averaging over the displacements and the occupation numbers , calculated with the reference terms @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in fact , this is an infinite series including the correlations of all orders in the reference state . the main problem is to specify @xmath19 $ ] coherently with the host symmetry and elastic properties . it is known that real host materials have rather complicated elastic properties ( e.g. a strong anisotropy ) . therefore , only some simplified model calculations are expected to give tractable results . on the other hand , such predictions ( e.g. a rigid plane model@xcite ) do not exhibit quantitative agreement with experimental data . the perturbative scheme developed previously @xcite has shown that the coupling term is concerned with a concentration dependence of the host response to the intercalation . this involves at least two effects . first is a renormalization@xcite of the net pair interaction between the intercalants due to their indirect interaction through the matrix . the second is a change of the host volume upon insertion of the guest species . depending on the host nature , a stress field may result if the lattice is not totally free to relax . in this situation it seems reasonable to estimate the coupling term based on the continuum theory of elasticity with the concentration dependent stress and strain fields . then the host - guest free energy is a sum of the lattice gas and elastic part @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the configurational ( lattice gas ) part , in which the pairwise interaction is renormalized@xcite due to the interaction through the matrix . this gives the chemical potential @xmath34 ( see eq . ( [ mu0 ] ) ) with a new interaction constant @xmath13 . the elastic part is approximated by the free energy of a strained isotropic body under a loading stress @xmath35 . since the strain is assumed to be purely dilatational , we operate with traces @xmath36 and @xmath37 of the corresponding tensors . @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the effective elastic constant , independent of the concentration . the total stress @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 therefore , we have two stress contributions . the internal , or self - stress @xmath42 corresponds to the host reaction to the guest insertion . the second term @xmath35 describes a loading procedure , that may include the sample clamping or other effects which are not directly related to the strain . it is important that , in general , @xmath35 is a function of @xmath23 ( not a function of @xmath43 ) . for instance , if the sample is clamped such that @xmath44 , then we have a stress accumulation proportional to the concentration @xmath45 .", "the guest chemical potential @xmath46 is given by the concentration derivative of the total free energy . the second term involves the so - called chemical expansion coefficient @xmath48 , while the last term is associated with the loading path . it is seen that the intercalation level depends on an interplay of the internal stress and the loading stress . the latter could be small , but its concentration derivative is not necessary small , so that the loading path may induce serious consequences@xcite . in particular , for a given material ( @xmath39 ) and a suitable loading path @xmath35 , there may be a cancellation of the last two terms in eq . ( [ muel ] ) in a given domain of @xmath23 . this explains why in some cases the purely configurational description ( @xmath49 ) works well .    for comparison to other theoretical approaches it is convenient to express the strain function in terms of other relevant quantities . the strain can be measured as a volume dilatation or as a change of the interlayer spacing in the course of insertion . if @xmath50 is a composition dependent sample volume ( or interlayer spacing for layered compounds ) , then by definition @xmath51 where @xmath52/v(0)$ ] is the relative volume variation and @xmath53/[v(1)-v(0)]$ ] is a modulating function . the latter varies in between @xmath54 and @xmath55 . if @xmath56 is a linear function , then the system is said to obey the vegard s law@xcite . if the host - guest system forms a solid solution , then the guest partial molar volume @xmath57 is related to the total volume @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the initial host volume ( at @xmath60 ) . then we can find the following relation for the strain , the volume variation and partial molar volume @xmath61 if the loading is composition independent @xmath62 and the sample volume changes linearly ( @xmath63 , like in the @xmath0 @xmath64-phase ) , then we recover the well - known result@xcite @xmath65 the term liner in the concentration can be viewed as an additional interaction which can be combined with @xmath66 in @xmath34 . although this additional term is proportional to the elastic constant @xmath39 , it is physically different from the interaction of elastic dipoles@xcite which is already absorbed into @xmath13 ( see the discussion after equation ( [ fx ] ) ) . this interaction takes place even if the sample is perfectly clamped ( @xmath44 ) , while our term represents a cooperative effect due to @xmath67 .    in order to analyze the role of elastic effects in the phase behavior of the guest species it is instructive to consider a simple example of vanishing loading stress @xmath68 , @xmath69 . in this case there is no difference between the volume expansion or contraction . then we arrive at @xmath70 where @xmath71 . in addition , @xmath56 is taken to be that in the so - called layer rigidity model@xcite which describes a deviation from the vegard s law in layered compounds @xmath72 where @xmath73 is related to the rigidity of the host layers . the first order phase transition ( of liquid - gas type ) is manifested by a singularity in the differential capacity @xmath74 @xmath75^{-1}\\ ] ] it is clear that for @xmath76 both derivatives of @xmath56 are positive and the only possibility for the critical behavior is the case of attractive interactions @xmath17 , i.e. when the configurational part @xmath77 becomes negative . then the last two terms in the denominator of ( [ c ] ) rescale the critical temperature and shift the critical composition from @xmath78 . for @xmath79 the term @xmath80 becomes negative and the criticality may appear due to the elastic effects even if @xmath81 . the coexistence curves for this case , obtained by a numerical analysis of the divergence in @xmath82 , are plotted in fig . it is seen that the critical temperature ( the maximum ) increases with increasing @xmath73 . simultaneously the critical concentration decreases . the elastic effects break the hole - particle symmetry of the problem and consequently the curves are not symmetric and are not centered around @xmath78 .    in our previous works @xcite we have analyzed another extreme case of vanishing total stress @xmath83 and the loading stress proportional to the concentration @xmath84 . then @xmath85 where @xmath86 . note , however that , for @xmath87 , the above result is valid only for a linear behavior of @xmath88 , while is an approximation for an arbitrary @xmath56 . in reality the elastic constants could depend on the concentration , for instance the bulk modulus of @xmath89 is reduced@xcite up to @xmath90 due to the hydrogen sorption . thus one can easily imagine a situation when @xmath91 and then the approximation ( [ msf ] ) is applicable for a nonlinear @xmath56 . in general , for a non - vegard s behavior and the linear loading @xmath84 we deal with @xmath92 \\frac{dp(x)}{dx } -\\gamma p(x)\\ ] ]    the strain can be measured as a volume dilatation or as a change of the interlayer spacing during the transitions between different phases ( staging in graphite , restructuring in @xmath1 , @xmath93 transition in @xmath0 , etc ) . in any case the lattice parameters do not obey the linear vegard s law @xcite , exhibiting a sharp change near the transition compositions @xmath94 . this can be described by the following approximation@xcite . @xmath95\\right ] \\label{p}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 counts the number of phase boundaries . in @xmath1 , @xmath97 corresponds to monoclinic - tetragonal and tetragonal - cubic transitions , respectively . for @xmath2-graphite systems , @xmath96 corresponds to the stage transfer boundaries@xcite . the set of rigidity parameters @xmath98 controls a local slope and @xmath99 are the weights corresponding to each phase , such that @xmath100 . this is consistent with experimental observations@xcite indicating that the structures are not completely pure , but contain some features that indicate a mixing of phases . the present form of @xmath56 corresponds to continuous structural transitions , but can be easily modified to take into account the jump - like behavior ( like for the staging @xcite ) . nevertheless , in that case the concentration derivatives of @xmath56 would be singular , inducing the singularities in the thermodynamic quantities ( as it should be in the neighborhood of a phase transition ) . note however that the experimental dependencies are usually smoothed due to a finite concentration resolution . then it is difficult to distinguish between the step - wise variation and a sharp ( but continuous ) transition . for that reason the criticality criteria , determined on the ground of rigorous statistical mechanical arguments ( @xmath46 loops or a divergent capacity @xmath101 ) , only approximately conform to experimental data . therefore we stay with the continuous @xmath56 , performing the fitting to the experiment .    following this methodology , in fig . 3 we display the intercalation isotherm ( inset ) and the capacity curve , comparing them to the experimental data@xcite for @xmath1 . the fitting ( eq .  ( [ muf ] ) ) is performed assuming that the effective pair interaction inside the matrix is repulsive for any @xmath23 . the curve modulation results from the strain behavior @xmath56 , associated with the volume dilatation . as is discussed previously@xcite , the peculiarities ( inflection points and the peaks in @xmath102 ) mark the boundary between different host symmetries . from the experimental point of view , the peak height is usually associated with a transition sharpness . nevertheless , as we have discussed above , the critical behavior of the model itself should be studied separately .", "in many cases there are two mobile species inside host matrices : the host electrons and the guest particles . therefore , the transport is characterized by their flux densities @xmath103 and @xmath104 , related to the gradients of the corresponding chemical ( or electro - chemical ) potentials @xmath105 and @xmath106 . @xmath107 @xmath108 where @xmath109 are phenomenological transport coefficients , which are scalar quantities if the host is spatially isotropic . in matrices with a metallic conductivity the electrons are much more mobile than the guest species . due to this the guest ionic charge is compensated by the electrons . for the same reason the electrons reach a uniform ( equilibrium ) distribution much faster than the intercalants ( @xmath110 on the time scale when @xmath111 ) . in addition , usually @xmath112 @xcite . therefore one may focus on the guest flux @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the mobility coefficient that must contain a blocking factor @xmath115 , determining the concentration - dependent chemical ( or collective ) diffusion coefficient @xmath116 . a comprehensive review of theoretical approaches to the determination of the chemical diffusion coefficient can be found in ref .  @xcite . in the simplest approximation we deal with @xmath117 under the assumptions above , the intercalant transport is described by the diffusion equation with an effective diffusion coefficient @xmath116 . the latter requires an information on the intercalation isotherm @xmath46 . then , based on the equilibrium properties , at a given concentration gradient , one , at least in principle , can solve the kinetic problem . note , that such a simple scheme should be modified when the host conductivity changes remarkably upon the intercalation . then the electronic impact should be taken into account . also , we do not consider other driving forces , like external field or stress gradients , assuming that the guest concentration , @xmath23 , is the only independent variable . and finally , near the phase coexistence ( e.g , staging ) a system becomes non - uniform because of the phase boundaries . then the formulation of the kinetic problem must be coherent with the theory of critical phenomena ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . starting from ( [ muel ] ) and ( [ ddef ] ) we obtain @xmath118 where the first term is the standard lg part @xmath119 and the elastic contribution is given by @xmath120\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath121 . the diffusion coefficient involves several competing factors ( strains , stresses and their concentration derivatives ) . in general it is not trivial to see whether @xmath122 increases or decreases with @xmath23 . the situation is even more complicated for systems in which the lattice spacing does not obey the linear vegard s law , but has inflection points separating different phases ( e.g. staging in graphite or restructuring in @xmath1 ) . then the derivatives above may change sign with the concentration . also we see again that the loading path has a significant contribution .    for @xmath0 ( @xmath64-phase ) we recover the well known result @xcite . the concentration induced internal stress @xmath123 increases the diffusion @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the stress free contribution ( it corresponds to @xmath34 , i.e. the lattice gas description , see above ) . note that the non - local stress effects@xcite are not discussed here . since , according to ( [ ddef ] ) , the diffusion coefficient is just an inverse of @xmath101 , @xmath122 as a function of @xmath23 has minima ( fig . 3 ) , corresponding to the peaks in the capacity curve . for @xmath126 ( fig . 3 ) the theory works well near the first minimum , but overestimates the diffusion at higher @xmath23 . assuming that eq.([ddef ] ) is valid , we have also inverted the capacity data ( fig . 2 ) in order to demonstrate that there is no `` hidden '' errors in the fit for @xmath101 . since the equilibrium characteristics ( fig .  2 ) are predicted with a reasonable accuracy , then one of the source for the discrepancy could be our simplified assumptions on the mobility . for instance , one might suppose that eq.([ddef ] ) does not work for higher @xmath23 because the hoping @xmath127 depends on the elastic properties . by the analogy with the two - dimensional diffusion@xcite , @xmath127 is related to the lattice spacing . the latter decreases with @xmath23 for @xmath126@xcite , so that the resulting @xmath116 would also decrease . nevertheless the volume change does not exceed several percents@xcite . this can not explain the two orders of magnitude difference in fig . the lattice anisotropy seems also to be irrelevant because the final ( high @xmath23 ) structure is cubic , so the isotropic approximation for the diffusion and elastic properties is reasonable . it is known@xcite that @xmath1 changes its electronic conductivity near the structural instability composition . then the ionic transport must correlate with the transport of the neutralizing electrons . similar effects occur in superconductors@xcite . therefore , the electronic mobility impact ( that is absent from our approach ) to the current should be taken into account by including the additional driving force @xmath128 . this contribution can be included into our approach , assuming some model for the electronic structure , e.g. - the rigid band model . this would correct our predictions for small @xmath23 ( according to @xcite , for @xmath129 ) , but our high-@xmath23 estimation would remain unchanged . we believe that the electronic effects are not responsible for the decrease of @xmath116 at high concentrations . based on the fact@xcite that the electrical properties of @xmath1 become more and more metallic with increasing @xmath2 content , we may expect that our approximation @xmath110 becomes more reliable with increasing @xmath23 . moreover , if the conductivity effects were important , then the ionic diffusion would increase like this occurs in amorphous @xmath126 films@xcite . on our opinion we deal with an interplay of several facts . although the model works well in predicting the equilibrium properties , nevertheless it is probably too simple for the description of the kinetics . in fact , the transport is assumed to take place in an infinite lattice through the hoping of neutral species ( @xmath130 ) , ignoring the kinetics other relevant phenomena , like the charge transfer ( metal / host , guest / host ) , the exclusion ( permselectivity ) effect@xcite , the formation of the passive layer at the host / electrolyte boundary , etc . on the other hand , the experimental data on the diffusion are extracted from direct measurements employing a theoretical model , which could differ ( in some details ) from the one introduced here . concerning the order of magnitude estimations , it should be noted that the experimental data for the same substance are usually differ significantly depending on the sample preparation , its size and the scanning time interval . therefore , the quantitative description of the ionic transport is a delicate problem requiring mutual theoretical and experimental efforts . nevertheless , our estimation of the elastic effects is qualitatively correct in predicting that the system characteristics changes coherently with the strain @xmath56 , and therefore , positions of the minima ( fig . 3 ) @xmath94 are predicted correctly , implying a correlation between the @xmath116 behavior and the strain development . similar situation takes place for @xmath2-graphite . in fig . 4 the normalized interlayer spacing for graphite in the presence of intercalated @xmath2 is plotted as a function of the guest composition . the fitting is preformed using eq . ( [ p ] ) under a suitable choice of the parameters @xmath99 , @xmath98 , @xmath94 . the experimental data are taken from refs . our fit is rather reasonable , `` catching '' the fact that the stage transfer compositions @xmath94 approximately correspond to the inflection points in @xmath56 , where the average interlayer spacing changes sharply . note that we do not discuss the fine structure of the phase diagram@xcite , such as dilute and liquid - like phases for the same stage . these features are related to the the guest in - plane ordering which is indistinguishable in the behavior of the interlayer spacing .    having a reliable approximation for @xmath56 we calculate the diffusion coefficient in the framework outlined above . the fitting to the experimental data @xcite is shown in fig . it is seen that the diffusion slows down significantly near the stage transfer compositions @xmath94 . although the magnitude of @xmath116 is close to the experimental results , the width of the minima is underestimated . note that the fitting is not optimized , that is , we did not try to find an optimal set of the parameters , which gives equally good agreement for the isotherm @xmath46 and @xmath116 . nevertheless , as in the case of @xmath1 ( fig . 3 ) , there is a clear correlation between the diffusivity and the strain behavior .", "in summary , our approach implies that the main equilibrium and transport features of the intercalation systems ( which differ in their microscopic details ) can be well understood in terms of a concentration dependence of the hydrostatic parts of the stress and strain fields , associated with the internal and loading effects@xcite . it is shown that the elastic effects may induce the critical behavior even if the `` direct '' interaction between the guest species is absent . although the ionic transport is supposed to be equivalent to the diffusion of neutral ( ion plus electron ) species , the approach is flexible enough to incorporate other transport mechanism ( migration , or electronic mobility effects ) . the theory gives a quantitative description of different insertion processes , involving the volume expansion ( @xmath3 ( see@xcite ) , @xmath131 ) , staging ( @xmath2-graphite ) or restructuring ( @xmath1 ) . for all these processes the theory implies a correlation between the intercalation isotherm and a concentration dependence of the diffusion coefficient . the latter exhibit a set of characteristic minima , related to the boundaries between different phases ( like different symmetry phases of @xmath1 , @xmath132 transition in @xmath0 , etc ) . however the experimental dependencies are usually smoothed due to a finite concentration resolution . for that reason the criticality criteria , determined on the ground of rigorous statistical mechanical arguments ( e.g. @xmath133 at the transition concentrations ) only approximately conform to the experimental data , exhibiting a sharp ( but finite ) decrease of @xmath122 . for a non -

ion collider ( rhic ) has drawn much attention with an aim to explore the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phase diagram at non - zero temperature ( @xmath2 ) and baryon chemical potential ( @xmath3 )  @xcite . one of the key observable is related to the event - by - event distribution of conserved charge numbers such as : net - baryon , net - electric charge and net - strangeness  @xcite . current experiments at rhic have reported the measurements for various order moments of net - proton and net - charge event - by - event distributions using the bes phase - i data  @xcite . from the net - proton measurement , deviations are observed for @xmath4 27 gev for ratios of higher order cumulants compared to expectation from a hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model and skellam statistics  @xcite . however , from the experimental side , there is no conclusive evidence about the location of the qcd critical end point ( cep ) . this has prompted to have high statistics bes - ii program scheduled for 2018 - 19 with the focus on taking data at lower beam energies ( below 39 gev ) . so far , the reported experimental measurements are based on higher moments of either net - proton or net - charge multiplicity distribution , which are related to baryon number or electric charge susceptibilities , respectively  @xcite .    probes of phase structure of qcd should also include correlations among different conserved charges  @xcite . they are not only expected to vary in some characteristic manner between low and high temperature phases of qcd but also provide insight into applicability of the hrg model . it has been suggested that , the ratio of strange to non - strange susceptibilities calculated in lattice qcd can give insight about quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase  @xcite . the correlation between baryon number ( @xmath5 ) and electric charge ( @xmath6 ) ( @xmath7 ) shows a variation with the temperature which are correlated with the changes in relevant degrees of freedom  @xcite . at lower temperature @xmath7 is dominated by contributions from protons and anti - protons , whereas in the high temperature limit of ( 2 + 1 ) flavor qcd , their values are due to quark degrees of freedom . similarly , correlations of baryons with strangeness ( @xmath8 ) and electric charge with strangeness ( @xmath9 ) are sensitive to the strangeness degrees of freedom of the system  @xcite . at high temperature limit , in which the basic degrees of freedom are quarks and gluons , the strangeness is carried by the @xmath10 and @xmath11 quarks that later carry the baryon number in strict proportion to their strangeness number ( @xmath12 ) which makes the @xmath5 and @xmath13 strongly correlated  @xcite . on the other hand , in a hadron gas the strangeness is mostly carried by kaons with @xmath14 , which makes the correlation between strangeness and baryon number very small . hence , observables such as @xmath9 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 give information about the qcd phase structure  @xcite . further , combinations of diagonal and off - diagonal quark number susceptibilities can be used to obtain the fluctuations of conserved charges  @xcite . diagonal susceptibilities measure the quark number density to changes in @xmath2 and @xmath15 . at high temperature region diagonal susceptibilities show large values and expected to approach the ideal gas limit  @xcite . whereas in the low temperature region , the quarks are confined , the diagonal susceptibilities are expected to have small values . the off - diagonal susceptibilities in turn can be used to explore the degree of correlation between different charge and baryon numbers that carry different flavors  @xcite . using the ratio of susceptibilities , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , it has been observed that , above critical temperature ( @xmath18 ) , the flavor carrying sector of qcd is consistent with deconfined plasma of weakly interacting quarks and antiquarks . above 1.5@xmath18 , the flavor carrying degrees of freedom are quark - like quasi - particles . below @xmath18 the behavior of the above susceptibility ratios is consistent with that of hadron resonance gas  @xcite . in addition , a landmark point in the qcd phase diagram is the cep  @xcite . as one approaches the cep in the phase diagram , there will be large fluctuations in the event - by - event produced particle numbers  @xcite . these fluctuations are quantified by measuring various order moments of the event - by - event particle number distribution . these moments are related to some power of correlation length ( @xmath19 ) of the system  @xcite . higher moments of the distributions are related to the higher power of @xmath19 which makes them more sensitive to cep effects  @xcite . specifically it has been recently suggested to look for mixed pion - proton cumulants as a signature for cep  @xcite . the paper suggests to construct five specific mixed pion - proton cumulants from which when non - cep contributions are subtracted will yield a value of unity if the system experiences critical phenomena . such ratios have no theoretical uncertainties arising from uncertainty in the values of the qcd based parameters . these ratios are claimed to provide strong evidence needed for the discovery of the qcd critical point .    keeping in mind above aspects and the importance of having a proper baseline for the experimental measures , we discuss in the present paper , mixed susceptibilities ( between electric charge , baryon number , and strangeness ) and various order pion - proton cumulants within the frame work of a hrg model  @xcite . the calculations presented here also keeps in mind the actual experimental situation in terms of acceptances ( in momentum and rapidity ) and measurable quantities  @xcite . the paper is organized as follows . in the following section , we discuss the hrg model used in this study . in section [ sec : acceptance ] , the results for various mixed cumulants are presented for different kinematic acceptance and charge states . in section  [ sec : baselineratios ] , we present the proper baseline for critical fluctuation . finally in section  [ sec : summary ] , we summarize our findings and mention about the implications of this work in current experimental measurements in high energy heavy - ion collisions .", "the partition function ( @xmath20 ) in the hrg model include all the degrees of freedom of confined , strongly interacting matter and implicitly contains all the interactions that result in resonance formation  @xcite . the logarithm of the partition function is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22\\big\\},\\ ] ] @xmath2 is the temperature , @xmath23 is the volume of the system , @xmath24 is the chemical potential and @xmath25 is the degeneracy factor of the @xmath26 particle . the total chemical potential @xmath27 = @xmath28 + @xmath29 + @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the baryon , electric charge and strangeness number of the @xmath26 particle , with corresponding chemical potentials @xmath3 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . the @xmath36 and @xmath37 signs are for baryons and mesons respectively . the thermodynamic pressure ( @xmath38 ) can then be obtained from the logarithm of partition function in the limit of large volume as : @xmath39 in a static fireball , a particle of mass @xmath40 with @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath41 as the transverse momentum , pseudo -

[ fig : mixedratios_ppi ] shows the different cumulant ratios by taking primordial pions and protons , the lower panel show the cumulant ratios of protons and pions which have contributions from both primordial as well as resonance decay . these ratios are calculated using the hrg model should and can be considered as baseline instead of poisson contribution as baseline .", "in summary , keeping in mind the importance of mixed susceptibilities and pion - proton cumulants in unraveling the phase structure of qcd , we have provided the variation of these observables as a function of colliding beam energy within the ambit of a hrg model . the results presented in this paper will provide the required baseline for the corresponding measurements in the experiments . we have studied the effect of experimental acceptance on the ratios of the mixed susceptibilities using a hadron resonance gas model . we have considered @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 ratios , which have contributions from charged baryons ( anti - baryons ) , charged strange or baryon strange particles . there is a small dependence on @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the above susceptibility ratios . however , there is a strong energy dependence for all the ratios . these susceptibility ratios are very sensitive to the different charge states . in a real experimental situation , it is difficult to measure the strange baryons ( @xmath74 and higher masses strange baryons ) on an event - by - event basis and calculate their cumulants for fluctuations , specially at lower beam energies . instead we have concentrated on measurable ratios like @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 and presented the hrg expectations for primordial and resonance decay contributions . we have also provided a hrg based calculation of realistic baseline ( non - cep expectation ) for a set of new observables recently proposed for critical fluctuations using the different combinations of cumulant ratios of protons and pions  @xcite . the experimentally measured values of these ratios , after subtraction of the non - cep contributions , are expected to be at unity in presence of cep . these cumulant ratios of proton and pion from the hrg model calculations are observed to increase as a function of . these ratios calculated using the hrg model should be used as baseline instead of poisson expectation for the interpretation of data related to qcd critical point . m.  a.  stephanov , k.  rajagopal and e.  v.  shuryak , phys . lett .   * 81 * , 4816 ( 1998 ) . m.  g.  alford , k.  rajagopal and f.  wilczek , phys . b * 422 * , 247 ( 1998 ) . y.  aoki , g.  endrodi , z.  fodor , s.  d.  katz and k.  k.  szabo , nature * 443 * , 675 ( 2006 ) . m.  asakawa , u.  w.  heinz and b.  muller , phys . * 85 * , 2072 ( 2000 ) . m.  asakawa , s.  ejiri and m.  kitazawa , phys . lett .   * 103 * , 262301 ( 2009 ) . m.  a.  stephanov , prog . suppl .   * 153 * , 139 ( 2004 ) ;

ray data from blazars suggests the existence of cosmological magnetic fields stronger than @xmath5 g in large voids  @xcite . such magnetic fields can be accounted for by primordial magnetic fields , which are generated in the early universe  ( for recent reviews , see refs . @xcite ) . since alps generally couple with electromagnetic fields , one can expect a conversion between cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons and alps in the presence of primordial magnetic fields . such a conversion produces observable distortions in the cmb spectrum  @xcite . @xcite has studied the resonant conversion between cmb photons and alps . they obtained the photon - alp mixing constraint from the far infrared absolute spectrophotometer ( firas ) data of the cosmic background explorer ( cobe )  @xcite . since the cobe firas constraint on the resonant conversion probability @xmath6 corresponds to @xmath7 , they provided a constraint @xmath8 for alp masses between @xmath9  ev and @xmath10  ev , where @xmath0 is the coupling constant and @xmath1 is the spatially averaged magnetic field strength at the present epoch . their result suggests that , if primordial magnetic fields have a strength close to the current upper limit , the cmb distortion constraint gives a stronger constraint on @xmath0 than the solar and astrophysical bounds  @xcite . recently , pixie  @xcite and prism  @xcite have been proposed to provide precision measurements of the cmb frequency spectrum . measuring cmb distortions form the blackbody spectrum is a good probe to access the thermal history of the universe  ( see refs . @xcite for recent reviews ) . the current goal of these sensitivities to cmb distortions is set to be a factor @xmath11 improvement on the cobe firas . here , we revisit cmb distortions due to resonant photon - alp conversions , and make a forecast about the feasibility of future constraints from pixie / prism . we also expand the constraint to smaller alp masses , @xmath12  ev , than in ref . such small - mass alps naturally arise in the axiverse scenario and have diverse phenomenology in the cmb , large scale structure , and black hole astrophysics that can constrain them independently of their couplings to the visible sector  @xcite . however , when the coupling to photons is present such alps can go through resonant conversions with cmb photons due to plasma effects in the cosmic dark age and be constrained independently of their contribution to dark matter . we evaluate cmb distortions due to small - mass alps , taking into account multiple resonant conversions . this paper is organized as follows . we briefly review the resonant conversion between photons and alps in the cosmological scenario in sec . we also derive the analytical form of the resonant conversion in both strong and weak coupling limits at the resonant epoch . in sec . iii , we calculate the resonant conversion probability numerically and evaluate the pixie / prism constraints on the alp coupling and primordial magnetic field strength . iv is devoted to our conclusions . throughout this paper , we adopt natural units where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and the boltzmann constant @xmath15 . we use cosmological parameters for a flat @xmath16cdm model , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .", "alps couple to electromagnetic fields through a two photon vertex . in the existence of external magnetic fields , electromagnetic fields in the alp interaction terms can be decomposed into the dynamical part of photons and the external magnetic field part . as a result , the interaction term of an alp and a photon with external magnetic fields is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the photon frequency , @xmath22 is the component of the external magnetic field perpendicular to the propagation of photons , and @xmath23 is the component of a photon parallel to the @xmath22 component .    due to this interaction , the propagation eigenstates of the photon - alp system @xmath24 are different from the interaction eigenstates with external magnetic fields . therefore , conversion between @xmath25 and @xmath26 occurs in the same way as for massive neutrinos of different flavors . the mixing angle of @xmath24 in vacuum is given by  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the alp mass . this mixing angle produces photon - alp oscillations with a wavenumber @xmath29    in the cosmological plasma , the photon dispersion relation is modified due to plasma effects . this modification can be parametrized by an effective photon mass @xmath30 . among the various plasma effects , the scatterings off free electrons and neutral atoms make negative and positive contributions to the effective photon mass , respectively . due to these effects , the effective mass can be given as  @xcite @xmath31 , \\label{eq : m_gamma}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the plasma frequency @xmath33 with the fine structure constant @xmath34 , the electron mass @xmath35 and the free electron number density @xmath36 . the refractive index of neutral hydrogen @xmath37 is set to @xmath38 in normal conditions  @xcite . in eq . ( [ eq : m_gamma ] ) , we ignore the contributions of helium and magnetic fields , because these effects are negligibly small  @xcite . the effective photon mass depends on the evolution of the ionization fraction @xmath39 through the neutral hydrogen and free electron number densities . ionized hydrogen recombines with free electrons at @xmath40 and is reionized around @xmath41  @xcite . we calculate @xmath39 with recfast  @xcite , adopting a toy model for reionization which is given by a @xmath42 function , @xmath43 $ ] with @xmath44 and @xmath45 . we plot the evolution of the effective photon mass in fig . [ fig : mg2 ] with cmb temperature @xmath46 . the effective mass squared has positive and negative contributions from scattering off free electrons and neutral atoms , respectively . as a result , the effective mass becomes negative for high frequencies in the dark ages where negative contributions dominate positive ones . the effective photon mass modifies photon - alp oscillations through the lagrangian . this effect arises as the effective mixing angle @xmath47  @xcite , @xmath48 where the parameter @xmath49 controls the significance of the plasma effects , @xmath50    as shown in fig . [ fig : mg2 ] , the effective mass at early universe can be much larger than the alp mass and @xmath51 . in this case , the conversion between @xmath25 and @xmath26 is suppressed . however , as the universe evolves , the effective mass equals an alp mass and @xmath49 reaches unity . at this time , the effective mixing angle becomes @xmath52 and the resonant conversion occurs between photons and alps with this mass . this is in analogy to `` resonant '' neutrino oscillations known as mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect  @xcite . , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 with cmb temperature @xmath46 . for @xmath56 the photon mass is always positive and the minimum alp mass that experiences resonant conversion is @xmath57ev , with multiple resonance for @xmath58ev ( horizontal line ) . since @xmath30 passes through zero and back for high @xmath21 , these will be most relevant for light alps and multiple resonances . , width=302 ]    the conversion probability for the resonance is given by  @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the level crossing probability , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the effective mixing angles at the photon production  ( @xmath63 ) and detection points  ( @xmath64 ) , respectively . at the photon production point ( i.e. at reheating ) , since the redshift is very high , @xmath49 is large . hence we approximate @xmath65 throughout this paper . the level crossing probability @xmath60 indicates the non - adiabaticity of the conversion . while @xmath60 becomes zero in the limit of the adiabatic conversion , @xmath60 reaches unity in the extremely non - adiabatic case . in order to obtain the level crossing probability , we make the approximation that @xmath30 varies linearly in the resonance regime , and make a taylor - series expansion at the resonance position , neglecting the second- and higher - derivative terms . in this approximation , the level crossing probability is given by applying the landau - zener result  @xcite , @xmath66 , \\label{eq : landau}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are respectively the oscillation wavelength and vacuum mixing angle at the resonance epoch , and @xmath69 is a scale parameter to be evaluated at the location where a resonance occurs  @xcite , @xmath70 where @xmath71 refers to the time at the resonance .    for small @xmath28  ( @xmath72  ev ) , we expected from fig . [ fig : mg2 ] that multiple resonances occur . the conversion probability can be calculated in a manner similar to the single resonance case . following the classical probability result , we obtain the probability for the double resonant case by replacing @xmath60 by @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the probabilities for the first and second resonances , respectively  @xcite . similarly to the double resonant case , the probability for more multiple resonances can be calculated . resonant photon - alp conversions depend on the component of external magnetic fields perpendicular to the propagation direction of photons , @xmath22 . generally , primordial magnetic fields have structures which depend on the generation mechanisms of these fields . therefore , the resonant conversion probability is possibly anisotropic due to these structures and depends on the ratio of the magnetic field coherent scale to the resonant scale . in this paper , we focus on the monopole component of cmb distortions to the black - body spectrum .    before calculating resonant conversion probabilities numerically , it is worth estimating them analytically for two cases , @xmath76 and @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the effective photon mass at the detection point  ( @xmath64 ) .    in the case of @xmath76 , the resonant conversion probability has been studied in ref . the mixing angle at the detection point is expressed by that in the vacuum state given by eq .

( [ eq : landau ] ) . a strong non - adiabatic condition , @xmath84 , leads the level crossing probability to @xmath85 accordingly , in the weak coupling limit , the conversion probability at a comoving frequency @xmath21 can be provided by  @xcite @xmath86 where the redshift factor comes from the dependence of both magnetic fields and cmb physical frequency on the resonant epoch .    for @xmath87 , cmb photons suffer multiple resonances . since photons are still detected in vacuum , we can approximate @xmath80 in the weak mixing limit . for the double resonance case , the sky - averaged conversion probability is expressed as @xmath88 it is clear that the cobe firas limit requires fine - tuning of @xmath74 and @xmath75 . accordingly , for @xmath87 , the parameter regions of @xmath0 and @xmath89 are tightly restricted .    in the case of @xmath90 , photons are no longer detected in vacuum , and the mixing angle at the detection point is given by eq . ( [ eq : theta ] ) . therefore , @xmath91 is approximated by @xmath92 in the weak mixing limit . then , the sky - averaged probability for the resonant conversion can be written as @xmath93    for low frequencies ( @xmath94 ) , the effective photon mass is always positive and larger than the alp mass . therefore , there is no resonance and the photon - alp conversion is adiabatic . this results in the sky - averaged probability for the resonant conversion being @xmath95 with @xmath96 . however , for high frequencies  ( @xmath97 ) , double resonant conversions happen . the sky - averaged probability for the resonant conversion is given by @xmath98 in the double resonant case , the cobe firas limit requires strong non - adiabatic resonances , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , or completely adiabatic conversions , @xmath101 and @xmath102 . here , we focus on only the case of strong non - adiabatic resonances . when the weak coupling limit is valid at the resonant epochs , the resonant conversion probability is given by @xmath103,\\label{eq : weak - double}\\ ] ] where the subscripts @xmath104 and @xmath105 denote values at the first and second resonant epochs , respectively . the magnetic field strength and cmb frequency at the resonant epochs depend on the redshift due to the cosmological expansion . as @xmath28 decreases , the weak coupling limit is no longer valid and the strong coupling limit @xmath106 is satisfied at the resonant epochs , although the weak coupling limit is still valid at the detection point  ( @xmath64 ) . we find that the level crossing probability in the strong coupling limit has the same approximate form as in the weak coupling limit  ( see also appendix ) . accordingly , the sky averaged conversion probability can be written as @xmath103 . \\label{eq : double - reso}\\ ] ] in both weak and strong coupling limits , the resonant conversion probability can be expressed in the same form as shown in eqs . ( [ eq : weak - double ] ) and ( [ eq : double - reso ] ) .", "a photon - alp coupling causes resonant conversions of cmb photons to alps . in the standard big bang scenario , the cmb spectrum is predicted as a black - body spectrum . when conversions happen after the decoupling of cmb thermal equilibrium , they can produce observable cmb distortions from the black - body spectrum . cobe firas confirmed that the cmb spectrum is well fit to a black - body spectrum at temperature @xmath107k  @xcite . the intensity of the black - body spectrum is given by @xmath108^{-1}.\\ ] ]    due to the presence of photon - alp conversions , the observed intensity is modified to   @xmath109 therefore , the sky - average cmb distortion from the black - body spectrum can be written as @xmath110    we show the frequency dependence of the cmb distortions for different alp masses and @xmath111 in fig .

[ fig : fr ] shows that the conversion probability depends on @xmath117 , and is proportional to @xmath21 . these are well described by eq .

( [ eq : double - reso ] ) . in fig . [ fig : fr ] , both lines for @xmath119  ev show that the resonant conversion probability also depends on @xmath111 as expected from eq . ( [ eq : double - reso ] ) . the frequency dependence is not trivial , because the resonance epochs depend on the frequency as shown in fig . [ fig : mg2 ] . when we assume @xmath128 , we find that , although the magnetic field strength and cmb frequency are larger at higher redshift , the second term in eq . ( [ eq : double - reso ] ) makes a dominant contribution . [ fig : fr ] shows that , as the cmb frequency increases , @xmath129 also becomes large on the high frequency side @xmath130 , similarly to the case of @xmath131  ev where the conversion probability is proportional to the frequency . cmb distortions are also created in the thermalization process of energy injections in the early universe . ussually , these distortions are described by two types of the distortions ; @xmath121- and @xmath122-type distortions  @xcite . for comparison , in fig . [ fig : fr ] , we show the frequency dependence of @xmath121- and @xmath122-type distortions . here , we plot these distortions with cobe limits , @xmath132 and @xmath133  @xcite . compared with these distortions , the resonant conversion creates frequency - independent distortions makes differences on high frequencies . although @xmath121-type distortions are suppressed and @xmath122-type provides excess distortions ( @xmath134 ) , the resonant conversion generates the deficit distortions . currently , prism is designed to measure the deviation @xmath135 for the cmb frequency range , @xmath136  ( @xmath137 )  @xcite . we adopt these values as the pixie / prism sensitivity for cmb distortions . we evaluate the pixie / prism constraints on the alp coupling and magnetic fields , @xmath138 from these values . we plot the pixie / prism constraint as functions of an alp mass @xmath28 in fig . [ fig : limit ] .     as functions of alp mass @xmath28 . the thick lines are for pixie / prism limit and the thin lines are for cobe firas limit . the dotted , dashed and solid lines represent frequencies , @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively . the mass region where fine tuned @xmath142 is required to satisfy the cobe firas limit is shown as the shaded region . , width=302 ]    cobe/ firas has provided the best upper bound on possible cmb distortions from the black - body spectrum . according to ref . @xcite , we assume that cobe firas constraint is @xmath143 for frequencies @xmath144 and evaluate the cobe firas limit . for comparison , we show the cobe firas limit as thin lines in fig . [ fig : limit ] .    for @xmath145  ev , the resonant conversion occurs only once . the conversion probability can be written as eq . ( [ eq : con - approx ] ) and is proportional to @xmath146 . therefore , as shown in fig . [ fig : limit ] , pixie / prism can give a much better constraint on @xmath147 than cobe firas and the improvement is roughly given by the ratio @xmath148 . in the shaded region , the multiple resonances happen while the detection point ( @xmath64 ) is in vacuum , @xmath76 . the resonant conversion probability is provided by eq . ( [ eq : tuned ] ) . as discussed above , the cobe constraint requires fine tuned @xmath111 . this means that alps in this mass region are effectively ruled out .    in the case of @xmath149 ev , there is no resonant conversion for lower frequencies @xmath94 . the strong constraint on @xmath150 can not be obtained for such low frequencies . on the other hand , cmb photons with higher frequencies @xmath151 suffer double resonant conversions . as a result , the constraints on @xmath152 are divided to three alp mass regions which correspond to eqs . ( [ eq : weak - double ] ) and ( [ eq : double - reso ] ) .    when @xmath138 attains the value of the prism / pixie constraint in fig . [ fig : limit ] , the weak coupling limit is valid at resonance epochs for @xmath153ev . the resonant conversion probability is given by eq . ( [ eq : weak - double ] ) . although eq . ( [ eq : weak - double ] ) has an explicit dependence on @xmath28 , this dependence is canceled by @xmath154 and @xmath155 which are proportional to @xmath156 from eq . ( [ eq : r ] )  ( note that @xmath157 is independent of @xmath28 in this mass region ) . as a result , the resonant conversion probability does not depend on @xmath28 .    for @xmath158  ev , @xmath138 at the prism / pixie constraint reaches the strong coupling limit at resonance epochs . the conversion probabilities in the strong coupling limit are approximated to the identical form to the weak coupling limit as shown in eqs . ( [ eq : weak - double ] ) and ( [ eq : double - reso ] ) . the conversion probability does not depend on alp mass , @xmath28 . therefore , our constraint can be extended down to @xmath159  ev axions which can play an interesting role in the context of large - scale structure formation @xcite . when the alp mass is @xmath149 , the resonant conversion probability in the both limits of weak and strong couplings is proportional to @xmath146 . therefore , pixie / prism can improve the constraint on @xmath147 from cobe firas by the ratio @xmath148 as same as for larger mass of alps , @xmath160 .    to close this section we comment on our assumption about the coherent scale of magnetic fields . in our calculations , for simplicity , we have assumed that the coherent scale of magnetic fields is larger than a resonant scale . here we discuss the validity of this assumption . mirizzi et al . have studied the condition for this assumption with @xmath161  @xcite . the typical comoving width of a resonance @xmath162 is given by @xmath163 . comparing with the comoving coherent scale of magnetic fields , @xmath164 , they showed that the condition of @xmath165 is valid when the coupling @xmath166 satisfy @xmath167 our constraint meets this condition with the comoving coherent scale @xmath168  mpc . we can also check the validity of the assumption for @xmath169 . although resonances occur twice at @xmath170 and @xmath171 , the lower - redshift resonance has a typical comoving width @xmath172 larger than the higher - redshift resonance ( @xmath128 ) . for cmb frequency @xmath173 , we get the fitting formula of @xmath155 as @xmath174 fig . [ fig : mg2 ] shows @xmath175 . therefore , the condition @xmath176 for @xmath177 is achieved when the comoving coherent scale of magnetic fields satisfies @xmath178 where we used @xmath179 with @xmath180 and @xmath181 . as the alp mass decreases , our constraint is valid for small - scale magnetic fields . as the alp mass decreases , our constraint is valid for small scale magnetic fields , such as those expected to be produced in the qcd or electroweak phase transitions ( @xmath182 )  @xcite .", "in this paper , we have studied resonant conversions from cmb photons to small - mass alps with primordial magnetic fields . resonant conversions of cmb photons to such small - mass alps occur due to plasma effects in the dark age . these resonant conversions can produce observable cmb distortions . we have evaluated the resonant conversion probability between cmb photons and alps , following the method of ref . in particular , we have focused on low - mass alps , @xmath183  ev . depending on cmb frequency , cmb photons suffer multiple resonant conversions to such low - mass alps . using cobe firas bound on the possible cmb distortions from the black - body spectrum , we have obtained the upper limit on @xmath184 where @xmath0 and @xmath185 are the photon - alp coupling constant and the averaged primordial magnetic field strength at the present epoch . our limit is @xmath186 for @xmath3 at the cmb frequency @xmath187 . we have found that the cobe constraint requires fine tuned @xmath111 for @xmath188 . this means that alps in this mass region with non - zero photon coupling are effectively ruled out . we have also evaluated the constraint expected from pixie / prism , one of whose goals is to measure the cmb frequency spectrum precisely . compared with cobe firas , pixie / prism can improve the constraint on @xmath189 by the ratio of pixie / prism s cmb distortion sensitivity to cobe firas s one . accordingly , the pixie / prism constraint is @xmath190 for @xmath3 at the cmb frequency @xmath187 . the resonant conversion creates the deficit distortion . this fact means that the effective temperate of residual free electron gas , which is thermally equivalent with cmb temperature before the resonant conversion , becomes higher than the effective cmb temperature after the conversion . as a result , in order to recover the thermal equilibrium state , electrons with high momenta cool by compton scatterings and ones with low momenta absorb cmb photons . this signature can appear on the cmb spectrum at low frequencies  ( less than 1  ghz ) . we will address this issue in the near future . the current direct constraint on the photon - alp coupling for small mass is @xmath191 for @xmath192  @xcite . our constraint is to the product of the photon - alp coupling constant @xmath0 and the magnetic field strength @xmath193 . the constraint on @xmath194 has been also derived from studying the effect of photon - alp conversions on cmb polarization  @xcite . our result shows that cobe firas constraint is comparable with this bound and pixie / prism can provide the better bound . recently , the limit similar to the pixie / prism constraint , @xmath195 , has been suggested as due to the conversion _ from _ the axionic dark radiation _ to _ cmb photons  @xcite . however , our work relies on the reverse process , which does not require the prior production of axionic dark radiation . therefore pixie / prism can give the more robust constraint . as for primordial magnetic fields , the upper bounds on primordial magnetic fields are provided by observations of cmb anisotropies  @xcite and large scale structures  @xcite . the constraint on comoving magnetic field strength with the @xmath104  mpc coherent scale is below several nano gauss . therefore , if primordial magnetic fields are detected with the upper limit strength , the pixie / prism limit can give a stronger constraint on the photon - alp coupling @xmath0 stronger by roughly 5 orders of magnitude compared to the present limit for small - alp mass , @xmath196  ev  ev , then the photon coupling leads to cosmological birefringence ( e.g. @xcite ) and causes rotation of cmb polarisation . limits from wmap9 @xcite translate to constraints on @xmath0 of a similar order of magnitude to those obtainable by pixie / prism for intermediate scale axion decay constants @xmath197  gev . planck polarisation results should improve this further . ] .    on the other hand , if in future the existence of small - mass alps were confirmed , for example by direct detection @xcite , and the photon - alp coupling constant was measured then the constraint of pixie / prism constrains primordial magnetic fields . the measurement of cmb distortions by pixie / prism can then give the stronger constraint on the primordial magnetic fields than other current upper limits . we thank jens chlubas for useful comments . ht is supported by the doe . the research of js has been supported at iap by the erc project 267117 ( dark ) hosted by universit pierre et marie curie -

leech 1994 ; murphy 1996 ) and molecular gas rich with a high star formation ( sf ) rate as most of the luminosity is radiated by dust in the far - ir . sanders ( 1988 ) suggested that the most extreme ultra - ligs ( uligs ) with @xmath7 comparable with the bolometric luminosity of quasars ( qsos ) , are dust - enshrouded qsos triggered by the interaction / merger of two _ gas - rich _ spirals . however , a starburst origin ( , joseph & wright 1985 ) even for uligs has also been suggested . evidence in favor of a starburst includes the h@xmath1 gas content , radio continuum morphology and iso mid - ir spectroscopy ( , solomon 1997 ( s97 ) ; downes & solomon 1998 ( ds98 ) ; condon 1991 ; genzel 1998 ) . the observed abundant supply of _ dense _ h@xmath1 gas traced by hcn emission , usually found only in sf cores ( solomon 1992 ; gao 1996 ; gao & solomon 1999 ) shows that uligs are ideal stellar nurseries . although there have been extensive co observations in ligs / uligs including co imaging ( , scoville 1991 ; 1997 ; ds98 ) , there has been no systematic attempt to trace the h@xmath1 gas properties during the galaxy - galaxy merger sequence starting with systems roughly separated by a galactic diameter . the purpose of this study is to investigate the connection between the progress of a merger and the h@xmath1 gas responsible for the sf . there are many close mergers where the progenitors are not gas - rich galaxies ; these may never become ligs . all ligs / uligs are h@xmath1 gas rich ( sanders 1991 ; gao 1996 ; s97 ) . the ideal sample to trace a merger sequence should contain galaxies of various merging stages that initially started with roughly comparable molecular gas content . since this is impossible , we select ligs where we can identify the 2 progenitors from ccd images usually in the red or near - ir . by measuring the co(1 - 0 ) luminosity as a function of the merger separation , the time dependence of the gas content can be traced statistically .", "we focus exclusively on mergers satisfying @xmath8 ,   where @xmath9 is the projected separation between the nuclei of the merging galaxies of the major diameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in reality , we require the pairs have touching / overlapping optical disks / tails . we exclude late mergers of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 kpc at an angular distance of @xmath14 mpc ) so that @xmath9 can be reliably measured . this also helps to distinguish genuine mergers from projection effects , exclude galaxies where there is confusion of the extranuclear starburst regions with galactic nuclei , and minimize other potential biases introduced by the seeing limit or severe dust obscuration . at larger distance , ligs with @xmath15  kpc similar to the nearest uligs arp  220 , mrk  273 will be simply indistinguishable from the single - nucleus galaxies without sub - arcsec imaging . even at moderate distances ( @xmath16 mpc ) , some previously accepted close doubles , , mrk  231 ( armus 1994 ) and iras  12112 + 0305 ( sanders 1992 ) turn out to be singles as seen by hst ( surace 1998 ; sanders 1998 , private communications ) . our sample selection is simple : all ligs with   @xmath17   are selected if they have both co data and ccd images . a heterogeneous sample of 50 ligs has been used ( table  1 ) ; 19 of them are uligs . co(1 - 0 ) observations have been conducted in @xmath18 ligs of mostly mergers ( gao 1996 ) . most have been observed with the nrao 12 m and a representation is shown in fig .  1 ( details will be discussed in a future paper ) . this nearly completes the co data for nearby lig mergers in the bright galaxy sample ( bgs , soifer 1989 ;

ds98 ) by using a constant conversion factor , the dependence of h@xmath1 mass on separation may be even steeper than that in eq . 1 .    mergers separated by a few kpc produce the * same * as mergers with @xmath39  kpc * with less h@xmath1 gas * ( fig .  2 & eq .  1 ) . it is not the increase in molecular gas that leads to the high  but the increase in average gas surface density which produces a higher sfe . in more than a dozen early / intermediate stage mergers in this sample , co imaging reveals that most of the gas is in the inner merging disks except for widely separated pairs not yet closely interacting , which have extended co ( gao 1997 ; 1998a ; lo , gao & gruendl 1997 ) . arp  302 ( lo 1997 ) , the widest pair ( @xmath9=25  kpc ) , has two extended co disks ( @xmath40 kpc ) and one of them shows roughly an exponential disk with a scale length of @xmath41 kpc extending out to 20 kpc in diameter . ngc  6670 ( @xmath42 kpc ) shows central sources with @xmath43 kpc radii and strong co disks out to @xmath44 kpc with weaker emission out to 15 kpc in both galaxies . arp  238 ( @xmath9=12  kpc ) and arp  55 ( @xmath9=10  kpc ) , the intermediate stage mergers , show central @xmath132 kpc sources and extensions out to @xmath4410 kpc in both pairs of disks . late mergers like arp  299 ( aalto 1997 ) and ngc  6090 ( @xmath45 kpc ) show gas concentrations between the merging disks .    for a pair of gas - rich spirals initially separated at @xmath46 kpc , merging at ( orbital decay speed ) @xmath47 , the time to reach @xmath48 is   @xmath49 myr . if the ligs with different separations are interpreted as a sequence then , using a standard conversion factor and eq .  1 , the implied average sf ( gas depletion ) rate is @xmath50 where @xmath51 . of course , the trend evident in fig . 2a may not be a true time sequence since it is a snapshot of many ligs at various separations . nevertheless , this sf rate deduced from the observed depletion of h@xmath1 gas is similar to that inferred from @xmath0 ( under the assumption that the ir luminosity is from imbedded high mass stars ) : about 100 /yr for @xmath52 ( , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .    at the extreme end of the merger sequence are ultra - ligs ( uligs ) with small separations or no evidence of 2 remaining nuclei , which have very compact gas concentrations and about 5 times more  than ligs . most of the molecular gas in uligs is concentrated in the central 1 kpc and is not in normal gmcs ; the translation of  to h@xmath1 mass is fundamentally different ( s97 ; ds98 ) and the h@xmath1 mass is lower than expected from use of a standard coversion factor . nevertheless , uligs still have close to @xmath53 h@xmath1 . even allowing for this , uligs do not follow the correlations we find for ligs ( fig .  2 ) . the difference may be due to the different physical parameters of the starbursts . the starbursts in uligs appear to take place predominantly in * extreme starburst * regions of @xmath16 pc size and @xmath54 ( ds98 ) with substantial velocity structure characterized by rotation or bar - like motion . they are the primary sources of the millimeter continuum with more than 1,000 magnitudes of visual extinction . for example , arp 220 has two extreme starburst regions . these may be the remnants of nuclei or condensations in the gas but they now are composed almost entirely of gas and young stars . agns might also contribute to  in some uligs ( , veilleux 1997 ) .    mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ) have predicted the sf rate and the gas depletion during a merger sequence in two extreme cases : galaxies with bulges and without ( see their fig . the decrease in h@xmath1 mass in our sample ( fig . 2a ) is consistent with their model prediction ( especially when uligs are excluded ) for a diverse group of initial conditions and bulge / disk ratios . in the models only mergers with bulges have enough gas left for a final extreme burst as in uligs . the models failed to predict gas concentration in the overlap region , either hi in early mergers , , ngc  6670 ( wang 1998 ) or h@xmath1 in intermediate mergers , , arp  244 and arp  299 ( gao 1998b ; aalto 1997 ) . although gas inflow into the center in late mergers is predicted ( mihos & hernquist 1996 ; barnes & hernquist 1996 ) , this is near the final merging ( @xmath55 3 kpc ) . successful models should distinguish between diffuse hi and h@xmath1 in gmcs and produce this feature when galaxies are still 515 kpc apart . sf in the overlap region is predicted in a model by the compression of pre - existing gmcs due to the heating of the atomic ism by shocks ( jog & solomon 1992 ) . pre - existing gmcs are clearly the source of sf even before the true merging of the disks as is evident in arp  302 .", "we show here that there is a strong correlation between co luminosity , a measure of m(h@xmath1 ) , and the projected separation for luminous infrared galaxies ( ligs ) . although there is no correlation between the star formation ( sf ) rate ( ) and separation , ligs with smaller separation have a higher sf rate per solar mass of h@xmath1 . this increase in sf `` efficiency '' is due to increased h@xmath1 gas surface density . advanced mergers have * less * h@xmath1 mass ( not more ) than when the mergers started . this implies that the starburst is not fueled by a large inflow of a huge mass of diffuse hi gas from large galactic radii converting to h@xmath1 , but rather that existing gmcs form stars throughout the merging process over a few hundred million years . although the correlations are robust for ligs they do not exist for ultra - ligs ( uligs ) . the difference may be due to the different physical parameters and timescales of the starbursts . the starbursts in uligs appear to take place predominantly in * extreme starburst * regions with radii @xmath14 pc , @xmath56 h@xmath1 , @xmath54 and a very high sf efficiency ( ds98 ) . the dynamical timescales in extreme starbursts are characterized by only about a million years ( @xmath57 and size @xmath16 pc ) . we thank d.c . kim , d.b . sanders and j.d . goldader for the use of some optical images . helpful suggestions and discussions with d.b . sanders are gratefully acknowledged . we appreciate very much for the thorough review and thoughtful / helpful comments of the referee , t.w . murphy , jr . yg s research at lai is funded by nsf grant ast96 - 13999 and u. of illinois . aalto , s. 1997 , apj , 475 , l107 . armus , l. , heckman , t.m . , & miley , g.k . 1987 , aj , 94 , 831 . armus , l. , 1994 , aj , 108 , 76 . barnes , j.e . , & hernquist , l. 1996 , apj , 471 , 115 . combes , f. , 1994 , a&a , 281 , 725 . condon , j.j . , huang , z .- p . , yin , q.f . , & thuan , t.x . 1991 , apj , 378 , 65 . downes , d. , & solomon , p.m. 1998 , apj , 507 , 615 .

[ modsim ] we give a short account of our present understanding , making use of modern computer simulations of the lunar data , of some of the methods by which the babylonians arrived at their precise knowledge of the periods of the sun and the moon . in sect . [ four ] we analyse their determination of the lunar period by applying modern fourier analysis . this technique is also successfully used in the semiclassical description of quantum oscillations in terms of classical closed ( periodic ) orbits,@xcite which has had a substantial impact on recent research on quantum chaos.@xcite", "the babylonian astronomy focused on special phenomena . in case of the moon , these were eclipses and some ocurrences around conjunction ( new moon , i.e. , sun and moon have the same ecliptical longitude ) and opposition ( full moon : the elongation of the moon from the sun equals 180 ) . in case of the planets they were , e.g. , the first and last visibility . the so - called babylonian mathematical astronomy , which was fully developed around 300 b.c . , enabled the scribes to calculate positions and times of these special phases . they did , however , not consider them as functions of a continuous time variable , but they calculated a series of discrete phases along the path of the celestial body in question . for the moon they recorded times and positions of consecutive conjunctions or oppositions , labeled by the names of the months during which they occurred . the new babylonian month started on the evening when the crescent moon became visible for the first time after conjunction . the time interval  from sunset until moonset on that evening was observed . this quantity is quite obvious and easy to observe . however , from a theoretical point of view , it is very complicated . it depends on the velocity @xmath4 of the moon , its longitude @xmath5 ( position in the ecliptic ) , its latitude @xmath6 ( distance from the ecliptic ) , and on the time interval @xmath7 from conjunction to sunset . it is an impressing achievement of the babylonian scribes that they were able to develop very elegant numerical systems capable of calculating  for consecutive new moons , taking all the variables into account . the values of  were listed in so - called lunar ephemerides for each month . ( similarly , in the modern computer simulations discussed in sect . [ modsim ] below , we present the data as functions of the lunation number @xmath1 counting the full moons . ) at least since o. neugebauer@xcite we know how the ephemerides were calculated ; but we have still rather little knowledge about how this theory was derived from observations .    one big question was how the period @xmath8 of the lunar velocity was found . the movement of the moon is very irregular : it keeps changing phase and latitude and can have its maximal velocity anywhere on the ecliptic . which kind of observations did the babylonians use ? in lunar ephemerides concerned with conjunctions , the calculated values of the lunar velocity for successive new moons are given in a column called f. but these values are all derived from a linear zig - zag function , given in a column @xmath9 appearing directly after the first column containing the names of the months . therefore we must assume that @xmath9 , rather than f , was constructed from observations . their common period is p@xmath10 = 6247/448 = 13.94420 synodic months , which is surprisingly accurate . p@xmath11 is the mean period of the lunar velocity measured on the days of conjunction ( or at oppositions for the full - moon ephemerides ) . let p@xmath12 be the period of the lunar velocity , measured from day to day . the value of p@xmath10 corresponds to the period p@xmath12 = 6247/6695 synodic months = 27.55453 days . the presently known value , calculated for babylonian times , is 27.55455 days . column @xmath9 was long supposed to be based on lunar eclipses which were of great importance in mesopotamia and had been observed since early times . however , the babylonian observational records of moon eclipses were too inaccurate to allow for their accurate value of p@xmath10 . therefore it has been postulated@xcite that some other observations were used to construct @xmath9  namely those of some short time intervals around full moons .      since 747 b.c . , celestial phenomena were observed regularly and recorded month after month in the so - called diaries.@xcite the astronomical observations conducted in mesopotamia may be called the longest scientific project ever . diaries were produced continuously during a period of almost 700 years - the latest diary found so far stems from the year 61 b.c . they were written in cuneiform on clay tablets : for each month of the year lunar phases , eclipses and planetary phases were recorded together with market prices , weather observations and historical events . in the earliest diaries only the days of the special lunar phases were recorded . however , starting at least back in the 6th century b.c . , the babylonians began to regularly observe the times between the risings and settings of sun and moon in the days around opposition and record the measured times . ( the oldest preserved diary in which  is mentioned stems from the year 568 b.c . ) the following four special time intervals relating to the full moon , the so - called `` lunar four '' , were observed and recorded :    @xmath13  = time from moonset to sunrise measured at last moonset before sunrise ,    = time from sunrise to moonset measured at first moonset after sunrise ,    = time from moonrise to sunset measured at last moonrise before sunset ,    = time from sunset to moonrise measured at first moonrise after sunset . these time intervals were measured in u = time degrees ( 1 day = 360 ; 1 u @xmath14 4 min ) , and since they were rather short ( @xmath15 20  = 80 min ) , they could be measured much more accurately than the times of eclipses . therefore , lunar four data may be much better candidates for the reconstruction of @xmath9 than eclipse observations . however , these intervals  all of them being similar to   are very complicated functions of the lunar velocity , its longitude and latitude , and of the time from opposition to sunrise :  = ( @xmath4,@xmath5,@xmath6,@xmath7 ) , etc . was it possible for the babylonians to extract information on @xmath4 from these beating functions , i.e. , to find @xmath16 ?    from cuneiform tablets it is known that the babylonians did observe the lunar four with quite some accuracy . but since only about 5% of all diaries have been found until now , there are large gaps in the recorded data . it is not possible to extract a sufficient amount of lunar four data to check exactly what information they contain . therefore , it is of great help to simulate the lunar four data by means of a computer code for lunar ephemerides , as will be discussed in the following section . since we thereby are concerned mainly with the partial sums  and  of the lunar four , it is necessary to briefly mention their astronomical significance.@xcite on the last morning before opposition , the moon sets  degrees before sunrise and on the next morning , it sets  degrees after sunrise . we see that during the day of opposition , in comparison to sunrise , the setting moon on the western horizon is retarded by the amount . similar arguments show that , observed on the eastern horizon , is the retardation of the rising moon during the day of opposition .", "for our computer simulations of lunar observables at ancient babylonian times , we used a code developed by s. moshier,@xcite which employes a semi - analytical lunar ephemeris adequate for historical times.@xcite from the risings and settings of sun and moon , evaluated at the days around the oppositions , we computed the lunar four and tabulated them as functions of the lunation number @xmath1 .      using such calculated lunar four data and the simple idea that observations in the east should be combined with observations in the west , it was found@xcite that the sum of all lunar four , @xmath0 = + , yields oscillations with the period @xmath8 that can be fitted by the linear zig - zag function recorded in column @xmath9 . in , we show the curve @xmath17 by crosses , connected with thick lines . the thin dashed line is the function @xmath18 , shifted by an amount @xmath19100 . it yields an optimal fit to the calculated function @xmath17 . it overshoots the extrema of @xmath17 but reproduces its main oscillations yielding , in particular the correct period p@xmath20 . note that the phase of @xmath17 ( i.e. , its position along the @xmath1 axis ) was not adjusted , but obtained directly from the calculated ephemerides appropriate for the time span ( indicated by a horizontal bar in the figure ) covered by the data ( shown in below ) on the cuneiform tablet lbat 1285 . the only adjusted parameter here is the vertical shift of @xmath19100 , whose origin and significance have remained unclear so far .    in sect . [ fourbab ] we will use fourier analysis to illustrate that the period p@xmath11 can be extracted from a fit to the function @xmath17 , but not to any of the single lunar four , nor to the partial sums ( ) @xmath21 or ( ) ( @xmath1 ) .    the conclusion is therefore nearlying that we have found the observational origin of the column @xmath9 from which all data related to the lunar velocity were derived . the hypothesis that @xmath9 was constructed from the combination @xmath0 of lunar observables is theoretically well supported@xcite by the astronomical significance of @xmath0 .    in order to support this hypothesis with historical evidence , it must be shown that the babylonians really did collect lunar four data of consecutive months , and that the accuracy of these data was sufficient . a special type of tablets , the goal - year tablets,@xcite collect lunar and planetary data to be used for astronomical predictions in a special year , the `` goal year '' . a goal - year tablet for the year @xmath22 records all lunar four intervals from the year @xmath23 together with the eclipses that took place ( or were expected to occur ) during the year @xmath23 . it also lists the sums  and  for the last six months of year @xmath24 . the babylonians have thus , indeed , recorded the lunar four data continuously , and we can test their accuracy by modern simulations .    in we plot the babylonian data recorded on the goal - year tablet lbat 1285 ( circles and dashed lines ) and compare them with the computer - simulated values ( crosses and solid lines ) . although the single lunar four behave rather irregularly , the agreement between old observations and modern calculations is very good , considering the fact that no adjustable parameter has been used . especially important is the fact that the recorded values of the partial sums  and  lie very close to the computer - simulated curves and reflect even some of their fine structure . similar agreement could be found with data recorded on many other tablets , one of them dating back to the times of cambyses ( 523 b.c.).@xcite    we have thus clear historical evidence that the babylonians did record the lunar four regularly over several hundred years and , in particular , paid attention also to their partial sums  and . the accuracy of these recorded data is sufficient to support the hypothesis that the lunar period p@xmath11 could be extracted from their sum @xmath0 . what if some lunar four data could not be observed because of bad weather or some other reason ? there must have been ways to reconstruct or predict them . one saros = 223 synodic months @xmath14 18 years is a well - known eclipse cycle . a lunar eclipse observed in the year @xmath23 will occur again in the year @xmath22 , and it will be visible in babylon if it takes place during the night when the moon is above the horizon . we can thus easily understand that the eclipse data on the tablet for the goal - year @xmath22 could be used for predicting eclipses in the year @xmath22 . but the question arises : how and to what purpose were the recorded lunar four data of 1 saros ago used ? helps us to answer this question . over a period of 30 months , the functions @xmath21 , ( ) @xmath21 , and ( @xmath25 are compared here with their respective values 223 months earlier . the sums  and  repeat themselves nicely after 1 saros . this is not too surprising since 1 saros , in a good approximation , equals an integer number of periods of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . however , @xmath21 ( taken as a representative of all single lunar four ) behaves very irregularly and there seems to be no simple connection between @xmath21 and @xmath26 .    it is , nevertheless , possible to predict single lunar four data by means of goal - year data . the knowledge that ( ) @xmath21 = ( ) @xmath26 and ( ) @xmath21 = ( ) @xmath26 can be combined with our knowledge that the three variables @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 will have approximately the same magnitudes at two oppositions @xmath27 and @xmath28 , situated one saros apart . the only variable determining the lunar four which has changed after one saros is the time at which opposition takes place : 1 saros = 223 synodic months = 6585 + 1/3 days . the time of opposition , compared to sunrise and sunset , is shifted by 1/3 day . these considerations led to the following proposal@xcite how the goal - year tablets could be used for predicting the lunar four by what we call the `` goal - year method '' : @xmath29 the shift of 1/3 day in the time of opposition lets @xmath21 become 1/3 ( ) larger than @xmath26 , while  is reduced by the same amount . the quantity  measures the retardation of the setting moon during the day of opposition . the correction of  and  by one third of this quantity therefore takes into account the retardation of the moon after 1 saros . the cuneiform tablet tu 11 , which contains astrological as well as astronomical sections ( at the time the two were not distinguished ) , nicely comfirms the goal - year method . in section 16 of tu 11 we find parts of the equations above spelled out in words.@xcite this proves that the babylonians had , indeed , found and used the above relations for the prediction of lunar four time intervals . what is impressing with the goal - year method is that it is easy , elegant and surprisingly precise . in we illustrate the accuracy of the method by comparing calculated values of ( @xmath1 ) with those predicted according to the right - hand side of the first equation above .", "to unravel the origin of beats , one can apply the technique of fourier analysis : by fourier transforming the ocillating data with respect to a suitable variable ( e.g.  energy or wave number ) , one obtains a spectrum ( e.g.  of periods or orbit lenghts ) of the interfering sources . as mentioned in the introduction , this tool is employed also in the study of quantum chaos in order to establish the semiclassical correspondence of quantum mechanics and classical mechanics . we first give two examples of such analyses from atomic and cluster physics and then apply the fourier analysis to the babylonian lunar observables . ( further examples relevant for nuclear physics are given by arita in this volume.@xcite )      when hydrogen atoms are put into strong magnetic fields , their electronic motion becomes classically chaotic . a  by now famous  semiclassical analysis of photoionization energy spectra of hydrogen in magnetic fields by holle _ et al._,@xcite using an extension of the periodic orbit theory of gutzwiller,@xcite established the one - to - one correspondence of strong fourier peaks with closed classical orbits of the electron , as shown in . ( see ref.@xcite for the scaling variable @xmath30 which depends on both energy and magnetic field strength . ) a textbook example@xcite of a classically integrable system without chaos is shown in , where we display the coarse - grained level density of a three - dimensional spherical quantum billiard as a function of the wave number @xmath31 , gaussian - averaged over a range @xmath32 in order to emphasize the gross - shell structure . its fourier transform exhibits the length spectrum of the shortest classical periodic orbits contributing at this level of resolution , whose shapes are polygons with @xmath33 corners ( the number @xmath33 is given near the fourier peaks in the figure ) . we see that the quantum beats in @xmath34 are mainly due to the triangles and squares ( and , with less weight , pentagons etc . ; see ref.@xcite for details ) . although this appears to be a rather naive toy model , it is realistic enough to describe the supershell structure    that has been observed in the abundance spectra of metal clusters.@xcite      the three - body system sun - earth - moon is not integrable , but it is  luckily  not chaotic . we refer to a recent review by gutzwiller@xcite for an account of the various levels of sophistication at which it has been treated over the last two millenia , and for the basic periods of the sun and the moon ( as observed from the earth ) which govern its observables . as we have already mentioned in sect . [ baby ] , the babylonians were able to extract the period @xmath8 of the lunar velocity by a suitable combination of observations on the western and eastern horizon . in the following we shall illustrate their hypothetical procedure with the help of fourier transforms .    in we show on the upper left side two characteristic observables recorded by the babylonians ,  and , plotted versus the lunation number @xmath1 counting the successive oppositions of sun and moon . on the right side we present their fourier transforms with respect to @xmath1 , which yield the spectra of periods @xmath35 responsible for the oscillations and beats in these observables . all of the `` lunar four '' , ,  and  defined in sect . [ lunfour ] appear as rather erratic functions of @xmath1 yielding similar , relatively noisy fourier spectra ( we show here only the quantity  at the top . ) the spectra are dominated by the periods of the moon , @xmath36 months , and of the sun , @xmath37 months = 1 year , but a large number of smaller peaks demonstrate the complexity of the system . next from above we show the sum of the two quantities observed on the western horizon , . this quantity  and similarly the sum  observed on the eastern horizon  is a much smoother and more regular function of @xmath1 . as its fourier spectrum reveals , it is mainly a beat due to the two periods @xmath38 and @xmath8 . the two small components with @xmath39 months are responsible for the fine structure in ( ) ( @xmath1 ) and do not affect the mean spacing of the `` shells '' nor the period of the beating amplitude . the function ( ) ( @xmath1 ) has an almost identical fourier spectrum , but its oscillations as functions of @xmath1 are phase shifted with respect to those in ( ) ( @xmath1 ) . this behaviour is explained if one writes ( ) ( @xmath1 ) and ( ) ( @xmath1 ) as a sum and a difference , respectively , of two periodic functions : @xmath40 whereby @xmath41 does not depend on @xmath38 and @xmath42 does not depend on @xmath8 ( see ref.@xcite for the astronomical justification of this statement ) . hence , by constructing the sum @xmath0 = ( ) + ( ) one can eliminate the component with the period @xmath38 of the sun and obtain a curve that is dominated by the lunar period @xmath8 . alternatively , the difference @xmath43 = ( ) @xmath19 ( ) yields a curve dominated by the solar period @xmath38 . ( there is no evidence , however , that the babylonians were interested in @xmath43 . ) these facts are clearly revealed by the fourier spectra of @xmath17 and @xmath44 shown in the lower half of . since for both sums  and  the fourier peak corresponding to the solar period @xmath38 is much stronger than that belonging to the lunar period @xmath8 , both these functions oscillate mainly with the period of the sun . it is only the function @xmath17 that can be fitted by the zig - zag function @xmath18 with the period of the moon , as demonstrated in .", "this paper has been stimulated by the close similarity between beating oscillations appearing in the shell structure of nuclei and other many - fermion systems , and in the computer - simulated lunar observables from babylonian times . we have focused on the method of fourier analysis for extracting the dominating periods behind beating oscillations . for the quantum oscillations in fermionic systems this method is successfully employed in their semiclassical interpretation in terms of classical closed or periodic orbits through trace formulae , for which we have presented some examples . we have given a short introduction into observation and theory of lunar phenomena from ancient mesopotamia . we have then shown how the use of modern computer simulations of the lunar and solar ephemerides at ancient times allowed for a partial reconstruction of the methods by which the babylonians have arrived at their numerical lunar theory and their empirical schemes for prediciting lunar phases . there is no evidence at all that they had any theoretical understanding of the dynamics of the planetary system , nor any geometrical model for it . however , they were excellent numerical calculators and based their schemes on the collection and analysis of observational data over hundreds of years .    for a physicist it is a rather breath - taking experience to see old `` experimental '' data , recorded over 2500 years ago , reproduced by calculations requiring the best present numerical knowledge of our planetary system of course , the computer code of moshier makes use of some old astronomical data , without which the extrapolation of presently valid lunar ephemerides back to ancient times would not be possible . e.g. , there are long - term variations in the earth s rotational velocity which result in a clock error @xmath43 t . for the time around 300 b.c . , @xmath43 t could be determined from a solar eclipse recorded on the tablet lbat 1285.@xcite however , the lunar data reproduced in and on many other tablets have not been used as an input . therefore the agreement seen in this figure , as well as in , gives us confidence into the accuracy of moshier s code . at the same time it confirms the consistency of our present understanding of the empirical origins of the babylonian lunar theory .    with the help of fourier analysis we have illustrated the way by which the babylonians could have determined the period p@xmath11 of the lunar velocity , contained in the column @xmath9 of their lunar tables , from the sum @xmath0 of all lunar four . if this hypothesis is correct , then they have  without knowing it  performed a fourier decomposition of their observed data .    in any case  the mere fact that the babylonians some 2400 years ago were able to determine the length of the synodic month with an accuracy of six digits must be considered as one of the greatest scientific achievements of history . m. c. gutzwiller : _ chaos in classical and quantum mechanics _ ( springer , new york , 1990 ) . + _ quantum chaos y2k _ , proceedings of nobel symposium 116 , eds . berggren and s. berg , physica scripta vol . * t90 * ( 2001 ) . o. neugebauer : _ astronomical cuneiform texts _ , vols . i -

{"id": "1202.2969", "section_names": ["introduction", "the temperature asymmetry in the m31 halo by the 7-year wmap data", "discussion", "concluding remarks", "references"], "document": ["we have entered in a new era of high precision cosmology and it is clear by primordial nucleosynthesis constraints and by the results from the power spectrum of the cmb produced by the 7-years data of wmap satellite that our universe is composed of @xmath1 of dark energy ( de ) , @xmath2 of non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) and for only @xmath3 by baryons . about baryons , we know that about @xmath4 of them are in stars ( i.e. in the visible part of galaxies ) ; the hot gas in galaxies and galaxy clusters accounts for another @xmath5 of baryons ; but about @xmath6 of all baryons are missing and is not known where and in which form they are hidden . a possibility is that these baryons are contained in the so - called cosmic filaments in the form of a warm - hot intergalactic medium ( see e.g. @xcite ) . however , it is unlikely that all the missing baryons are confined in the cosmic filaments and , actually , there are many reasons to believe that a non - negligible amount of these hidden baryons are in galactic halos ( see below in this section ) or even in the galactic disk ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . a rather clear piece of evidence for the existence of large amounts of gas around galaxies is the widespread detection of absorption lines in front of quasars , the so - called ly-@xmath7 forest , that show hundreds of absorption systems along a single line of sight . also damped ly-@xmath7 systems with hydrogen columns density larger than about @xmath8 @xmath9 are associated with galaxies and both systems imply that galaxies at high redshift ( @xmath10 ) would have huge gas halos around them . where is all that gas now ? one possibility is that it has been expelled from galaxies during the first chaotic phase of star formation into the cosmic filaments . however , that might have happened only in part , leaving nowadays some of that gas around galactic disks . there is further evidence that there is some amount of gas in galactic halos , and in particular in that of our galaxy : the problem is to measure how much it is . that is , obviously , not so easy . let us briefly discuss some of this evidence . galaxies seem to evolve along the hubble sequence from sc type , characterized by small bulges and open spiral arms to sa , characterized by larger bulges and tighter spirals . during this evolution the @xmath11 ratio , which is a measure of the amount of dark matter , decreases ( while the number of stars increases ) implying that part of the dark matter should transform into stars and that means that part of the dark matter should consist of baryons in gaseous form . moreover , star - forming disk galaxies similar to our milky way , should exhaust their cold gas reservoir ( necessary to make stars ) within a few gyrs unless it is replenished in some way @xcite . numerical simulations ( see e.g. @xcite ) indeed show that galaxies like the milky way convert about @xmath12 yr@xmath13 of gas into stars while their gas content remains approximately unchanged . the reservoir of the accretion material is as yet unidentified but it goes without saying that it should come from the region that surrounds the galactic disks and might even reside in the intergalactic medium ( see @xcite for a discussion about the cooling mechanisms of the hot intergalactic gas ) . in any case , a gas accretion rate of about @xmath12 yr@xmath13 for m31/milky way galaxies onto their galactic disks is compulsory ( see also @xcite ) . the wealth of data in the last two decades show that there is good evidence for extra - planar gas around the milky way and other galaxies and it is detected in all gaseous phases : neutral , warm atomic , molecular and hot x - ray emitting gas . since about a decade we know that around the milky way and andromeda ( m31 ) galaxies there is a population of high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) that extends up to @xmath14 kpc and are not seen beyond about @xmath15 kpc @xcite . there are also intermediate - velocity clouds ( ivcs ) with a vertical scale height of @xmath16 kpc and a total mass about @xmath17 , forming a population separated with respect to that of the hvcs . the innermost halo clouds show a metallicity that is about half of the solar one and this favors the galactic fountain model for its origin in which hot gas is ejected out of the galactic disk , cools down and falls back onto the disk ( see e.g. @xcite ) . as far as hvcs are concerned , since generally only the radial velocity can be estimated for these objects and distance information are sparse and not well known , a closed theory about their origin is not available today . one possibility is that they represent metal poor gas from the intergalactic space falling onto the galactic disk @xcite , the other is that they represent the remnant of the galactic halo formation .    also around the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) deep radio synthesis observations has shown the presence of gas clouds within about 50 kpc . these clouds , which are the analogue of the hvcs , have size of about 1 kpc and mass @xmath18 @xcite . the total mass in hvcs is about @xmath19 @xcite . it also seems that a dilute gas halo at a temperature @xmath20 k is present around some spiral galaxies . elliptical galaxies ( and particularly bright ellipticals ) , as is well known , do contain large amount of hot diffuse gas emitting in x - rays ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . for spirals , evidence is much less convincing . a difficulty in this respect is that the emission measure scales with the square of the electron density and once the galaxy surface brightness drops to the level of the x - ray background ( mainly due to the milky way ) further detection is impossible . that is the reason why the size of the x - ray emitting gas around spiral galaxies is very poorly constrained . interestingly enough , very recently a hot gaseous halo has been detected by xmm - newton satellite towards ugc12591 , the fastest rotating spiral galaxy @xcite , up to a distance of about 110 kpc from the galaxy center . combining the x - ray data with near - ir and radio measurements it has been found that the baryon mass fraction in this galaxy is about @xmath21 ( in particular the baryon mass within about 500 kpc is @xmath22 while the total mass , estimated using the galaxy rotation curve , is found to be @xmath23 ) . this would imply that the majority of the missing baryons in spiral galaxies does not reside in their hot gas halos . indeed , after the detection of the first microlensing events towards the lmc @xcite ) of the halo dark matter may be made by machos ( see e.g. @xcite ) although this result as well as the estimation of the average macho mass implied by observations depends on the specific adopted halo model ( see e.g. @xcite ) . pixel - lensing observations towards the m31 galaxy have been conducted by several collaborations leading to the discovery of more than 35 events @xcite up to now ( one of which even showed the presence of an exoplanet in andromeda galaxy @xcite ) give uncertain conclusions about the fraction of the halo dark matter in the form of machos , ranging from about @xmath24 for @xmath25 machos to the possibility of explaining the detected events simply by self - lensing ( see e.g. @xcite ) . ] a model was proposed for the formation of machos ( massive astrophysical compact halo objects ) in the galactic halo @xcite . actually , this model naturally emerges from the present - day understanding of the globular cluster formation . indeed , the fall - rees theory for the formation of globular clusters @xcite predicts , without any further assumption , that dark clusters made of brown dwarfs and cold gas clouds should lurk in the galactic halo at galactocentric distances larger that @xmath26 kpc . accordingly , the inner halo is populated mainly by globular clusters , whereas the outer galactic halo should be dominated by dark clusters populated by machos and cold gas clouds . the gas clouds in the dark clusters should be very cold , with a temperature very close to that of the cmb , should have sub - solar mass and size about that of the solar system ( for details see @xcite ) .    a novel way of investigating the amount and distribution of the dark baryons in the galactic halos , and in particular in that around the m31 galaxy is discussed in the next section . this method deals with the use of cmb data ( at present the 7-year wmap data ) to trace galactic disks and halos .", "galactic disks are well studied objects in all wavelengths and give important information on the mass distribution within and around galaxies @xcite . on the other hand , galactic halos are relatively less studied structures and there are still many ambiguities not only in the main halo constituents , but also in the basic properties such as , in particular , the rotation . the degree to which galactic halos rotates with respect to the disks is a relevant and difficult issue to be investigated . the rotation of the galactic halos , indeed , is clearly related to the formation scenario of galaxies . in the standard collapse model ( see e.g. @xcite ) both the halo and disk of galaxies derive from the same population . the rotation of the outer halo should be , in this case , aligned with the disk angular momentum . on the contrary , in a hierarchical formation scenario , structures arriving later in the outer halo should have a minor connection to the disk . therefore , it is evident that information on the galactic halo rotation provide key insights about the formation history of galaxies . nevertheless , it is important to stress that testing for the rotation even of the closest galaxy ( m31 ) halo is still beyond our reach @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    the first attempt of using the 7-year wmap data @xcite in the three bands w ( 94 ghz ) , v ( 61 ghz ) , and q ( 41 ghz ) to map in microwaves both the disk and halo of the m31 galaxy is provided in @xcite . to reveal the different contributions by the m31 disk and halo , the region of the sky towards the m31 galaxy has been divided into several concentric circular areas as shown in fig . 1 in @xcite . the m31 disk does contain gas observed mainly at 21 cm wavelength ( but also in the ir ) up to a distance of about 40 kpc from the galactic center . it is also well known that the m31 disk rotate with a speed of about 250 km s@xmath13 and this has been clearly shown also by the velocity maps provided in @xcite . in @xcite a temperature asymmetry along the direction of the m31 rotation has been observed for the first time also in microwaves with a maximum of @xmath27k / pixel at about 20 kpc from the m31 center . this temperature asymmetry is very likely induced by the doppler shift effect due to the m31 disk rotation speed . the robustness of this result has been tested by considering 500 randomly distributed control fields in the three wmap bands and also by simulating 500 sky maps from the best fit cosmological parameters . both procedures give comparable results and imply that there is less than @xmath28 probability that the signal is due to a random fluctuation of the cmb signal . an analogous study has been also conducted in the same paper towards the m31 halo within @xmath29 ( about 240 kpc from the m31 center ) . we found also towards the m31 halo a cmb temperature asymmetry up to about 120 kpc with a peak temperature contrast of about @xmath30k / pixel . although the confidence level of the signal , if estimated purely statistically ( i.e. with 500 control fields and 500 simulated sky maps ) , is not high ( we find , indeed , that there is a probability of less than about @xmath31 that the detected temperature asymmetry in the m31 halo is due to a random fluctuation of the cmb signal ) , that the detected temperature asymmetry in the m31 halo is due to a random fluctuation of the cmb signal . ] the geometrical structure of the temperature asymmetry in the three bands point towards a real effect modulated by the rotation of the m31 halo . we point out once more that the use of three wmap bands is important for revealing the role of the contribution of the galactic foregrounds since each emission mechanism contributes differently in each band . the fact that the temperature contrast seems present in all three bands and is more or less the same in each band up to about @xmath32 ( about 120 kpc from the m31 center ) indicates that the foregrounds are far weaker than the effect . a size of about 120 kpc corresponds to the typical size inferred for the dark matter halos around massive galaxies and might open the possibility of a new way of studying these systems , both galactic disks and halos , at microwave wavelengths . in any case , a careful analysis of the planck data that should be released shortly should allow either to prove or disprove our main results .", "as clear from the discussion above , the detected temperature asymmetry for the m31 disk is fairly clear in all wmap bands , and is also expected due to the foreground emission of the m31 disk modulated by the doppler shift induced by the disk rotation . incidentally , the m31 galaxy has been recently detected by the planck observatory @xcite , whereas it did not appear in the wmap list . these are all reasons to expect that the particular effect we discuss here can be studied more accurately with planck data .    as for the m31 halo , we have shown that , although less evident than for the m31 disk , there is less than about @xmath24 probability that the detected temperature asymmetry at a galactocentric distance @xmath33 kpc comes from a random fluctuation of the cmb signal . if one assumes that this temperature asymmetry in the m31 halo relies in the m31 itself and is related to the m31 halo rotation , a natural question that arises is about the origin of this effect . in all generality , four possibilities may be considered : ( @xmath34 ) free - free emission ; ( @xmath35 ) synchrotron emission ; ( @xmath36 ) sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect ; and ( @xmath37 ) cold gas clouds populating the m31 halo . the first three effects assume the presence of a rather hot plasma in the halo of m31 . although this hot plasma has not been detected yet , one can assume that a certain amount of this plasma can populate the m31 halo ( spiral galaxies are believed to have much less hot gas than ellipticals ) and may rotate with a certain speed . free - free emission arises from electron - ion scattering while synchrotron emission comes mostly from the acceleration of cosmic - ray electrons in magnetic fields . both effects give rise to a thermal emission with a rather steep dependence on the frequency @xcite that therefore should give a rather different temperature contrast in the three wmap bands . the absence of this effect indicates that the contribution from possibilities ( @xmath34 ) and ( @xmath35 ) should be negligible . in the case of ( @xmath36 ) , even for typical galaxy clusters with diffuse gas much hotter than that possibly expected in the m31 halo , the rotational effect produces a temperature asymmetry of at most a few @xmath38k pixel@xmath13 , depending on the rotational velocity and the inclination angle of the rotation axis @xcite , that is much less than that observed towards the m31 halo . actually , a possible temperature asymmetry in the cmb data towards the m31 halo as a consequence of the existence of a population of cold gas clouds in its halo was predicted in @xcite - possibility ( @xmath37 ) . indeed , if the halo of the m31 galaxy would contain gas clouds , one expects them to rotate along the disk rotation ( even if , perhaps , more slowly ) , and thus there should be a doppler shift inducing a temperature anisotropy @xmath39 between one side of the m31 halo and the other with respect to the rotation axis perpendicular to the disk . in the case of optically thin halo clouds the doppler induced temperature asymmetry would be @xmath40 , where @xmath41 k is the cmb temperature , @xmath42 is the m31 averaged rotation speed , @xmath43 the averaged cloud optical depth over the frequency range ( @xmath44 ) of a certain detection band , and @xmath45 the cloud filling factor , i.e. the ratio of filled ( by clouds ) to total projected sky surface in a given field of view . in the case of optically thick gas clouds instead one has @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the cloud temperature . in @xcite we concentrated mainly on the optically thick option and , as a suggested test for the proposed model ( see also @xcite ) , made a rough estimate . by the way , this value for s is not far from that coming from recent observations of hvcs in m31 presented in fig . 1 in @xcite . indeed it turns out that s can be parameterized as @xmath48 $ ] , so that @xmath49 at about 40 kpc from the m31 center . we emphasize , however , that this limit has to be considered as a lower limit to the true value of s since it only comes from considering the observed hvcs in the m31 halo . ] of the expected temperature asymmetry between the two opposite sides of the m31 halo as @xmath50 that implies a temperature asymmetry about @xmath51k for @xmath52 , that is very close to the value recently found in @xcite .    before closing this section we would like to mention that one of the most serious problems associated with the presence of cold gas clouds in galactic halos is that of explaining their mere dynamical stability . as a matter of fact , isothermal perfect gas clouds without fixed boundaries are unstable with respect to the gravothermal catastrophe on time scales of a few crossing times . generally speaking , the outcome of the gravitational collapse of a gas cloud is the formation of a dense central core ( see e.g. @xcite ) . at the beginning , the evolution is almost isothermal ( due to the low optical depth of the gas cloud ) but , when opacity exceeds unity , the central temperature and pressure rapidly increase , leading to star formation . however , halo cold gas clouds may mostly succeed in avoiding collapse since in low temperature and low opacity conditions , collapse may lead to the formation of solid / liquid @xmath53 ( below about 14 k ) and to the formation of a temperature inverted gas cloud with a condensed cold core . this new physical ingredient provides the possibility of stabilizing these cold gas clouds . such loosely bound cold clouds could form a gas reservoir in galaxy halos and behaves as a collisionless ensemble of matter . incidentally , these cold cores might also evaporate due to ambient heating , but they can leave for gyrs in the clod and low excitation environment such as those expected in galactic halos ( for further details see also @xcite ) . interestingly enough , cosmic rays and energetic photons ( for example those in the uv band of the electromagnetic spectrum ) might cause ionization in the solid molecular hydrogen leading to the formation of @xmath54 and @xmath55 . very recently , it has been shown @xcite that the so - called unidentified infrared ( uir ) bands , usually thought to be related to large molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , may instead be produced by @xmath55 and @xmath54 in solid form , thus showing that solid @xmath53 may indeed be abundant in quiet astrophysical environments and opening a new way of searching for cold gas clouds .", "as mentioned earlier , it is likely that there are no grounds to assume that a unique solution may solve the hidden baryon problem . it is instead plausible that it is a composite problem reflecting the diversity of astrophysical conditions . for example , globular clusters are mostly composed of baryons and no evidence for non - baryonic mass is present in these objects . thus , baryons are well separated from non - baryonic dark matter in the formation process of these structures . on the galaxy cluster scale most baryons are in the form of a hot x - ray emitting gas while in the inter - galactic medium most baryons might be in the form of a warm - hot gas . the wealth of data especially in the last decade shows that there is good evidence for the presence in the halos of spiral galaxies of gas in all gaseous phases : neutral , warm atomic , and hot x - ray emitting gas @xcite . atomic gas ( often identified as hvcs ) is observed in the radio band ( particularly at 21 cm ) and through absorption lines towards field stars and quasars . the hot gas may be detected in x - rays but , unfortunately , searches for cold gas clouds in galactic halos are more problematic . various attempts have been undertaken to detect such clouds as searching for the presence of a gamma - ray halo @xcite , stellar scintillations @xcite , obscuration events towards the lmc @xcite , ortho-@xmath56 line at 372 ghz @xcite , and extreme scattering events in quasar radio - flux variations @xcite . all these searches have given no clear indication of cold gas cloud presence in galactic halos , but these searches are going on using more and more sensitive facilities and new developments , such as searching for the vibrational transition lines produced by @xmath55 and @xmath54 in solid form . therefore , the issue of a realistic estimate of the amount of baryonic mass in galactic halos and their size does remain open and a new perspective in this research can be given by investigating it in microwaves following @xcite .", "9 corbelli e 2003 month . not . r. astron . soc . * 342 * 199 hoekstra h _ et al _ 2005 astrophys . j. * 635 * 73 bregman j n 2007 ann . . astrophys . * 45 * 221 cen r

( [ eqn : laser_ham ] ) we can replace @xmath27 $ ] , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the pauli spin matrices . since @xmath3 ( see fig . [ fig : lattice ] ) we can rewrite the van - der - waals potential between two ( super)atoms in the state @xmath30 located @xmath31 sites apart as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the separation between those sites . as already pointed out , @xmath34 is quickly decaying with the distance . in particular , the next - nearest neighbor interaction is a factor of @xmath35 smaller than the nearest neighbor one ( @xmath36 ) . we will thus only focus on the nearest neighbor interaction which is well - justified for large enough lattices . the interaction hamiltonian for the entire atomic ensemble , with @xmath37 , then reads @xmath38 with the rydberg number operator @xmath39/2 $ ] and the boundary condition @xmath40 .    in summary , the complete hamiltonian that drives the dynamics of our system can be written as @xmath41.\\ ] ] the system can be described as a periodic arrangement of spin-@xmath42 particles , where the two spin states , corresponding to the two internal states of the ( super)atoms , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , interact via an ising - type potential . in this picture , the rabi frequency @xmath19 and the combination of @xmath43 can be effectively interpreted as perpendicular magnetic fields . hence , the relevant parameters in our system will be : a ) the ones related to the laser , i.e. , the single - atom rabi frequency @xmath7 and detuning @xmath8 , which can be time - dependent and b ) the interaction between rydberg atoms represented by @xmath44 .      throughout this paper , we consider the regime where the detuning is much smaller than both the collective rabi frequency ( laser driving ) and the interaction strength , i.e. , @xmath45 . as a consequence , the behavior of the system will be determined by the ratio of the latter two parameters . here we focus on the limit @xmath46 , i.e. , the laser coupling is much stronger than the interaction between atoms . in this regime the first term of the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : working_hamiltonian ] ) is the dominant one and it is convenient to make it diagonal by means of a rotation of the basis . this is achieved by the unitary transformation @xmath47 which brings @xmath48 and @xmath49 . when applied to our hamiltonian ( [ eqn : working_hamiltonian ] ) , it yields @xmath50 with @xmath51\\label{eqn : h_xy}\\\\ h_1&=&\\frac{\\delta}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^l\\left(1-\\sigma_{x}^{(k)}\\right)\\label{eqn : h_1}\\\\ h_2&=&\\frac{\\beta}{4}\\sum_{k=1}^l \\left[\\left(\\sigma_{+}^{(k)}\\sigma_{+}^{(k+1)}+\\sigma_{-}^{(k)}\\sigma_{-}^{(k+1)}\\right)-2\\sigma_x^{(k)}\\right]\\label{eqn : h_2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the famous @xmath53-model of a spin chain with a transverse magnetic field . let us now analyze the importance of the individual contributions of @xmath54 . as we can see in fig . [ fig : spectrum ] , the spectrum of @xmath54 decays into manifolds of states which are separated by gaps whose width is approximately @xmath55 . this is caused by the dominant first term of @xmath52 , i.e. , @xmath56 . the eigenstates of @xmath57 are - in terms of the ( super)atom states - given by @xmath58\\ ] ] with @xmath59 . thus , each of the manifolds that determine the coarse structure of the spectrum is spanned by a set of product states that have the same number of ( super)atoms in the state @xmath60 . in fig . [ fig : spectrum ] , these manifolds are denoted by @xmath61 , which is the eigenvalue of the states with respect to the operator @xmath62 . the second term of @xmath52 conserves the total number of @xmath60 ( super)atoms . in other words , it couples only states that belong to the same @xmath61-manifold and that are nearly degenerate . as a consequence , the strength of these intra - manifold couplings due to @xmath63 is proportional to @xmath44 . conversely , @xmath64 and @xmath65 couple states that belong to manifolds with different number of ( super)atoms in the state @xmath60 . in particular , @xmath64 and the last term of @xmath65 flip one of the ( super)atoms from @xmath60 to @xmath66 or viceversa . thus , the coupled states belong to different manifolds with @xmath67 , energetically separated by @xmath55 . the two first terms of @xmath65 drive a similar process , flipping always two contiguous ( super)atoms in the same state simultaneously , i.e. , @xmath68 or @xmath69 . as a result , these terms connect states with eigenvalue @xmath61 to those with @xmath70 , which are separated roughly by @xmath71 . these features are reflected in fig . [ fig : spectrum ] .     and @xmath72 . the spectrum splits into manifolds which can be labeled by the quantum number @xmath61 of the operator @xmath73 . for sufficiently large @xmath19 , the coupling between manifolds that is established only by @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be neglected . the ( constrained ) dynamics inside the @xmath61-subspaces is then determined by @xmath52.,width=188 ]    the transition rates between @xmath61-manifolds corresponding to @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be estimated by second order perturbation theory to be of the order @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively . hence , for sufficiently strong driving @xmath46 , their contribution can be neglected and the system s dynamics is constrained to the @xmath61-manifolds . as a consequence , the hamiltonian that drives the intra - manifold dynamics , @xmath52 , _ effectively drives the dynamics of the entire system in this parameter regime_. this hamiltonian is analytically solvable , and we thus have access to the actual spectrum and eigenstates of the system . the diagonalization of this hamiltonian relies on the so - called jordan - wigner transformation and a fourier transform that we explain thoroughly in the following paragraph @xcite . the pauli matrices in the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : h_xy ] ) obey anti - commutation and commutation relations when they belong to the same and different sites , respectively . thus , the algebra is neither bosonic nor fermionic . this difficulty can be overcome by the jordan - wigner transformation , @xmath76 which introduces the operators @xmath77 and @xmath78 that obey the canonical fermionic algebra @xmath79 after this transformation , the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : h_xy ] ) takes on the form @xmath80\\\\ & -&\\frac{\\beta}{4}\\left(c_l^\\dagger c_1+c_1^\\dagger c_l\\right)\\left(e^{i\\pi n_+}+1\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the hamiltonian has been transformed into one which describes a chain of spinless fermions with nearest neighbor hopping . the last term of hamiltonian ( [ eqn : h_jw ] ) appears due to the periodic boundary conditions . it depends on the operator @xmath81 which counts the total number of fermions , which is also equivalent to the number of ( super)atoms in the state @xmath60 . thus , depending on the parity of the number of fermions of the state , @xmath52 reads @xmath82 for even ( e ) or odd ( o ) parity , respectively . these two cases can be accounted for simultaneously in a convenient way by introducing a matrix representation for the fermionic operators . they are projected onto the subspaces with even and odd eigenvalue of @xmath83 by means of the projectors @xmath84/2 $ ] , with @xmath85 . since the hamiltonian @xmath52 conserves the number of fermions , i.e. , @xmath86=0 $ ] , it is diagonal in this representation and can be decomposed as @xmath87 we now introduce new matrix - valued creation and annihilation operators of the form @xmath88 which obey the fermionic algebra provided @xmath78 and @xmath89 are fermionic operators . the hamiltonian can now be conveniently written as @xmath90 with @xmath91    the diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : h_matrix_gamma ] ) is achieved by performing the following fourier transform @xmath92 with the fourier coefficients @xmath93 the operators @xmath94 and @xmath95 are matrix -

valued fermionic operators has the advantage that excited states can be constructed by applying products of @xmath94 to the ground state . as a consequence , this matrix notation allows us to automatically distinguish between the odd and even fermion cases , which otherwise has to be done manually .", "the symmetry properties of our system impose certain selection rules for the excitation of the many - particle states . in order to understand this , let us start our analysis of the excited states by studying the symmetries of the hamiltonian . because of the special arrangement of the sites , the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : working_hamiltonian ] ) and also ( [ eqn : h_matrix_lambda ] ) are invariant under cyclic shifts and reversal of the lattice sites . this can be formally seen by representing these two symmetries through the operators @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively . their action on the spin ladder operators are @xmath104 and @xmath105 , from where follows that @xmath106=\\left[h_\\mathrm{spin},{\\cal r}\\right]=0 $ ] , i.e. , both of them correspond to conserved quantities . thus , if the system is initialized in an eigenstate with respect to @xmath107 and @xmath108 , the time evolution will not take place in the entire hilbert space , but merely in the subspace spanned by the states with the same quantum number with respect to @xmath102 and @xmath103 . this observation is highly relevant for our system . in practise , the natural initial situation will be that in which all atoms are in the ground state , i.e. , @xmath109 . this state has the above - mentioned properties , i.e. , it is invariant under cyclic shifts and the reversal of the sites : @xmath110 and @xmath111 . we will refer to such a state that has eigenvalue @xmath112 with respect to @xmath107 and @xmath108 as being fully - symmetric . hence , only the states from this fully - symmetric subspace can be actually accessed in the course of the system s time evolution under hamiltonian ( [ eqn : working_hamiltonian ] ) . in the following we will thus focus on constructing excited states that belong to this subset . the ground state of hamiltonian ( [ eqn : h_matrix_lambda ] ) is given by @xmath113 and it is fully - symmetric . excited states that contain @xmath114 fermions are in general formed by successive application of the creation operator , i.e. , @xmath115 . however , not all combinations will give rise to states that belong to the fully - symmetric subset . let us start considering the possible cases of a single - fermion excitation . for a fully - symmetric state we require @xmath116 , i.e. , @xmath117 with @xmath118 being a placeholder for @xmath102 and @xmath103 . after some algebra one finds that @xmath119 since @xmath120 and @xmath121 , only the single excitation with @xmath122 is symmetric under cyclic shifts and reversal . hence , the only one - fermion state that can be reached by the time - evolution reads @xmath123 to have a better physical understanding of this state , it is convenient to write it in terms of the atomic operators , @xmath124 thus , @xmath125 is a spin wave or , in other words , a superatom that extends over the entire lattice . these states are of interest since they can be used as a resource for single photon generation . for the two -

symmetric states are @xmath129 with @xmath130 . these are entangled states formed by superpositions of two - atom excitations in the ring with opposite momentum . this is more clearly seen by writing everything in terms of the pauli matrices @xmath131 these states are potentially interesting for the production of photon pairs . how they can be actually accessed will be discussed in sec .

[ fig : spectrum_real ] . once a desired many - particle state has been populated , and due to the limited lifetime of the highly excited levels which is in the order of several @xmath200 ( e.g. , 66 @xmath200 for rb in the 60s state ) , we want to map it to an stable configuration . to do so , we first turn off the laser ( @xmath201 ) and then switch on a second one whose action can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath202 in this expression , @xmath203 and @xmath204 stand for the creation and annihilation operators of an single - atom stable storage state @xmath205 on site @xmath2 , respectively . in the limit where the interaction is much smaller than the rabi frequency of this transition , i.e. , @xmath206 , we can neglect the second term of this hamiltonian . thus , performing a global @xmath207-pulse to the considered many - particle state means to perform the mapping @xmath208 , such that a stable configuration is achieved . hence , the difficulty lies in finding a trajectory or sequence @xmath209 for which at @xmath197 only a single many - particle state is occupied . we propose two different methods in the following .      in certain cases , one can guess a trajectory @xmath210 like the ones shown in fig . [ fig : address ] that eventually connects @xmath211 with a desired eigenstate of @xmath52 @xcite , but this is not always possible . the general appearance of the laser sequence strongly depends on the sign of the initial detuning @xmath212 . in fig . [ fig : address ] the two possible scenarios ( taking @xmath213 ) are depicted . for @xmath214 , the initial state is not the ground state of the system when the laser is turned off ( @xmath201 ) . as a consequence , this initial state suffers several avoided crossings with other levels when @xmath19 is increased . thus , it is not easy to find a path through the spectrum that connects it to a single desired eigenstate of @xmath52 , as the one shown in fig . [ fig : address]a . a more general framework for finding a proper trajectory is provided by optimal control theory @xcite . here , the desired fidelity with which the final state is achieved can be set and certain constraints on the trajectory can be imposed . this method is successfully applied to quantum information processing @xcite , molecular state preparation @xcite and optimization of number squeezing of an atomic gas confined to a double well potential @xcite . the case of @xmath215 will be treated in the next subsection .    ) through the spectrum of @xmath54 with @xmath216 ( units of @xmath44 ) . * a * : when @xmath214 , the ground state at @xmath201 does not coincide with the initial state , @xmath211 , and the energy of the initial state goes through a number of avoided crossings . a possible path through them to reach the state @xmath217 is shown . * b * : if @xmath215 , the initial state @xmath211 is adiabatically connected to the ground state @xmath157.,width=340 ]      we present in this work a different route to populate single many - particle states . this is accomplished in two steps : first , one has to prepare the ground state @xmath157 of hamiltonian ( [ eqn : h_xy ] ) in the limit @xmath46 ; once the ground state is populated , the single - fermion and two - fermion many - particle states can be accessed by means of an oscillating detuning , that gives rise to a time - dependent @xmath64 .    _ step 1 : _ let us start by explaining how to vary the laser parameters to prepare the ground state @xmath157 . in particular , when setting @xmath215 , the ground state of the system at @xmath201 coincides with the initial state @xmath211 . with increasing @xmath19 , it is adiabatically connected to the ground state @xmath157 of @xmath63 ( see fig . [ fig : address]b ) . the problem that we can encounter here is that non - adiabatic transitions to other energy levels occur when increasing @xmath19 , so that we do not populate only @xmath157 but also other states . to avoid this , we choose a large enough value of @xmath212 when the laser is still turned off ( @xmath201 ) . this increases the energy gap between @xmath211 and other energy levels , and , as a consequence , suppresses non - adiabatic transitions . this initial detuning can be decreased as @xmath19 increases so that in the desired regime , i.e. , @xmath218 , it is set to zero . as an example , we propose the following shapes of @xmath219 and @xmath196 @xmath220\\label{eqn : detuning}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the obtained fidelity @xmath221 for different values of the initial detuning @xmath212 and time intervals @xmath222 is given in fig . [ fig:0togs ] , where @xmath223 stands for the wavefunction of the final state . it is actually possible to populate the desired state with high fidelity , e.g. , over @xmath224 is achieved for all considered lattice sizes with @xmath225 and @xmath226 . we find that : i ) the fidelity depends only weakly on the lattice size although the dimension of the hilbert space grows exponentially with @xmath177 , and ii ) as expected , for a fixed value of the initial detuning , the fidelity increases with the increasing length of the time interval . note that the timescale of this whole process is limited by the lifetime of the rydberg state .     when populating the ground state of @xmath52 from the initial state via variation of the parameters of the laser @xmath219 and @xmath196 in the form given by ( @xmath227 ) and ( [ eqn : detuning ] ) , respectively . several initial values of the detuning and time intervals , as well as different lattice sizes , are considered . for a fixed value of @xmath212 ( units of @xmath44 ) , better fidelities are obtained for larger time intervals ( units of @xmath228 ) . for a fixed time interval , there is an optimal value of @xmath212 for each size of the lattice , around @xmath229.,width=340 ]    if there is only one atom per site , and based on the fact that @xmath230 is a product state , an alternative procedure to this adiabatic passage can be envisaged . starting from the vacuum @xmath211 ( also a product state with every atom in @xmath4 ) , we perform a global @xmath231-pulse to the single - atom transition @xmath232 . as a result , we obtain a product state where every atom is in a superposition @xmath233/\\sqrt{2}$ ] . in a second step , the @xmath207-pulse with the mapping laser described by the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : h_map ] ) and with @xmath206 , transfers every atom to the state @xmath234/\\sqrt{2}$ ] , i.e. , we have prepared the ground state @xmath157 . it is worth remarking that this method eliminates the lifetime limitation in this first stage . _ step 2 : _ let us show now how to address the single - fermion and two - fermion states from this ground state @xmath157 . as we explained in section [ sec : constrained ] , the hamiltonian @xmath64 , associated with the detuning , drives transitions between neighboring manifolds , i.e. @xmath235 , ( see fig . [ fig : spectrum ] ) . we exploit this fact and introduce an oscillating detuning of the form @xmath236 . if we tune @xmath237 to coincide with the gap between two given states , this detuning acts effectively as a laser that couples them resonantly with a rabi frequency that is proportional to @xmath238 .    using this oscillating detuning , we want to transfer the population from the ground to the first excited state ( fig . [ fig : excitation]a ) . to do so , @xmath237 is tuned to be on resonance with the corresponding energy gap , i.e. , @xmath239 , and by a @xmath207-pulse we populate @xmath125 . one has to take into account that in the limit of @xmath46 the energy gap between any two neighboring manifolds is equal , i.e. , also higher lying excitations are populated . to avoid this effect and address only the @xmath125 state , we can choose a not too large value of @xmath19 . in this regime , the second order level shifts caused by @xmath64 and @xmath65 , that are roughly given by @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively ( see section [ sec : energy ] ) , become increasingly important . in particular , as it is sketched in fig . [ fig : excitation]a , the gap between @xmath240 and any of the @xmath151 levels becomes more and more different from @xmath241 and , as a consequence , the unwanted transitions fall out of resonance . analogously , the same procedure could be used to address the two - fermion many - particle states ( see fig . [ fig : excitation]b ) . the first @xmath207-pulse resonant with the @xmath242 transition , is followed by another @xmath207-pulse with @xmath237 tuned to coincide with the energy gap of the specific @xmath243 transition , @xmath244 . the separation between neighboring @xmath151 states is of the order of @xmath44 and the rabi frequency of the transition is proportional to @xmath238 . as a consequence , to populate only a single level of the two - fermion manifold , the parameters have to accomplish that @xmath245 and , at the same time , @xmath238 has to be large enough in order to perform the transfer at a time interval that is much shorter than the lifetime of the rydberg state .    . * a : * in a first step , the population is transferred by a @xmath207-pulse to the single - fermion state by tuning the frequency of the detuning on resonance with the gap @xmath246 . * b : * a second @xmath207-pulse with @xmath237 tuned to match @xmath247 addresses the corresponding @xmath151 state , bearing in mind that @xmath245 in this step.,width=321 ]", "in this work we have studied the collective excitation of a laser - driven rydberg gas confined to a ring lattice . we have focused on the regime in which the interaction between the highly excited states is much weaker than the laser field . we found that the corresponding system can be described as a chain of spinless fermions whose dynamics is driven by the @xmath53-model . this hamiltonian can be analytically solved and , by exploiting the symmetries of the system , we were able to completely characterize the many - particle states arising . in particular , we have shown that the first excited state of the hamiltonian corresponds to a spin wave or to an excitation which is completely delocalized all over the lattice . the two - fermion states could be expressed as a superposition of excitation pairs and an investigation of their density - density correlation function has been performed . we have demonstrated that the qualitative behavior of these correlations differs substantially from one state to another of the same two - fermion manifold , going from a smoothly decaying function to a pronounced correlation - anticorrelation pattern . the analytical eigenenergies of the @xmath53-hamiltonian were compared to the numerical exact ones of the complete hamiltonian , and excellent agreement between both results has been found . finally , we have investigated several paths for the selective excitation of the many - particle states . one of them relies on the variation of the laser parameters with time , finding trajectories from the initial to a given final many - body state . the other possibility we have presented makes use of an oscillating detuning which allows to access excitations starting from the ground state of the hamiltonian . in each step , a @xmath207-pulse is performed with the frequency of the oscillation matching the energy gap between the involved states .    throughout this work we have considered an homogeneous occupation of the sites of the ring lattice . the situation of having a randomly fluctuating number of atoms per site would effectively lead to a disorder potential for the fermions , as outlined in ref . this would imply as well a change in the symmetry properties of the system , so that more states become accessible by a time - evolution ( e.g. , @xmath177 possible single - fermion states instead of only the fully - symmetric one ) . in addition , we have assumed that the atoms are strongly localized , @xmath248 ( fig . [ fig : lattice ] ) . taking into consideration the finite width of the wave packet would lead to another kind of disorder , this time associated to the interaction parameter @xmath44 .    as we have pointed out , the main problem one has to face in this system is the limited lifetime of the rydberg states , which is in the order of several microseconds . one could think of preparing a parallel system to the one described in this work but using polar molecules @xcite , to overcome this lifetime limitation . an interesting extension is also the investigation of the system in two - dimensional geometries , e.g. , triangular or square lattices , as well as several rings disposed in concentric or cylindric configurations . in all these cases , the symmetries of the particular arrangement of the sites might give rise to new interesting many - particle states ."], "summary": "we study the collective excitation of a gas of highly excited atoms confined to a large spacing ring lattice , where the ground and the excited states are coupled resonantly via a laser field . our attention is focused on the regime where the interaction between the highly excited atoms is very weak in comparison to the rabi frequency of the laser . we demonstrate that in this case the many - body excitations of the system can be expressed in terms of free spinless fermions . the complex many - particle states arising in this regime are characterized and their properties , e.g. their correlation functions , are studied . in addition we investigate how one can actually experimentally access some of these many - particle states by a temporal variation of the laser parameters .", "ranking": [4, 1, 0, 3, 2]}

independent elastic and shear moduli . the elastic forces that resist deformation in response to applied stresses and thermal fluctuations in a crystalline solid , are a consequence of the long range structural order . this structural order is acquired at the uniquely defined melting point where there is a thermodynamic driving force for structural change : the free energy of the system decreases through macroscopic atomic ordering .    just above the melting temperature , as the liquid is coooled , its viscosity increases and is well approximated by an arrhenius law , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the extrapolated value of viscosity at infinite temperature , @xmath3 is a nearly constant function of t ( playing the role of activation energy of atomic rearrangement ) , and @xmath4 is the usual boltzmann constant . eventually , when the liquid is cooled to its melting temperature , @xmath5 , a first order phase transition occurs , and the liquid becomes a crystalline solid . this process requires a finite amount of time , the nucleation time , however , and can therefore be thwarted . if a liquid is cooled sufficiently quickly , crystallization can be bypassed and the liquid enters a metastable state known as the supercooled liquid . as a supercooled liquid is further cooled , its viscosity begins to increase in an incredible fashion , by up to 16 decades over a temperature window as small as a few hundred kelvin . a `` glass transition '' temperature , labeled @xmath6 , is eventually reached at which point the viscosity is so great (  @xmath7 poise ) that any large scale atomic rearragnement ( flow ) ceases on physically meaningful timescales ( order of   100s ) . on daily time - scales , beneath @xmath6 , the supercooled liquid responds rigidly to external perturbations and is deemed a glass . if the viscosity of the supercooled liquid continued to increase in an arrhenius fashion down to @xmath6 , the glass transition would not have been so mysterious . in such a case , there would exist a constant energy barrier to local rearrangement that would become exponentially harder to cross as kinetic energy is removed from the supercooled liquid on cooling . the supercooled liquid would nt flow on experimentally meaningful timescales and the apparent rigidity would be entirely kinetic in origin . however , for all supercooled liquids , a departure from arrhenius dynamics is observed . for all liquids , there is an apparent temperature dependence to the activation energy @xcite , and the degree of departure from an arrhenius viscosity is quantified in the fragility parameter of angell @xcite . despite a wide and rich phenomenology that can not be enumerated here @xcite , understanding the underlying physical mechanism of the so - called super - arrhenius viscosity and the appearance of rigidity without long range order are the fundamental challenges of glass science . an activation barrier which grows with decreasing temperature is suggestive of cooperative particle motion in the supercooled liquid , and it is natural to suspect that this cooperativity likely arises due to structural changes accompanying supercooling . conventional wisdom posits that growing timescales require growing lengthscales @xcite . further , the possible , equilibrium vanishing of the configurational entropy and associated theoretical phase transition at finite temperature , @xmath8 , known as the kauzmann paradox is highly suggestive that structre plays a significant role in the glassy slowdown . in fact , many theories of the glass transition require the existence of a growing static structural lengthscale associated with the arrest at @xmath6 @xcite . however , structure factors and radial distribution functions show little change upon supercooling to @xmath6 , so the identification of a universally accepted structural lengthscale has remained elusive @xcite . previously , many structural lengthscales have been proposed and tested for but unfortunately none of these lengths have been satisfactably verified experimentally @xcite . to that end we have proposed the existence of a new lengthscale related to structural connectivity in the supercooled liquid , namely the shear penetration depth , which is defined as the depth to which a shear perturbation applied on a boundary would penetrate into a liquid . using molecular dynamics simulations on a model metallic glassformer , we provide evidence that this lengthscale grows dramatically with supercooling , and marks a natural candidate to measure structural connectivity in supercooled liquids tied to their arrest . the shear penetration depth has the added benefit that it can be experimentally measured . we have defined the shear penetration depth as the length over which a shear perturbation applied on a boundary will appreciably penetrate into a material . if a force is applied to the boundary layer of a high temperature liquid , only the atoms in the layers of the liquid near the boundary will experience an appreciable displacement due to the applied force . as the temperature is lowered and the viscosity increases , the shear force penetrates deeper into the material until the glass transition is reached . when the material is a glass , the shear perturbation entirely penetrates the material , diverging to the system size . this idealized behavior of the shear penetration depth is depicted in figure ( [ depth . ] ) . when a crystalline solid moves together in response to a shear force , it is because the long range order allows for the transmission of the force throughout the entire material . in a glass we expect that there is also a network of interconnectivity which grew and became more cohesive as the supercooled liquid was cooled toward @xmath6 . the shear penetration depth serves not only as a lengthscale for the various theories that require one , but more importantly is intimately connected with structural connectivity and its existence and growth would provide strong evidence that structure underlies the slow kinetics of the glass transition .", "to test for the existence of the shear penetration depth , we simulated a model metallic glass former , namely @xmath0 ( @xmath9 ) . this binary alloy system represents an exceptional example of a fragile glassformer , displaying a marked super -

empirical finnis - sinclair type embedded atom model potential developed by mendelev et al @xcite . this potential was shown to very accurately reproduce the behavior of both the equilibrium liquid and supercooled liquid / glass . simulations were run with n=5000 atoms in the npt ensemble with the target external pressure set to p=0 . a nose - hoover thermostat and barostat were used to control the temperature and pressure , respectively . the initial positions of the atoms were generated randomly , and the system was then allowed to melt and come to equilibrium at an initial temperature of t=2200 k for 0.25 ns . once the liquid had equilibrated , it was quenched to the desired target temperature ( ranging from 300 k up to 1900 k ) using a quench rate of @xmath7 k / s . once the target temperature was reached , the system was allowed to evolve naturally for 0.1 ns . next , an additional external force of 0.2 ev / a was applied in the x - direction to all atoms in the uppermost 4 angstrom layer of the simulation box . this force was left active for only 100 timesteps . this was meant to approximate an impulsive `` kick '' at the boundary layer of the system . after the application of the shear force , the system was left to evolve for an observation time of 16,000 timesteps . after the observation time had passed , displacement data was exported and examined . for t=300 , 500 , 600 , 650 , 700 , 750 , 800 , and 1300 k , six independent starting configurations were employed to provide for good statisitics .", "in order to quantify the penetration depth and extract its temperature dependence , we examine the displacement of the atoms in the shear direction as a function of their distance from the boundary layer at each of the target temperatures . representative data is shown in figure ( [ data . ] ) . we define the shear direction ( direction of applied shear ) as the x - direction , and the vertical distance from the boundary layer as the z - direction ( see figure ( [ depth . ] ) ) . the displacment is the net displacement of the atoms in the shear direction from the timestep immediately preceding the activation of the shear force to the end of the observation time , as defined above . the height of the atom is its z - coordinate at the observation time . due to the periodic boundaries , only atoms falling within the range @xmath10 to @xmath11 are considered . thermal and temporal effects do play a role , and make the response of the system more complicated than assumed here . this can be quantified , and a deeper analysis is saved for a separate work @xcite . because the system size is small and the applied shear force is weak ( so as not to fracture the system in the glassy state ) , the displacement of the atoms , @xmath12 , as a function of height ( z ) can be linearized . to that end , we perform a linear regression to the data and get fits of the form , @xmath13    for all temperatures where multiple independent runs were made , we average the values of @xmath14 , and it is this average , @xmath15 , that we examine as a function of temperature . figure ( [ slope . ] ) depicts this temperature dependence . the error bars are given by the standard deviation computed from the multiple runs . these correspond to thermal fluctuations and the different inherent structures the supecooled liquid / glass can be quenched into . it is clear that there is a drastic , monotonic decrease in @xmath15 as the temperature is decreased toward @xmath6 . in the vicinity of @xmath6 and at all temperatures below it , the value of @xmath15 with its associated error is indistinguishable from zero . this is consistent with total penetration of the shear . we can convert the decay of the displacement into a quantifiable length scale by defining the penetration depth as @xmath16 due to the fluctuations at and below @xmath6 , we can only assert that the length scale grows dramatically with decreasing temperature and diverges to beyond the system size at the glass transition . a bound on the shear penetration is provided by @xmath17    @xmath18 represents an absolute lower bound on the behavior of the length scale with temperature and is displayed in figure ( [ length . ] ) . from the figure it is clear that the length scale grows dramatically as the glass transition is approached . it is also quite noticeable that appreciable growth of the lengthscale does not set in until a temperature close to @xmath19 . below this temperature ( typically for all metallic glass formers @xmath20 ) @xcite super - arrhenius growth of the relaxation time appears . furthermore , below @xmath19 , the stokes - einstein relation may break down , and solid - like properties begin to appear in the liquid @xcite . more significantly , below @xmath19 , local structures begin to form and percolate throughout the system as seen in numerous molecular dynamics studies @xcite . this provides ample support to the notion that structure plays a significant role in the arrest at the glass transition . as the local structures interlock and interpenetrate , they begin to thread the system . as they grow further , and become increasingly cohesive , a backbone forms in the liquid which is stiff and rigid . this allows for the propagation of the shear force through the material , and leads to the arrested flow . the shear penetration depth is ultimately agnostic as to the exact form of propagating structural order and connectivity , but represents an exciting new method of possibly measuring this growing order without resorting to standard scattering methods which have been largely opaque to role of structure in the glass transition .", "by taking advantage of simple physical reasoning derived from the main distinction between liquids and solids , in terms of their response to shear , we have identified a natural length scale relevant to the glass transition . this lengthscale , the shear penetration depth , has been shown through simulations , to grow dramatically as a liquid is supercooled toward @xmath6 . further , we have made a reasonable and physically meaningful connection with growing structural order and connectivity in the supercooled liquid . that the shear penetration depth begins to grow appreciably at @xmath19 , is a strong indicator that structure plays a fundamental role in the kinetic phenomenology of the glass transition . because the shear penetration depth is intimately related and sensitive to this connectivity and structural change , it marks an exceptional candidate for revealing the effect of structure in experiments .", "nw and zn were supported by the nsf dmr-1411229 . zn thanks the feinberg foundation visiting faculty program at weizmann institute ."], "summary": "the glass transition remains one of the great unsolved mysteries of contemporary condensed matter physics . when crystallization is bypassed by rapid cooling , a supercooled liquid , retaining amorphous particle arrangment , results . the physical phenomenology of supercooled liquids is as vast as it is interesting . most significant , the viscosity of the supercooled liquid displays an incredible increase over a narrow temperature range . eventually , the supercooled liquid ceases to flow , becomes a glass , and gains rigidity and solid -

contradictory . yet there is a proof of existence of deterministic models for quantum mechanical objects , in which dissipation , i.e. , a fundamental information loss mechanism , has been an essential ingredient  @xcite .    with these findings in mind , we presently discuss aspects of a dynamical transition _ from _ classical _ to _ quantum behaviour , assuming that : _ quantum features originate from a dissipative process which affects all physical objects . dynamics and statistical interpretation of quantum states ( born rule ) originate from deterministic rules , such as embodied in classical mechanics , in an ensemble theory . _    we speculate that the _ atomistic _ structure of spacetime itself is responsible for effects which are attributed to quantum mechanics , typically operating at length scales very much larger than the planck length . here `` atomistic '' refers to a discrete set of elements with the presence , or absence , of a certain order relation between any two elements . furthermore , this set , in particular the number of its elements changes dynamically , possibly establishing new order relations , or erasing old ones . in this way , `` time happens '' . similar ideas about the nature of spacetime have been formulated every now and then throughout the history of natural philosophy  @xcite . however , only recently such general scenario has been elaborated in more detail in the theory of _ causal sets_. in mathematical terms , these are locally finite ordered sets . their evolution by sequential growth through random ( `` sprinkling '' ) appearance of new set elements together with their order relations has been studied  @xcite .    in the absence of an equally elaborate theory of matter in relation to such atomistic structure of spacetime , we can nevertheless state the following , concerning the situation of a typical object . consider an electron , for example , an object that to highest known precision behaves according to the laws of quantum mechanics . we may term its `` situation '' a hypothetical complete set of its properties that are accessible by experiments . now , first of all , there are interactions between such object and its environment ( the `` rest of the universe '' ) , last not least gravitational ones . besides more familiar aspects , however , there must exist a continual _ information loss _ about its situation , since the atomistic spacetime beneath evolves . with respect to the latter , quantum theory at present deals with very coarse - grained phenomena , when describing the dynamics of matter . loosely speaking , in order to fully characterize an electron , the evolution of its causal relations with a continually changing number of spacetime `` atoms '' has to come into play . consequently , in a coarse - grained picture where this is not explicitly taken into account , information about an object degrades , due to the evolving  always and everywhere present  environment which is spacetime . secondly , however , common objects are characterized by a certain persistence , which makes them identifiable in experiments . therefore , the information loss must be a delicate one . it must be compatible with the _ conservation of probability _ , which is a basic tenet of a reasonable ensemble theory . contrary to measurement processes in quantum mechanics , where information is transferred from microscopic to macroscopic objects ,   we propose here that matter degrees of freedom are continually `` measured '' by the evolution of spacetime . these heuristic considerations lead us to modify the classical ensemble theory in important ways . we will incorporate dissipation into the liouville equation , however , in such a way that probability conservation remains intact . this provides us with a glimpse of the mechanism that might be responsible for turning the deterministic evolution of classical objects , described here by an ensemble theory , into the schrdinger evolution of quantum objects .", "it will be shown here how the _ classical _ liouville equation can be written in the form of the _ quantum mechanical _ vonneumann equation , generally , incorporating a characteristic extra term . we consider objects with a single continuous degree of freedom , for simplicity .   to begin with , we consider conservative forces , such that the equations of motion are determined by the generic hamiltonian function : @xmath0 depending on generalized coordinate @xmath1 and momentum @xmath2 , and where @xmath3 denotes the _ true potential_. in section  3 , we will come back to the notion of the true potential and distinguish it from a related _ coarse - grained potential _ @xmath4 . an ensemble of such objects , for example , following trajectories with different initial conditions , is described by a distribution function @xmath5 in phase space , i.e. , by the probability @xmath6 to find a member of the ensemble in an infinitesimal volume at point @xmath7 . this distribution evolves according to the liouville equation : @xmath8 with @xmath9 .  we recall that the relative minus sign in the poisson bracket , or between terms here , reflects a symplectic phase space symmetry . this will translate into the familiar commutator structure in eq.([schroed ] ) .    a fourier transformation , @xmath10 , replaces the liouville equation by : @xmath11 without changing the notation for the distribution function , whenever changing variables . thus , momentum is eliminated and a _ doubled number of coordinates _ results . finally , with the transformation : @xmath12 we obtain the liouville equation in the form : @xmath13 \\label{hx }   \\hat h_\\chi & : = & -\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_\\chi ^{\\;2}+v(\\chi ) \\;\\ ; ,   \\;\\;\\;\\mbox{for}\\;\\;\\chi = q , q   \\;\\ ; , \\\\ [ 1ex ] \\label{i }   { \\cal e}(q , q)&:=&(q -

hand side of eq.([schroed ] ) has a symmetric spectrum with respect to zero and , in general , will not be bounded below . + * finally , the following observation will be important : @xmath20 the analogous vanishing of @xmath17 in a field theory is equivalent with having massive or massless free fields , with or without external sources , and with or without bilinear couplings . generally , in all these cases , anharmonic forces or interactions are absent . we emphasize that the coupling of the hilbert space and its dual and the related lacking of a stable ground state , in general , show that our reformulation of hamiltonian dynamics does not qualify as a proper quantum theory . however , we will motivate certain modifications from which dynamical aspects of quantum mechanics seem to emerge after all .", "here we present a simple - minded argument indicating that the discreteness of spacetime may be relevant for the emergence of quantum mechanical phenomena , turning the liouville equation into the vonneumann  -  lindblad equation , in particular . given that spacetime is discrete , there must be a characteristic length scale , the planck length , where the continuum description of all phenomena breaks down . this implies that one might overlook important traces of this atomistic structure by employing continuum quantities which allow to arbitrarily extrapolate their functional dependence to scales @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the planck length .    instead of having a _ coarse - grained potential _ @xmath4 , for example , the _ true potential _ @xmath3 should become piecewise defined somehow , when approaching smaller and smaller scales in the continuum picture . thus , the function @xmath4 is an approximation to @xmath3 and the difference between the two must give rise to local _ fluctuations _ therefore , we set : @xmath24 in order to relate the short distance behaviour to its coarse - grained description . two sources of fluctuations can enter here : first , the spatiotemporal discreteness @xcite . second , the possibly discrete nature of interactions or matter . the latter might go beyond what is usually seen as _ effects _ of quantum mechanics . this has not been explored in parallel with the causal set theory of the deep structure of spacetime and will not be further discussed at present . however , there is an important `` asymptotic freedom '' effect , caused by spatiotemporal discreteness : on a ( background ) causal set , cross sections must fall to zero when the center of mass energy of two scattering particles reaches the planck scale @xcite . this is based on viewing the causal set _ as if _ generated by a poisson process , `` sprinkling '' set elements with an average density of one element per planckian volume , @xmath25  for example , into minkowski space , if this is considered as the continuum limit . the `` asymptotic freedom '' effect suggests to consider the _ true potential _ function @xmath3 as _ piecewise linear _ , with the pieces  simplices in higher dimensions  characterized by short `` linearity lengths '' @xmath26 . they must be , however , sufficiently larger than the planck length , @xmath27 , such that the continuum description is meaningful .     with these remarks in mind , we reconsider the force term @xmath28 in eq.([schroed ] ) . we rewrite this equation , admitting more than one spatial dimension , more simply as : @xmath29_{(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{q};t ) } + ( \\mathbf{q}-\\mathbf{q})\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathbf{\\nabla } v(\\frac{\\mathbf{q}+\\mathbf{q}}{2})f(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{q};t ) \\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , with @xmath31 denoting the laplacian , in an obvious generalization . now , the term involving the derivative of the potential is related to the _ would - be quantum mechanical _ term  the potential difference between points @xmath32 and @xmath33  as a linear mid - point approximation to an integral : @xmath34 the approximate relation becomes an exact equality in the cases covered by observation ( [ ezero ] ) .    more generally , the integral  which yields _ exactly _ the quantum mechanical term  can be decomposed into a sum of integrals along straight line segments : @xmath35 determined by a set of positions @xmath36 which match the piecewise linearity of the true potential with the path of integration from @xmath37 to @xmath38 , i.e. , with the linearity lengths , @xmath39 . we conclude that within small volumes , the linear size of which is determined by the linearity length @xmath40 of the potential there , the liouville equation of _ classical _ statistical mechanics , in the form of eq.([schroed ] ) or eq.([schroedr ] ) , is _ indistinguishable _ from the corresponding _ quantum mechanical _ vonneumann equation , which both refer to the continuum description . furthermore , we learn from eqs.([schroedr])([qmintegral ] ) that for larger distances , covering several linearity lengths @xmath26 , the potential ( commutator ) term of the vonneumann operator is obtained as a _ sum of classical contributions_. this summation is natural in view of the fact that each term adds an appropriate amount of energy to the potential difference @xmath41 , with one contribution per interval over which the potential is linear .    in this way , we obtain the hamilton operator for arbitrarily extended , piecewise linear potentials : @xmath42 in the coordinate representation , and readily infer the vonneumann equation in operator form : @xmath43 \\;\\;.\\ ] ] however , following the argument from eq.([schroedr ] ) to eq.([vnplp ] ) , there is a subtlety behind the last two equations here , concerning the composition of the simplices .    in the continuum picture , each simplex forms a tiny `` box '' with a _ sharply localized _ boundary condition , which prohibits the leaking of probability to the outside  as long as they are sufficiently separated . bringing two such boxes next to each other , such that a common border region arises which is less than a planck length `` thick '' , the confining boundary condition will dissolve into a free boundary condition , no matter how it originated in the first place . this is another manifestation of the `` asymptotic freedom '' property , caused by the discrete spacetime structure . thus , we imagine that the range of variables entering the matrix elements of @xmath44 can adiabatically increase to the full range over both simplexes . while this `` gedankenexperiment '' might seem plausible , a serious justification of the extension of the range of validity of eq.([vnplp ] ) over more than one linearity length seems necessary . we intend to come back to this important point elsewhere .      in order to extend our considerations further to reach the scales where quantum mechanics is known to work , we have to address also the coarse - graining that must be involved . this can not be analyzed rigorously without understanding how the common forces / interactions that we encounter relate to phenomena at much shorter distance scales , such as the linearity scale . however , qualitatively , we expect the coordinates to _ fluctuate _ , which enter the continuum description , in particular , when we write down the vonneumann equation with the potential terms obtained in eq.([qmintegral ] ) .  indeed , let us consider , for example , an event determined in the continuum picture . the position ascribed to it in a fixed lorentz frame can not be exactly maintained with time , if minkowski space is a _ continuum approximation _ to an underlying discrete structure : to the future of this event there likely will be planck scale size ( or larger ) patches of minkowski space which contain no element of the approximated causal set . it appears to us that the event , respectively its successors , must change position by small amounts with time ( `` swerve '' ) , effectively performing a random walk within its future lightcone @xcite . we can get a feeling for the linear size @xmath45 of these swerves by estimating the probability to have a spherical void of volume @xmath46 that lasts for a planck time interval . for the poisson process mentioned earlier and with @xmath47 , we find this to be @xmath48 . therefore , uncertainties @xmath45 of the order of a typical distance pertaining to the standard model , for example , are extremely improbable . nevertheless , at the linearity scale they may play an essential role in washing out the piecewise linear potentials .     by experience , smooth polynomial interactions play an essential role , say in the standard model and , to be derived from there , in phenomenological forces of physics at still lower energies . since details of the coarse - graining are unknown , in particular those leading to highly constrained gauge symmetries , we now consider the phenomenological _ ansatz _ of eq.([ansatz ] ) , which connects _ short distance behaviour at the linearity scale _ with its _ coarse - grained description_. in particular , this replaces a true , piecewise linear potential @xmath3 by a coarse - grained potential @xmath4 plus local fluctuations @xmath23 . the fluctuations are treated as white noise with mean and correlation , respectively , given by : @xmath49 \\label{correl }   \\langle\\delta v(\\mathbf{x})\\delta v(\\mathbf{y})\\rangle   & = & \\nu^2(\\mathbf{x})\\delta ( \\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y})/\\delta ( 0 )     \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 describes the width of the local distribution of fluctuations . this distribution can not be assessed without further insight into how forces arise at small spacetime scales . we now implement eq.([ansatz ] ) , @xmath51 , in the vonneumann equation following from eqs.([schroedr])([qmintegral ] ) , with piecewise linear potential . this yields the vonneumann equation with the coarse - grained potential @xmath4 and additional fluctuating terms : @xmath52 \\;\\;,\\ ] ] where the effective hamilton operator is now given by : @xmath53 \\label{heff1 } & : = & -\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_{\\mathbf{x}}^{\\;2}+v(\\mathbf{x})+\\delta v(\\mathbf{x } ) \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the coordinate representation , cf . eq.([vnplp ] ) . in order to evaluate the influence of the fluctuations , we iterate eq.([vnl ] ) once : @xmath54+\\mbox{o}(\\delta v ) -[\\delta v,[\\delta v,\\hat f ] \\;\\;.\\ ] ] integrating once , with the initial condition : @xmath55_{t=0}+\\mbox{o}(\\delta v ) \\;\\;,\\ ] ] and averaging over the fluctuations , with the help of eqs.([mean])([correl ] ) , leads to : @xmath56 -\\int_0^t\\mbox{d}t'(\\{\\hat\\nu^2,\\hat f\\}-2\\hat\\nu\\hat f\\hat\\nu ) \\;\\;,\\ ] ] with the matrix elements @xmath57 and @xmath58 . for sufficiently short times and slowly varying @xmath44 , we may use the approximation : @xmath59 -t(\\{\\hat\\nu^2,\\hat f\\}-2\\hat\\nu\\hat f\\hat\\nu ) \\;\\;,\\ ] ] thus , we arrive at a markovian master equation with a dissipative _ lindblad term _ , in addition to the leading commutator , which is responsible for unitary quantum evolution  la vonneumann in the absence of dissipation . linearity in the density matrix is an important feature of our resulting equations . in particular , in the form of eqs.([vnl2])([vnlm ] ) , the master equation preserves the normalization of @xmath44 , say @xmath60 , which expresses the conservation of probability . it seems worth while to point out that we arrive at the standard , i.e. , in particular _ local _ , quantum mechanical evolution equation  even if modified by a less standard yet wellcome lindblad term . however , we emphasize that the relation to the primordial deterministic degrees of freedom , which involves a fourier transformation ( cf . section2 ) , is highly nonlocal . this may ease the tension created by bell s theorem , when it comes to deterministic ( `` hidden '' ) variables . the lindblad term in eq.([vnlm ] ) implies an interesting _ decoherence and continuous localization mechanism _ , which causes the decay of spatial superpositions ( `` schrdinger cat states '' ) . while the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath44 are not affected by the lindblad term , the off - diagonal matrix elements decay : @xmath61 where we neglected the effect of @xmath16 , for simplicity , which can not stop the decay . ultimately , spacetime discreteness produces this mechanism  via the induced fluctuations in interactions . since there is no theory yet to tell us about the correlation function @xmath62 , it may suffice to point out that considerations of stochastic effects on quantum mechanics  as it is  have quite a history , see , for example , refs . @xcite and the literature cited there . this is related to attempts to solve the measurement problem and to account for the apparent absence of spatial superposition states of macroscopic objects @xcite . also quantum gravity is conjectured to lead to characteristic stochastic effects @xcite . in this context , various proposals for the analogue of our lindblad operator @xmath63 in eq.([vnlm ] ) have been made as well and it has similarly been concluded that spatial superposition states decohere and decay . while these issues are not settled , our heuristic arguments suggest that if quantum mechanical behaviour indeed emerges dynamically , then the resolution of the measurement problem may be linked to this . ` prequantum ' dynamics may account for an objective selection mechanism in accordance with the observed wave function collapse in measurement outcomes .    generally , lindblad master equations present a large class of linear markovian master equations , which are usually derived to describe open quantum systems that interact with particular environments  @xcite . here spacetime itself forms the universal environment that `` measures '' all physical objects . we have derived this _ quantum mechanical master equation _ , beginning with _ classical statistical mechanics _ , by incorporating several assumptions about the atomistic nature of spacetime , as well as about the nature of forces acting on matter .", "we have presented a heuristic discussion to the effect that quantum mechanics  together with a natural decoherence and continuous localization mechanism  is a consequence of classical statistics and concerns dynamics with respect to an atomistic spacetime that is observed with low resolution , i.e. , at large distance scales . the spatiotemporal discreteness results in permanent information loss affecting all matter , when described in the corse -

generally defined as those dwarfs with spectral type @xmath1 m7 @xcite , encompassing very low mass stars just above the stellar / substellar boundary and all brown dwarfs below it . surprisingly , despite their low bolometric luminosity , a number of ultracool dwarfs have been detected as relatively bright sources at radio frequencies @xcite . initially , the detection of variable , broadband radio emission with low net circular polarization suggested incoherent gyrosynchrotron radiation due to a population of electrons spiraling in the magnetic field of the ultracool dwarf @xcite . this is the mechanism by which higher mass dwarf stars are thought to generate persistent levels of radio emission . however , such stars are surrounded by high temperature chromospheres and coronae and the levels of radio emission they produce have been found to be tightly correlated to their coronal x - ray luminosities @xcite . ultracool dwarfs , on the other hand , are thought to possess cooler , more neutral atmospheres , as evidenced by their low h@xmath2 and x - ray luminosities @xcite , and yet can produce high levels of radio emission , many orders of magnitude brighter than predicted by this relationship . @xcite reported a periodicity of @xmath3 hours in the radio emission detected from one such ultracool dwarf 2mass j00361617 + 1821104 citing orbital motion of a companion , rotation of the dwarf or periodic magnetic reconnection as possible causes of the observed behaviour . @xcite detected a periodicity in the radio emission from a second ultracool dwarf , tvlm 513 - 46546 ( hereafter tvlm 513 ) consistent with the putative rotation period of the dwarf derived from @xmath4 sin @xmath5 data , thereby favouring rotation as the cause of the observed periodicities for both dwarfs . based on this assumption , the periodic variability can be explained by either ( a ) an anisotropically beamed radio emission mechanism or ( b ) the occultation of very high brightness temperature compact regions in the magnetosphere of the dwarf . both scenarios were deemed inconsistent with isotropic gyrosynchrotron emission from a large extended corona . it was postulated that the radio emission from ultracool dwarfs may instead be due to coherent electron cyclotron maser emission generated in the low density regions above the poles of a large - scale magnetic field @xcite , the same mechanism producing the coherent radiation detected from the magnetized planets in our solar system @xcite . however , studies of the electron cyclotron maser instability operating in planetary magnetospheres have reported intrinsically narrow banded , 100% polarized emission . the radio emission from tvlm 513 , on the other hand , was found to be broadband with net circular polarization @xmath6 reaching a periodic maximum of @xmath7 , properties more consistent with the incoherent gyrosynchrotron process . we have conducted further deep pointings of tvlm 513 in an effort to unambiguously distinguish between incoherent gyrosynchrotron emission and coherent electron cyclotron maser emission . the periodicity reported by @xcite was once again present , but the dwarf was found to be in a much more active state than in previous epochs , producing periodic bursts of extremely bright 100% circularly polarized emission . these observations provide direct confirmation that ultracool dwarfs can produce persistent levels of broadband , 100% polarized , coherent electron cyclotron maser emission .", "we used the very large array ( vla ) to observe the m9 dwarf tvlm 513 - 46546 for @xmath8 hours at a frequency of 8.44 ghz on 2006 may 20 and for @xmath8 hours at a frequency of 4.88 ghz on 2006 may 21 . data reduction was carried out with the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) software package . the light curve of the 8.44 ghz radio emission is characterized by periodic bursts of both left and right 100% circularly polarized emission , the brightest periodically reaching flux values of @xmath9 mjy , which are stable in phase for the duration of the observation ( fig . 1 ) . similar , albeit less bright ( up to @xmath10 mjy ) , periodic bursts are also present in the 4.88 ghz light curve . the periodicity of 1.96 hours was also retrieved in i band photometric monitoring observations of tvlm 513 using telescopes at the us naval observatory ( usno ) , flagstaff station and the vatican observatory ( vo ) , arizona confirming that the periodicity present in the radio emission from tvlm 513 is due to the rotation of the dwarf ( fig . 2 ) . therefore , although the bright , polarized bursts present in the radio data appear to be transient flares , they are produced by the strong beaming of persistent radio emission together with the rapid rotation of the dwarf . for the limiting case of perfectly beamed emission and assuming a source @xmath11r from the surface , where r is the radius of the dwarf , we can use the duration of the bursts to geometrically constrain the size of the emitting source region to be @xmath12r . using this value , we can establish the brightness temperature of the radio emission to be @xmath13 k , which , together with the 100% circular polarization and extremely narrow beaming , provides conclusive confirmation of its coherent nature . the phase folded light curves of the radio emission detected from tvlm 513 at 8.44 and 4.88 ghz are shown in fig . the flux detected over the duration of the observation was @xmath14 mjy and @xmath15 mjy at 8.44 and 4.88 ghz respectively . these values are similar to those reported previously for this dwarf by @xcite of @xmath16 mjy and @xmath17 mjy at 8.44 and 4.88 ghz respectively . however , the periodic bursts , particularly those detected at 8.44 ghz which are an order of magnitude brighter than the mean flux values , were not detected in the observations of @xcite , indicating that activity levels in the compact regions producing the bursts have increased greatly in the intervening @xmath18 months between the two epochs . although the periodic bursts are 100% circularly polarized , the interpulse emission at both frequencies is largely unpolarized . this unpolarized component does not display the high degree of periodic variation observed for the 100% circularly component of the emission indicating much lower intrinsic beaming of the emission . although periodic bursts are detected at 4.88 and 8.44 ghz , the phase folded light curves suggest narrowband structure across this frequency range , for example the brightest burst in the 8.44 ghz phase folded light curve does not appear to have a counterpart in the 4.88 ghz light curve . although there is a burst at a similar phase in the 4.88 ghz light curve , it is left circularly polarized and thus probably originates in a region of opposite magnetic polarity to the right circularly polarized 8.44 ghz burst . it should be noted that direct correlation of the radio emission at both frequencies is subject to the assumption that the periodic bursts were stable in phase and amplitude over the duration of the two night monitoring campaign , as data were not obtained at both frequencies simultaneously . it is notable that the phase folded light curve of the 4.88 ghz emission is characterized by two highly polarized bursts per period of rotation of the dwarf , separated by @xmath19 phase . this is consistent with emission from the same source region emitted perpendicular to the local magnetic field and hence detected twice per period of rotation . in contrast , the bursts observed at 8.44 ghz are only detected once per rotation and hence may be obscured on one side by optically thick plasma or indeed the stellar surface .", "the characteristics of the periodic bursts , which include 100% circular polarization , high brightness temperature and very narrow beaming , are all consistent with coherent emission generated via the electron cyclotron maser instability @xcite . as discussed by @xcite , the unpolarized component of the radio emission detected from tvlm 513 may also be produced by the coherent electron cyclotron maser mechanism , but incoherent gyrosynchrotron or synchrotron emission can not be ruled out without further multifrequency observations to separately characterize the 100% circularly polarized bursts and the unpolarized component of the emission . the electron cyclotron maser instability is the mechanism deemed responsible for the coherent radio emission detected from the magnetized planets in our solar system @xcite , and has also been proposed as a source of certain classes of solar and stellar bursts . the bulk of planetary electron cyclotron maser emission is confined to high magnetic latitudes and in - situ measurements of earth s auroral kilometric radiation ( akr ) have provided the deepest insights in to the nature of the radiation mechanism . akr is associated with the presence of magnetic field - aligned electric fields at high magnetic latitudes that ( 1 ) evacuate thermal plasma along open field lines enabling the formation of density cavities where the electron cyclotron frequency can greatly exceed the plasma frequency , @xmath20 , a prerequisite for the generation of electron cyclotron maser emission and ( 2 ) accelerate electrons into these density cavities that adiabatically evolve along field lines of increasing strength to form an unstable ` horseshoe ' or ` shell ' distribution @xcite , providing the free energy to power the maser emission . emission in the r - x mode perpendicular to the magnetic field in the source region is favoured , resulting in emission of opposite polarity from magnetic polar regions of opposite polarity . a similar model was proposed by @xcite to account for the radio emission detected from ultracool dwarfs , now confirmed to be the case with the detection of periodic 100% circularly polarized bursts from tvlm 513 . the means by which the stable magnetic field aligned electric fields are generated and maintained in the magnetosphere of tvlm 513 remains unclear . we rule out the interaction of the magnetosphere with a stellar wind from a coronally active star , the means by which a large fraction of planetary maser emission is powered , as high resolution adaptive optics observations of tvlm 513 have found no evidence of a physical companion @xcite . it is also unlikely that a close - in orbital companion is responsible , as is the case for the component of jupiter s maser emission associated with the jupiter - io electrodynamic circuit . the narrow duty cycle bursts detected from tvlm 513 are tightly locked in phase with rotation of the dwarf and hence are not in corotation with an orbital companion . we can assert therefore that the stable electric fields are somehow generated and sustained within the magnetosphere of the ultracool dwarf . it is worth noting that the rapid rotation of jupiter is also thought to be an efficient source of electron acceleration for a component of the non - io related maser emission and a similar scenario may be applicable to tvlm 513 .", "electron cyclotron maser radiation is emitted at the electron cyclotron frequency denoted by @xmath21 hz , where b is the magnetic field strength in the radio emission source region . it has been proposed that emission at the secondary harmonic may dominate where radiation generated at the fundamental electron cyclotron frequency can not escape due to gyroharmonic absorption by thermal plasma , for example , in the case of maser emission generated at the base of magnetic flux tubes in the solar corona @xcite . however , thermal plasma density is expected to be much lower in the density cavities located at the magnetic polar regions of tvlm 513 than at the base of the solar corona , and therefore optical depth at the secondary harmonic layer should also be much smaller than derived for the solar case . @xcite also note that growth at the fundamental is extremely efficient limiting the energy available for growth at higher harmonics . importantly , measurements by the fast satellite at earth and the ulysses probe at jupiter have directly confirmed that planetary electron cyclotron maser emission is almost entirely generated at the fundamental frequency . therefore , emission at the fundamental frequency is strongly favoured for the bursts of electron cyclotron maser emission detected from tvlm 513 . we can thus derive the field strength at the source of the 8.44 ghz bursts detected from tvlm 513 to be @xmath22 kg , confirming the estimate of @xcite . these high magnetic field strengths , which can also be attributed to other ultracool dwarfs previously detected at radio frequencies including a number of bona fide brown dwarfs , are of the same order as those confirmed for the most magnetically active dme flare stars @xcite . @xcite have recently directly measured the magnetic field strengths of a number of ultracool dwarfs confirming that magnetic flux is indeed maintained at the lower end of the main sequence .    the extremely high stability in phase of the narrow duty cycle , 100% circularly polarized bursts detected from tvlm 513 , coupled with the detection of bursts at both 4.88 and 8.44 ghz , confirm that these high strength magnetic fields are in a large - scale , stable configuration . this is further supported by the periodic signal detected in the i band photometric data ( fig . 2 ) , which is stable in phase and amplitude for the duration of the 4 night monitoring campaign , consistent with the presence of high strength , fixed magnetic field regions at the stellar photosphere ( lane et al .  in preparation ) . multiple bursts of both left and right 100% circularly polarized emission , which originate in regions of opposite magnetic polarity , are confined to the same range of phase of rotation of the dwarf ( @xmath23 , fig . 3 ) , indicating the probable presence of a dipolar component to this large - scale magnetic field . periodic bursts are detected when the axis of this dipolar field lies in the plane of the sky , which occurs twice per period of rotation of the dwarf . this model requires the dipolar field to be tilted relative to the rotation axis of the dwarf .", "electron cyclotron maser emission generated at the poles of a large - scale magnetic field may be a ubiquitous source of radio emission from planets , brown dwarfs and very low mass stars . @xcite and @xcite have also proposed that electron cyclotron maser emission originating in the polar regions of a large - scale magnetic field may be a source of radio emission from coronally active stars , particularly dme flare stars . the recent magnetic mapping of a rapidly rotating m4 dwarf has revealed the presence of a dipolar component , confirming that such stars can indeed possess large - scale , stable magnetic fields @xcite . in light of the observed behaviour of tvlm 513 we note that many of the coherent bursts detected from stellar sources , particularly dme flare stars , might not be transient flare events but rather may be due to the beaming of persistent electron cyclotron maser emission coupled with rotation of the star . periodicity may have gone undetected for higher mass stars as they have much longer periods of rotation than ultracool dwarfs @xcite , making it difficult to directly associate coherent flares with a particular phase of rotation .    in light of the sharp drop observed in the levels of h@xmath2 and x - ray emission for late m , l and t dwarfs , the electron cyclotron maser may prove a vital diagnostic tool for remote sensing of plasma conditions and magnetic field strengths and topologies in the mass gap between planets and stars . previous radio surveys have been undertaken of a volume limited sample of ultracool dwarfs in the solar neighborhood , resulting in an overall detection rate of @xmath24 @xcite . however , these surveys were conducted solely at a frequency of 8.44 ghz , important when considering that electron cyclotron maser emission is characterized by an upper cut - off frequency associated with the maximum magnetic field strength in the magnetosphere of the dwarf . a detection at 8.44 ghz requires magnetic field strengths of at least 3 kg . therefore a much larger fraction of these objects with maximum field strengths below this value , particularly lower mass l and t dwarfs , may be detectable sources at lower frequencies . we highlight the recent observation of periodic bursts of coherent emission from an unknown source towards the galactic center , gcrt j1745 - 3009 @xcite , at a frequency of 330 mhz , as the possible detection of an as yet unidentified cool , dim brown dwarf or extrasolar planet in the solar neighborhood . in particular , the period of 1.28 hours observed for the bursts from gcrt j1745 - 3009 compares favourably with the period of 0.98 hours observed for the bursts detected at 4.88 ghz from tvlm 513 , and the bursts have only been detected in @xmath25 of the time spent on source thus far @xcite , indicating long - term activity variation similar to that observed for tvlm 513 . we gratefully acknowledge the support of the hea funded cosmogrid project , the irish

inelastic scattering ( dis ) , the presently available data sets of inclusive and semi - inclusive dis are still not sufficient to accurately fix the spin - dependent parton distributions @xmath1 of the nucleons , in particular they hardly constrain the gluon density @xmath2 [ 1 - 3 ] . even less satisfactory is the situation for the @xmath3 , the parton distributions of longitudinally ( more precisely , circularly ) polarized photons , where nothing at all is known experimentally .    in past years , hera has already been very successful in pinning down the proton s unpolarized gluon distribution @xmath4 from observations of scaling violations in increasingly accurate @xmath5 measurements and from several exclusive processes such as jet , large-@xmath6 hadron , and heavy flavour production . moreover , since the bulk of the hera events originates from the photoproduction region ( @xmath7 ) , ` resolved ' processes have been measured , in which the ( quasi - real ) photon interacts not only in a ` direct ' ( ` point - like ' ) way but resolves into its hadronic structure . these hera measurements [ 4 - 13 ] have been precise enough to improve not only our knowledge about the parton content of the unpolarized proton , but even about that of the photon , @xmath8 .    given the success of such unpolarized photoproduction experiments at hera , it seems to be quite natural to closely examine the same processes also for the situation with longitudinally polarized beams , in order to determine their sensitivity to @xmath2 _ and _ @xmath9 . in preceding studies @xcite we have already analyzed jet and heavy flavour production , with the latter turning out to be less useful at collider energies . here we reanalyze in detail the whole range of conceivable photoproduction processes , covering this time also single - inclusive charged hadron , prompt photon , and drell - yan dimuon production . our previous results for single - inclusive jet production are extended towards the largest values of the laboratory rapidity @xmath10 which should be experimentally accessible . at large @xmath10 one finds an improved sensitivity to @xmath11 . in the case of dijet production we study an additional , less exclusive , kinematic selection ( as compared to our previous analysis ) . this selection allows jets to be measured at higher transverse energies without loss of statistics , and is also more suited to eventual next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd calculations . it should be stressed that hera could play a unique role in the determination of the parton content of polarized photons even if it should succeed in establishing only the very existence of a resolved contribution to polarized photon - proton reactions . other determinations of the @xmath11 , for instance , via a measurement of the photon s spin - dependent structure function @xmath12 in polarized @xmath13 collisions , are not planned in the near future and in case of future lepton - nucleon fixed - target photoproduction experiments such as compass @xcite , the resolved component is too small to be extracted experimentally @xcite . our previous results , as well as most of those presented here , are based only on leading order ( lo ) qcd parton level calculations . of course , in real jet production processes , initial and final state qcd radiation , as well as non - perturbative effects such as hadronization are also present . these lead to multiparticle final states , and necessitate the use of a jet algorithm to recombine the final - state particles into jets . the details of the final - state and the jet algorithm used can in practice lead to significant differences with respect to the parton level results . in general at hera for jets of the energies considered here , these effects are larger than the smearing introduced by detector resolutions ( see , for example @xcite ) . in order to investigate the impact of such effects on the measurement of asymmetries at a polarized hera , we use a monte carlo simulation , sphinx @xcite , which includes the polarized matrix elements for jet photoproduction . here we limit ourselves to the case of dijet production which is the only process that provides a clean separation of the ` resolved ' part of the cross section , as will be discussed later . nevertheless , we expect similar hadronization effects also for single - inclusive jet or hadron production . our contribution is organized as follows : in the next section we collect the necessary ingredients for our calculations . section 3 is devoted to a discussion of the various conceivable photoproduction processes , namely inclusive jet , inclusive hadron , heavy flavour , prompt photon , and dimuon production . section 4 contains a more detailed investigation of dijet production including our monte carlo studies . finally , section 5 presents the conclusions .", "even though all recent analyses of polarized dis [ 1 - 3,17 ] have been carried out at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy , we have to stick to lo calculations throughout this work since the nlo corrections to polarized photoproduction processes are not yet known ( except for prompt photon production @xcite and the ` direct ' part of single - inclusive hadron production @xcite ) . this implies use of lo parton distributions , which have been provided in the studies of @xcite where various sets , mainly differing in the @xmath14-shape of the polarized gluon distribution , were presented .    to study the physics potential of hera for pinning down @xmath2 in photoproduction processes we will choose four very different lo sets which represent to a good extent the presently large uncertainty in @xmath2 . one should keep in mind that all these sets provide very good descriptions of the present polarized dis data . for definiteness we will take the lo ` standard ' set of the radiative parton model analysis @xcite , which corresponds to the best - fit result of that paper , along with two other ` extreme ' sets of @xcite which are based on either assuming @xmath15 or @xmath16 at the low input scale @xmath17 of @xcite , where @xmath18 is the unpolarized lo grv @xcite input gluon distribution . in the following these two sets will be referred to as ` @xmath19 input ' and ` @xmath20 input ' scenarios , respectively . the gluon of set c of @xcite , henceforth denoted as ` gs c ' , is qualitatively different as it has a substantial negative polarization at large @xmath14 . we will therefore also use this set in our calculations . for illustration , we show in fig .  1 the gluon distributions of the four different sets of parton distributions we will use , taking a typical scale @xmath21 . we have also plotted the unpolarized grv lo gluon distribution in fig .  1 , in order to demonstrate that the spin asymmetry for any process sensitive to the gluon is likely to be very small _ if _ it gets sizeable contributions from the region of small @xmath22 . this observation has implications for the kinematical cuts we will choose in our phenomenological studies to be presented in the next sections .    in the case of photoproduction the electron just serves as a source of quasi - real photons which are radiated according to the weizscker - williams spectrum @xcite . the photons can then interact either directly or via their partonic structure ( ` resolved ' contribution ) . for a longitudinally polarized electron beam , the resulting photon will be also longitudinally ( circularly ) polarized and , in the resolved case , the _ polarized _ parton distributions @xmath3 of the photon enter the calculations . the @xmath23 are completely unmeasured so far , so that models for them have to be invoked . to obtain a realistic estimate for the theoretical uncertainties in the polarized photonic parton densities two very different scenarios were considered in @xcite assuming ` maximal ' ( @xmath24 ) or ` minimal ' ( @xmath25 ) saturation of the fundamental positivity constraints ( similar to the case of nucleons ) latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : pos }    scale @xmath17 for the qcd evolution . here @xmath17 and the unpolarized photon structure functions @xmath27 were adopted from the phenomenologically successful radiative parton model predictions in @xcite . the results of these two extreme approaches are presented in fig . 2 in terms of the photonic parton asymmetries @xmath28 , evolved to @xmath29 in lo . an ideal aim of measurements in a polarized collider mode of hera would of course be to determine the @xmath11 and to see which ansatz is more realistic . the sets presented in fig .  2 , which we will use in what follows , should in any case be sufficient to study the sensitivity of the various cross sections to the @xmath11 , but also to see how far they influence a determination of @xmath2 .", "let us now turn to some technical preliminaries required for our analyses . first of all , it is useful to define the effective polarized parton densities at a scale @xmath30 in the longitudinally polarized electron by for the direct ( ` unresolved ' ) case . ] @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , where @xmath33 is the polarized weizscker - williams spectrum for which we will use @xmath34 \\ln \\frac{q^2_{max } ( 1-y)}{m_e^2 y^2 } \\ ; , \\ ] ] with the electron mass @xmath35 . for the time being , it seems most sensible to follow as closely as possible the analyses successfully performed in the unpolarized case , which implies to introduce the same kinematical cuts . as in @xcite we will use an upper cut is used along with slightly different @xmath36-cuts as compared to the corresponding zeus measurements @xcite , which leads to smaller rates . ] @xmath37 , and the @xmath36-cuts @xmath38 ( for single - jet @xcite and heavy flavour @xcite production ) and @xmath39 ( for dijet @xcite , inclusive hadron @xcite , prompt photon @xcite and drell - yan dimuon production ) will be imposed . furthermore , it should be noted that in what follows a polarized cross section will always be defined as @xmath40 the signs denoting the helicities of the scattering particles . the corresponding unpolarized cross section @xmath41 is obtained by taking the sum instead , and the experimentally relevant cross section asymmetry is @xmath42 . whenever calculating an asymmetry @xmath43 , we will use the lo grv parton distributions for the proton @xcite and the photon @xcite to calculate the unpolarized cross section . for consistency , we will employ the lo expression for the strong coupling @xmath44 with @xcite @xmath45 mev for four active flavours . rapidity distributions will always be presented in terms of the laboratory frame rapidity @xmath10 which is related to the centre - of - mass @xmath46 via @xmath47 as conventional for hera , @xmath10 is defined to be positive in the proton forward direction . studying distributions in @xmath10 is a particularly suitable way of separating the direct from the resolved contributions in single - inclusive measurements of jets or hadrons : for negative @xmath10 , the main contributions are expected to come from the region @xmath48 and thus mostly from the direct piece at @xmath49 . the situation is reversed at positive @xmath10 .    in the asymmetry plots we will always show the expected statistical errors @xmath50 for a measurement at hera , estimated from @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 are the beam polarizations , @xmath54 is the integrated luminosity and @xmath55 the detection efficiency for the desired final state . for all our calculations we assume @xmath56 and a conservative value of @xmath57/pb . for this process we can be rather brief , as all details of the calculation were already described in our previous report @xcite . here we only present updated plots of the cross sections and their asymmetries , extending to larger , but still experimentally accessible , values of @xmath10 . 3 shows our results for the single - inclusive jet cross section and its asymmetry vs.  @xmath10 and integrated over @xmath58 gev for the four sets of the polarized proton s parton distributions . for figs . 3a , b we have used the ` maximally ' saturated set of polarized photonic parton densities , whereas figs . 3c , d correspond to the ` minimally ' saturated one . comparison of figs . 3a , c or 3b , d shows that as expected the direct contribution clearly dominates for @xmath59 , where also differences between the polarized gluon distributions of the proton show up clearly . furthermore , the cross sections are generally large in this region with asymmetries of a few per cent . at positive @xmath10 , in particular in the region @xmath60 now included in the plot , we find that the cross section is dominated by the resolved contribution . here it is sensitive to the parton content of both the polarized proton _ and _ the photon , which means that one can only learn something about the polarized photon structure functions if the polarized parton distributions of the proton are already known to some accuracy , e.g. , from an analysis of the region of negative rapidities . we note that the dominant contributions to the resolved part at large @xmath10 are driven by the polarized photonic _ gluon _ distribution @xmath61 . we have included in the asymmetry plots in figs . 3b , d the expected statistical errors @xmath50 at hera estimated from eq . ( [ eq : errors ] ) for @xmath62 . from the results it appears that a measurement of the proton s @xmath2 should be possible from single - jet events at negative rapidities where the contamination from the resolved contribution is minimal .      from our results for one - jet production in fig . 3 it seems worthwhile to consider also single - inclusive production of charged hadrons . at first glance , this process appears less interesting than jet production , as the cross section for producing a definite hadron at a given @xmath6 will always be smaller than the one for a jet . on the other hand , in case of inclusive hadrons one can obviously go experimentally to @xmath6 much smaller than the @xmath63 gev employed in our single jet study . moreover , in the unpolarized case single - inclusive hadron production was successfully studied experimentally at hera prior to jets @xcite . the generic lo cross section formula for the photoproduction of a single hadron @xmath64 with transverse momentum @xmath6 and cms - rapidity @xmath65 in polarized @xmath0 collisions reads : @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes a convolution and the sum is running over all appropriate @xmath68 subprocesses for the direct ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) and resolved ( @xmath71 ) cases . these subprocesses are the same as the ones for jet production . in ( [ eq : wqc ] ) , @xmath72 and @xmath30 is the factorization / renormalization scale for which we will use @xmath73 as for our jet calculations . the @xmath74 stand for the polarized parton distributions of the proton , and the @xmath75 are the unpolarized fragmentation functions for @xmath76 . for the latter we will use the lo functions of @xcite which yield a good description of the unpolarized hera inclusive hadron data @xcite . needless to say that we obtain the corresponding unpolarized lo jet cross section @xmath77 by using lo unpolarized parton distributions and subprocess cross sections in ( [ eq : wqc ] ) .    figs . 4a , b show our results for the sum of charged pions and kaons after integration over @xmath78 gev , where all other parameters were chosen exactly as for figs . one can see that the spin asymmetries behave rather similarly in shape as the corresponding results in figs . 3a , b , but are somewhat smaller in magnitude mainly due to the smaller @xmath14 values probed here for @xmath79 gev compared to the single jet case where @xmath63 gev ( see also fig .  1 ) . nevertheless , the expected statistical errors , calculated for the realistic choice of @xmath80 in eq . ( [ eq : errors ] ) and displayed in fig . 4b , d , demonstrate that single - inclusive hadron photoproduction is also a very promising candidate . we finally mention that apart from charged - hadron production we have also studied the photoproduction of @xmath81 baryons . this is another particularly interesting topic , as it turns out to be possible experimentally to determine the polarization of the produced @xmath81 s from their parity - violating decays to @xmath82 . this implies that a measurement of the spin asymmetry in this case could allow statements concerning the _ spin - dependent _ fragmentation functions of the @xmath81 , hereby possibly providing some complementary new insight into ` spin - physics ' . encouraging theoretical predictions for photoproduction of @xmath81 s are also presented in these proceedings @xcite . heavy flavour ( charm ) production was already considered in our previous report @xcite , where we found expected statistical errors roughly of the size of the spin asymmetry itself . this process , albeit being very sensitive to @xmath2 thanks to the dominance of the photon - gluon - fusion subprocess @xmath83 , appears therefore less favourable than the ones considered in the previous subsections . it is expected to be more useful for fixed - target experiments , where measurements of @xmath2 in open - charm production are planned @xcite . prompt photon production at hera is currently under investigation in the unpolarized case @xcite . here important contributions at lo result , for instance , from the subprocess @xmath84 , with the initial quark coming from the resolved photon and the gluon from the proton , or vice versa . this process , which is therefore sensitive to @xmath2 in the polarized case , has to compete with @xmath85 annihilation and with the compton process @xmath86 from the direct ( unresolved ) photon . we found that the main problem of prompt photon production is the smallness of the unpolarized cross section ( with respect to , say , the single - inclusive hadron cross section ) , which results in large expected statistical errors , @xmath87 . the experimental study of prompt photon production at a polarized hera thus appears to be impossible . finally , we have also examined photoproduction of drell - yan dimuon pairs . this process is of potential interest due to the fact that the relevant lo subprocess is simply @xmath88 , which means for the case of photoproduction that only the resolved contribution is present at lo . the experimental finding of a nonvanishing asymmetry would therefore be evidence for the existence of polarized ( anti)quarks in a polarized real photon . unfortunately , again the expected statistical errors turn out to be way larger than the asymmetry itself due to the smallness of the unpolarized cross section .", "in the case of unpolarized photoproduction of dijets at hera , an experimental criterion for a distinction between direct and resolved contributions has been introduced @xcite . in our previous analysis @xcite , we have adopted this criterion for the polarized case to see whether it would enable a further access to @xmath2 and/or the polarized photon structure functions . very encouraging results were obtained . however , the results presented in @xcite were based on lo qcd parton level calculations . one implication of this is that , although the kinematic cuts applied to jets in @xcite reflect the cuts which have been used in experimental analyses , the ` jets ' to which they are applied consist of single quarks or gluons . in a real event , higher order effects such as qcd radiation ( in the initial and final state ) and non - perturbative effects such as hadronization are also present . these lead to multiparticle final states , and necessitate the use of a jet algorithm to recombine the final state particles into jets . the jet kinematics should then reflect the kinematics of the initiating parton . however , the details of the final state and the jet algorithm used can in practice lead to significant differences with respect to the parton level predictions . in general , at hera these effects are larger than smearing introduced by detector resolutions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this section , we will therefore present a more sophisticated analysis of dijet production that includes these additional effects , as modelled in the monte carlo simulation mentioned in the introduction . among all our results , the ones presented in this section are therefore the ` most realistic ' ones . we expect the typical size of the effects from hadronization and qcd radiation found here to be representative for all other photoproduction processes considered in this work .      to begin with , let us briefly recall the underlying idea for the separation of direct and resolved contributions @xcite . the generic expression for the polarized cross section for the photoproduction of two jets with laboratory system rapidities @xmath89 , @xmath90 is to lo @xmath91 where @xmath6 is the transverse momentum of one of the two jets ( which balance each other in lo ) and @xmath92 the important point is that measurement of the jet rapidities allows for fully reconstructing the kinematics of the underlying hard subprocess and thus for determining the variable @xcite @xmath93 which in lo equals @xmath94 , with @xmath36 as before being the fraction of the electron s energy taken by the photon . thus it becomes possible to experimentally select events at large @xmath95 , @xmath96 @xcite , hereby extracting the _ direct _ contribution to the cross section with a relatively small contamination from resolved processes . conversely , the events with @xmath97 will represent the resolved part of the cross section . this procedure should therefore be ideal to extract @xmath2 on the one hand , and to examine the polarized photon structure functions on the other .      in order to investigate the impact of effects from hadronization on the measurement of spin asymmetries at a polarized hera , a monte carlo simulation , sphinx @xcite , has been used . sphinx is based upon the general purpose library of monte carlo routines , pythia @xcite .    as used in this analysis , the program generates hard scatterings according to the lo qcd matrix element , in addition it includes initial and final state qcd radiation calculated to leading logarithmic accuracy in @xmath98 . the parton shower evolves from the scale of the hard interaction down to @xmath99 . below this scale , the further evolution is considered to be non - perturbative , and the lund string model is used to hadronize the ( in general many ) partons . the additional feature of sphinx as compared to pythia is that it includes the polarized matrix elements for jet photoproduction , as well as implementing the various different polarized parton distributions ( for the proton and photon ) discussed previously . thus the simulation of asymmetries in realistic final states is possible . however , the polarization information is only used in the hard subprocess . the parton showers and fragmentation stages do not preserve a memory of the polarization . sphinx / pythia use @xmath6 for the hard scale of the interaction , which is the relative transverse momentum of the scattered partons . events were generated down to a minimum @xmath6 of @xmath100 .    as a case study , @xmath101 of luminosity was generated for direct and resolved photoproduction for four options , using the gs c parton distribution for the proton and the maximally and minimally saturated distributions for the photon ( 36 million events in total ) . this leaves a pessimistic ( or conservative ) estimate of the statistical errors which might eventually be obtained , but is sufficient to show whether or not the migrations between parton and hadron level might preserve observable asymmetries . most measurements of jet cross sections at hadron - hadron colliders and in photoproduction at hera have used some variation of a cone - based jet algorithm . these algorithms maximize the transverse energy inside a cone in @xmath102 space . they are invariant under boosts along the beam axis , and successfully isolate ` hard ' physics which in hadron - hadron or photon - hadron interactions is generally at large transverse energies with respect to the beam axis . however , they suffer from various ambiguities in how jet finding is initiated in the first place and in how jets are merged or split , and are in general not infrared safe @xcite .    in this analysis the cluster algorithm ktclus @xcite is therefore used . in this algorithm , the quantity @xmath103 is calculated for each pair of objects ( where the initial objects are the final state particles ) , and for each individual object : @xmath104 if , of all the numbers @xmath105 , @xmath106 is the smallest , then objects @xmath107 and @xmath108 are combined into a single new object . if however @xmath109 is the smallest , then object @xmath107 is a jet and is removed from the sample . this is repeated until all objects are assigned to jets . the parameters for the jet are calculated as : @xmath110 in which the sums run over all particles belonging to the jet . this scheme is also used to determine the parameters of the intermediate objects . in this scheme ktclus retains the advantages of cone algorithms , without suffering from their associated problems . this algorithm has now been used in more recent experimental analyses ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . we first compare the monte carlo results with the predictions presented in our previous study . for this purpose we integrate over the cross section in ( [ eq : wq2jet ] ) to obtain @xmath111 , where @xmath112 . furthermore , we will apply the cuts @xcite @xmath113 . the results are shown in fig . the left hand column shows the @xmath114 distribution for @xmath115 , and for @xmath116 with the ` maximally ' and ` minimally ' saturated sets of polarized photonic parton distributions , reading from top to bottom , respectively . the right hand column shows the corresponding asymmetries . the bin widths are chosen to be commensurate with the experimental resolution , rather than being optimized for the size of the statistical sample shown here . in the high @xmath117 case ( @xmath118 ) , the agreement with the parton level predictions is generally good in both the cross section and the asymmetry . the exception is at very forward rapidities ( @xmath119 ) where the parton level cross section is very small and the behaviour of the dijet asymmetry is dominated by the effects of high @xmath117 resolved contributions and the migration of lo direct jets towards high @xmath65 due to the presence of the proton remnant ( to which they are colour - connected ) . nevertheless , overall the prospects for an independent , direct constraint on the polarized parton distributions in the proton by this method appear to be good . in the equally interesting low @xmath117 case ( @xmath120 ) , the agreement is not as good , although it is still reasonable . in particular , the minimally saturated case clearly still shows lower asymmetries than the maximally saturated one , and is in fact consistent with zero for this luminosity . in the unpolarized case , the above cross sections were proposed following arguments based upon lo qcd @xcite , but have since been calculated to nlo @xcite . in the course of these calculations , it was discovered that soft gluon radiation leads to difficulties when the @xmath121 threshold is the same for both jets at nlo , and so subsequent measurements have concentrated on cases where a different threshold is applied to each jet . we study here an example of such a cross section . in this case we demand that there must be two jets with @xmath122 gev , as before , but that at least one of them must have @xmath123 gev . the jets are then symmetrized in @xmath65 . the measured cross sections are then @xmath124 for one jet , where the other jet is required to be either ` backward ' ( @xmath125 ) , ` central ' ( @xmath126 ) , or ` forward ' ( @xmath127 ) . the cross sections are measured for the two regions , @xmath115 and @xmath128 . the @xmath129 cut is removed . in the lo calculations shown here , which are currently all that is available for such cross sections in the polarized case , both jets of course have the same @xmath121 anyway , and so both have @xmath123 gev . however , in the mc there is smearing due to the additional effects which can lead to jets having different @xmath121 . the results are shown in fig . 6 ( asymmetries ) and 7 ( cross sections ) . again in the high @xmath117 case the agreement is good . in the low @xmath117 case , the asymmetries are in general lower than in the parton level case , and indeed are consistent with zero for the minimally saturated photonic parton distributions . however , there is still a measurable non - zero asymmetry in the maximally saturated case . the bins widths in these results are dictated by the statistics .", "we have analyzed various conceivable photoproduction experiments in the context of a polarized @xmath0-collider mode of hera . leading order theory predictions for jet and single - inclusive hadron production show a very encouraging sensitivity to the polarized gluon distribution of the proton and also to the completely unknown parton content of a circularly polarized photon . in particular , it turns out that for these processes the differences between results obtained for different sets of polarized parton distributions are usually clearly larger than the expected statistical errors for a measurement at polarized hera , even for a rather conservative luminosity of 100/pb . in contrast to this , the experimental study of photoproduction of heavy flavours , prompt photons and drell - yan dimuon pairs at a polarized hera appears impossible .    in the very promising case of dijet photoproduction which allows for a separation of the ` direct ' and ` resolved ' contributions on an experimental basis , we have investigated the impact of parton showering , hadronization and jet finding on the parton level results , which is a crucial ingredient for making contact between theoretical estimates based on lo parton level calculations and the ` real world ' . we have found that although the combined effects of hadronization and qcd radiation can be significant , measurable asymmetries are preserved . thus the prospects both of obtaining an independent constraint on the polarized parton distributions in the proton , and of observing for the first time a possible asymmetry in those of the photon seem excellent , even with relatively limited integrated luminosity .    finally , it should be again stressed that hera could be _ the _ place to obtain at least some experimental information on the presently completely unmeasured parton distributions of a longitudinally polarized photon in the foreseeable future . most of the various photoproduction processes studied here appear to be promising and experimentally feasible to achieve this aim even with a conservative luminosity of 100/pb . 999 m.  glck , e.  reya , m.  stratmann , and w.  vogelsang , _ phys . * d53 * ( 1996 ) 4775 . t.  gehrmann and w.j . stirling , _ phys . rev . _ * d53 * ( 1996 ) 6100 . d.  de florian , talk presented at the workshop ` deep inelastic scattering off polarized targets : theory meets experiment ' , zeuthen , germany , 1997 , to appear in the proceedings ; m.  stratmann , ibid . i.  abt et al . , h1 collab . , _ phys . lett . _ * b314 * ( 1993 ) 436 ; c.  adloff et al . , h1 collab . , desy 97 -

symmetric phase , which would also suggest the bubble should expand ( assuming the solution at this time of symmetry still belongs to the family presented in @xcite ) . recently however , a numerical study was presented  @xcite which computed explicitly the solution to the future of the initial , time - symmetric , initial data . in the negative mass case , the solution found appeared to indicate a very puzzling development . namely , that as the bubble expanded , it would encounter a naked singularity on its way .    in the present work we reexamine the dynamical behavior of the data presented in @xcite via numerical simulations , and further study a more general case where the initial data describes an initially collapsing bubble with negative mass . we restrict our simulations to the context of homogeneous spherically symmetric spacetimes . to summarize our findings , we see that negative mass bubbles will not lead to a naked singularity . by choosing different members of the initial data family , these could start out either expanding or collapsing . in the former case , the bubble continues on expanding while in the latter case , the bubble bounces back without ever collapsing . we additionally study the case of a positive mass bubble which starts out collapsing . here , depending on the strength of the gauge field at the initial hypersurface , the bubble collapses to a black string or bounces back to expand `` forever '' ( i.e. for as long as we let the simulation run ) . furthermore , these two distinct possibilities give rise to critical behavior on the threshold of collapse or expansion .", "we consider a generalization of the time symmetric family of initial data presented in @xcite . we start with a spacetime endowed with the metric @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the standard metric on the unit two - sphere @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a smooth function that has a regular root at some @xmath4 , is everywhere positive for @xmath5 and converges to one as @xmath6 . the coordinate @xmath7 parametrizes the extra dimension @xmath8 which has the period @xmath9 . the resulting spacetime @xmath10 constitutes a regular manifold with the topology @xmath11 . the bubble is located where the circumference of the extra dimension shrinks to zero , that is , at @xmath12 . additionally , we consider the presence of a * u(1 ) * gauge field in the following form , @xmath13 with @xmath14 an arbitrary constant and @xmath15 an integer greater than one . it is important to point out two things . first , the gauge field here considered has a more generic dependence than those previously considered in @xcite , where only the case @xmath16 was discussed . second , the symmetries of the problem would a priori allow for the gauge field to have non - trivial @xmath17 and @xmath18 components . however , it follows from maxwell s equations that those contributions would lead to a coulomb - like electric field which is divergent at the location of the bubble . for this reason we set those components of @xmath19 to zero .    in the time - symmetric case , initial data satisfying the hamiltonian constraint obeys @xmath20 where @xmath21 . the parameter @xmath22 is related to the adm mass via @xmath23 . the fact that the bubble be located at @xmath12 requires that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 . we also require @xmath28 and avoid the conical singularity at @xmath12 by fixing the period of @xmath7 to @xmath9 . repeating the analysis in @xcite one finds that the initial acceleration of the bubble area is given by @xmath29 . \\label{eq : ddota}\\ ] ] for @xmath16 this agrees with the formula found by corley and jacobson , and as they discussed , for negative mass bubbles , the initial acceleration is positive , and only if chosen appropriately can a positive mass bubble have negative initial acceleration . as we will see later , in the vacuum case , this acceleration remains negative leading to a collapse of the bubble and the formation of a black string . in the non - vacuum case however , the strength of the gauge field can modify this behavior completely . for weak enough @xmath14 the bubble continues to collapse whereas when @xmath14 is large the bubble area bounces back and expands . furthermore , by fine - tuning the parameter @xmath14 we will show that the solution approaches a static bubble solution to the five - dimensional einstein - maxwell equations . we also consider non - vacuum initial data with @xmath30 which allow for richer scenarios . a particularly interesting case is that describing an initially negative acceleration with negative mass . if this were possible , and the bubble continued to collapse , this would likely give rise to a naked singularity . thus , we are interested in data for which @xmath31 . in view of the inequality ( [ eq : reghor ] ) and eq . ( [ eq : ddota ] ) this means that @xmath32 from this we see that for @xmath33 the mass can only be positive . in contrast to this , for @xmath30 and @xmath34 large enough such that @xmath35 , negative mass bubbles can be considered .", "a detailed description of the numerical techniques used in our code will be presented elsewhere @xcite . here we point out its salient features .    1 . the equations are written in first oder symmetric hyperbolic form , with a gauge choice that is such that the characteristic speeds are given by @xmath36 , @xmath37 or @xmath38 . these properties facilitate achieving a stable implementation of the equations . regularity conditions are enforced at the bubble and employed to design a numerical scheme that satisfies a discrete energy estimate @xcite . this discrete energy estimate guarantees numerical stability for a related toy model problem . constraint preserving boundary conditions are enforced at the outer boundary to ensure no constraint violating modes are fed through it  @xcite . the equations are implemented using second order accurate finite difference techniques . a non - uniform radial coordinate is employed to improve the resolution near the bubble . for all cases presented here , the radial grid covered @xmath39 $ ] with a total of @xmath40 points . the outer boundary s location is chosen so as to have _ always _ less than a crossing time in our evolutions , guaranteeing outer boundary conditions ( though consistent with the constraints ) will not affect quantities at the bubble . second order convergence is checked in all runs . as an example , the convergence of some of the simulations representing expanding bubbles is illustrated in fig . [ fig : conv1 ] . similar behavior is observed in all cases .", "here we evolve the brill - horowitz initial data in the case of vanishing gauge field . the bubble area @xmath42 as a function of the proper time @xmath43 at the bubble is shown in fig . [ fig : area ] for different values of the mass parameter @xmath22 . ( figure [ fig : conv1 ] illustrates the convergence of the solution throughout the evolution ) . as expected , the lower the mass of the initial configuration , the faster the expansion . empirically , and for the parameter ranges used in our runs , we found that at late times the expansion rate is given by @xmath44 where a dot denotes the derivative with respect to proper time @xmath43 . in particular this approximation is valid for the bubble solution exhibited by witten @xcite which describes the time evolution in the case @xmath45 . we monitored several curvature invariant quantities ( the kretschmann invariant in particular ) for our numerical spacetimes and found no sign of divergence . next , we analyze the brill - horowitz initial data for the case in which the bubble is initially collapsing ( notice that for @xmath16 this implies that the adm mass is positive ) . while our numerical simulations reveal that in the absence of the gauge field such a bubble continues to collapse , we also show that when the gauge field is strong enough , the bubble shrinks at a rate which decreases with time and then bounces back . obviously , if the collapse trend were not halted , a singularity should form at the origin . since the adm mass is positive , one expects this singularity to be hidden behind an event horizon , and one should obtain a black string . in fact , for the solutions which are initially collapsing and which have vanishing gauge field , we observe the formation of an apparent horizon . furthermore , we compute the curvature invariant quantity @xmath46 at the apparent horizon ( as discussed in @xcite ) , where @xmath47 is the kretschmann invariant and @xmath48 the areal radius of the horizon . for a neutral black string , this invariant is @xmath49 . figure [ fig : blackstring ] shows how this value is attained after the apparent horizon forms for representative vacuum cases ( with @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) , thus providing strong evidence for the formation of a black string . ( we also find apparent horizons forming , or already present in the initial data , when a nontrivial gauge field is considered and the parameters are appropriately chosen . the corresponding bubbles will likely collapse to charged black strings and will be analyzed elsewhere  @xcite . ) +   +    as mentioned , for strong enough gauge fields , the previously described dynamics is severely affected . figure [ fig : criticalonset ] shows the bubble area vs. proper time for different values of @xmath14 . for large values of @xmath14 the bubble `` bounces '' back and expands while for small ones the bubble collapses . there is a natural transition region separating these two possibilities . tuning the value of @xmath14 one can reveal an associated critical phenomena , the ` critical solution ' being a member of the family of static solutions given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 . these solutions can be obtained by a double analytic expansion of the black hole solutions described by eqs . ( 2.13 ) and ( 2.15 ) of ref . @xcite followed by the transformations @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 . the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xmath60 are related to the period of the @xmath7 coordinate and to the adm mass via @xmath61 and @xmath62 . since these parameters are conserved throughout evolution , the initial data fixes the member of the static family the dynamical solution approaches to . details of the critical behavior exhibited by this system will be presented in  @xcite . +   +      we here restrict to cases with negative masses that start out collapsing . interestingly enough we find that even when starting with large initial negative accelerations , which in turn make the bubble shrink in size to very tiny values , it bounces back without ever collapsing into a naked singularity . as an example , fig . [ fig : notnakediii ] shows the bubble s area versus time for different values of @xmath15 and @xmath14 . the initially collapsing bubbles decrease in size in a noticeable way but this trend is halted and the bubbles bounce back and expand . although we have not found a simple law as that in eq . ( [ simplerelation ] ) , clearly the bubbles expand exponentially fast . therefore , it seems not to be possible to `` destroy '' the bubble and create a naked singularity . this situation is somewhat similar to the scenarios where one tries to `` destroy '' an extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole by attempting to drop into it a test particle with high charge to mass ratio . there , the electrostatic repulsion prevents the particle from entering the hole @xcite .", "we have performed numerical simulations to investigate the dynamics of spherically symmetric , homogeneous bubble spacetimes . these have revealed several interesting features .    in the vacuum case , negative mass bubbles do not form singularities , rather they continue on expanding and the asymptotic rate of expansion obeys the simple relation ( [ simplerelation ] ) . positive mass cases , as pointed out previously can start out either expanding or contracting . in the former case , they continue on expanding and its asymptotic rate obeys the same simple relation . for the collapsing case we have evidences that the bubble will collapse to a black string . it is interesting to note here that the ratio of a circle at infinity over the adm mass is given by @xmath63 since @xmath64 this value is always larger than that needed for the gregory - laflamme `` instability''@xcite . thus , a slight @xmath7-dependent perturbation of the scenario considered here could indeed give rise to a naked singularity . this would require infinite time to appear as shown in @xcite , but certainly would give rise to rich dynamics as illustrated in @xcite .    in the non - vacuum case , the presence of a gauge field gives rise to additional features . first , for the positive mass case , it can `` halt '' the collapse and subsequently induce an expansion . furthermore , by fine - tuning the strength of the field , the solution approaches a static bubble . this critical solution separates the collapsing bubbles ( which , likely , collapse to a charged black string ) from the one that expand at late times . in a subsequent paper  @xcite we will show that the dynamical behavior near the static bubble exhibits critical phenomena . note that clearly the solution does encounter another moment of time symmetry at the critical value . however , for field strengths larger than the critical one , this is not the case . the bubble bounces but the solution does not go through a time - symmetric phase . last , the gauge field can also make _ negative _ mass bubbles start out collapsing if its radial dependence is steeper than that originally considered in @xcite . intuitively this happens due to the contribution of the energy in the gauge field overcoming the repulsive gravitational effect of the negative mass bubble . however , as part of the field is radiated away , the collapse is halted and a subsequent expansion results . by choosing both the strength of the field or its radial dependence appropriately ( with @xmath65 ) , we could make the bubble start out collapsing at a very rapid rate . in these cases , the bubble shrinks to very small sizes but eventually bounces back without forming a naked singularity . we thank robert myers for calling this problem to our attention and for pointing out the influence a steeper radial dependence in the gauge field could have . additionally , we thank him and gary horowitz for many interesting discussions . we acknowlege the lsu gravity group for comments on the manuscript . we benefited from the hospitality of the kavli institute for theoretical physics . l.l . thanks the perimeter institute for theoretical physics for hospitality . this research was supported in part by the nsf under grant numbers nsf -

study for testing the quantum linearity . however , the collapse models can not be tested with neutrinos and the effect , stronger for neutral mesons , is still beyond experimental reach , while chiral molecules can offer valid candidates for testing collapse models @xcite . the most promising testing ground is offered by the spontaneous emission of radiation due to the particle interaction with the stochastic field which causes an enhancement of the energy expectation value . this implies , for a free charged particle , the emission of electromagnetic radiation . such a spontaneous radiation is not present in the standard quantum mechanics . a measurement of the emitted radiation rate thus makes it possible to obtain valuable information on the @xmath2 parameter of the collapse models . q. fu @xcite obtained , for the first time , an upper limit for @xmath2 based on this effect , using the radiation measured by a system of germanium detectors@xcite .    in this paper we present a more refined analysis of the x -

relativistic csl model , assuming that @xmath2 is an universal parameter , not depending on the particle mass , and it is given by @xcite :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 represents the electron mass , @xmath5 is the energy of the emitted photon , @xmath2 and @xmath6 are , respectively , the reduction rate parameter and the correlation length of the reduction model . the @xmath6 parameter value is taken to be @xmath7 . using the measured radiation rate obtained for an isolated germanium detector @xcite fu extracted the following upper limit for @xmath2 :    @xmath8 if the stochastic field is assumed to be coupled to the particle mass density ( mass proportional csl model ) ( see for example @xcite ) then the previous expression for the emission rate eqn .

( 2006 ) concludes : ( 1 ) large scale axisymmetric fields , in agreement with the observations ; ( 2 ) significant surface differential rotation , in contradiction with the observations . therefore understanding how the magnetic field is generated in the fully convective stars and what the field properties are is clearly important . the atmospheres of such ultracool , very low mass stars are predominantly cool , dense , and highly neutral , apparently precluding the build - up of magnetic stresses thought to provide magnetic heating . yet , detections of observational signatures commonly associated with magnetic activity in sun - like and fully convective stars @xcite suggest that the production mechanism is the same or nearly the same in very low mass stars as for low mass and sun - like stars . further study of the x - ray emissions @xcite and @xmath3 emissions @xcite is one way to delimit the properties of magnetic heating in very low mass stars and indirectly investigate the influence of the magnetic field . recent detections and studies of radio emission from ultracool dwarfs @xcite also offer us another important approach to understand the properties of magnetic fields in the fully convective stars , as the magnetic field is likely intimately involved in the production mechanism of the radio radiation from these objects .    in this paper , we present our radio observation of a sample of 8 ultracool dwarfs and the detection of the m8 binary lp  349 - 25 using the very large array . in  2 we present the observation and the data reduction , the properties of the radio emission from lp  349 - 25 are given in   3 , we discuss radio emission from lp  349 - 25 particularly and its radio mechanism in   4 .", "we selected a sample of nearby ultracool field dwarfs with spectral types ranging over a narrow band of m8l0 since 5 of 9 ultracool dwarfs detected at radio wavelengths are m8m9.5 dwarfs , giving a significant fraction of @xmath456% ( see table  1 in @xcite and references therein ) . the rotational velocities of the stars range from 4 to 35  km  s@xmath5 , and the @xmath3 equivalent width ranges from 0 to 21   . some known binary systems are also added , including the new tight m8 binary lp  349 - 25 whose binary status was recently reported by @xcite .    in this paper , we present our radio observation results of 8 of these dwarfs . their properties are listed in table  [ sample ] . we observed the 8 dwarfs from 2005 december 22 to 2006 january 02 with the nrao very large array ( vla ) when the array was the d configuration , except the observation of 2 m  0140@xmath627 in dnc , at 8.5  ghz ( 3.6  cm ) using the standard continuum mode with 2  @xmath7  50  mhz contiguous bands . the flux density calibrators were 3c  48 , 3c  147 , and 3c  286 and the phase calibrators were selected to be within @xmath8 of the targets . the data was reduced and analyzed with the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) . only lp  349 - 25 was detected at the observed frequency of 8.5  ghz ( fig . [ vlaimage ] ) . in order to examine the emission from this object , we subtracted the visibilities of other radio sources in the field , and re - imaged the visibility dataset . we extracted the position and flux of the source in total intensity , and made an image of the dataset in circular polarization ( stokes v ) . in addition , we investigated the time variation of the source using the task dftpl within aips .      table  [ sample ] gives the flux and upper limits for the detections / non - detections , respectively . the position of the radio source near the center in the map of the field around lp  349 - 25 coincides with the expected position of lp  349 - 25 at the epoch of our observations ( 2005.967 ) with its proper motion included ( @xmath9ra@xmath10  arcsec  yr@xmath5 , @xmath9de@xmath11  arcsec  yr@xmath5 , @xcite ) . we therefore conclude that the detected radio emission is from lp  349 - 25 . our initial examination of maps made in total intensity ( stokes i ) and circular polarization ( stokes v ) show the existence of a weak source in the stokes v map near this same position . further investigation , however , reveals that the location of the source in the stokes v map is offset with respect to the position of the source in the stokes i map by @xmath12 10 arcseconds . the right ( rcp ) and left ( lcp ) circularly polarized primary beams of the vla are separated by about 6% of the half - width at half maximum of the antenna beam . this gives rise to a phenomenon known as `` beamsquint '' @xcite , and for observations at 8.5 ghz the magnitude of the offset is 10.3 arcsec . this makes the detection of circular polarization intrinsic to the source suspect . finally , re - imaging of this field in stokes v after subtracting the visibilities in total intensity produces a lower significance ( @xmath133@xmath14 ) of the source . based on the fluctuations in the stokes v image , we deduce a 3@xmath14 upper limit of 48 @xmath9jy , or a circular polarization percentage @xmath1313% . the total extent of the observations of lp  349 - 25 was only @xmath41.7 hours , precluding the possibility of searching for rotational modulations , as this would correspond to one rotation period only for very rapidly rotating objects ( e.g. tvlm  513 - 46546 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . we extracted light curves of total intensity from the visibility dataset using time bins of 300 and 60 seconds to search for short - time scale transient brightenings . no obvious evidence of flare variability presented itself on visual inspection of either light curve . using the one - sided kolmogorov - smirnov statistic , we tried to see if we could reject the null hypothesis that the fluxes are distributed uniformly in time and thereby establish evidence for variability . we compared the cumulative distribution function of the fluxes to that of a uniform distribution in time , and conclude that the data are consistent with being drawn from a uniform distribution of events with ks statistics of 0.05 and 0.01 for the 300 and 60 second time binnings , respectively . the ks probabilites are unity in both cases , thus we find no evidence for variability .", "the flux detected from lp  349 - 25 together with the parallax measurement of 67.6  mas @xcite imply a radio luminosity of 9.6@xmath710@xmath15  erg  s@xmath5  hz@xmath5 . this is @xmath12  3 times larger than the steady luminosities of previously detected single very low mass dwarfs with similar spectral types ( m8m9 ) . the makeup of the binary system in lp  349 - 25 is likely m7.5v+m8.5v or m8v+m9v ( according to * ? ? ? * ) , and thus if the two components are equal contributors to the radio flux the radio luminosity of each dwarf would be comparable to or slightly brighter than the steady flux levels of the brightest apparently single dwarf previously detected . the projected separation of the binary is 0.12  or 1.78  au at the distance of 14.8  pc , derived from its trigonometric parallax measured recently @xcite . the beam size of the image from our d array observations is 9.2@xmath78.0(major axis @xmath7 minor axis ) , with a position angle of 76@xmath16 , thus we can not spatially resolve the two components .    with only one observed frequency of 8.5  ghz , we can not constrain an emission mechanism . previous papers have discussed two mechanisms : gyrosynchrotron emission from a population of mildly relativistic accelerated particles @xcite , and cyclotron maser emission @xcite . the brightness temperature of the emission is fundamental to constraining the emission mechanism , but with two dwarfs both being potential sources of the radiation , there are two unknowns in converting flux to brightness temperature : the fraction of the total flux which each component contributes , and the size of the emitting region ( being possibly different for each dwarf ) . we consider two simplifying cases : ( 1 ) each dwarf contributes half the observed flux , with characteristic length scale the radius of the dwarf ( where the radius is @xmath120.1  r@xmath17 ) as suggested by the previous observations @xcite ; ( 2 ) one dwarf contributes all of the emission , with length scale one tenth the dwarf radius as observed in a few m dwarfs @xcite . application of the relationship between brightness temperature , frequency , flux density , and source size @xcite , + @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the source flux in @xmath9jy , @xmath20 is the observing frequency in ghz , and @xmath21 is the angular size of the source in mas , yields for the first case @xmath22  k , and in the second case @xmath23  k. the high brightness temperatures indicate that the emission is nonthermal and could be consistent with gyrosynchrotron emission @xcite . one should note that larger size scales reduce the estimated brightness temperatures . in the second case , with @xmath24 k a coherent mechanism , such as cyclotron maser emission is also applicable . such a mechanism has been suggested by @xcite to account for the periodic variation of flux density and circular polarization in two other dwarfs . @xcite noted that the unmodulated flux of their target , tvlm  513 - 46546 , could be attributable to gyrosynchrotron emission with undetected circular polarization . clearly , more observations of lp  349 - 25 are needed to determine its characteristics better .", "our sample of 8 late - m dwarfs with spectral types ranging from m8.0 to m9.5 produced only one detection , that of a binary consistent with two m8 dwarfs . including the objects in our survey with previous reports on late m - t dwarfs @xcite , the fraction of late - m and brown dwarfs detected at radio wavelengths is @xmath410% so far ( see table  1 in @xcite and references therein , @xcite ) . interestingly , over a narrower range of spectral type , @xmath4m8@xmath25m9.5 a larger fraction , 18% , of objects have been detected at radio wavelengths , including our sample . @xcite suggested that rotation may play a role in influencing which objects are detected at radio wavelengths , by noting that the few objects with radio detections were among those with the largest values of @xmath26 . the relationship between rotation and the existence of large - scale magnetic fields , which may be necessary to influence the production of radio emision , has been suggested for fully convective stars by @xcite , based on measurements of longitudinal magnetic field strengths in the active dm3.5e star ev  lac ( @xmath27  km  s@xmath5 ) and absence in the slower rotator dm5.5 hh  and ( @xmath28  km  s@xmath5 ) . the fact that none of the fast rotators in our sample ( @xmath29  km  s@xmath5 ) provided radio detections suggests that @xmath26 is not the dominant factor controlling the production of detectable levels of radio emission . only the binary lp  349 - 25 was detected but unfortunately the rotational velocities of its components have not been measured so far . thus , the correlation between radio emission and rotation is still unclear .    the ambiguous relationship between rotation and radio emission is strengthened upon considering the field m stars vb  8 and lhs  3003 ( both spectral type m8 ) , which have similar rotational velocities ( 8  km  s@xmath5 for vb  8 and 9  km  s@xmath5 for lhs  3003 ) , and are located at @xmath30  6.5  pc . despite the similarities in spectral type , @xmath26 , and distance ( which produces similar sensivities ) , only lhs  3003 has shown radio quiescent emission @xcite . one possible explanation is that they were observed at different radio frequencies : @xcite observed vb  8 at 8.5  ghz and @xcite observed lhs  3003 at frequencies of 4.8 and 8.6  ghz but they only detected the star at 4.8  ghz . this might suggest that the spectral peak of radio emission from ultracool and brown dwarfs is closer to 4.8  ghz rather than 8.5  ghz , as discussed in @xcite . another possible explanation lies in the bias that inclination can introduce in estimating rotation rates from @xmath26 . photometric periods combined with spectroscopic rotation velocities have the potential to nail down this discrepancy ( e.g. * ? ? ? there is no explicit dependence between either emission mechanism proposed so far for radio emission from very low mass dwarfs and rotation . for two cases where radio emission has been detected and rotational modulation of the emission has been determined , @xcite proposed a model whereby a large scale dipole or multipole with magnetic field strength of a few kg at the stellar surface can produce cyclotron maser emission in regions where the strong - field condition @xmath31 1 is satisfied , where @xmath32 is the plasma frequency ( @xmath33  hz ) and @xmath34 is the gyro - frequency ( @xmath35(g )  hz ) ; i.e. in regions of low electron density and high magnetic field strength . the recent detection of a strong and large - scale axisymmetric magnetic field on a rapidly rotating m4 dwarf ( v374  peg , @xmath36  km  s@xmath5 ) bolsters the suggestion of a link between large - scale fields , rapid rotation , and detectable levels of varying radio emission , but provides only a post hoc explanation for why some objects are detected at radio wavelengths . clearly , a detailed investigation of those objects which do show evidence of radio emission is needed , along with suitable samples of objects with similar properties but lacking in radio detections , to tease out any controlling parameters . so far , there are no clear correlations between radio emission from ultracool and brown dwarfs and their properties such as rotation , spectral types , and chromospheric activity ; and radio emission mechanisms are possibly gyrosynchrotron or coherent electron cyclotron maser emission .", "we present our radio observations of a sample of 8 late - m dwarfs , with spectral types ranging over a narrow band of m8.0@xmath2m9.5 . only one of them has been detected , the m8 binary lp  349 - 35 . we have observed lp  349 - 25 at only 8.5  ghz , thus incoherent gyrosynchrotron or coherent electron cyclotron maser emission could be applicable . observation of multiple radio frequencies will clarify the radio emission mechanism of the binary , and measurement of @xmath26 of each component will also be required to test whether any correlation with rotation is implied by this radio detection . the lack of detections of the fast rotators in our sample suggest a murky picture of the relationship between radio emission and rotation ( as measured by @xmath26 ) . finally , with a separation of only 1.8  au , derived from an angular separation of 0.12  and @xmath0  mas @xcite , dynamical masses of each component of lp  349 - 25 are under measurement ( t. forveille , private communication ) . as the masses of the components of lp  349 - 25 can be measured precisely without any theoretical assumptions , this will therefore allow us to clarify their fully - convective status ( e.g. , 0.10.2  @xmath1 , @xcite ) , and hence the kind of magnetic dynamo in these ultracool dwarf components which may play an important role to explain our detection of radio emission from these objects . this also makes the system an excellent target for further studies with better constraints on the correlations between x - ray , radio emission and stellar parameters such as mass , age , temperature , and luminosity in ultracool dwarfs . this paper presents the result of vla project ap495 . n. p .- b . and e. l. m. acknowledge financial support from nsf grant ast 0440520 . n. p .- b . thanks y .- n . su for helps to prepare observation scripts and p .- gu for useful discussion . support for this work was provided by nasa through hubble fellowship grant # hf-01189.01 awarded by the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy . this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation ;

( in fig . [ fig : cl_ref ] we show the anisotropy power spectrum for the `` standard '' cdm model , see @xcite for a discussion of the physics behind these anisotropies ) . this kind of precision in theoretical predictions is necessary to interpret the results envisioned from a future satellite cmb mission , which could accurately measure the power spectrum over a broad range of scales , allowing one to measure most of the standard cosmological parameters with unprecedented accuracy @xcite . however such a measurement is still ( optimistically ) several years away , and in the meantime the data on cmb anisotropies continues to be amassed at a steady rate . for the interpretation of current data , such a high level of precision is not necessary , and semi - analytic techniques exist which can give spectra accurate to @xmath5 @xcite . an important constraint on structure formation models can be obtained without even this amount of effort however . it has been pointed out @xcite that for measurements of the spectrum constrained to scales of @xmath6 or above , the anisotropy power spectra exhibit a degeneracy in parameter space , which can be both a hindrance and a boon . this degeneracy has been dubbed `` cosmic confusion '' @xcite as it provides a limit to how well cosmological parameters can be extracted from measures of the cmb power spectra on scales larger than @xmath7 . notice the promise this degeneracy has in simplifying the interpretation of degree scale cmb data . as noted by dodelson & kosowsky @xcite , if this degeneracy holds it is possible to characterize the constraints on a wide range of models in terms of two parameters : an overall amplitude and the value of the degenerate combination of parameters @xmath8 ( see  [ sec : confusion ] for details . a part of this approximate degeneracy was implicitly used in @xcite to constrain the spectral slope and ionization history from the peak height ) . the amplitude of the _ potential _ fluctuations , measured on the largest scales by _ cobe _ , has become the preferred method for normalizing theories of large - scale structure @xcite . ( we show an example of this in fig . [ fig : deltah ] , where the dimensionless amplitude of the matter power spectrum at horizon crossing , @xmath9 , is shown vs.  @xmath10 and spectral tilt @xmath11 . ) the value of @xmath8 will constrain other parameters on which the predictions of the theory depend . furthermore , to the extent that cosmic confusion holds , generating spectra for a wide range of parameters can be reduced to simple modifications of a standard spectrum ( however with the advent of semi - analytic techniques for quickly generating spectra over the entire angular range , this may be of limited utility ) . an obvious application of this is a fitting formula for the height of the peak in the power spectra at @xmath12 . the current data provide limits on the height of the peak ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , which are becoming stronger . a quick method of estimating the height of the peak in the cmb spectrum can allow one to estimate the constraints from degree - scale measurements quickly and efficiently over a broad range of parameter space . the outline of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec : confusion ] we discuss how well cosmic confusion works , and slightly modify the original formulation @xcite .  [ sec : reion ] discusses the special case of late reionization in processing the spectra . in  [ sec : fit ] we use a compilation of cmb data to provide a limit on the peak height and discuss implications for models of structure formation .  [ sec : conclusions ] presents the conclusions .", "in this section we would like to make some comments about , and minor improvements upon , the degeneracy of cmb spectra with respect to certain parameters which has been dubbed `` cosmic confusion '' @xcite . specifically , it is claimed that for a range of parameters the cmb anisotropy spectra are degenerate in @xmath13 where @xmath11 is the ( scalar ) spectral index , @xmath14 is the ratio of tensors to scalars ( see below ) , @xmath15 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the reionization redshift ( see  [ sec : reion ] ) . the degeneracy is supposed to hold up to the first peak in the power spectrum , @xmath18 , though some spectra can be degenerate over an even larger range of @xmath19 @xcite . to start let us take as our guiding principle the following conjecture :    * for reasonable input parameters all cmb anisotropy spectra with the same peak - to - plateau ratio will be approximately degenerate . the interpretation of this statement clearly depends upon what range of cosmological models are adopted , over what range of scales the degeneracy is required to hold ( not beyond the first peak ) , and the precise meaning of `` approximately '' . we will discuss all of these issues below . inflation in its most generic form predicts a flat universe , so in this paper we will restrict ourselves to models with vanishing spatial curvature . several questions relating to open inflation are still unresolved , for example the predictions for super - curvature modes , spectral tilt and tensor modes to be very close to ( or greater than ) 1 . ] . while for any given model the calculations of the power spectrum are straightforward @xcite , we feel that these uncertainties make fitting to spectra premature for these models . the simplest implementation of cosmic confusion is in terms of an apparent spectral index , which we shall call @xmath8 ( this is related to the @xmath20 of @xcite by @xmath21 ) . as our base model we shall adopt ` standard ' cdm ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) for which we define @xmath27 . this spectrum is shown in fig . [ fig : cl_ref ] and tabulated in table  [ tab : scdm ] . the spectrum for a model whose parameters combine to give @xmath8 is then related to that of standard cdm by the simple formula @xmath28 where @xmath29 for notational convenience . we have chosen to pivot around @xmath30 as this is approximately the pivot point of the _ cobe _ data @xcite . alternatively one could use @xmath31 @xcite , which turns out to be almost the same for the range of spectra under consideration .    to understand the expression for @xmath8 in terms of the parameters of the model , we need only consider the effect of changing each parameter on the peak height of the model . we will now consider each of these effects in turn , concentrating first on those parameters for which the conjecture works well and then turning to those for which the deviations are larger .    as discussed in @xcite changing the spectral index , @xmath11 , of the primordial spectrum ( @xmath32 ) is equivalent to multiplying the anisotropy spectrum by @xmath33 as in eq . [ eqn : tiltapp ] . for @xmath34 the worst deviations induced by this approximation occur around @xmath3550 , and are @xmath36 . hence tilting the model away from scale invariance changes @xmath8 by @xmath37 . associated with tilt is the possibility that some of the cmb anisotropy comes from long - wavelength , inflation - produced gravitational waves ( tensor fluctuations ) . the fraction , @xmath14 , of tensors is usually quoted in terms of the contribution to the quadrupole : @xmath38 . unfortunately due to the decaying potentials in a @xmath39 model the scalar quadrupole is very sensitive to @xmath40 @xcite for a fixed `` initial '' power spectrum . the tensor quadrupole is much less sensitive @xcite and hence the ratio has a strong ( artificial ) @xmath39 dependence @xcite . we choose instead to write @xmath41 , where the prefactor has been chosen to make the definitions agree for @xmath42 . the @xmath30 mode is not as strongly affected by the decaying potentials @xcite making this a more robust measure of the underlying tensor / scalar ratio . since the tensor spectrum damps rapidly on scales smaller than the horizon at last scattering @xcite the effect of introducing a tensor component is to increase the plateau by @xmath43 while leaving the peak unchanged . [ the factor 0.76 is roughly @xmath44 for a scale - invariant spectrum with @xmath23 . ] an equivalent reduction in the peak height relative to the plateau can be accomplished by reducing the spectral index ( from @xmath30 to @xmath12 ) by , @xmath45    in the semi - analytic , two - fluid models of cmb anisotropies @xcite , the height of the first peak depends primarily on the combinations @xmath46 ( which sets the speed of sound in the coupled baryon - photon fluid ) and the redshift of matter - radiation equality . the latter scales with @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the fraction of the radiation made up of photons , scaled to be 1 in the standard model with 3 massless neutrino species . in models in which more relativistic species are included , such as decaying neutrino models @xcite , @xmath49 can be reduced leading to a larger peak height , just as if @xmath50 were lowered . as a warning we point out that this ` degeneracy ' is not exact , due to the effect of @xmath40 at low redshift ( which is included implicitly in the formulation of the semi - analytic models @xcite ) . in fig .  [ fig : cl_compare ] we show spectra for two models with the same ( reasonable ) values of @xmath51 and @xmath46 , which differ even up to the first peak by 510% . specifically the models have @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the first with ( @xmath50,@xmath54)=(0.4,0.25 ) and the second with ( 1,0.1 ) . as one can see from the figure , the exact height and position of the first peak are complicated functions of the cosmological parameters ! the reason for the breaking of the degeneracy in this particular case is that the large - angle temperature fluctuations ( from decaying potentials at @xmath39 domination ) and the projection of physical scales to @xmath19 both depend on @xmath40 , not just @xmath55 . the original statement of cosmic confusion was meant to hold for models with @xmath53 , meaning that models with equal @xmath51 would be degenerate , and furthermore that they would coincide with models with some @xmath56 . for models with scale invariant initial perturbations , @xmath23 , @xmath53 and @xmath57 to 0.75 , we find that the height of the peak ( relative to @xmath58 ) is very well fit by @xmath59 we note that @xmath60 ranges from 260 to 200 over this range of @xmath15 , since a changing sound speed causes the sound horizon at last scattering to subtend a varying angular scale @xcite . this small movement of the peak should not matter if we redefine `` cosmic confusion '' to hold when averaged over a reasonably broad window in @xmath19 , as is the case in most experiments to date . under the `` confusion '' assumption then we predict that @xmath61 which is roughly equivalent to the original statement given in @xcite . both this approximation , and the original statement @xcite , give @xmath36 deviations in @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 . [ the percentage deviations for @xmath65 can be larger than 10% , but here cosmic variance is also larger . ]    similarly we find that the variation with @xmath10 at fixed @xmath46 and @xmath15 works at the @xmath5 level in power for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , with @xmath68 this is not exactly what we would have expected based on a degeneracy in @xmath69 : the scaling with @xmath50 is slightly weaker , and that with @xmath49 weaker still . [ this can be traced to the same non - degeneracy mentioned above and illustrated in fig . [ fig : cl_compare ] . ]    note that at present @xmath46 as determined by big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is uncertain to a factor of @xmath70 ( c.f . the hubble constant ! ) @xcite . thus we are compelled to study the variation of the peak height with the sound speed , or @xmath46 , which was not included in the original statement of cosmic confusion @xcite . for @xmath23 and @xmath71 the height of the peak is relatively well fit by an exponential in @xmath72 for @xmath22 and less well fit by an exponential for @xmath73 . unfortunately the slopes of the fits for these two cases ( which have different @xmath74 ) disagree : @xmath75 as a compromise then we take the average of the two coefficients to arrive at our dependence of @xmath8 on @xmath46 @xmath76 which holds relatively well over the range preferred by bbn : @xmath77 @xcite .    in summary then we can define a `` spectral tilt '' @xmath8 through @xmath78 for a large range of @xmath79 cdm models , we find with this @xmath8 that `` cosmic confusion '' holds at the @xmath5 level in power ( 5% in temperature ) up to @xmath80 for those models with @xmath67 , @xmath81 and @xmath77 ( we discuss @xmath82 in  [ sec : reion ] ) . this deviation usually occurs at @xmath8350 and some of it can be attributed to the approximation for tilt of the primordial spectrum that we are using ( eq .  [ eqn : tiltapp ] ) . for low-@xmath50 or @xmath15 models the shape of the rise into the peak and the position of the peak are sufficiently different that a tilted model is not a good fit ( though our fit is a good approximation to the height of the peak even for @xmath84 ) . on the other hand for some models in the range mentioned the degeneracy is good to 1% in power for @xmath85 . the logarithmic dependence of @xmath8 on @xmath51 differs from the linear dependence of @xmath20 on the same quantity found by @xcite . both approximations give similar `` worst fit '' @xmath62 , but the logarithm is a better fit to the height of the peak ( @xmath86 relative to @xmath58 ) over the range of models considered ; it works to better than 5% .    with the rapid progress being made in measurements of the cmb anisotropy , it is likely that we will need to do better than 10% in the very near future . a more complicated fit or a better treatment of spectral tilt could alleviate matters slightly . however , bearing in mind that the position of the peak also changes with the input parameters and that the degeneracies ( e.g.  @xmath87 ) built into `` confusion '' themselves only hold at the 510% level , one is lead to conclude that `` one number '' summaries of the cmb data are becoming a thing of the past . of course , eq .  [ eqn : nudef ] is still useful as a quick - and - dirty method of estimating the height of the peak ( to 5% ) in the power spectrum for quite a wide range of parameters . this can be useful for narrowing the large parameter space down to a smaller region which can be searched more carefully ( as one often uses linear theory estimates in large - scale structure work ) . if the experiments are chosen to probe scales for which `` confusion '' works well , then constraints on @xmath8 will still encode much of the information that the cmb has for large - scale structure .    as more experiments probe scales `` beyond the first peak '' ( @xmath88 ) , the utility of cosmic confusion as a summary of _ all _ cmb constraints will decrease . in these cases one must search a multi - dimensional parameter space and compute the full cmb spectrum either by numerical evolution of the coupled boltzmann equations or fast semi - analytic methods which can be accurate to @xmath36 ( e.g.  @xcite ) . moving beyond this degeneracy will allow us to obtain more information about the cosmological parameters from study of the detailed structure of the power spectrum .", "in the original statement of cosmic confusion @xcite , there was a term for the reionization redshift . reionization in the adiabatic models of interest is likely to occur very rapidly @xcite and at relatively low redshift , @xmath17 . since @xmath17 the universe has probably been fully ionized . we show in table  [ tab : zr ] a `` reasonable '' estimate of the reionization redshift for some models by way of example . these determinations rely on several assumptions and so should only be taken as illustrative . the results are also very sensitive to the value of @xmath46 and @xmath89 chosen .    in such a scenario , the amplitude of the fluctuations on small scales is reduced by @xmath90 @xcite , where @xmath91\\ ] ] ( for @xmath92 ) is the optical depth to thomson scattering from @xmath93 to @xmath17 ( also shown in table  [ tab : zr ] ) . note that @xmath94 depends not only on @xmath17 but also on @xmath72 and @xmath15 , which was neglected in the original treatment of cosmic confusion @xcite . ( for the accuracy to which the spectrum depends on and scales with @xmath94 see @xcite . ) in addition new fluctuations are generated on larger angular scales for @xmath95 @xcite . reionized spectra are _ not _ well described by a simple tilting of the scdm spectrum . an approximation which has the correct asymptotic forms @xcite is to multiply the spectrum by @xmath96 $ ] , where @xmath97 is the optical depth from @xmath93 to redshift @xmath98 and @xmath99 defines a mapping from angles to redshift ( e.g.  the redshift at which the horizon subtends an angle @xmath100 ) . while this approximation has the right asymptotic form , it fails to be a good approximation to a reionized spectrum for @xmath95 since it does not take into account the fluctuations generated on the new last scattering surface . these fluctuations typically do not extend to @xmath101 , so if one is interested only in scales near the peak of the spectrum a reduction of @xmath102 $ ] is appropriate .    because reionization is such an important part of interpreting cmb anisotropy measurements in the context of cosmological models , we will defer a more detailed discussion of reionization to a future paper @xcite .", "in this section we discuss what we can infer about @xmath8 from current observations of cmb anisotropy . we shall use the data tabulated in @xcite since the newer data is ( mostly ) not yet available . as discussed in @xcite and below , the constraints even without including the new data are very interesting for large - scale structure modelling . several issues regarding foreground contamination and possible systematic errors intrude in the analysis of current cmb data . it was shown in @xcite that for the experiments dominating the fit near the peak , removing the foregrounds does not increase the error bars by more than @xmath5 . to account for foreground removal we have ( conservatively ) multiplied the errors in @xcite by 10% ( except for _ cobe _ ) . note that since @xcite , several experiments have reproduced earlier observations , indicating that systematic errors are not as severe as might have been thought . in one case however , that of the msam experiment @xcite , one of the two channels ( the `` single - difference '' ) showed a discrepancy . to be very conservative we have dropped this point from our analysis ( shown in fig . [ fig : the_data ] as the solid square at @xmath103 ) and updated the `` double - difference '' point to include the new data ( which is slightly lower than the older data ) . also we do not include the new data from the python experiment ( though we show it in fig . [ fig : the_data ] as the solid triangles with the small error bars @xcite ) since the points are correlated in an unknown way . as it is not the purpose of this paper to revisit the data analysis , especially without access to the latest data , we shall use the data set as tabulated in @xcite , with the simple modifications discussed above . one point deserves special mention . in @xcite we used symmetric error bars on all of the points . this is a conservative method if the inference is the presence of a peak , since most of the observations have skew positive error bars . however this leads to a slightly stronger than warranted _ upper _ limit on the height of the peak , and a slightly weaker lower limit . as most of the skewed likelihood functions have not been published in tabular or graphical form we have not tried to correct for this bias . since for most of the models under consideration ( especially the models with high @xmath40 ) the large - scale structure data is best fit with a tilt ( @xmath104 ) , this treatment remains the most conservative . a fit to the data as in @xcite , but with spectra generated from eq . [ eqn : tiltapp ] , gives a likelihood function for @xmath8 shown in fig . [ fig : nulik ] . here we have integrated , or marginalized , over the normalization @xmath105 , which is well fixed by _ cobe _ the mean and standard deviation are @xmath106 . the absolute goodness of fit to both the _ cobe _ data alone @xcite and the other data @xcite show no indications that the fit should be suspect for purely _ statistical _ reasons . notice that this result has several immediate implications for structure formation models . that the preferred peak height is near that of a cdm model with scale invariant initial conditions puts a _ lower _ limit on the amount of tilt which can be accommodated @xcite . the lower limit clearly depends on the values of @xmath50 , @xmath15 and @xmath46 assumed , with lower @xmath50 and @xmath15 acting to loosen the constraint and lower @xmath46 acting to strengthen it . the probability of early reionization @xcite in these models will only tighten the lower limit on @xmath11 .    the increased height of the peak in low-@xmath50 models or models with @xmath107 can cause conflict with the _ upper _ limit on @xmath8 , unless the models are tilted , the baryon fraction is lowered or there is some reionization . we note in passing that for @xmath39cdm , some tilt is probably necessary to provide a good fit with the large scale structure data in any case @xcite . in general , while the degree scale data provide a strong constraint on models with high @xmath50 , the possibility of early reionization ( the degree scale power is exponentially sensitive to the very uncertain @xmath17 ) and the large uncertainty in @xmath46 from bbn significantly weaken the constraints from this data for low @xmath50 or @xmath49 models .", "in this paper we have compared the accuracy of spectra generated using the `` cosmic confusion '' @xcite assumption to those calculated using numerical evolution of the boltzmann hierarchy . for a range of parameters of current interest the spectra are found to agree to @xmath5 for all multipoles up to the first peak ( @xmath12 ) . over the same range the height of the peak is reproduced to @xmath108 . as pointed out by dodelson & kosowsky @xcite , the presence of this degeneracy for scales greater than @xmath7 allows a simple statement of the parameter constraints arising from cmb data . given current data we find that @xmath8 ( see eq . [ eqn : nudef ] ) is constrained to be @xmath106 . by limiting the amount of spectral tilt , this result in combination with large - scale structure measurements ( on somewhat smaller scales ) strongly constrains models of structure formation ( see e.g.  @xcite and  [ sec : fit ] ) . n. sugiyama , astrophys . j. supp . * 100 * 281 ( 1995 ) . w. hu , d. scott , n. sugiyama , m. white , phys . rev . * d52 * 5498 ( 1995 ) . u. seljak , astrophys . j. * 435 * , l87 ( 1994 ) . d. scott , m. white , general relativity & gravitation * 27 * , 1023 ( 1995 ) . d. scott , j. silk , m. white , science * 268 * , 829 ( 1995 ) ; d. scott , m. white , in _ cmb anisotropies two years after cobe _ , ed . krauss , world scientific , new york , p.214 w. hu , n. sugiyama , astrophys . j. * 444 * , 489 ( 1995 ) . g. jungman , m. kamionkowski , a. kosowsky , d.n . spergel , preprint , astro - ph/9507080 j.r . bond , r. crittenden , r.l . davis , g. efstathiou , p.j . steinhardt , phys . lett . * 72 * , 13 ( 1994 ) . s. dodelson , a. kosowsky , phys . lett . * 75 * , 604 ( 1995 ) . e. bunn , d. scott , m. white , astrophys . j. * 441 * , l9 ( 1995 ) ; e. bunn , n. sugiyama , astrophys . j. * 446 * , 49 ( 1995 ) ; k. gorski , g. hinshaw , a.j . banday , c.l . bennett , e.l . wright , a. kogut , g.f . smoot , p. lubin , astrophys . j. * 430 * , l89 ( 1994 ) ; m. white , e. bunn , astrophys . j. * 450 * , 477 ( 1995 ) ; k.m . gorksi , b. ratra , n. sugiyama , a. banday , astrophys . j. * 446 * , l67 ( 1995 ) ; r. stompor , k. gorski , a.j . banday , to appear in mnras ; m. white , d. scott , to appear in comments on astrophysics . l. cayon , e. martinez - gonzalez , j.l . sanz , n. sugiyama , s. torres , to appear in astrophys . j. ; k. yamamoto , e. bunn , to appear in astrophys . j. p. steinhardt , `` cosmology at the crossroads '' , in _ proceedings of the 1994 snowmass workshop_. m.l . wilson , astrophys . j. * 273 * , 2 ( 1983 ) ; n. gouda , n. sugiayama , m. sasaki , prog . 85 * , 1023 ( 1991 ) ; m. kamionkowski , d. spergel , n. sugiyama , astrophys . j. * 426 * , l57 ( 1994 ) ; m. kamionkowski , b. ratra , d.n . spergel , n. sugiyama , astrophys . j. * 434 * , l1 ( 1994 ) ; k.m . gorksi , b. ratra , n. sugiyama , a. banday , astrophys . j. * 446 * , l67 ( 1995 ) ; m. white , d. scott , to appear in astrophys . j. ; k. gorski , g. hinshaw , a.j . banday , c.l . bennett , e.l . wright , a. kogut , g.f . smoot , p. lubin , astrophys . j. * 430 * , l89 ( 1994 ) . sachs , a.m. wolfe , astrophys . j. * 147 * , 73 ( 1967 ) . l. kofman , a. starobinsky , sov . . lett . * 11 * , 271 ( 1985 ) . turner , m. white , j.e . lidsey , phys . rev . * d48 * , 4613 ( 1993 ) . l. knox , phys . rev . * d52 * , 4307 ( 1995 ) . m. white , e. bunn , astrophys . j. * 450 * , 477 ( 1995 ) ; ( erratum in press ) . r. crittenden , j.r . bond , r.l . davis , g. efstathiou , p.j . steinhardt , phys . lett . * 71 * , 324 ( 1993 ) . doroshkevich , ya.b . zeldovich , r.a . sunyaev , sov . astron . * 22 * , 523 ( 1978 ) . jorgensen , e. kotok , p.d . naselskii , i.d . novikov , astr . astrophys . * 294 * , 639 ( 1995 ) m. white , d. scott , j. silk , ann . rev . astron . & astrophys . * 32 * , 319 ( 1994 ) . j. bardeen , j.r . bond , g. efstathiou , astrophys . j. * 321 * , 28 ( 1987 ) ; s. dodelson , g. gyuk , m. turner , phys . rev . * 72 * , 3754 ( 1994 ) ; phys . rev . * d49 * , 5068 ( 1994 ) ; m. white , g. gelmini , j. silk , phys . rev . * d51 * , 2669 ( 1995 ) ; s.j . mcnally , j.a . peacock , mnras 277 , 143 ( 1995 ) . c. copi , d.n . schramm , m.s . turner , science * 267 * , 192 ( 1995 ) . couchman , mnras * 214 * , 137 ( 1985 ) . couchman , m.j . rees , mnras * 221 * , 53 ( 1986 ) ; m. fukugita , m. kawasaki , mnras * 269 * , 563 ( 1994 ) ; s. sasaki , f. takahara , y. suto , prog . * 90 * , 85 ( 1993 ) ; m. tegmark , j. silk , blanchard , astrophys . j. * 420 * , 484 ( 1993 ) ( erratum * 434 * , 395 ) ; a. liddle , d.h . lyth , mnras * 273 * , 1177 ( 1995 ) . w. hu , d. scott , j. silk , phys . rev . * d49 * , 648 ( 1994 ) . w. hu , m. white , to appear in astron . & astrophys . n. sugiyama , n. vittorio , j. silk , astrophys . j. * 419 * l1 ( 1993 ) . w. hu , m. white , to appear in astrophys . j. m. white , d. scott , j. silk , m. davis , mnras , * 276 * , l69 ( 1995 ) . s. dodelson , a. stebbins , astrophys . j. * 433 * , 440 ( 1994 ) . cheng , et al . , to appear in astrophys . j. m. dragovan , private communication a. klypin , j. primack , j. holtzman , preprint , astro - ph/9510042 . m. white , d. scott , to appear in comments on astrophysics . e. bunn , ph.d . thesis , university of california , berkeley ( 1995 ) . .the multipole moments , @xmath29 , for the `` standard '' cold dark matter model with @xmath23 , @xmath109 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the moments have been normalized to have @xmath110 . enough moments have been given to interpolate the behaviour of the curve .

[ fig : hr_int ] ) . we have considered sample of 50 events classified by @xcite as unknown because of their softness . when excluding short events they again have @xmath25 except two events from the direction to vela  x-1 .    why do not we see softer grbs despite the fact that there exist x - ray dominated bursts with peak energy below the batse  window ? we calculated the batse  detector response to estimate the dependence between the incident photon spectrum and the observed hardness ratio ( see fig . [ fig : hr_beta ] ) . we approximated grb spectra with the band function @xcite and folded them with the batsedetector response matrix ( drm ) @xcite . the low hardness ratio ( @xmath26 ) of our soft events is consistent with a wide variety of spectral parameters @xmath3 , low energy and high energy spectral indices @xmath27 and @xmath28 , in particular , with @xmath29 kev and @xmath30 ( see fig .  [ fig : hr_int ] and [ fig : hr_beta ] ) . it is also evident that the sufficient condition for a grb to give @xmath31 and thus to look as a typical grb in the batsedata ( with larger signal above 50 kev ) is @xmath32 , independently on the @xmath3 . a combination of a low @xmath3 and a very steep @xmath28 would give the hardness ratio below 0.3 which we do not observe . the fact that all events with @xmath33 have evident non - grb origin ( solar flares , vela  x-1 pulsar , etc . ) implies that a spectral cutoff below @xmath915 kev may be a distinguishing feature to separate non - grb sources .", "_ bepposax _  observed 20 x - ray dominated grbs which were detected by wide field camera ( 226 kev ) , but did not activate the trigger of the gamma - ray monitor ( 40400 kev ) . their counterparts were found in the batse  records for almost all observable events @xcite . most of them were detected earlier as classic grbs by our scan of batse  data in 50300 kev band @xcite . it turns out that these events have a high hardness ratio similar to typical grbs ( see fig . [ fig : saxhete]a ) . the hardness ratio 100300/50100 kev for common _ bepposax_/batse events shows a similar picture : 7 out of 8 events have a typical hardness for weak grbs and one event is softer . thus this distribution is also consistent with the extrapolated hardness - intensity trend for long grbs @xcite . these facts support our conclusion that most of the x - ray dominated grbs should have a hard tail with @xmath32 in the batse  window 251000 kev ( see fig . [ fig : hr_beta ] ) .    _ _  observed 45 grbs in the 2400 kev band and their spectral fits are given in @xcite . in order to check how _ results are related to our data we folded _ hete-2 _ spectra with the batse  detector response matrix and obtained corresponding counts in batse  channels ( see fig . [ fig : saxhete]b ) . the fraction of soft events in the _ hete-2 _ sample is about 3 times larger than in the batse  sample which can be explained by different instrument responses . but only 1 out of 45 _ hete-2 _  events gives a lower hardness ratio than we see in the batse  grb sample . nine out of 45 _ hete-2 _  events are below the batse  sensitivity threshold . the batse  sample , however , represents probably the whole grb spectral variety . @xcite fitted _ _  spectra by three functions : a power - law , a power - law with the exponential cutoff and the band function . they started from a power - law fit and used a more parametric expression only if the fit was inconsistent with the data at 0.01 significance level . from fig . [ fig : saxhete]b one can see that the power - law fit was acceptable only for weak events . relatively bright bursts gave good power - law with exponential cutoff fits . however , this does not mean that they could not be fitted by the band function . according to our results , the existence of grbs with sharp spectral cutoff is questionable for events with low @xmath3 . indeed , the events with @xmath341020 kev would give a very low hardness ratio which we do not observe . note that , as shown by @xcite , only few percents of grbs with high @xmath3 are better described by a power - law with the exponential cutoff . if the dispersion in @xmath3 is due to variations in the redshift / blueshift in the source , then the spectral shape would be stable and our conclusion could refer to all grbs .", "1 .   despite the wealth of the x - ray dominated grbs observed by _ ginga _ , _ bepposax _  and _ hete-2_the number of soft grbs in the batse  data is relatively small . the fraction of events with the count rate in 2550 kev higher than that above 50 kev is @xmath95 per cent ( 20 per year with flux down to 0.1 ph @xmath2 s@xmath1 ) . the hardness distribution of the x - ray dominated grbs in the batse band is consistent with that of weak classic grbs . in the case of a low @xmath3 , the main fraction of grbs should have a relatively hard high - energy tail with a power - law slope @xmath35 . only a few per cent of the x - ray rich grbs have a tail with @xmath36 , but still harder than the exponential one . this fact clarifies the deficiency of soft events in the batse data . an exponential cutoff in the grb spectra , if exists , is probably a rare phenomenon . therefore , a spectral cutoff with the e - folding energy below @xmath0 kev may be a distinguishing feature to separate the non - grb events .", "we are grateful to robert preece and geoffrey pendleton for the code of the batse  detector response matrix . we thank kevin hurley for providing us ipn  data on our soft grb sample . this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center . the work is supported by nordita nordic project in high energy astrophysics in the integral era , russian foundation for basic research ( grant 04 - 02 - 16987 ) , and russian foundation of science support ( y.t . ) . band d. et al . , 1993 , apj , 413 , 281 gehrels n. et al . , 2004 , apj , 611 , 1005 in t zand j. , heise j. , kippen r. , woods p. , guidorzi c. , montanari e. , frontera f. , 2003 , in piro l. , frontera f. , masetti n. , feroci m. , eds , asp conf . series 312 , third rome workshop on gamma - ray bursts in the afterglow era , astron . , san francisco , p.  18 [ kippen r. m. , woods p. m. , heise j. , int zand j. , preece r. d. , briggs m. s. , 2001 , in costa e. , frontera f. , hjorth j. , eds , gamma - ray bursts in the afterglow era . berlin , springer , p.  22 [ kommers j. , lewin w.h.g . , kouveliotou c. , van paradijs j. , pendleton g.n . , meegan c.a . , fishman g.j . , 2001 , apjs , 134 , 385 [ metzger , a . e. , parker r. h. , gilman d. , peterson l. e. , trombka j. i. , 1974 , apj , 194 , l19 [ paciesas w.s . et al . , 1999 , apjs , 122 , 465 [ pendleton g.n . et al . , 1999 , apj , 512 , 362 [ preece r.d . , briggs m.s . , mallozzi r.s . , pendleton g. n. , paciesas w.s . , band d.l . , 2000 , apjs , 126 , 19 [ sakamoto t. et al . , 2005 , apj , 629 , 311 [ smith d.a . et al . , 2002 , apjs , 141 , 415 [ sommer m. et al . , 1994 , apj , 422 , l63 [ stern b. e. , tikhomirova y. , kompaneets d. , svensson r. , poutanen j. , 2001 , apj , 563 , 80 [ strohmayer t. e. , fenimore e. e. , murakami t. , yoshida a. , 1998 , apj , 500 , 873 [ trombka j. i. , eller e. l. , schmadebeck r. l. , adler i. , metzger a. e. , gilman d. , gorenstein p. , bjorkholm p. , 1974 , apj , 194 , l27 [ wheaton wm . , 1973 , apj , 185 , l57"], "summary": "a population of x - ray dominated gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) observed by _ ginga _ , _ bepposax _  and _ hete-2_should be represented in the batse  data as presumably soft bursts . we have performed a search for soft grbs in the batse  records in the 25100 kev energy band . a softness of a burst spectrum can be a reason why it has been missed by the on - board procedure and previous searches for untriggered grbs tuned to 50300 kev range . we have found a surprisingly small number ( @xmath0 yr@xmath1 down to 0.1 ph @xmath2 s@xmath1 ) of soft grbs where the count rate is dominated by 2550 kev energy channel . this fact as well as the analysis of _ hete-2 _  and common _ bepposax_/batse  grbs indicates that the majority of grbs with a low @xmath3 has a relatively hard tail with the high - energy power - law photon index @xmath4 . an exponential cutoff in grb spectra below 20 kev may be a distinguishing feature separating non - grb events .

{"id": "astro-ph9611139", "section_names": ["introduction", "observations and data reduction", "modeling", "results and discussion", "conclusions"], "document": ["although galaxies cover a wide range in properties , such as luminosity , hubble type and environment , their globular cluster systems are remarkably similar in many respects . in particular , all globular cluster luminosity functions ( gclf ) can be crudely represented by a gaussian with a peak located at m@xmath6 @xmath3 7.5 and a width of @xmath7 @xmath3 1.2 . the peak , or turnover magnitude , has been used with some success as an independent distance estimator to galaxies ( see jacoby 1992 ) . its usefulness relies on the assumption that the turnover magnitude is universal for all galaxies . it has been suggested that the gclf is not universal , but rather varies systematically with gc metallicity ( ashman , conti & zepf 1995 ) , the galaxy hubble type ( secker & harris 1993 ) or galaxy environment ( blakeslee & tonry 1996 ) . if any of these ` second parameter ' effects are confirmed , then accurate distance estimates using the gclf method will require an appropriate correction . in the case of gc metallicity , ashman ( 1995 ) have quantified the effects of metallicity on the turnover magnitude and show that once a metallicity correction ( @xmath3 0.1 mag ) is applied , the gclf gives distances in good agreement with other methods .    to fully resolve these issues , a number of high quality gclfs are required covering a range of hubble types and environments . one approach is to study galaxies that belong to a nearby group . this has the benefit of allowing the gclf  determined distances to be directly compared with other distance methods for galaxies in the same group . fleming ( 1995 ) aimed to use this approach on the nearby coma i cloud by examining the gclf in ngc 4494 ( e1 ) and ngc 4565 ( sb ) . their results will be discussed below . the coma i cloud is a small group of galaxies in the foreground of the well  known coma cluster of galaxies ( a1656 ) . it is dominated by spiral galaxies but also includes a few ellipticals ( gregory & thompson 1977 ) .    here we examine the gclfs of the two brightest ellipticals which may be members of the coma i cloud , namely ngc 4278 and ngc 4494 . both galaxies contain a kinematically  distinct core which may have resulted from a merger . using _ hubble space telescope _ wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) data of forbes ( 1996 ) , we can probe the gclf in these galaxies to about 2 magnitudes beyond the turnover magnitude . the wfpc2 data have the additional advantages of very low background contamination with no blending of gcs in the central galaxy region . our method is similar to that applied to the gclf of ngc 4365 ( forbes 1996 ) . in particular , we use the maximum likelihood code of secker & harris ( 1993 ) to fit the gclf and the absolute turnover magnitude determination of sandage & tammann ( 1995 ) , i.e. m@xmath5 = 7.62 @xmath2 0.08 . we compare the gclf distance modulus with other methods and estimate the hubble constant .", "details of the wfpc2 data for the gcs in ngc 4278 and ngc 4494 are presented , along with 12 other ellipticals , in forbes ( 1996 ) . from the 2 @xmath8 500s f555w images , we use daophot ( stetson 1987 ) to detect gcs . detection is based on fairly conservative limits of flux threshold , shape , sharpness and size . and after checking against a list of hot pixels , the final contamination from cosmic rays , foreground stars , background galaxies and hot pixels is less than a few percent . we did not apply any color selection to the gc lists . the gc magnitudes have been converted into johnson v and corrected for galactic extinction . when examining the gclf of ngc 4365 ( forbes 1996 ) , we showed that the fraction of detected gcs with magnitude , once the threshold criterion is adjusted for a 0.3 mag sensitivity difference ( burrows 1993 ) , is similar for all four ccds . for ngc 4494 we were able to use all ccds , as the dust is confined to a small ( @xmath3 1@xmath9 ) ring which does nt appear to affect any gcs ( carollo 1996 ) . in the case of ngc 4278 , dust covers much of the pc ccd . we have therefore decided not to include gcs from the pc in this analysis .", "a full description of the modeling processes including completeness tests , photometric errors , background contamination and maximum likelihood fitting , are given in forbes ( 1996 ) . to summarize , we carried out simulations to test the ability of daophot to detect gcs on actual wfc images for both galaxies . these completeness tests , and the photometric error in measuring gc magnitudes , are given in figure 1 for ngc 4278 and figure 2 for ngc 4494 . both figures are similar to that found for ngc 4365 ( forbes 1996 ) . the 50% completeness level is v = 24.9 for ngc 4278 and v = 24.8 for ngc 4494 . we ignore gcs with magnitudes fainter than these to avoid large incompleteness corrections . a small correction is made for background contamination based on similar exposure wfpc2 images from the medium deep survey ( forbes 1994 ) . finally we fit the background  corrected gclf using the maximum likelihood code of secker & harris ( 1993 ) which takes account of the completeness and photometric error variations with magnitude . we fit both gaussian and @xmath10 distributions to the gclf .", "we have detected 241 gcs in ngc 4278 and 148 in ngc 4494 to the 50% completeness level . the results of fitting the gclf of each galaxy , with the gaussian and a @xmath10 functions , are summarized in table 1 . in particular , the average turnover magnitudes are m@xmath11 = 23.23 @xmath2 0.11 for ngc 4278 and m@xmath11 = 23.07 @xmath2 0.13 for ngc 4494 . as these magnitudes are statistically within the combined errors , this would indicate that both galaxies are at the same distance . the probability contours output from the maximum likelihood code for the gaussian fit , over a range of 0.53 standard deviations , are shown in figures 3 and 4 . in figures 5 and 6 we show the binned gclf and our best  fit gaussian superposed for each galaxy . note that the fitting procedure does not use binned data but rather treats each data point individually . these figures clearly show that the 50% completeness limit is almost 2 magnitudes fainter than the turnover magnitude , giving us additional confidence that the turnover is well determined . this makes our data among the most complete , in terms of sampling the luminosity function , of gclfs published to date . the number of ` missing ' gcs , i.e. those fainter than the limiting magnitude , is @xmath12 10% .    fleming ( 1995 ) have recently investigated the gclf of ngc 4494 and the sb spiral ngc 4565 . the aim of their study was to derive a gclf distance for galaxies of different hubble types located in the same group . this would allow a direct test of whether or not the gclf turnover magnitude depends on hubble type . they used the same cfht @xmath31@xmath9 v band images used by simard & pritchet ( 1994 ) for a surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) study of these galaxies . the data consisted of two pointings for each galaxy . using daophot for gc detection and completeness tests , their 50% completeness limits for the two pointings were v = 23.2 , 24.0 for ngc 4494 and v = 24.5 , 24.3 for ngc 4565 . for a gaussian fit to their gclf data of ngc 4494 they quote @xmath1 = 23.6 @xmath2 0.4 with @xmath7 fixed at 1.4 . the results for ngc 4565 are @xmath1 = 22.63 @xmath2 0.2 , @xmath7 = 1.35 @xmath2 0.22 . in both cases there is considerable scatter in their faint magnitude bins ( see their figures 5 and 6 ) . they concluded that ngc 4565 was in the coma i cloud but that ngc 4494 lies in the background . we now consider whether their data , and hence inferred distances , are consistent with our dataset . we first note that all fleming magnitudes should be 0.05@xmath4 brighter after applying a galactic extinction correction . starting with ngc 4494 , for which their 50% completeness limit is comparable to their estimated turnover magnitude . for a gaussian fit our data gives @xmath13 = 23.05 @xmath2 0.13 which is _ not _ consistent with their result . however , an important distinction is that they fixed @xmath7 to be 1.4 ( their data did not warrant fits to both @xmath7 and @xmath1 ) . it has been shown that uncertainties in @xmath7 correspond to uncertainties in @xmath1 , so that a change from @xmath7 = 1.4 ( fleming ) to 1.1 ( us ) would translate into a brighter @xmath1 by about 0.5@xmath4 ( e.g. hanes 1977 ; secker & harris 1993 ) . thus the fleming gclf would have a turnover of @xmath1 @xmath3 23.05 . an alternative , and perhaps more straight forward , way to show this is given by figure 7 . this shows the fleming data for ngc 4494 and the best fit gaussian to our data for ngc 4494 . we include two gaussians arbitrarily scaled up and down by a factor of two vertically ( the turnover magnitude is held constant , but the dispersion is allowed to vary ) . this figure indicates that , within the error bars , the fleming data for ngc 4494 are consistent with a gaussian that has a turnover of @xmath1 = 23.05 . as a further test , we re  fit their data but excluded the faintest bin and allowed the gaussian dispersion @xmath7 to be a free parameter ( along with the turnover magnitude and the normalization ) . this gave m@xmath11 = 23.27 @xmath2 0.4 ( after extinction correction ) and @xmath7 = 1.3 @xmath2 0.3 . we conclude that the ground  based dataset of fleming ( 1995 ) for ngc 4494 and our wfpc2 data _ are _ consistent , albeit within some large scatter . next we consider ngc 4565 , in particular is it at the same distance as ngc 4494 ( and ngc 4278 ) ? figure 7 shows the fleming data for the spiral ngc 4565 . the data lie between the best fit gaussian to our ngc 4494 data and one scaled down by a factor of two . thus , as with ngc 4494 , the ground  based data for ngc 4565 is consistent with a gaussian of @xmath1 = 23.05 . it is difficult to rule out the possibility that the turnover magnitude is brighter by @xmath3 0.5@xmath4 ( this difference is too large to be explained as metallicity effect ashman 1995 ) . we now calculate the distance modulus for our data from the apparent turnover magnitude . as noted in the introduction , ashman ( 1995 ) have advocated that a small correction be applied to the universal value based on gc metallicity . such a metallicity correction has been shown by them to improve gclf distance estimates . in the absence of spectroscopic measures , we can estimate the mean metallicity of a gc system assuming [ fe / h ] = 5.051 ( v  i )  6.096 ( couture 1990 ) . using the mean color from forbes ( 1996 ) , we derive [ fe / h ] = 0.79 for ngc 4278 and 0.84 for ngc 4494 , giving metallicity corrections of @xmath14m@xmath6 = 0.16 and 0.14 respectively . thus we make the universal value of m@xmath11 = 7.62 @xmath2 0.08 ( sandage & tammann 1995 ) fainter by 0.16 or 0.14 magnitudes .    in table 2 we summarize distance determinations from other workers for galaxies in the coma i cloud . we include the gclf distance for ngc 4565 from fleming ( 1995 ) , after making a 0.05 galactic extinction correction and assuming m@xmath11 = 7.62 @xmath2 0.08 with no metallicity correction . from v band surface brightness fluctuations , simard & pritchet ( 1994 ) estimate ( m  m ) = 30.88 @xmath2 0.3 for ngc 4494 , and 30.08 @xmath2 0.07 for ngc 4565 . using the planetary nebulae luminosity function ( pnlf ) method , jacoby , ciardullo & harris ( 1996 ) get 30.54 @xmath2 0.05 for ngc 4494 and 30.21 @xmath2 0.08 for ngc 4565 . from the a mass model of the virgo region and an _ assumption _ about the ` triple value ambiguity ' in velocity , tully & shaya ( 1984 ) give distances to ngc 4494 and ngc 4565 which correspond to 30.34 and 30.21 respectively . we will assume an error of @xmath2 0.3@xmath4 on these estimates . finally , aaronson & mould ( 1983 ) find ( m  m ) = 30.42 @xmath2 0.32 for several spiral galaxies in the direction of the coma i cloud using the infrared tully  fisher relation . the distance modulus for ngc 4494 ranges from ( m  m ) = 30.34 ( mass models of tully & shaya 1984 ) to 30.88 ( sbf work of simard & pritchet 1994 ) with a weighted mean of 30.54 @xmath2 0.07 . our value for ngc 4278 ( 30.61 @xmath2 0.14 ) is consistent with the ngc 4494 mean . most recently , i band sbf measurements also indicate that ngc 4278 and ngc 4494 have essentially the same distance modulus , albeit at the upper range of values listed in table 2 ( tonry 1996 ) . for ngc 4565 the weighted mean distance modulus is 30.10 @xmath2 0.05 . this is 0.4@xmath4 or 2 mpc closer than ngc 4494 . this suggests that ngc 4565 lies in the foreground relative to ngc 4494 . it has been suggested that the coma i cloud may consist of two sub  groups , one around ngc 4565 and the other associated with the s0 galaxy ngc 4274 and ngc 4278 ( de vaucouleurs 1976 ) . this claim was questioned by gregory & thompson ( 1977 ) who found no particular evidence that the coma i cloud formed two sub  groups . however , they did note that the group formed a bar  like structure of dimensions 0.9 @xmath8 2.5 mpc and that the galaxies with the _ lower _ velocities tend to be systematically fainter , i.e. located further from us . table 2 shows that in each case , other workers found ngc 4494 to be more distant than ngc 4565 for a given distance method . our preferred interpretation is that both ngc 4494 and ngc 4278 are at the same distance and are located at the far end of the coma i cloud , whereas ngc 4565 is located 2 mpc closer at the front end of the group . aaronson & mould ( 1983 ) caution that the redshifts for galaxies in the coma i cloud may not correlate well with distance , given the proximity of the group to the virgo cluster . nevertheless , we will attempt to estimate the hubble constant from our measurements . if we calculate the mean velocity of the eight galaxies associated with ngc 4274 sub  group ( de vaucouleurs 1976 ) , and include ngc 4494 , we get 880 km s@xmath15 . the correction for motion with respect to the local group using solution number 2 of yahil , tammann & sandage ( 1977 ) is @xmath3 40 km s@xmath15 , giving 840 km s@xmath15 . the virgocentric infall component from tammann & sandage ( 1985 ) is @xmath3 200 km s@xmath15 , which gives a corrected recession velocity of 1020 km s@xmath15 . using a distance modulus of 30.54 and this corrected velocity we estimate a hubble constant of @xmath3 80 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 . finally , we have derived the local ( within 100@xmath9 radius ) and total gc specific frequency ( @xmath16 ) for each galaxy following the method described in forbes ( 1996 ) . these give similar results of @xmath3 5 for ngc 4278 and @xmath3 2 for ngc 4494 . the richness of the gc system around ngc 4494 appears to lower than that of a typical elliptical ( @xmath16 @xmath3 5 ; van den bergh 1995 ) .", "using wfpc2 data of forbes ( 1996 ) we have fit the globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) of two ellipticals , ngc 4278 and ngc 4494 . the first of which is generally thought to lie in the coma i cloud , whereas the latter has been suggested to lie in the background . both the gaussian and @xmath10 profile fits give similar results , namely a turnover magnitude of m@xmath5 = 23.23 @xmath2 0.11 for ngc 4278 and m@xmath5 = 23.07 @xmath2 0.13 for ngc 4494 . the fitted dispersions ( @xmath7 @xmath3 1.1@xmath4 ) are somewhat smaller than typical values for other ellipticals . the limiting magnitude , as determined by completeness tests , is about 2 magnitudes fainter than these values . we derive distance modulii of 30.61 @xmath2 0.14 and 30.50 @xmath2 0.15 for ngc 4278 and ngc 4494 respectively , assuming an absolute turnover magnitude of m@xmath6 = 7.62 @xmath2 0.08 from sandage & tammann ( 1995 ) and a small metallicity correction based on the precepts of ashman ( 1995 ) . we compare our distance measure with the ground  based gclf study of fleming ( 1995 ) and other distance determinations for galaxies in the coma i cloud . our distance modulii lie within the range of published values . we conclude that both ngc 4278 and ngc 4494 _ are _ members of the coma i cloud , and speculate that they lie at the far end of a bar structure ; the near end of which is associated with ngc 4565 .

( 3200 ) phaethon is also a b - type asteroid and shows the existence of aqueous alteration materials @xcite . in addition , water - ice and organics are detected on the surface of ( 24 ) themis @xcite and ( 65 ) cybele , which orbits along the outer edge of the main belt @xcite . the study of comet - asteroid transition objects provides keys to the dynamical origin and evolution of neos , the mutual collisions of small solar system bodies , the material differences between asteroids and comets , and the origin of earth s water . this study s purpose is to obtain the rotational states , shape model , and rotational color variations for 107p / wilson - harrington ( also know as ( 4015 ) wilson - harrington ; hereafter 107p ) , which is a representative comet - asteroid transition object . 107p was discovered accompanied by a faint cometary tail at palomar observatory in 1949 @xcite . the object , however , could not be tracked because of insufficient observations to determine an accurate orbit . later , a near - earth asteroid 1979va (= 4015 ) was discovered . subsequent observations identified asteroid ( 4015 ) 1979va and 107p as the same object . despite a devoted search , no cometary activity has been detected since the initial observation of 107p ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . 107p is an apollo asteroid whose orbital parameters are a = 2.639 au , e = 0.624 , i = 2.785@xmath14 , and the tisserand parameters ( @xmath15 ) = 3.08 . a numerical simulation by @xcite mentions that there is a 4 % chance that 107p has a jfc origin and a 65% chance it has an origin in the outer main - belt region . taxonomically , it is categorized as a cf - type @xcite . the reflectance spectrum in the region 38006200  is similar to ( 3200 ) phaethon @xcite . the thermal properties of 107p have been investigated by mid - infrared photometry with nasa s spitzer telescope @xcite . these observations show that the beaming parameter , the diameter , and the albedo are @xmath16 = 1.39 @xmath17 0.26 , @xmath18 = 3.46 @xmath17 0.32 @xmath19 , and @xmath20 = 0.059 @xmath17 0.011 , respectively . the rotational period of 107p has been reported to be 3.556 @xmath2 and 6.10 @xmath17 0.05 @xmath2 by @xcite and @xcite , respectively . @xcite ascribes the difference of the two reports to the noisy data of @xcite because of the weather conditions . the few days observation in both reports , however , is not enough to determine the correct rotational period . longer observations are required to derive the correct rotational period and other physical properties . we hypothesize that 107p migrates to the neo region from the outer main - belt region inhabited by six of seven known mbcs , and impacts with small objects could eject dust and/or expose sub - surface ice that then trigger 107p s cometary activity . post - mbc , 107p is capable of becoming host to water - ice , organics , and aqueous alteration materials . in this hypothesis , the impacts influence would be apparent in the rotational states and/or the surface color variations . we had an opportunity to observe 107p from august 2009 to march 2010 . our long observation campaigns enable us to derive the rotational states , shape model , and rotational color variations . furthermore , the orbit of 107p makes it accessible by spacecraft . a more advanced sample return mission from a d - type asteroid or an asteroid - comet transition object is envisioned in japan . one candidate is 107p @xcite . clarification of the physical properties of 107p is important to the design of the future mission . if we are able to obtain 107p s physical properties , the data will be useful to revise the physical model of @xcite , similar to the hayabusa-2 target 162173 ( 1999ju3 ) whose physical model was reconstructed by both thermal observations and the lightcurve @xcite . this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we describe the observations made and the data reduction . in section 3 , we mention the rotational states and shape model of 107p . in section 4 , we focus on the possibility of tumbling motion and the existence of a binary . finally , we summarize the physical model of 107p and discuss the feasibility of a sample return mission .", "we conducted the photometric observation campaigns of 107p with five small- and medium -

dimensional fourier series and the physical model of tumbling could be constructed . the two - dimensional fourier series is described in the following form    @xmath41\\\\ \\nonumber             & + & \\sum^{m}_{k=1}\\sum^{m}_{j =- m}\\left[c_{jk}\\cos\\left(\\frac{2{\\pi}j}{p_{\\psi}}+\\frac{2{\\pi}k}{p_{\\phi}}\\right)t\\right.\\\\              & + & \\left . s_{jk}\\sin\\left(\\frac{2{\\pi}j}{p_{\\psi}}+\\frac{2{\\pi}k}{p_{\\phi}}\\right)t\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath42 is the order , @xmath43 is the mean reduced light flux , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the fourier coefficients for the linear combination of the two frequencies @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , and @xmath48 is the time . substituting @xmath42 = @xmath49 , @xmath50 = @xmath0 @xmath1 , and @xmath51 = @xmath3 @xmath1 for 107p , we obtain a fitting curve , as shown in fig . the fitting curve adequately reconstructs the trend of the lightcurve . however , since the sidereal rotation period and the processing period have a commensurability of 3:1 , the lightcurve can also be reconstructed using the one - dimensional fourier series of sixth order . as we mentioned in section 3.2 , the physical model is possibly constructed using a lam of @xmath4:@xmath5:@xmath6 = 1.0:1.0:1.6 , ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) or ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , @xmath52 = @xmath11 , @xmath50 = @xmath0 @xmath1 , and @xmath51 = @xmath3 @xmath1 . although @xcite mentions that a tumbling asteroid generally does not return to the same orientation in any single period , the approximately equal length of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for 107p suggests a negligible change for the nutation angle . therefore , 107p can return to the same orientation every @xmath0 @xmath1 . these circumstances imply that 107p might be a tumbling object .    assuming 107p is a tumbler , external forces are required to trigger the motion . impacts of small objects , tidal encounters with planets , and yorp effects are suggested by @xcite . though 107p is a neo , the object did not have an encounter with earth in 1949 . in the case of km - size objects , the efficient onset of tumbling by yorp requires a longer timescale than that of collision with small objects @xcite . therefore , we propose the impact of small objects as a probable cause for tumbling of 107p . the orbital origin of 107p has a high possibility of being from the outer mba region inhabited by mbcs . one possibility is that the cometary activities of mbcs are caused by impacts of small objects . we can consider that 107p is originally an object like an mbc and impacts with small objects in the neo region could eject dust and/or expose sub - surface ice that then trigger 107p s cometary activity . when we suppose that the collisional excitation happened in 1949 , the damping timescale @xcite is expressed as    @xmath53    where @xmath18 is the mean diameter of tumblers in kilometer units and @xmath54 is a constant of about 17 ( uncertain by about a factor of 2.5 ) . the units of @xmath50 and @xmath55 are hours and billion ( @xmath56 ) of years , respectively . since the damping timescale of around @xmath57 @xmath58 is long enough , 107p would continue tumbling even if the impact occurred before 1949 . we describe the situation in which 107p hosts a binary . in order to confirm the existence of a binary , the detection of mutual eclipse events is required in the lightcurve . the mutual eclipse events were not detected in the observations of @xcite and @xcite because of the viewing angle , the lower photometric precision , or the absence of the binary . on the other hand , we detected the around same flux decrease in every 0.50 phase . therefore , the existence of the binary is conceivable as the other interpretation of the shape model c. if we define the flux decrease around the phase of 0.15 ( or 0.30 , 0.45 ) and 0.65 ( or 0.80 , 0.95 ) in fig . 6 as the primary ( secondary ) eclipse and the secondary ( primary ) eclipse , respectively , the orbital period of the binary is @xmath0 @xmath1 . supposing a circular orbit and negligible mass for the binary , the semi - major axis is described as    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the gravitational constant , @xmath61 is the mass of 107p , and @xmath62 is the orbital period of the binary . for the sake of simplicity , when assuming that 107p is spherical with the diameter of 3.46 @xmath19 @xcite and a typical density of 2 @xmath63 , the semi - major axis is around 3.65 @xmath19 . in the case of the same albedo for 107p and the binary , the flux decrease of the total eclipse ( @xmath64 ) satisfies the following relationship @xcite    @xmath65,\\ ] ]    where @xmath66 is the radius of the binary and @xmath67 is the radius of 107p . since the typical flux decrease is @xmath680.05 @xmath69 in fig . 6 , the radius of the binary is around 0.4 @xmath19 . when we assume the orbital plane of 107p accords with the line of sight from an observer , the inclination of the binary as an occulter satisfies    @xmath70    here , @xmath71 is the inclination of the binary for the orbital plane of 107p is less than 36@xmath14 in the 107p system . if @xmath71 is zero , the eclipse duration is estimated to be @xmath680.05 @xmath1 . the term is around one - sixth of the orbital period and consistent with the interval of lightcurve peaks of fig . moreover , the binary hypothesis indicates that the double - peak period of the lightcurve without the eclipse becomes @xmath72 @xmath1 . as we mentioned in section 3.1 , the period of @xmath72 @xmath1 as the sidereal rotation of 107p is not likely . alternatively , the lightcurve without the eclipse might be a quadruple - peak lightcurve whose period is @xmath0 @xmath1 . though the quadruple - peak lightcurve is rare , the period could compatibly account for all the past reports . in addition , the situation shows that the sidereal rotation of 107p and the orbital periods of the binary are locked with @xmath0 @xmath1 . the period of @xmath3 @xmath1 is explained by the period between the egress time of the primary ( secondary ) eclipse and the ingress time of the secondary ( primary ) eclipse .    the promising mechanisms for formation of asteroid binaries are the rotational - fission due to the spin - up by yorp effects ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , tidal encounter with planets ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the escaping ejecta by the collisions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . the mechanisms have a lot in common with the cause of tumbling . fissions and collisions in every mechanism can trigger 107p s cometary activity . the possible existence of a binary is consistent with the past cometary activity .", "this study revealed the physical properties of 107p by a photometric observation campaign . we detected the lightcurve periodicity to be @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath3 @xmath1 with a commensurability of 3:1 . the multiband photometry indicates that the taxonomy class of 107p is c - type . no clear rotational color variations are confirmed on the surface . we suggested two models to explain the different interpretations of the lightcurve periodicity . the commensurability reflects tumbling with the sidereal rotation period of @xmath0 @xmath1 and the precession period of @xmath3 @xmath1 . the shape is a lam of @xmath4:@xmath5:@xmath6 = 1.0:1.0:1.6 . around the same length of @xmath4 and @xmath5 shows the nutation angle is approximately constant at @xmath11 . the direction of total rotational angular momentum is around @xmath7 , @xmath8 , or @xmath9 , @xmath10 . 107p returns to the same orientation every @xmath0 @xmath1 by retrograde motion . impacts of small objects are suggested as a cause for the tumbling and comet activity . alternatively , the past comet activity itself is thought to be a cause of the tumbling , like a 1p / halley @xcite . 107p is not a tumbler . the sidereal rotation period is @xmath0 @xmath1 . the shape is roughly spherical but slightly hexagonal with a sam of @xmath4:@xmath5:@xmath6 = 1.5:1.0:1.0 . the pole orientation is around @xmath12 , @xmath13 . the sense of rotation is retrograde . the lightcurve of commensurability would reflect a discriminative appearance like ( 2867 ) steins , which has been explored by the rosetta spacecraft @xcite . otherwise , the lightcurve also indicates the possibility of hosting a binary whose orbital period is @xmath0 @xmath1 . the existence of a binary is also consistent with the past cometary activity . finally , we describe the mission feasibility for 107p . the orbit accessible by spacecraft makes 107p a promising target for a sample - return mission . if 107p is not a tumbling object , the moderate rotational period of @xmath0 @xmath1 would enable us to obtain a sample by the touchdown of a spacecraft , whereas touchdown on 107p would require a difficult maneuver if 107p is a tumbler . in that case , a multi - fly - by mission that combines with the sample return mission for another target would become a hopeful plan .", "we appreciate the observational campaign participants , especially dr . ryosuke nakamura and dr . masanao abe , for their dedicated coordination of the campaign and encouragement . we also acknowledge the japan space forum . this work was financially supported in part by a grant -

baseline accelerator experiments  @xcite . it is important not only to investigate the potential of current and upcoming long baseline experiments to determine the neutrino oscillation parameters , but also to probe for the possible existence of non - standard neutrino interactions , nsi , for short . the latter are expected in most models of neutrino mass generation , such as seesaw - type schemes  @xcite and will play a crucial role since they will shed light on the scale characterizing this so - far elusive mass generation mechanism . the interest on probing for the existence of nsi has been growing over recent years , thanks also to the increasing precision of upcoming experiments  @xcite and to the fact that the current oscillation interpretation is not yet fully robust  @xcite so one needs to scrutinize the interplay between oscillations and nsi in future experiments  @xcite . a wide class of non - standard neutrino interactions may be parametrized at low energies by the effective lagrangian @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the fermi constant and the parameters @xmath3 characterize the strength of the nsi . for simplicity , these are assumed to be real . the chiral projectors @xmath4 denote @xmath5 , while @xmath6 and @xmath7 label the three neutrino flavors , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a first generation charged sm fermion ( @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) . collider experiments produce well - controlled and clean muon neutrino beams , with just a small component of electron neutrinos , while tau neutrino beams are unavailable . as a result one can expect that the muon neutrino nsi parameters , @xmath14 are better constrained in comparison with other neutrino flavors . this is indeed the case for the interaction with electrons  @xcite . however , for the interaction of neutrinos with quarks , although neutrino nucleon scattering has a very long history since cdhs  @xcite and charm  @xcite , the accuracy of these early experiments was worse than that of the more recent nutev experiment , which has measured the @xmath15 interaction with a very high accuracy  @xcite , reporting a discrepancy with the standard model predictions . while this may be interpreted as a hint of new physics , indicating at face - value a potentially non - zero value for the nsi parameters @xmath16  @xcite , uncertainties coming from qcd corrections might have been underestimated  @xcite . moreover , as expected , limits on muon neutrino nsi coupling strengths  @xcite derived on the basis of 1-loop dressing of the neutrino effective four - fermion vertex can not be formulated rigorously . indeed these are highly model dependent and , even when a full analysis is performed , including all the necessary diagrams required in order to obtain gauge - invariance , one does not strongly constrain the flavor changing parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18  @xcite .    recently , two new determinations of the standard model electroweak mixing parameter @xmath19 from the nutev measurement have been presented  @xcite . given that the most stringent model  independent bounds on @xmath20 come from the nutev data , it is necessary to consider the effect of including these new corrections on the nutev results . therefore , the main goal of this paper is to the review the current status of the constraints for the @xmath21 non - standard neutrino interactions in view of the larger uncertainties indicated by these recent papers . in so - doing we will not only take into account the new results mentioned above , but also combine the laboratory constraints with the restrictions inferred from the analysis of atmospheric neutrino data . in order to obtain these constraints we adopt as a simplifying working hypotesis that all nsi parameters other than @xmath22 vanish . we will see that restricting ourselves to a two - generation nsi global analysis we obtain relatively stringent constraints on the nsi interactions for muon neutrinos , at the few @xmath23 level , thanks largely to the interplay of atmospheric data . the paper is planned as follows . in the next section we will make a brief description of the neutrino nucleon scattering parameters that are relevant for our analysis . in section  [ sec : constr - from - nutev ] , we will discuss the nutev data and their implications for the nsi parameters , while in sec . [ sec : constr - from - charm ] we discuss the previous experiments charm and cdhs . in section  [ sec : comb - with - atmosph ] we combine this information with constraints coming from the analysis of atmospheric neutrinos in order to obtain global constraints on the nsi parameters . finally , in section  [ sec : concl - future - prosp ] we will give our conclusions and discuss the prospects for further improvement in the determination of nsi parameters .", "neutrino scattering experiments provide one of the most precise probes of the weak neutral current , and have been often been used to measure the electroweak mixing angle @xmath19 . in particular , it has been shown that experiments with an isoscalar target are particularly convenient , since in this case the uncertainties due to unknown corrections to the qcd parton model cancel to a large extent  @xcite . for an isoscalar target of up and down - type quarks , the largest contributions to the neutral and charged current cross sections are related by isospin invariance and their ratio can be written as : @xmath25 @xmath26 where one introduces the ratio @xmath27 and the coupling constants are defined as @xmath28 with p = l , r . in the presence of nsi of muon neutrinos with quarks , these coupling constants are replaced by : @xmath29    the quantities @xmath30 and @xmath31 have been measured in the past at the cdhs  @xcite and charm experiments  @xcite . another well - known observable for the study of deep inelastic neutrino scattering on an isoscalar target is the paschos - wolfenstein ( pw ) ratio defined as  @xcite @xmath32 this ratio is particularly useful because it depends very weakly on the hadronic structure of the nucleus target and it is largely insensitive to the uncertainties resulting from charm production as well as charm and strange sea distributions . however , the simultaneous measurement of neutral current cross sections for neutrinos and antineutrinos requires the use of separate neutrino and antineutrino beams . the nutev collaboration makes use of this observable in order to measure the electroweak mixing angle . actually , they measure experimentally the ratios @xmath33 and @xmath34 , shown in eqs . ( [ eq : ratio - nu ] ) and ( [ eq : ratio - antinu ] ) , which later transform in the paschos - wolfenstein ratio @xmath35 through their fit procedure .", "the nutev collaboration used high statistics neutrino and antineutrino beams to measure their neutral and charged current cross sections on an iron target . using a statistical separation of the nc and cc event candidates , based on the length of each event in the detector , nutev reported experimental values for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , as mentioned in the previous section . a numerical fit of these results provides a measurement of the left and right  handed neutral couplings to the light quarks  @xcite : @xmath36 notice the discrepancy with respect to the standard model expectations  @xcite : @xmath37 due to the nutev preference for a lower effective left  handed coupling , almost 3@xmath38 away from the sm expectation . similarly , a value for the electroweak mixing angle in the on  shell scheme was obtained from a numerical fit : @xmath39 which is @xmath40 away from the value determined in global precision electroweak fits  @xcite : @xmath41        ascribing the discrepancy between the nutev result for the left coupling @xmath42 and its prediction within the standard model to the existence of a non - zero nsi - operator , the authors in ref . @xcite obtained a positive hint for non - zero values of the left flavor - conserving nsi couplings @xmath43 and @xmath44 . on the other hand , for the case of flavor changing nsi parameters they obtained limits on the nsi @xmath45 couplings . however , several corrections and theoretical uncertainties coming , for instance , from nuclear effects and next - to - leading - order corrections were neglected in the original nutev collaboration analysis . although the presence of nsi could explain the discrepancy of the nutev results with the sm , before claiming that they provide a hint of new physics , one needs make sure that all uncertainties are carefully taken into account . as a matter of fact several attempts have been made to interpret the nutev results just in terms of conventional physics , see for example refs.@xcite . here we re - analyze the impact of taking into account carefully the uncertainties in deriving restrictions on physics beyond the sm as parametrized by the nsi lagrangian in eq . ( [ eq : efflag ] ) . in particular , we will focus on the two most recent re - analysis of the nutev data given in refs . @xcite in order to obtain constraints on neutrino nsi coupling strengths . the nnpdf collaboration reports more precise estimates of the strange and anti - strange parton distribution functions , leading to a new value for the electroweak mixing angle  @xcite : @xmath46    on the other hand the analysis in ref . @xcite takes into account three different corrections coming from nuclear effects , due to the excess of neutrons in iron , charge symmetry violation arising from up and down quark mass differences , and strange quarks . with all these corrections included , the following value for the electroweak mixing angle is extracted : @xmath47    one can see from eqs . ( [ sin : nnpdf ] ) and ( [ sin : bentz ] ) that the two re - calculated estimates for the electroweak mixing angle , with larger uncertainties , are consistent with the sm prediction , as seen in fig . [ fig : sin2 ] . in order to determine the resulting restrictions set by nutev data on the strength of nsi couplings , in view of the corrections discussed above  @xcite , we adopt the paschos - wolfenstein ratio @xmath35 . we perform a @xmath48 analysis using the paschos - wolfenstein ratio derived from each re - analysis of nutev data , and we compare these results with the standard model prediction for @xmath35 . as a result of this simple statistical analysis , and allowing for one non - zero nsi coupling at a time , we obtain the following constraints at 90% c.l . : @xmath49 when using the results in nnpdf , and @xmath50 for the bentz et al . case . for both analyses we observe two allowed regions for most of the nsi couplings , reflecting the degeneracy seen in fig . [ fig : nsi - fd ] . allowing now for the simultaneous presence of left and right  handed nsi neutrino couplings we obtain the results given in fig . [ fig : nsi - fd ] . for convenience , we present the constraints in terms of the vector and axial couplings instead of using the @xmath51 basis . this makes it easier to proceed when combining with the atmospheric data ( see below ) . the left panel holds for the case of a down - type quark , while the right one holds for an up - type quark . one can see that , in both cases , there is a two - fold degeneracy in the values of the nsi parameters , which is easily understood from eq . ( [ eq : pw ] ) , @xmath52 , this equation represents a hyperbola centered at ( @xmath53 , @xmath52 ) = ( -@xmath54 , -@xmath55 ) . after the change of variables to ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) , the hyperbola is rotated to the one shown in fig . [ fig : nsi - fd ] . ] .        on the other hand , for the case of flavor changing nsi , our analysis gives the allowed region shown in fig . [ fig : nsi - fc ] . in this case the allowed regions for the two chiral components of the flavor - changing nsi couplings of @xmath58- and @xmath13-type quarks are the same , hence we show our results in only one plot . note that here the allowed region is a hyperbola centered at the origin ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) = ( 0,0 ) , displaying a remnant of the two - fold degeneracy seen for the flavor conserving case . in agreement with eqs .

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]", "we have re - analysed the constraints on novel non - standard neutrino interactions of muon neutrinos with quarks which follow from current accelerator experiments . in particular , we have re - considered the results of the nutev experiment in view of a new evaluation of the nutev systematic uncertainties . we have combined the restrictions following from accelerator data with those coming from recent atmospheric data analysis , which plays a crucial role in removing degeneracies . we have found that , although constraints for muon neutrinos are better than those applicable to tau or electron neutrinos , they are not as strong as previously believed . while previous authors report bounds of the order of few @xmath62 , we find that , taking into account the current estimates of the nutev uncertainties , constraints are now of the order of few @xmath63 . our results are summarized in table  [ table : final results ] . even weaker constraints would hold in a generalized three - generation framework . although muon neutrino nsi couplings are often neglected  @xcite , one should keep in mind the weakness of the existing limits . note that these results will not be improved by the inclusion of data from the long baseline experiment minos @xcite , given its poor sensitivity to matter effects when compared with that of atmospheric data , at least in a two - neutrino analysis . as a result minos will not significantly restrict the neutral current nsi couplings discussed here , and the same is expected for opera  @xcite . however , future `` clean '' measurements of the oscillation parameters combined with the nsi - contaminated parameters determined by atmospheric experiments would be helpful . certainly it would also help considerably to have a very long baseline setup as envisaged in the long baseline neutrino experiment ( lbne ) project currently proposed , capable of probing earth matter effects with enhanced sensitivity  @xcite . last , but not least , we note that a new high statistics neutrino scattering experiment , nusong has been proposed  @xcite , with the same goals as nutev . one of its main tasks would be to probe new physics in the neutrino couplings . expectations are that nusong would improve the nutev sensitivities on muon - neutrino quark scattering by a factor 2 at least , which would translate into a similar improvement on the nsi sensitivities with respect to those obtained from nutev . we would like to thank i. cloet for useful comments about his work in ref . work supported by micinn grants fpa2008 - 00319/fpa , csd2009 - 00064 , by prometeo/2009/091 , by conacyt and by eu network pitn - ga-2009 - 237920 . m.t .  acknowledges financial support from csic under the jae - doc programme . particle data group , k.  nakamura _ et  al . _ , j. phys . * g37 * , 075021 ( 2010 ) . h.  nunokawa , s.  j. parke and j.  w.  f. valle , prog . . phys . * 60 * , 338 ( 2008 ) . t.  schwetz , m.  tortola and j.  w.  f.  valle , arxiv:1103.0734 [ hep - ph ] . t.  schwetz , m.  tortola and j.  w.  f. valle , new j. phys . * 10 * , 113011 ( 2008 ) , [ 0808.2016 ] . m.  maltoni , t.  schwetz , m.  a. tortola and j.  w.  f. valle , new j. phys . * 6 * , 122 ( 2004 ) , hep - ph/0405172 . j.  schechter and j.  w.  f. valle , phys . * d22 * , 2227 ( 1980 ) ;

like object with vacuum quantum numbers . the regge approach  @xcite of the pre - qcd era provides a working phenomenology to describe such processes in a hadron basis since no parton structure is resolved . the idea @xcite to introduce a hard scale in a diffractive process opened the possibility to examine these processes at the level of quarks and gluons in the modern framework of qcd . the discovery of such _ diffractive hard scattering _ was made by the ua8 experiment @xcite by observing high-@xmath3 jets in single diffractive events in @xmath4 collisions at cern . many other hard processes in diffractive events have been observed later on , for a review see e.g.@xcite . of special importance are the measurements of diffractive deep inelastic scattering ( ddis ) at the electron - proton collider hera @xcite , where the well understood point - like electromagnetic interaction probes the parton structure in the diffractive reaction mechanism . this has resulted in theoretical descriptions of data based on essentially two different approaches , one being pomeron exchange in regge phenomenology and the other colour screening via soft gluon exchange in qcd . the pomeron approach starts with the initial proton state fluctuating in a soft non - perturbative process into a proton and a pomeron . the latter is assumed to have a partonic structure which is probed by the momentum transfer @xmath5 of the deep inelastic photon exchange to produce the hadronic final state , well separated in rapidity from the final state proton carrying most of the longitudinal momentum of the beam proton . hera data on ddis can then be described @xcite as a product of an effective pomeron flux factor from regge phenomenology and deep inelastic scattering on the pomeron having parametrised parton density functions ( pdf ) @xcite . alternatively , one may parametrise diffractive structure functions without an explicit pomeron flux but instead being conditionally dependent on the momentum of the final proton .    however , this approach is not universal in the sense that such parametrisations do not reproduce diffractive hard scattering data in hadron - hadron collisions . for example , such pomeron pdfs overestimate substantially the cross - sections for diffractive hard scattering processes , such as production of jets or @xmath6 , at the tevatron @xcite . this has called for introducing a gap survival suppression factor @xmath7 , which can be given a qualitative theoretical motivation but which is difficult to calculate quantitatively . the colour exchange approach starts instead with the hard scattering process and then adds softer gluon exchanges to achieve the effective colour singlet exchange in diffractive processes . thus , the underlying hard process is assumed to be the same as in the corresponding non - diffractive process and its momenta naturally not affected by other exchanges at much lower momentum transfer scales . however , the formation of confining colour fields may well be affected by the softer gluon exchanges and thereby the hadronisation process such that a different distribution of the final state hadrons emerges . for example , when different colour singlet string - fields emerge separated in rapidity they will hadronise into two hadron systems separated by a rapidity gap with no hadrons . a simple , but phenomenologically rather successful model of this kind is the soft colour interaction ( sci ) model  @xcite added to the lepto @xcite and pythia @xcite monte - carlo event generators . a large variety of diffractive data could then be reproduced with essentially the same value of a single new parameter , introduced to give the probability for exchange a soft colour octet gluon between any pair of partons . this colour exchange alter the formation of the colour string - fields and hence the application of the conventional lund string hadronisation model results in a different topology of the hadronic final state . the model gives an essentially correct description of diffractive dis @xmath8 scattering at hera @xcite as well as diffractive events at the tevatron having jets or quarkonia @xcite or gauge bosons @xcite . it has therefore been applied for predictions , e.g. of diffractive higgs production in double gap processes at lhc @xcite . the gap survival factor @xmath7 often used in other kinds of models , is not necessary here since the full event simulation accounts for such effects resulting in correct rates for the investigated diffractive processes in @xmath8 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 collisions . other models of a similar nature , with different forms of colour exchange , have been developed . the gal model @xcite for example considers soft colour exchanges between strings with a probability that favours minimization of the strings area in energy - momentum coordinates . a recent development of such colour string reconnection models makes a more elaborate account for @xmath11 colour statistics @xcite . a theoretical qcd basis for basic colour exchanges has been proposed in @xcite and , in a more elaborated form , in @xcite . the basic hard scattering process is treated by conventional perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) . its large momentum scale implies that it occurs on a small space - time scale compared to the bound state proton and is thus embedded in the proton . therefore , the emerging hard - scattered partons propagate through the proton s colour field and may interact with it . the amplitude for such multiple gluon exchanges is calculated in the eikonal approximation to all orders in perturbation theory resulting in an analytic expression for such a colour screening effect . the theoretical approach @xcite used here to resum multigluon exchange has similarities with the one in @xcite giving a similar eikonal factor @xmath12 in the amplitude , but there are also differences as will be discussed below . it is this amplitude that we here develop into a probabilistic model . we implement it for two different monte carlo event generators : lepto for general deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering including first order qcd matrix elements and parton showers based on conventional @xmath13 evolution from the dglap equations @xcite , and as well for cascade @xcite specialised on small-@xmath0 electron - proton scattering based on the off - shell @xmath14 first order matrix element and @xmath2 factorisation with ccfm evolution @xcite and unintegrated gluon density of the proton . the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : dynamic - rescattering ] we describe the basic process with the colour screening . section [ sec : ddis - via - dcs ] discusses the resulting cross - section for diffractive deep inelastic scattering and its monte carlo implementation . section [ sec : res ] shows our results in comparison to hera data . finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] presents our conclusions .", "in the virtue of the sci model , the skeleton of both inclusive and diffractive ( with rapidity gaps and/or leading proton ) dis process is provided by the same perturbative qcd diagram illustrated in fig . [ fig : ddis ] . a parton with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath15 in the initial proton at the starting scale @xmath16 for pqcd is evolved to smaller momentum fractions , but higher transverse momenta and virtualities up to a hard scale @xmath17 . here , a virtual photon @xmath18 with momentum @xmath19 and virtuality @xmath20 resolves a quark at bjorken @xmath0 @xmath21 at small @xmath0 the process will dominantly be initiated by a gluon , which can radiate and splits into a @xmath22 pair . the total momentum fraction taken from the proton is @xmath23 , and the total mass @xmath24 of the parton system denoted as @xmath25 in fig . [ fig : ddis ] is @xmath26 for a @xmath27 pair ( without additional gluons ) having with quark transverse momentum @xmath2 and longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath28 , the corresponding invariant mass is @xmath29     with a subsequent rescattering of the @xmath30 dipole off the target colour field ( left panel ) . schematic diagram of the diffractive dis process @xmath31 accounting for final state rescattering by multiple gluon exchange at @xmath32 and perturbative parton shower off initial state parton which builds up the diffractive system @xmath25 ( right panel ) . the latter can be separated from the leading proton ( or small - mass system @xmath33 ) by a rapidity gap . the final state radiation is not shown as it does not affect the overall kinematics of the @xmath25 system.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]   with a subsequent rescattering of the @xmath30 dipole off the target colour field ( left panel ) . schematic diagram of the diffractive dis process @xmath31 accounting for final state rescattering by multiple gluon exchange at @xmath32 and perturbative parton shower off initial state parton which builds up the diffractive system @xmath25 ( right panel ) . the latter can be separated from the leading proton ( or small - mass system @xmath33 ) by a rapidity gap . the final state radiation is not shown as it does not affect the overall kinematics of the @xmath25 system.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ]    at large @xmath34 , the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the incident proton are dominated by valence quarks leaving practically no chance for the proton to survive such an interaction , and hence resulting in a non - diffractive event . at small @xmath34 , however , the pdfs are dominated by gluons , and the partonic system @xmath25 is created in photon - gluon fusion @xmath35 as depicted in fig . [ fig : ddis ] . in this case , the momentum exchange via multiple soft gluons with a small net fraction @xmath36 between the proton and the perturbative @xmath25 systems does not significantly change the momenta of partons emerging from the hard scattering . however , they do change the colour structure of the resulting @xmath25 and @xmath33 systems . the original sci model captures the main effects in many processes as ddis at hera and diffractive hard scattering at the tevatron . despite this success , it is not derived from a perturbative qcd amplitude . for the case of ddis , a derivation of the amplitude for the colour screened process has been done based on perturbative qcd in the large @xmath37 limit @xcite and provides a theoretical basis for the ddis process in terms of colour exchanges . it improves on the previous description by introducing a dependence on the kinematical details of the event which also leads to colour transparency . we start with the outline of the resummed colour screening amplitude and the derivation of probability for an event - by - event treatment in an event generator .    consider the ddis amplitude in impact parameter representation in the target rest frame which corresponds to the colour dipole picture of the process . the lowest fock component of the virtual photon @xmath38 corresponds to its fluctuation to a @xmath30 dipole with transverse separation @xmath39 in the colour background field of the traget proton at impact distance @xmath40 from its centre . the prepared fock component then propagates through the field in the proton and softly interacts with it such that it can , in principle , change its colour but not kinematics ( the dipole size is frozen at the time scale of its propagation through the colour medium ) . we consider the forward limit where the total transverse momentum @xmath41 of gluon exchanges in the @xmath42-channel is small , @xmath43 . in this limit , as a straightforward consequence of the optical theorem in the limit of large @xmath44 c.m . energy , the ddis amplitude @xmath45 can be written with the ordinary gluon - initiated inclusive dis amplitude @xmath46 and the dynamical colour screening ( dcs ) amplitude @xmath47 as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the relative quark transverse momentum in the @xmath30 dipole in the lowest order subprocess @xmath50 .    the screening amplitude @xmath51 accounts for the soft gluon exchanges between the proton remnant @xmath33 and the rest of the final state commonly denoted as @xmath25 , with @xmath52 at the lowest order . these exchanges carry a small longitudinal fraction @xmath53 and the transverse momentum transfer @xmath54 is at a soft scale @xmath55 . @xmath51 is resummed to all orders in the large-@xmath56 limit where it acquires a simple eikonal form @xcite . @xmath57 here , @xmath58 is the colour factor for the single gluon exchange amplitude and @xmath59 is the effective coupling constant at the soft hadronic scale @xmath55 . the effective qcd coupling is not small in this case . several approaches dealing with the landau singularities at low momentum transfers were proposed in the literature , e.g.  @xcite . in practice , we use the infrared - stable analytic perturbation theory ( apt ) approach  @xcite .    for our study we use similarly the inclusive amplitude @xmath60 in impact parameter space the fraction of the cross section with colour screening between the systems @xmath25 and @xmath33 is obtained from the ratio @xmath61 which defines the probability function for the overall colour singlet exchange . with @xmath62 , this leads to @xmath63 to apply this as the probability in a monte - carlo generated event at the parton level , we will associate @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and approximate by taking the average over the relative angle @xmath66 @xmath67 which is motivated by the fact that @xmath66 will be uniformly distributed in a sample of many collisions .     for different values of @xmath68 ( upper to lower curve ) ] the resulting colour screening probability is shown in fig . [ fig : rescatter - prob - for - angles ] , for different choices of @xmath59 which enters as a normalisation factor . two important characteristic properties can here be observed . first , infrared safety with the probability levelling off at large @xmath69 , which resembles the saturation feature of the dipole scattering amplitude . second , vanishing colour screening probability for small dipoles @xmath70 , which is compatible with the colour transparency property . our basic theoretical approach @xcite for resumming multiple gluon exchanges has similarities with the theory developed in @xcite and resulting in an amplitude with an eikonal factor of the form @xmath12 in similarity with eq . ( [ eik - formula ] ) above . that approach can also be applied to both inclusive and diffractive dis starting from the same hard matrix element and employing factorization and resummation of soft @xmath42-channel gluons . despite these similarities , there are significant differences . in @xcite all exchanged gluons are treated on the same footing via a wilson line resumming them into a color singlet exchange . our approach separates one `` leading '' gluon , carrying the largest @xmath0-fraction , from the rest of the exchanged gluons which are much softer , carrying @xmath71 . these softer gluons are resummed to all orders and are required to be in a color octet state that matches the leading gluon to an overall color singlet exchange that provide the mechanism for rapidity gap formation . our leading gluon is treated via conventional @xmath2-factorisation in terms of the unintegrated gluon distribution in the proton , thus providing a model which is explicitly the same for diffractive and inclusive scattering without introducing any new kind of parton distribution functions , cf eq . ( [ sigmad ] ) below . this is in contrast with the formalism in @xcite which introduces diffractive parton distribution functions ( pdf ) containing non - perturbative dynamics and interpreted as the probability to find a parton with a momentum fraction @xmath72 in the proton , provided the proton emerges intact with momentum fraction @xmath73 . such diffractive pdfs can be analyzed theoretically @xcite which may introduce model parameters to be determined from data .    naturally , one should study these , and other , theoretical approaches and via data find the optimal description of data to understand the rather complex diffractive processes in terms of basic theory and few free parameters . our approach has only two new parameters , which both have physical meanings that constrain their values to a rather narrow range . the following sections specify the monte carlo implementation of the model and show detailed numerical comparisons to data .", "the ddis cross section is then obtained using the inclusive cross section and standard inclusive parton densities together with the probability @xmath74 in eq . ( [ eq : prob - from - rb ] ) for dynamic colour screening resulting in @xmath75 where @xmath76 are the standard inclusive parton distributions . @xmath77 represents the differential distribution of the standard dis cross section in @xmath78 which is obtained from the parton evolution event - by - event in the monte carlo . since @xmath78 represents the transverse size of the @xmath22 together with the pqcd radiation and the amplitude for colour screening is dominated by a rescattering off large dipoles , we use the smallest @xmath2 difference within the partonic @xmath25-system and let @xmath79 . although this @xmath80 is typically related to the pqcd cutoff , the monte carlo simulation can give very small such relative @xmath2 due to random angular orientations of the momentum vectors . we therefore introduce a cut - off @xmath81 to avoid a spurious divergence and transverse sizes @xmath78 that are not perturbatively small . thus , we let @xmath82 . the impact parameter @xmath83 is related to the soft transverse momentum of the screening multiple gluon exchange , which is expected to be well below the factorisation scale for the pqcd processes . on the other hand @xmath84 is expected to be somewhat larger than the confining energy - momentum scale @xmath85{mev}$ ] in order for the screening process to occur fast enough that the proton state can stay quantum mechanically coherent into the final state . the colour screening probability therefore depends on the ratio @xmath69 given by @xmath86 where @xmath81 , as mentioned , regulates the divergence . the values of @xmath84 and @xmath81 constitute the two free parameters of the model and are to be determined from a comparison with experimental data . from the construction , we expect their values to be approximately between @xmath87 and the perturbative cutoff @xmath88 in the gluon pdf . using eq . ( [ eq : def - rb - ratio ] ) in eq . ( [ eq : prob - from - rb ] ) results in a probability @xmath89 for the effective colour screening that depends on the internal kinematics of the system @xmath25 . we calculate the diffractive reduced cross section @xmath90 within the same kinematic limits as applied by the experiment @xcite . in addition , we adopt two different notions of the diffractive cross section . the first definition @xmath91 is based on a forward remnant system with a mass @xmath92{gev}$ ] and proton quantum numbers . the other definition @xmath93 requires a large rapidity gap ( lrg ) of two units in pseudorapidity . this choice is potentially sensitive to the inner radiation structure of the system @xmath25 because the lrg is defined in terms of pseudorapidity . the emissions in the ccfm evolution @xcite are not strongly ordered in virtuality as they are by assumption in the dglap evolution @xcite . therefore , the parton in the hard interaction can no longer be approximated as on - shell and instead an off - shell matrix element is used for the hard interaction . likewise , the branching gluons in the ccfm evolution are described by an unintegrated gluon density function ( ugdf ) .    in the ccfm evolution , one effectively resums the leading logarithms in the energy splitting @xmath94 and @xmath95 , as well as the leading logarithms in @xmath5 . experimental data on the ddis cross section @xmath96 covers a wide kinematic range where , in particular , one can have @xmath97 . because of such potentially very different hard scales , we expect corrections from large logarithms to become important in certain parts of the phase space . because of eq . ( [ mxdef ] ) we expect the ccfm evolution to be better suited for the ddis observables , at least , in the case of @xmath98 when the large leading logs @xmath99 are properly treated . because of the soft divergence in the first order qcd matrix element , the hard process @xmath100 will favour an uneven splitting of the energy between the quarks . specifically , if we define the fraction of energy taken by the quark as @xmath28 , then the matrix elements have soft divergences as @xmath94 and @xmath95 for @xmath101 or @xmath102 , respectively . one aspect of the soft divergence is that it favors a rather large ratio between @xmath0 and the energy fraction @xmath103 of the parton entering the matrix element . specifically , in the matrix element @xmath100 one can have a large ratio @xmath104 without any additional radiation from the quark propagator . such a large @xmath105 is not accounted for in the initial state parton evolution . in the case of the matrix elements @xmath106 and @xmath107 plus dglap evolution this phase space is in part taken into account , but the dglap evolution does not resum potentially large @xmath108 . another aspect of the uneven splitting is that one of the quarks will be very forward in pseudorapidity in the lab frame when @xmath28 is close to the divergence . in this case , the quark can have a large enough forward momentum @xmath109 to populate the gap region and the event therefore does not contribute to the diffractive cross section as defined in terms of a lrg in spite of having a leading proton . the divergent behaviour is unphysical and is usually avoided with a cutoff . still , an inclusion of higher order effects may be important for the cross section and also for the inner structure within the @xmath25 system . in particular , the energy of the @xmath22 system may be shared by additional gluons and therefore significantly reduce the rapidity range of the final @xmath25-system and therefore can have an influence on the lrg observable .     in comparison with the h1 data @xcite . the model prediction uses dynamic colour screening with the parameters and and the cascade event generator with ccfm evolution . @xmath89 for the fitted parameters is shown in the upper - left corner . diffractive events in the model are defined as having a remnant system @xmath33 with proton quantum numbers and invariant mass @xmath92{gev}$ ] . rows for different values of @xmath110 are offset by a factor @xmath111 as indicated on the figure . ]      in order to study the dynamic colour screening in more detail , we interface the model with different monte carlo event generators . in particular , we employ the program lepto @xcite which offers first order qed and first order qcd matrix elements combined with dglap @xcite parton showering and collinear pdfs . as a second program we use cascade @xcite which offers @xmath112 with @xmath2-factorised off - shell matrix elements and ccfm evolution @xcite which is intended to account for potentially large logarithms of incident momentum fractions of radiated partons . the photon - gluon fusion matrix element @xmath113 illustrated also in fig . [ fig : ddis ] is the dominant contribution to the diffractive dis cross section at small @xmath0 . lepto includes this process as a first order qcd matrix element , as well as via a combination of the qed hard process @xmath114 augmented by a @xmath115 dglap splitting . cascade provides this process as an off - shell first order qcd matrix element , but not as a first order qed matrix element with parton splitting .    after generating events on parton level using matrix elements augmented with initial and final state parton showers , we apply the colour screening model before any special treatment of the remnant . in particular , we do not allow any cluster fragmentation of systems with a small invariant mass because the dynamic screening will potentially change the colour topology of the event before the scale of hadronization is reached and therefore change the possible outcomes of the fragmentation . this is understood as colour rescattering to happen on the scale between the perturbative cutoff at @xmath116{gev}$ ] and @xmath87 of hadronisation . the remnant system is in a monte carlo program treated by a non - perturbative model . for the case that the perturbative interaction resolves a gluon , which is the class of events which potentially leads to diffraction , the remnant is usually split into a @xmath117 pair with a certain sharing of momenta . this splitting typically introduces a relative transverse momentum representing the fermi motion in the bound state proton which is given by a gaussian distribution with a width @xmath118 . this relative @xmath2 affects the later hadronisation which introduces an uncertainty for the prediction of a forward proton spectrum . in this work , we are interested in diffraction defined by a forward small - mass system with proton quantum numbers or a large rapidity gap , which is insensitive to whether the hadronisation model maps the small - mass forward remnant state to a proton state or a resonance . all plots for the diffractive cross section in this paper show the reduced cross section @xmath119 which is related to the cross section via @xmath120 with @xmath121 given as @xmath122 with the negligible nucleon mass @xmath123 .    , @xmath124 and for different values of @xmath5 . as the hard scale increases , there is more phase space for initial state radiation available and we see more gluon branchings . as the number of gluon branchings increases , a larger part of the full perturbative event and specifically its @xmath110-value is described using ccfm evolution which leads to a more accurate differential cross section . ]     as in fig . [ fig : cascade_cutsnone_m01alphas70 ] but model results using the lepto event generator based on matrix elements for all hard processes to order @xmath125 and parton showers based on dglap @xmath1 evolution . the parameters for the dynamic colour screening model obtained from the fit against data @xcite are and . ]     but with a constant probability of @xmath126 fitted from this data . we observe that especially at small @xmath110 the resulting diffractive cross section has a significantly different slope with respect to @xmath5 and the description of data is not as good as in the case of the dynamic rescattering model . ]", "[ fig : cascade_cutsnone_m01alphas70 ] shows the diffractive cross section @xmath127 obtained with dynamic colour screening and the process @xmath128 from the cascade event generator with ccfm evolution . events are selected according to the forward small - mass system prescription which requires a remnant system @xmath33 with proton quantum numbers and invariant mass @xmath92{gev}$ ] . the two parameters of the rescattering model are fitted and we obtain and . these values are physically reasonable in the sense that both are between @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and that the typical transverse momentum scale @xmath84 of the proton background is smaller than the minimal transverse momentum scale @xmath81 of the partonic @xmath25 system . we note that there is an overall good agreement with experimental data over a very wide region of the kinematical space . this agreement is remarkable because the model does not introduce specialised diffractive parton distributions , but uses standard proton ugdfs as input and introduces only two new physically motivated parameters . nevertheless , we note that one specific kinematic region is not very well described , namely , where @xmath110 and @xmath5 are both small and @xmath34 is large . the discrepancy develops for @xmath129 and increases for decreasing @xmath5 in the range of a few @xmath130 . a qualitative understanding of the problem can here be obtained from the principles of parton evolution via gluon radiation . at small @xmath110 , meaning large @xmath131 compared to @xmath5 , large logarithms of @xmath132 become important . on the other hand , at small @xmath5 scales , the event is mainly described by the matrix element , whereas the shower activity is low , which leads to a relative damping of the cross section with respect to the data . this lower radiative activity is illustrated in fig . [ fig : branchings-3em2 - 17em3 ] in terms of the number of branchings in the parton evolution for different @xmath5 at a representative value of @xmath124 .    at very small @xmath133 there is a very long evolution path from the initial gluon with momentum fraction @xmath34 to a much smaller bjorken-@xmath0 at the quark - photon vertex . the cascade event generator has the advantage to resum both @xmath1 and @xmath134 contributions in its ccfm - based treatment of initial - state gluon radiation off the incoming gluon . however , gluon emissions from the quark propagator between the @xmath115 vertex and the quark - photon vertex ( _ cf . [ fig : ddis]b ) can also generate large @xmath134 contributions , in particular for the longest total evolution paths at very small @xmath110 . this radiation from the quark propagator can not be generated in cascade since the ccfm equation only includes gluon radiation from gluons and not from quarks . the simulation process starts by using the hard matrix element for @xmath135 , and then the initial gluon is evolved down to the starting scale of the proton state . thus , at very small @xmath110 in particular , there can be a substantial phase space available for gluon radiation off the quark propagator connecting to the virtual photon , which is not taken into account . gluon emission from the quark propagator can be taken into account by instead using the lepto monte carlo generator . it includes not only the hard matrix element for @xmath136 but also the other first order qcd process @xmath137 , where the gluon can be emitted from the incoming or outgoing quark , as well as the zeroth - order process @xmath114 . for both these processes , additional gluon radiation from the initial quark may occur through the initial - state parton showering , which in lepto is generated through conventional dglap evolution in @xmath1 , but without a resummation of @xmath134 contributions . [ fig : lepto_cutsnone ] shows the results of using lepto with the same dynamic colour screening model , with fitted parameter values and of expected magnitudes . the description of data is good in the inner region of the covered kinematic space , but with substantial discrepancies at small @xmath34 and very large @xmath110 . in the discussed problematic region , however , the agreement with data is better than that for cascade at large @xmath34 , small @xmath5 and small @xmath110 around 0.01 , although not at the very smallest @xmath138 . this indicates that , as discussed , emissions from the quark propagator is of some importance , but accounting for large @xmath134 contributions is also needed . no presently available event generator include all the mentioned effects that seems necessary in order to describe the diffractive cross - section over the entire kinematic region . the indication is , however , that combining all available theoretical formalisms in perturbative qcd , i.e. matrix elements and parton showers including @xmath1 and @xmath134 resummations , with the dynamical colour screening model presented here should provide a working description of the observed diffractive deep inelastic scattering process . constrained only by the requirement to be in the physically sensible range @xmath139 $ ] and to be fairly smooth . solid line : the probability from the fit of the colour screening model as used in fig . [ fig : cascade_cutsnone_m01alphas70 ] ( upper left corner ) . we note that both methods result in very similar functions for @xmath89 . ] it is interesting to compare the dynamic colour screening model with the results from having a fixed colour screening probability while keeping all other parameters equal . [ fig : cascade_cutsnone_const ] shows the diffractive cross section with @xmath126 , obtained by a fit to data . we note that the constant probability results in a significantly worse description of the data . the overall normalisation as well as the shape of @xmath96 with respect to @xmath5 is better described by the dynamic screening model .    in the results from the dynamic model of fig . [ fig : cascade_cutsnone_m01alphas70 ] , we have fitted the two parameters @xmath81 and @xmath84 of the dynamic screening model to data . the parameters determine the overall normalisation and essentially the position of the slope where the screening probability @xmath89 falls off to zero . on the other hand , the general shape of this probability is given by the underlying model itself . it is interesting though to investigate what form of @xmath89 would result in a good fit without assuming an underlying model . to this end , we fit a mapping @xmath140 which is only constrained by the fact that it should lie in the physically sensible range @xmath141 $ ] and that it should be reasonably smooth . the result of such a fit is shown in fig . [ fig : prob - casc - m01-alphas70 ] . we observe that even though we did not place any particular constraint on the functional form , one obtains essentially the same result as in the dynamic screening model and therefore support to its qcd - basis .       at the scales 1 , 4 and @xmath142{gev}$ ] for the solid , dashed and dotted lines , respectively , is shown in the left panel . the gluon density a1 for the same scales is shown in the right panel . the distribution starts out with a steeper slope at small scales and influences the observable as shown in fig .

[ fig : cascade_cutsnone_m01alphas70 ] it is seen that @xmath96 is at large @xmath110 and large @xmath34 sensitive to the shape of the gluon density at the starting scale . ] the result in fig . [ fig : cascade_cutsnone_m01alphas70 ] is obtained using the unintegrated gluon density @xmath144 illustrated in fig . [ fig : gdf - plot-1010 ] ( left ) . this density starts out flat at a low scale @xmath145 which can be compared with the @xmath146 behavior of the pomeron flux in regge - based models . the diffractive cross section in our model is sensitive to the slope especially in the kinematic region where @xmath110 is large . we can compare the main result in fig . [ fig : cascade_cutsnone_m01alphas70 ] with the result obtained by using a parton density which has a stronger increase towards small @xmath0 already at low scales , shown in fig . [ fig : gdf - plot-1010 ] ( right ) . the corresponding @xmath127 is shown in fig . [ fig : cascade_gdf1013_cutsnone_m01alphas70 ] . we note that especially the dependence of the cross section on @xmath5 is sensitive to the gluon density @xmath144 at small scales @xmath145 . by including diffractive data into the fit of a gluon density , this dependence could be used to further constrain the shape of the gluon distribution at low scales . but showing @xmath147 where the diffractive cross section is defined in terms of a large rapidity gap between @xmath148 and @xmath149 in pseudorapidity . ]     range available in the experimental data is indicated by a horizontal thinner line for each row in @xmath110 . the fraction of events with a gluon in the lrg region is shown in the two rightmost plots . ] range available in the experimental data is indicated by a horizontal thinner line for each row in @xmath110 . the fraction of events with a gluon in the lrg region is shown in the two rightmost plots . ] [ fig : cascade_lrg40t60_m01alphas70 ] shows the diffractive cross section @xmath150 as defined by the presence of a large rapidity gap in the range @xmath151 in pseudorapidity . we note the close similarity to fig . [ fig : cascade_cutsnone_m01alphas70 ] . when requiring a minimum gap size @xmath152 in the event , the non - diffractive cross - section is exponentially suppressed by @xmath152 . while the presence of a lrg of size @xmath152 in the final state is a clear indication of diffraction , the exact location of the gap is sensitive to the description of the kinematics of the central system @xmath25 , and @xmath150 depends therefore additionally on the treatment of dynamics within the @xmath25-system . the dynamic colour screening model describes the probability of a colour screened interaction , but the additional soft exchanges do not change the kinematics of final state partons . we know on the other hand that our description in terms of matrix elements plus showering does not cover the full phase space . especially , the lack of additional gluon radiation from the quark propagator in the matrix element @xmath112 could be the reason why this @xmath22-system extends up to too high rapidity and can hadronize into the gap region . we therefore keep the gap size @xmath153 as in the data , but shift its starting value from 3.3 in data to 4 . this modification is irrelevant for our result at @xmath154 , but noticeable at @xmath155 where it causes at most a correction of @xmath156 at small @xmath110 and small @xmath5 , but becomes important at @xmath157 . we expect @xmath150 to be sensitive to higher order corrections especially close to the soft divergence @xmath94 where partons from the matrix element cause activity in the lrg region . this is illustrated in fig . [ fig : lrg - parton - veto ] where the fraction of events having a @xmath19 or @xmath158 with momentum vector into the lrg is shown . we note that the fraction of quarks in the lrg increases towards low @xmath5 which can be understood from the correlation between @xmath5 and the transverse momentum . on the other hand , the fraction of gluons in the lrg depends more strongly on @xmath34 and weaker on @xmath5 . this can be understood from the fact that gluons arise from the parton shower in contrast to the quarks which are defined by the matrix element .    at the leading order of our computation , we note that the result is only mildly sensitive to the cuts employed to regulate the @xmath94 divergence . also , a comparison with massive matrix elements at leading order suggests that typical quark masses lead effectively to the same cuts on the energy sharing variable @xmath28 as used in our results . on the other hand , higher order corrections could significantly alter the internal event structure , especially in the region of the phase space where it is likely to have a large step @xmath28 between @xmath0 and @xmath103 . there , an additional final state gluon could modify the extension of the @xmath25 system in rapidity . an improved parton evolution based on ccfm with additional splittings @xmath159 and @xmath160 could therefore in principle improve the description further because the diffractive process at a low scale could be described with a qed matrix element and low @xmath0 resummed parton evolution . similarly , @xmath150 is also sensitive to the distribution of the transverse momenta and energy splitting in the parton shower .", "we have developed the probability for dynamic colour screening in dis in a way that can be used in monte carlo event generators and applied it with cascade and lepto . the resulting model predicts the diffractive dis cross section based on perturbative qcd matrix elements and standard inclusive parton densities in both collinear and @xmath2-factorisation approaches . this facilitates practical applications of previously obtained theoretical derivations of the amplitude for colour screening through semi - soft multiple gluon exchanges calculated in the eikonal approximation to all orders in perturbative qcd . the basic formalism gives a theoretical understanding why the soft colour interaction ( sci ) model has been phenomenologically successful , but goes beyond that model by leading to a colour screening probability that depends on the dynamics of the perturbative qcd parton dynamics . this dynamical screening probability exhibits a saturated behaviour at small transverse momenta of the emerging parton system as well as colour transparency at large transverse momentum . the monte carlo model has only two , physically motivated parameters . their values are obtained by fitting the hera diffractive cross section and found to be of the expected magnitude . the model successfully describes the data over a large kinematic range , significantly better than with a constant screening probability . interestingly , a fit of a free - form probability function results in the same shape as in our model , and hence gives support for our account of the basic qcd dynamics of relevance . it is noteworthy that we have not introduced any diffractive parton distribution functions to describe soft dynamics through unknown functions fitted to data . this explicitly demonstrates that diffractive and inclusive scattering can be described by the same basic qcd processes when explicit account is taken of color degrees of freedom in gluon exchanges at scales below normal cut - offs of @xmath161 gev of hard , perturbative qcd processes and @xmath162 of the hadronisation phase transition .    in some kinematic regions there are two very different scales present , namely the invariant mass of the diffractive system @xmath131 and the photon virtuality @xmath5 . this calls for a resummation of large logarithms @xmath163 , or equivalently @xmath164 . to address this issue , we take the cross section in the @xmath2-factorisation approach from off - shell matrix elements and unintegrated gluon densities together with the ccfm evolution which provides a resummation of leading logarithms in @xmath165 . we show that this significantly improves the description of the diffractive hera data at @xmath166 corresponding to @xmath97 . nevertheless , there are residual deviations in the region where both @xmath110 and @xmath5 are at their lowest values . this may be attributed to the extreme region of very small @xmath110 when the quark propagator connected to the virtual photon have a significant phase space available for gluon radiation , which is not accounted for ; neither in the leading order matrix element for @xmath167 nor in the ccfm evolution that does not include the @xmath160 splitting . the dglap evolution does include this and also shows a slightly better result in this case , but is still not sufficient since here the effects of large @xmath168 is not included .    to conclude and connect to the discussion in the introduction , our study has shown that the phenomenon of diffractive deep inelastic scattering can be described using a basic qcd - framework . the hard subprocess is treated in the same way as for non - diffractive events but a colour screening process occurs as a result of multiple gluon exchanges that are resummed to all orders . significant deviations from data occur in a special kinematic region , where potentially large logarithmic corrections are not yet fully included in available evolution equations for gluon radiation . still , the overall results show that gluonic colour screening in qcd is a viable approach to understand diffraction .        j.  r.  forshaw and d.  a.  ross , cambridge lect .  notes phys . * 9 * , 1 ( 1997 ) . g.  ingelman and p.  e.  schlein , phys . b * 152 * , 256 ( 1985 ) . r.  bonino _ et al . _ [ ua8 collaboration ] , phys . b * 211 * , 239 ( 1988 ) . g.  ingelman , int . j.  mod . a * 21 * , 1805 ( 2006 ) [ hep - ph/0512146 ] . s.  chekanov _ et al . _ [ zeus collaboration ] , nucl . b * 816 * , 1 ( 2009 ) ;

error and unambiguous discriminations of quantum signal subsets @xcite , and the latter one was recently recasted by the more general theory of mixed state unambiguous discrimination @xcite .    after discussing the formulation of unambiguous state filtering , we apply it to the sensing of quantum channels consisting of non - unitary operations as an example of applications . this scenario would be important for practical applications because various kinds of decoherence in quantum channels are described by non - unitary operators . to sense small decoherence parameters of such channels , we need to detect the mixed state probes appropriately . we discuss the detection strategy based on unambiguous state filtering and propose possible experimental implementations . the paper is organized as follows . in sec . ii , the general formulation of the problem treated in this paper is given . in sec . iii and iv , we apply our formalism to the problem of non -

[ fig : tmsvscheme](a ) . from eq . ( [ eq : p_tmsv ] ) , we find @xmath104 as @xmath154 where the minimum required power is @xmath155 here , @xmath156 is the average power incident on a tested channel . obviously , within the limit of large @xmath109 , @xmath157 is almost proportional to @xmath158 . finally , we briefly discuss another strategy that is based on measurement of the photon number ( photocurrent ) difference , which works effectively in some interferometric schemes using entanglement @xcite . the schematic is shown in fig . [ fig : tmsvscheme](b ) . here the state is discriminated by observing whether the difference in the photon number between two photo - detectors is zero or non - zero , i.e. , by the set of measurement operators @xmath159 . although this is not optimal since the support space of @xmath160 is obviously larger than that of eq . ( [ eq : tmsv ] ) , to find the precision limit of this simpler measurement scheme is still interesting from a practical point of view . the detection probability is calculated to be @xmath161 and we find the minimum detectable loss and the minimum required power as @xmath162 and @xmath163 respectively .    to summarize , we plotted the @xmath104 s for coherent , squeezed , and two - mode squeezed probes with @xmath127 in fig . [ fig : graph3 ] . again , a two - mode squeezed ( entangled ) probe showed better performance than single - mode squeezed probes . since the total power for a probe is defined by _ the power incident on a tested channel only _ , the expansion of the output hilbert space due to an entangled probe clearly enables greater sensitivity . fortunately , we can also see that when the input power is sufficiently larger than @xmath112 , the strategy of detecting the photon number difference is near optimal . this strategy may be simpler than the optimal one in regions of large @xmath109 where currently available photodetectors can operate . however , an entangled probe provides the most drastic gain in regions where the input power is extremely limited , when it is measured by the optimal measurement scheme . minimum detectable loss @xmath104 for various probe fields . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]", "in this paper , we have discussed the measurment scenario of unambiguous quantum state filtering where one particular signal is unambiguously extracted from a set of non - orthogonal signals . the maximum detection probability and its corresponding measurement operators are given by simple expressions although our formulation includes mixed state signals . as an application , we have considered the sensing of decoherence in quantum channels . we applied this formalism to the sensing of two kinds of decoherence channels , a depolarizing channel and a channel which included linear loss . a probe field is initially in a pure state and the output is probably in a mixed state . the latter channel is especially important in practice since we often encounter such decoherence in optical quantum communication networks . our results suggest that the asymptotic behavior of the precision limit is the same as that of unitary operation sensing , for example , phase shift sensing @xcite . on the other hand , in the region of a weak probe field , for probes to have non - zero detection probabilities there are minimum required powers . these results show how a non - classical , especially an entangled , probe and an appropriate detection scheme improve sensing performance . suppose @xmath164 . it induces @xmath165 and @xmath166 ( @xmath167 ) , eventually , @xmath168 . since @xmath169 is the set of eigenvectors of @xmath1 , the above statement is in contradiction to the assumption that @xmath170 is supported by the @xmath23-dimensional hilbert space @xmath10 . for example , although it is possible to construct the filtering measurement which extracts the thermal state unambiguously from a signal set consisting of a thermal state and a vacuum state , its converse ( extraction of the vacuum state ) is impossible ."], "summary": "in this paper , we consider the generalized measurement where one particular quantum signal is unambiguously extracted from a set of non - commutative quantum signals and the other signals are filtered out . simple expressions for the maximum detection probability and its povm are derived . we applyl such unambiguous quantum state filtering to evaluation of the sensing of decoherence channels . the bounds of the precision limit for a given quantum state of probes and possible device implementations are discussed .", "ranking": [4, 0, 2, 3, 1]}

off is therefore an important motivation for cosmic ray experiments like auger @xcite and hires @xcite . complementing the cosmic ray experiments , a number of experiments perform direct searches for ultra high energy ( uhe ) neutrinos from the gzk pion decays ( @xmath3 ) . the search for neutrinos above the gzk energy is also motivated in the context of grand unification theories ( gut ) @xcite . relic x-particles with ultra high mass @xmath4  ev originating from the gut phase - transition in the early universe could be decaying in the present epoch . thereby they would produce uhe neutrinos . as a final example of a theoretically very appealing possibility , is the z - burst process @xcite . in this scenario , the highest energy cosmic rays are produced following resonant interactions ( @xmath5 ) of uhe neutrinos on the relic neutrino background . to explain the full cosmic ray spectrum , this would require a very high flux of neutrinos in the @xmath6 regime to be present . limits constraining the possible uhe ! neutrino flux from these processes exist , with the most stringent one to date being presented by the anita - lite experiment @xcite .    among the various methods for detecting ultra high energy ( uhe ) particles , a promising technique utilizes the askaryan effect @xcite . this effect causes electromagnetic cascades , induced by the uhe particle interactions in dense media , to develop a negative charge excess . the charge excess will radiate coherently at radio wavelengths , thereby producing strong coherent pulses of erenkov radiation . in a series of accelerator experiments , the askaryan mechanism has been confirmed to work in different media . most important for our purposes , it was tested in silica sand specifically to mimic the conditions of the lunar material @xcite . it was first proposed by askaryan @xcite , later by dagkesamanskii and zheleznyk @xcite , that the radio transparent lunar regolith ( the 10 - 20 m deep surface layer of the moon , consisting mainly of fractured rock ) would be an ideal target for studying such uhe particles . an additional advantage is the absence of an atmosphere which implies that electromagnetic showers in the lunar regolith are caused by the primary cosmic particles . a number of attempts at observing cosmic ray induced radio waves from the moon have since been carried out using ground based radio telescopes . the first experiment @xcite used the 64 m diameter parkes radio telescope in australia to make coincidence measurements from two polarization channels . a 500-mhz band centered at 1.425 ghz was used after making appropriate corrections for the ionospheric delay between two sub - bands . the second was the goldstone lunar ultra - high energy neutrino experiment ( glue ) @xcite that used two large telescopes of the jpl / nasa deep space network in goldstone ( ca ) . a third experiment of this kind took place at kalyazin radio astronomical observatory , using again a single 64 m radio telescope @xcite . none of these experiments however , resulted in any detection of signals from uhe particles . under the name numoon , there is one currently on - going search using the westerbrok synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) in the netherlands @xcite . for future experiments with increased sensitivity there are proposals @xcite to study this effect with upcoming radio telescopes like the low frequency array ( lofar ) and the square kilometer array ( ska ) , or to use lunar orbiting artificial satellites carrying one or more radio antennas @xcite .    in this paper we study in detail the possibility of detection of uhecr and neutrino radio waves from the moon with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) facility @xcite . the gmrt comprises @xmath7 fully steerable dishes spread over distances up to @xmath8 km , each with a diameter of @xmath9 m. half of these antennas are distributed randomly over about @xmath10 km@xmath11 in a compact array while the rest are spread out in an approximate `` y '' configuration . the gmrt currently operates in eight frequency bands around @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16-@xmath17 mhz . the shortest baseline is @xmath18 m while the longest one is @xmath19 km . the telescope has an effective area in total of @xmath20 m@xmath11 for frequencies up to @xmath21 mhz and @xmath22 m@xmath11 at the higher frequencies . the rms sensitivity of the gmrt , using a @xmath23 s integration time and a bandwidth of @xmath24 mhz is @xmath25 mjy and @xmath26 mjy at @xmath21 mhz and @xmath27 ghz respectively . with such high sensitivity , we expect a substantial improvement from previous experiments in the measurement of the askaryan radio waves from the moon .", "high energy charged particles from uhe cosmic ray ( cr ) or uhe neutrino interactions in the lunar regolith will initiate a cascading shower with total energy @xmath28 and typical length scale @xcite @xmath29 in units of radiation length . for the lunar regolith with radiation length @xmath30 g / cm@xmath11 and density @xmath32 g/@xmath33 , the shower length for a particle with energy @xmath34 ev is therefore @xmath35 m. since the particles in the cascade travel at speeds very close to the speed of light the duration of the shower is @xmath36ns . the radio waves of about @xmath37 ns duration which are emitted from the lunar regolith are dispersed as they propagate through the atmosphere of the earth . the electrons in the ionosphere cause a time delay @xcite of @xmath38 seconds , where @xmath39 m@xmath40 is the typical night -

[ radioflux1 ] . in this figure we also show the commonly used gaussian approximation where the forward - suppression factor @xmath51 in ( [ f ] ) is ignored . for high frequencies this has no effect . for low frequencies , the differences at small angles only plays a role for showers nearly parallel to the surface normal , while the effects of changing the normalization near the erenkov angle is important also for more horizontal showers . a measure of the effective angular spread @xmath52 of the emission around the erenkov angle @xmath53 is given in terms of @xmath54 for the example in fig . [ radioflux1 ] this becomes @xmath55 . the erenkov radio waves are expected to be @xmath56 linearly polarized @xcite . radio signals should therefore be observed with both the lcp and rcp modes . a simultaneous triggering of both the lcp and rcp modes ( with @xmath57 of the total intensity in each mode ) will be a good signature of the transient erenkov radio wave emission from uhe particles . in addition , the large number of gmrt dishes should allow pointing discrimination and spatial - temporal coincidence measurements to be used for signal identification and background rejection .", "for cosmic rays , which produce showers by hadronic processes , the shower energy @xmath28 is equal to the energy of the primary particle . when instead the showers are produced by deep inelastic neutrino scattering off target nucleons , the fraction of the total energy which produces the hadronic showers is , on average , @xmath58 @xcite . we model the lunar regolith as a homogeneous medium with dielectric permittivity @xmath59 , hence refractive index @xmath60 . the erenkov angle is @xmath61 . the radio waves are also absorbed in the regolith , which we take to have a frequency dependent attenuation length @xmath62 m @xcite . this means the attenuation length of radio waves is always much smaller than the mean free path of the neutrinos , conveniently parameterized as @xmath63 km using the cross sections of @xcite . as can be seen from this expression , the mean free path for an uhe neutrino is not sufficient to escape the moon . most of the passing neutrinos will therefore interact in the material . the threshold energy required for showers to be detectable is determined by the sensitivity of the radio telescope . this is commonly presented in terms of a noise intensity @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the system temperature , @xmath66 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath67 the integration time , @xmath68 the bandwidth , and @xmath69 the effective area of the telescope . in units of jansky ( @xmath10 jy = @xmath70 w / m@xmath11/hz ) the noise intensity is given by @xmath71 at gmrt , for frequencies @xmath72 and @xmath21 mhz we use the effective area @xmath73 m@xmath11 while for the higher frequencies @xmath74 m@xmath11 . the integration time @xmath75 for the bandwidth limited case . in table 1 we list the system temperatures at the different observation frequencies and the corresponding noise levels . using equation ( [ f ] ) , we can solve for @xmath28 at the threshold required for measurement with the radio telescope ( obtained for @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) . if we take a required signal - to - noise ratio @xmath78 , the threshold shower energies @xmath79 which can be measured at gmrt at the different observation frequencies are listed in table 1 . the radio waves produced below the lunar surface get attenuated while propagating to the surface and they get refracted at the surface before reaching the telescope . the transmission coefficients are different for the electric field polarization which is parallel and perpendicular to the lunar surface . it is therefore convenient to express the erenkov radiation intensity ( [ f ] ) in terms of the electric field magnitude @xmath80 of the radio waves . the conversion is @xmath81 using this conversion we also list the threshold electric fields measurable at gmrt in table 1 . if attenuation is factored in separately , the quantity @xmath82 remains a constant between the point of emission and the point of refraction at the surface : @xmath83}\\right)\\ , \\frac{\\mu \\mathrm{v}}{\\mathrm{mhz } } . \\label{re}\\ ] ] at the surface , there is partial reflection which changes the intensity of the outgoing electric field . the electric field observed at the telescope is determined relates to the incident electric fields by the fresnel relations @xmath84 t_{\\parallel}=\\frac{r { \\cal e}_{\\parallel}}{(r { \\cal e}_{\\parallel})_\\mathrm{inc}}=\\frac{2 \\cos r}{n \\cos r+ \\cos i } \\label{fresnel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the angles of incidence @xmath85 and refraction @xmath86 are related by snell s law . the refraction angle is fixed by the polar angle @xmath87 through the geometrical condition @xmath88 here @xmath89^{1/2}$ ] is the distance between the detector and the point of refraction on the lunar surface , and @xmath90 km is the average earth - moon distance . putting everything together , the parallel component of the electric field at the telescope on earth is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is given by ( [ re ] ) as a function of @xmath44 and @xmath28 . the dependence on the polar angle @xmath87 of the radio flux on earth is shown in fig . [ flux_theta ] . evaluating @xmath92 at @xmath76 and equating @xmath93 with the threshold field @xmath94 which can be measured with the telescope , we obtain the threshold energy @xmath95 as a function of the polar angle @xmath87 . fig . [ threshold ] illustrates that for observing the radio waves from the limb of the moon ( @xmath96 for @xmath97 ) , one has to have a higher threshold energy of the shower owing to the fact that the transmission coefficients @xmath98 and @xmath99 vanish when @xmath100 . when @xmath101 is not large compared to @xmath102 ( which is the case for a telescope aboard a satellite orbiting the moon ) then only a small disc around the center of the moon will be visible .    by equating the signal @xmath103 at the erenkov angle we determine the threshold @xmath104 at different frequencies and bandwidths . the values so obtained are listed in table  [ tab1 ] . .gmrt parameters , sensitivity and threshold energy . @xmath105 is the noise intensity of gmrt and @xmath106 the corresponding electric field . the threshold energy in the last column is calculated with @xmath107 . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the event rate that would be expected at the telescope can be related to an isotropic flux @xmath108 of uhe particles on the moon through @xmath109 where @xmath110 denote the type of primary particle and @xmath111 is an aperture function corresponding to the effective detector area . we will differentiate between neutrinos , which have a large mean free path and therefore can penetrate the interior of the moon before producing the erenkov radio waves , and the strongly interacting cosmic rays ( referred to by the subscript @xmath112 ) which can penetrate only small distances below the surface of the moon . the aperture can be further decomposed into an angular aperture @xmath113 and a geometric area factor for the moon @xmath114 with @xmath115 km . to evaluate the aperture , we use the analytical methods described in @xcite . for the case of cosmic rays , the angular aperture is given by @xmath116 \\times \\theta(\\cos\\beta ) \\mathrm{d}\\alpha\\mathrm{d}\\cos\\beta , \\label{angle}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the polar and azimuthal coordinates of the ray normal to the moon s surface in a system where the shower direction defines the @xmath119 axis . the full geometry and the different angles are described in fig .

[ crlimit30 ] respectively . we also show the results of carrying through our calculations for the lofar parameters given in @xcite . when compared to the lofar monte carlo simulation results , the two methods of calculation agree within a factor two over the full energy range . this is an acceptable discrepancy in level with known uncertainties from _ e.g. _ the regolith depth . a residual difference of @xmath141 is also expected since we used the gaussian approximation . the limit we obtain for the lofar parameters is less stringent than the one published , so in this respect our result constitutes a conservative estimate . > from comparing the limits for different frequencies , it can be seen that low frequency observations give more stringent limits on the flux at the expense of a higher threshold . this is due to the well - known increase in the aperture @xcite from radiation spreading at lower frequencies . the figures also show the auger data @xcite on uhe cosmic rays . although the extrapolation to higher energies is highly uncertain , the gmrt would most probably be sensitive to a post - gzk proton flux . similarly for the uhe neutrinos , prospective limits on their flux for @xmath142 hours and @xmath143 days are shown in figs . [ nlimit100 ] and [ nlimit30 ] . also here we show a calculation for the lofar parameters , again in quantitative agreement with previous results . since many radio experiments exist for uhe neutrino detection , we have compiled a comparison in fig .

[ fig : phase](a ) , which is derived from the r - dmft analysis with ctqmc at @xmath57 ( see sec .  [ sec : numerical_results ] ) . in this phase diagram , we use the terms , qshi and temi , for topological phases , which are strictly defined only at @xmath50 . even at finite temperatures , we can still see clear remnants of topological properties . our definition of the qshi and the temi at finite temperatures is as follows . these two states are both characterized by the almost quantized spin - hall conductivity @xmath0 . the difference between them is that the edge modes of the qshi are gapless ( helical edge modes ) while those of the temi are gapful in the single - particle spectrum . in the latter case , only the collective spin excitations become gapless , which is the definition of the temi . these two states are smoothly connected with increasing @xmath61 at finite temperatures via a crossover where the single - particle spectrum gradually acquires a gap for larger @xmath61 . further increase in @xmath61 eventually induces a first order phase transition at @xmath62 from the temi to a trivial dimer mott phase , where electrons in layer @xmath34 and @xmath35 form a singlet at each site and thus the topological properties are completely destroyed ( with lowering temperature , the order of the phase transition can change to second order due to strong spatial fluctuation@xcite ) . this first order transition accompanies the hysteresis behavior and the coexistence phase for @xmath63 . these r - dmft analyses clearly demonstrate the emergence of the temi state . we note that lowering temperature shifts the crossover region in fig . [ fig : phase](a ) to smaller @xmath61 . so , what happens at zero temperature ? to address this question , we show the phase diagram at @xmath50 in fig .  [ fig : phase](b ) , which is obtained with a bosonization approach for edge modes in one dimension ( see sec .  [ sec : edge ] ) . the bosonization analysis indicates that the temi state emerges for any @xmath64 , because at @xmath50 the spin exchange interaction @xmath65 is marginally relevant for edge states and induces a gap which monotonically increases with increasing @xmath65 . the nontrivial properties of the temi state induce a collective helical mode in @xmath66 with @xmath67 ( @xmath11 ) in accordance with the above finite - temperature results . the temi phase at @xmath50 persists up to the phase transition to the trivial dimer mott phase in the large @xmath61 region , as already mentioned in fig . [ fig : phase](a ) . below , we describe how we have arrived at these conclusions . in sec . [ sec : numerical_results ] , we first discuss details of the phase diagram [ fig . [ fig : phase](a ) ] obtained by r - dmft with ctqmc at finite temperatures , and then in sec . [ sec : edge ] address the zero temperature properties [ fig . [ fig : phase](b ) ] .    : ( a ) finite temperature ( @xmath57 ) and ( b ) zero temperature . in ( a ) , the quantum spin - hall insulator ( qshi ) is realized in the small @xmath61 region ( blue region ) , which is gradually changed to the temi ( read ) via a crossover with increasing @xmath61 . the temi state changes to a trivial dimer mott state ( the region colored with gray ) via a first order transition at @xmath62 . correspondingly , the hysteresis behavior is observed for @xmath63 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in ( b ) , one can see that the introduction of @xmath65 realizes a topological edge mott insulating state ( temi ) at @xmath50 , which is further driven to a trivial dimer mott insulator with increasing @xmath61 . these results at @xmath50 are in accordance with the analysis of ( a ) at finite temperatures . ] we start with bulk properties , i.e. properties at center of the cylinder ( @xmath70 ) . in fig . [ fig : cond](a ) , the spin - hall conductivity at @xmath57 is plotted as a function of the in - plane hubbard interaction @xmath61 for a given choice of the inter - plane exchange interaction @xmath65 ( we recall that the conductivity is proportional to the spin chern number even in the strongly correlated systems at @xmath50@xcite ) . we can see that the spin hall conductivity is almost quantized , i.e. @xmath0 up to a critical value of @xmath62 , beyond which it suddenly drops to zero via a first order transition . therefore we can say that the system is in a topologically nontrivial state for @xmath71 , while it is changed to a trivial phase for @xmath72 . however , only from the data for @xmath73 , we can not figure out which kind of topological phase the system belongs to for @xmath71 . this will be clarified through the analysis of the edge states below .     for @xmath74 and @xmath75 . in panel ( a ) , we can find a hysteresis behavior , which indicates the presence of the first order transition . ]    here we make a brief comment on how the topological properties disappear at the first order transition point in the bulk . this phase transition is due to zeros of the green s function ( or the divergence of the self - energy ) , which completely destroy the topologically nontrivial structure . in fig . [ fig : cond](b ) , we plot the imaginary part of the self - energy at @xmath70 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 . for @xmath75 , the self - energy indeed diverges ( i.e. , zero of green s function appears ) , while for @xmath74 the self - energy is non - singular and thus the system behaves as a renormalized band insulator , in accordance with the almost quantized spin - hall conductivity for @xmath71 shown in fig .

[ fig : dos_and_ak ] , we plot the local density of states ( ldos ) @xmath84 and the momentum - resolved spectral weight at the fermi energy @xmath85 . while the ldos at a bulk site shown in fig . [ fig : dos_and_ak](a ) indicates the presence of bulk gap for all the parameters chosen , the ldos at edge sites ( @xmath18 ) plotted in fig . [ fig : dos_and_ak](b ) strongly depends on the values of @xmath61 . for @xmath78 , we find a peak at the fermi energy @xmath86 , indicating that there are gapless edge modes . with increasing @xmath61 , however , this peak gradually changes to a gap structure . for example , as seen in fig . [ fig : dos_and_ak](b ) , the peak changes to a pseudo - gap for @xmath87 and to a gap for @xmath76 , implying that the helical edge modes in the single - particle channel are destroyed gradually . such destruction of the edge modes in the single - particle spectrum is more clearly seen in the momentum resolved spectral weight @xmath85 plotted in figs . [ fig : dos_and_ak](c ) and ( d ) . for @xmath78 , the system shows helical edge modes in the single - particle spectrum , resulting in a sharp peak of the momentum resolved spectral weight at @xmath88 [ see fig .  [ fig : dos_and_ak](c ) ] , which is consistent with the presence of the peak at @xmath86 in the ldos [ fig . [ fig : dos_and_ak](b ) ] . on the other hand , the gapless modes are destroyed for @xmath87 , where the spectral weight @xmath89 does not show any peak at @xmath88 , indicating that the helical edge modes in the single particle - spectrum are gapped out without symmetry breaking .    putting the above bulk and edge properties together , we conclude that the crossover behavior appears in two types of topological phases at a given temperature . in smaller @xmath61 , we find the qshi , which is characterized by the almost quantized spin - hall conductivity @xmath83 and the gapless helical edge modes . on the other hand , for larger @xmath61 , the spin - hall conductivity is still almost quantized , but the single - particle spectrum does not host any gapless mode , indicating the presence of gapless modes carrying the spin current only in collective excitation spectra . this phase is thus identified as the temi . the above crossover between the qshi ( smaller @xmath61 ) and the temi ( larger @xmath61 ) is observed at a given temperature ( @xmath57 ) , which is much less than the size of bulk energy gap . when the temperature increases , the crossover becomes obscured , and at temperatures higher than the bulk energy gap , the system enters the high temperature region where all the topological properties disappear . on the other hand , when the temperature becomes lower , we can confirm that the crossover region shifts to the small @xmath61 region ; namely the qshi ( temi ) region becomes smaller ( larger ) . this is because at lower temperatures , the effects of @xmath65 and @xmath61 are more prominent , leading to the enhancement of the gap at edge modes and thus stabilizing the temi . so , we naturally expect that the temi dominates the topological phase . in sec . [ sec : edge ] , we will address this problem and find that topological phase at @xmath50 is indeed in the temi state as far as @xmath65 is finite .      here , we discuss the phase competition between the topologically nontrivial phase ( temi ) and the trivial mott phase . as mentioned above , in the presence of the spin exchange interaction @xmath65 , increasing the hubbard interaction @xmath61 firstly induces a crossover from the qshi to the temi and then drives a first order transition to the trivial dimer mott insulator where the single - particle gap is of the order of @xmath61 at every site .    : interaction dependence of the double occupancy at @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( @xmath18 and @xmath46 ) , respectively .

( c ) [ ( d ) ] : interaction dependence of the inter - layer local spin correlation at @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( @xmath18 and @xmath46 ) , respectively . ] we start with the first order transition . the double occupancy and the local spin correlation at site @xmath30 in layer @xmath34 are plotted in fig .  [ fig : interaction_docc ] . in the region of small @xmath61 , the double occupancy and the spin correlation gradually decrease at every site with increasing the interaction strength , in accordance with the crossover behavior between the qshi and the temi . further increase in @xmath61 drives the system to a trivial phase from the temi via the first order transition . the topologically trivial phase for @xmath72 is a dimer mott phase for which electrons in layer @xmath34 and @xmath35 form a singlet at each site . the first order transition is accompanied by the hysteresis in the interaction dependences of the double occupancy and the local spin correlation for @xmath92 , where @xmath68 and @xmath93 . figure  [ fig : interaction_docc ] shows jumps in the double occupancy at @xmath94 and @xmath95 at every site ( the jumps are more clearly observed in the interaction dependence of the spin correlation ) . we note that the two adjacent insulating states separated with the first order phase transition at @xmath96 have totally different properties from each other although both of them have the single - particle gap in the edge modes . for the small @xmath61 side ( topological phase ) , the mott behavior is observed only at edge sites , while for the large @xmath61 side ( trivial phase ) , the mott behavior is observed at both of bulk and edge sites . in the former topological region , we have already observed that the helical edge modes are destroyed while the bulk behaves as a renormalized band insulator [ see figs . [ fig : dos_and_ak](a ) and ( b ) ] . correspondingly , in this topological region , only electrons around the edges are strongly affected , as clearly seen in figs . [ fig : sites_docc ] where spatial dependences of the double occupancy and spin correlation are plotted . for @xmath97 in the topological phase , the electrons around edges show the dramatic suppression of the double occupancy [ figs . [ fig : sites_docc ] ( a ) ] and also the strong singlet correlation [ figs .  [ fig : sites_docc ] ( b ) ] while the other electrons in the bulk are less correlated . on the other hand , in the large @xmath61 trivial region , whole the system shows a trivial mott insulating behavior . actually , as seen from the data for @xmath75 , the double occupancy has small values and the singlet correlation is strong at every site . correspondingly , both of the single - particle gap in the bulk and at the edges are of the order of @xmath61 ( i.e. the mott gap ) [ see figs . [ fig : dos_and_ak](a ) and ( b ) ] .    summarizing all the above results , we end up with the phase diagram shown in fig . [ fig : phase](a ) , which supports the crossover between the qshi state and the temi state , and also the phase transition to the trivial mott insulator at finite temperatures . so far we have been concerned with the finite temperature properties . at zero temperature , we expect that infinitesimal interaction @xmath98 induces the temi state , which persists even in the presence of @xmath61 as far as the system is in a topological phase . this is supported here by the analysis based on the bosonization approach . to this end , we start with the model ( [ fig : model ] ) with @xmath99 , and discuss how the instability of gapless edge modes occur in the presence of @xmath65 and @xmath61 . we use the chern - simons theory and the bosonization method@xcite , following the approach used in ref .  . consider the edge states of two copies of non - interacting qshi with spin chern number one . then its effective action is given by    [ eq : s_0 ] @xmath100 with @xmath101    where , @xmath102 are bosonic fields . @xmath103 , and @xmath104 . here @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the fermi momentum and the fermi velocity of edge states , respectively . @xmath107 denotes the klein factor with @xmath12 and @xmath11 , and @xmath108 is a positive constant . @xmath45 takes 1 ( @xmath47 ) respectively for @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) . we note that @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) describe the right ( left ) movers .    under the symmetry operations , these fields are transformed as @xmath113 where @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 denote the operators for the time - reversal , charge u(1 ) rotation , and spin u(1 ) rotation , respectively .    in terms of these bosonic fields , the interaction terms can be written as follows : @xmath117 thus , the effective action in the presence of the interactions is written as    [ eq : s_tot ] @xmath118 with @xmath119    since @xmath120=0 $ ] holds , the last term in eq . ( [ eq : s_tot]a ) pins the field @xmath121 when this term becomes relevant . we recall that this interaction term is symmetry allowed [ i.e. , this is invariant under applying @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 ] and pins the field without symmetry breaking . now , we apply the renormalization procedure . as a first step , we change the basis as follows :    @xmath123    with @xmath124 as a result , the @xmath125-matrix , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 are transformed as    @xmath128    in this basis the action ( [ eq : s_tot ] ) is separated into two sectors spanned by @xmath129 and @xmath130 . only the second sector includes non - liner terms . redefining the fields as @xmath131 and integrating out the fields @xmath132 , we obtain the sine - gordon action :    [ eq : s_sg ] @xmath133 with @xmath134    appling the renormalization - group scheme to the sine - gordon model ( [ eq : s_sg ] ) , we obtain the renormalization flow :    [ eq : rgflow ] @xmath135 , \\\\ \\frac{dg(l)}{dl}&\\sim&-j^2(l).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath136 is a fixed point . expanding eqs . ( [ eq : rgflow ] ) around this fixed point ( @xmath137 ) , we obtain    @xmath138    thus , for @xmath64 , the non - linear term is marginally relevant and pins the field @xmath139 since @xmath140 holds . this is also the case in the presence of the hubbard interaction @xmath61 . therefore , we conclude that with the infinitesimal antiferromagnetic spin exchange interaction , the single - particle excitations become massive without breaking symmetry . the remaining gapless edge modes live in the subspace of @xmath141 and @xmath142 . in order to find excitation spectra showing the edge modes , we have to diagonalize the @xmath125-matrix for the remaining sector . this can be done with redefining fields @xmath143 thus , we can find that @xmath144 and @xmath145 show gapless edge modes . correspondingly , @xmath146 with @xmath11 , where @xmath147 , hosts gapless mode propagating in opposite direction because eq . ( [ eq : s_0]c ) holds . these modes are protected by symmetry because any potential term pinning @xmath141 or @xmath142 breaks the symmetry . we note that the above results are obtained on the assumption that the spin chern number takes two . this assumption holds for the small @xmath61 region untill the trivial dimer mott phase emerges . we thus end up with fig .

called ` initial perturbations ' ; they can not be considered separately . if the model for the initial perturbations is insufficiently accurate , or even worse completely wrong , the full power of the experiment to constrain cosmological parameters can not be exploited . the inflationary cosmology is an attractive paradigm for the generation of the initial perturbations , but even there the situation can be very complicated in general . in particular , if there are multiple scalar fields the perturbations can be a mixture of isocurvature and adiabatic , and may be non - gaussian . such initial conditions may prove difficult or even impossible to parametrize , and if such an inflation model is correct it will be a major obstacle to successful parameter estimation . however it remains a powerful working hypothesis that the simplest class of models , where inflation is driven by a single scalar field , is viable ; this creates a framework within which the necessary calculations are reasonably simple , with the initial perturbations computed either approximately analytically or exactly numerically . as yet , there is no indication from observations that we might need to go beyond this paradigm . the main goal of this article is to investigate different strategies that an observer can use to estimate the cosmological parameters , and to examine the extent to which it is necessary to adopt detailed inflationary predictions . the spectrum of the fluctuations is assumed to be produced by an underlying inflationary model and is calculated exactly by means of numerical computations . given this situation , we study how the data analysis can be performed in two different scenarios . the first scenario applies if one wants only to estimate cosmological parameters , such as the baryon density and reionization optical depth , and does not care about the underlying inflation model beyond being confident that the description of the initial perturbations used is adequate . in this case , observers typically use a power - law fit , see _ e.g. _  ref . @xcite , and the first question is to test how accurate a power - law fit is to typical inflationary cosmologies . in particular , we wish to know if this kind of fit is accurate enough for present data , and whether it will also be accurate enough to analyze high - precision data like that to be provided by the _ planck _ satellite . the second scenario , which makes more stringent requirements on theoretical accuracy , is if one intends to estimate properties of the inflationary model . in this case , the slow - roll method can be used to calculate an approximate spectrum and we will study its accuracy . we also consider to which order in the slow - roll parameters the spectrum should be calculated in order to reach the _ planck _ precision . we propose an analysis pipeline for testing the consistency of single -

( [ eqn : at1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : at2 ] ) allows us to measure the inflationary parameters .    having shown that there exist situations where the shape matters , we wish to find the region of the parameter space in which the difference between a power - law shape with running and the shape predicted by slow - roll inflation is significant . for this purpose , we define the estimator @xmath56 where @xmath57 stands in for @xmath58 or @xmath59 . note that this estimator presumes that the two fits generate the same values for the amplitude , spectral index and running , whereas in practice a different choice of shape will lead to different values . this estimator therefore underestimates the differences between the two fits close to the pivot point and overestimates them far away from the pivot .    in fig . [ fig : srshape ] we plot the contours of the maximum of @xmath60 in the interval @xmath61 in the @xmath62 plane . its shape can be understood most easily from the approximation eq .

[ fig : srshape ] shape is not an issue if the running is at most of order @xmath66 , which is the case for a wide class of inflationary models ( similar constraints should be assumed to hold true for higher corrections as well ) . the region of fitted spectral indices and runnings in which the difference between the power - law shape and the slow - roll shape , estimated by @xmath67 , is within @xmath68 and within @xmath69.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    a significant difference between the two fits at a given observational accuracy is a clear indicator that higher - order terms may be important , as it is those which give the difference between the two expansions . to be certain of robust results , an attempt should be made to estimate these higher - order terms , either by extending one or both expansions to seek convergence between them or by resorting to fully numerical analysis techniques .", "in the previous section we showed that spectral shape can matter and therefore that it is important to take the predictions of slow - roll inflation into account if we are interested in the physics of inflation itself . before discussing how to extract the inflationary parameters we study the accuracy of the slow - roll approximation at second order . first studies of the accuracy of the slow - roll expansion can be found for the amplitudes in ref . @xcite by comparing to numerical results , while in ref . @xcite the first - order expressions for the amplitudes and the spectral indices has been tested by comparison to analytical results for power - law inflation . here we extend these studies to the full power spectrum at second order . we define the error of the slow - roll power spectrum as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is given by eqs . ( [ logex ] ) and ( [ eqn : as0])([eqn : at2 ] ) . in these expressions the values of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are computed numerically for the three models of sec . scalar and tensor error curves for the chaotic inflation potential . the pivot scale crosses the hubble horizon @xmath33 @xmath34-folds before the end of inflation . we see an improvement in accuracy from the first to the second - order expressions . the tensors have better overall accuracy than the scalars.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    looking at the chaotic inflation model first , we can see from fig . [ fig : errorst_lambda55 ] that the error curves resulting from slow - roll predictions generally have the property that they are most accurate close to the pivot point ( in terms of amplitude and spectral index ) and that the error increases as we move away from the pivot point . we can also see that the second - order expressions can improve the accuracy of both the scalar and tensor power spectra to within _ planck _ requirements , whereas the accuracy of the corresponding first - order expression would be at best marginal . this improvement is mostly brought about by the inclusion of the running . the tensor spectrum of fig . [ fig : errorst_lambda55 ] is determined more accurately than the scalars . we have observed that this is typically the case . since the accuracy requirement upon the tensors is less than on the scalars , it is the scalars upon which attention should be focused . next we turn to the false vacuum inflation model . note immediately from fig . [ fig : errors_fv ] that the second - order expression improves both the shape of the power spectrum and the accuracy of the amplitude at the pivot point itself . the first - order expression is good enough for present experiments in this example , but not for _ map _ and _ planck_.     scalar error curve for the false vacuum inflation model . again , we see an improvement in accuracy from the first to second - order expressions which helps to correct the amplitude at the pivot point.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    finally , for the arctan model we see in fig .  [ fig : errors_wang ] that although @xmath73 is small and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are still in agreement with the slow - roll conditions , the effect of the second - order correction is very important . the first - order expression is not sufficient for _ map_. in this example , the first - order expression also produces a significant error in the amplitude at the pivot point . for _ planck _ the plot suggests that the third order is necessary . it is of course impossible to study the accuracy of all possible models of inflation in this way . we therefore need a more general estimator for the accuracy of the slow - roll expansion in the parameter space @xmath76 . the difference between the slow - roll expansions of @xmath77 and @xmath78 is such an estimator . we define the error at a given order @xmath57 to be @xmath79\\right\\vert}{\\sum_{i=0}^n   { a_i\\over i!}\\ln^i\\!\\!\\left(\\frac{k}{k_*}\\right ) + \\exp\\left[\\sum_{i=0}^n{b_i\\over i ! } \\ln^i\\!\\!\\left(\\frac{k}{k_*}\\right)\\right ] } \\times 100\\% \\,,\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath80 and @xmath81 are taken at order @xmath82 . the interpretation of this expression is that it gives the smallest fractional amount by which the worse of the two expansions departs from the true power spectrum , namely half the distance between the two estimates . this interpretation justifies the absence of a factor @xmath83 at the denominator in eq . ( [ sign ] ) . this expression is of order @xmath84 and therefore is an indicator of the importance of orders that have not been included . moreover it has the same typical behaviour of the errors as one goes away from the pivot point , and we also find that it estimates the orders of the errors for the examples of sec . ii correctly . we expect that this estimate typically works well although there exists the possibility of fine - tuning models such that @xmath85 is not a good estimator . in the following we study the maximum of the error in a suitable interval of wavenumbers , because a large error in a small range may spoil an otherwise accurate fit . we therefore maximize @xmath86 and @xmath87 over @xmath61 . this is certainly conservative but is a good indicator of when robust results are expected . scalar error curve for the arctan potential . we see an improvement from the first to second order as well as a significant correction to the overall amplitude at the pivot scale.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the upper panel of fig .

[ fig : pipeline ] . the inputs are the cmb data and a cosmological model ( _ e.g. _  @xmath126cdm ) . the first step should be to determine the cosmological parameters under the assumption that the power spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations are given by a power - law with running of the spectral index , see eq . ( [ explogex ] ) . one should check the convergence of the values of all cosmological parameters as one fits scale - invariant , power - law , and power - law with running spectra , as discussed in sec . [ sec : ignoreinf ] . one should continue to refine the power spectrum shape ( adding in running of running etc ) until the new power spectrum parameter is found to be consistent with zero . at this point one has the choice to neglect this final parameter , and this seems a sensible option . we call the order of this truncated power spectrum @xmath120 . in a similar manner one should also check the convergence of the cosmological parameter estimates while fitting to the data using scale - invariant , first - order and then second - order slow - roll shapes , up to order @xmath122 . one should find @xmath127 , with @xmath128 being the most likely case . if we also find consistent estimates of the cosmological parameters then clearly the choice of power spectrum shape does nt matter . if @xmath129 but the cosmological parameter estimates are convergent and consistent with each other , then we have some evidence that a particular power spectrum shape may be preferred . figure [ fig : srshape ] might be used to check whether the extracted spectral indices and runnings are expected to give rise to a significant difference between the two fits . if there is no convergence using one or both of the power spectrum shapes , or if the different power spectrum shapes lead to significantly different estimates of the cosmological parameters , then there is either a significant problem in the assumed cosmological model or the shape of the spectrum is completely different from a power - law , _ e.g. _  a pronounced bump or a step at a privileged scale @xcite . presuming the latter , within the context of single - field inflation , the optimal strategy is a direct estimation of the inflationary potential from the data itself , without using intermediate approximations such as the slow - roll expansion , as described by grivell and liddle @xcite . such a calculation must simultaneously fit all parameters , and so will also test whether the results are consistent with a flat universe ; the simplest models of inflation predict @xmath130 , though realistic experiments will be orders of magnitude larger in uncertainty . if so the data are consistent with inflation , but single - field slow - roll inflation would be ruled out . if satisfactory convergence of the cosmological parameters is achieved then the next step is to check whether @xmath131 is consistent with one . if this test is failed then slow - roll inflation is excluded and we need alternative physics . if the universe is consistent with flatness , slow - roll inflation can now be taken very seriously . in the previous section we have shown that the power of fluctuations can be predicted at the required level of accuracy in a large region of parameter space favoured by present cmb observations . once slow - roll inflation has been adopted as a working hypothesis , @xmath131 should be fixed at unity and not varied in any parameter fits .    we can now test the consistency relation and then estimate the inflationary parameters . in principle one could use either expansion [ eq . ( [ explogex ] ) or eq . ( [ eqn : psrc ] ) ] if it has been successful , and even if @xmath132 the inflationary information contained within them should be equivalent . however presuming it is available it makes best theoretical sense to use the slow - roll fit . the approach is sketched in the lower tree of the pipeline in fig . [ fig : pipeline ] . the first step is to check whether a tensor contribution can be detected at a significant level . if not , then there are no means to fully check the specific predictions of slow - roll inflation . however , this means that an upper bound on the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath51 is provided by the cmb data . assuming slow - roll inflation we can use the consistency relation eq . ( [ eqn : rsr ] ) [ or its first - order version eq . ( [ 1stcons ] ) ] to obtain an upper bound on @xmath73 . then we neglect all @xmath73 terms in eqs . ( [ eqn : as0 ] )  ( [ eqn : at2 ] ) , allowing an estimate of @xmath74 , @xmath75 and the normalization of the scalar power spectrum @xmath133 . together with the upper bound on @xmath73 this gives an upper bound on the scale of inflation @xmath72 . figure [ fig : nsdnsdlnk ] might be used to estimate the theoretical error in the measurement of @xmath74 and @xmath75 . if the estimates for @xmath134 and @xmath135 turn out to be larger than the upper bound on @xmath73 we can take these estimates seriously . however , if it turns out that one of the higher - order parameters is of the same order as the upper bound for @xmath73 we can not consistently neglect @xmath73 . in this case only a banana - shaped region in parameter space of the second - order slow - roll expansion can be identified . but a warning is required at that point ; without a detection of tensors it might be impossible to distinguish between single - field slow - roll inflation and other models . if there is a significant detection of tensors , the next step is to test the consistency equation of slow - roll inflation eq . ( [ eqn : rsr ] ) . if this test is not passed , we have ruled out single - field slow - roll inflation . if we find consistency , the final step is to measure the scale of inflation @xmath72 and the inflationary parameters @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 . by fitting directly for these parameters , rather than the coefficients of expansion as above , we are now automatically imposing the consistency relations between the scalar and tensor spectra . this is also important for measurement of the cosmological parameters , as it ensures that the uncertainties are not overestimated ( under the presumption that slow - roll inflation is correct ) . the slow - roll shape is the preferred option for carrying out this final parameter determination , and this is also the determination which yields the definitive measures of the various cosmological parameters . these might differ from the parameters estimated from the power - law plus running fit once the consistency conditions are imposed . in particular the uncertainties should tighten as the inflationary predictions are more specific than fitting free power - laws plus running . the systematic uncertainty from theory in the measurement of inflationary parameters can now be estimated with the help of fig . [ fig : e1e2 ] . having analytically reconstructed an inflationary potential , its validity can be checked by evaluating the perturbations generated by the potential numerically , which will provide a further estimate of the magnitude of higher - order corrections . if these prove significant , the numerical results could be used to ` tune ' the reconstructed potential with the aim of removing any biases in estimation of other parameters . ultimately , analytic results obtained the way we describe can be compared with a direct numerical reconstruction as described in ref . @xcite , with the two methods providing invaluable cross - checks on each other . we have presented a strategy to measure the most important quantity in the context of inflationary models , the scale of inflation @xmath72 . it probes the time scale and thus the energy scale of new physics , which requires the detection of tensor contributions . sensitivity to gravitational waves is mainly provided via high - sensitivity polarization measurements , and it is these which may allow us to probe the highest energy scales for the first time .", "we thank lloyd knox , max tegmark and csar terrero - escalante for useful discussions . s.m.l . was supported by pparc and a.r.l .  in part by the leverhulme trust . d.j.s .  acknowledges a visit to the sussex astronomy centre funded by the austrian academy of sciences , the royal society and pparc . n.  w.  halverson et al . , astro - ph/0104489 ;

band superconductivity was found . after nearly four years of effort and the development of an extensive literature based on this material , it is now evident that this compound is an electron - phonon mediated superconductor , but with two distinct bands and hence two energy gaps . indeed , this is firmly established from detailed bandstructure calculations that provide the electron - phonon spectral densities which , when in turn are used in a two - band eliashberg formalism , give rise to predictions which are in accord with experiment . in fact , the picture that emerges is one of excellent agreement with the data , with the match being as good as is found between theory and experiment in conventional one - band superconductors@xcite . a detailed review and summary of the level of agreement found for the thermodynamic properties , bcs ratios , penetration depth and temperature - dependent energy gaps is found in ref . with such an extensive comparison between rigorous eliashberg theory and experiment completed , it is now appropriate to move on to the transport properties where less theoretical work has been done .    in this paper , we consider the critical current which is of fundamental interest in the discussion of transport . while most technological applications focus on the bulk critical current density , which requires understanding of flux lattice pinning , etc . , here we are presenting the critical current in thin films . this geometry is more relevant to understanding issues associated with the fundamental superconducting state , rather than focussing on material details that lead to vortex pinning , etc . , and hence can be expected to provide further insight into the nature of multiband superconductivity in these materials . we note in passing , at this point , that some authors use the term depairing current for the critical current although , technically , the depairing current is the current at which the first cooper pair is broken and the gap decreases , and the critical current is the maximum current possible , which is greater than the depairing current . in simple one - band s - wave bcs theory the values are almost the same and hence there is the tendency to use the terms interchangeably . here , these two quantities can be quite different and so we will use the term critical current to refer to the global maximum obtainable in the current density . the full temperature - dependence of the critical current @xmath2 was first studied in conventional one - band s - wave bcs superconductors by rogers@xcite and bardeen@xcite . further work following on this was done by parameter@xcite for the clean limit , and by maki@xcite for the dirty limit , where the latter author introduced a description of the superfluid current density using the green s function formalism . a study of the effect of of a current on the quasiparticle states density of states of a superconductor was done by fulde@xcite . the most general work was that of kupriyanov and lukichev@xcite , who calculated the full temperature dependence of the critical current in bcs theory for arbitrary impurity scattering , which returned the usual ginzburg - landau results for the critical current near @xmath6@xcite . further considerations led to an initial attempt to include strong inelastic scattering@xcite followed by a full eliashberg calculation and study of strong coupling effects for conventional electron - phonon superconductors done by ourselves@xcite . thus , the formalism and basic one - band results have been well - established in both the weak - coupling bcs limit and strong - coupling eliashberg regime , at all temperatures and for arbitrary impurity scattering . more recently there has been a renewed theoretical effort on the critical current as applied to exotic gaps , which are anisotropic , such as d - wave@xcite and f - wave@xcite . the two - band case is , in some sense , a highly anisotropic system and hence the study of the critical current in this instance also complements these recent works .    with regard to mgb@xmath5 , specifically , there has been some recent experimental work by kunchur@xcite , where the critical current has been measured in these systems . on the theoretical side , koshelev and golubov@xcite have gone beyond ginzburg - landau to use the usadel equations to study this system and find interesting effects such as a kink in the temperature - dependence of the c - axis critical current that reflects the underlying two - band nature . this type of feature is observed in other properties such as the penetration depth which also shows an inflection point in the temperature dependence , however , these effects may disappear with increased interband coupling . finally , a more recent work has been done on the topic of the non - linear term in the superfluid current in mgb@xmath5 and its effect on the nonlinear microwave response , which is relevant for device applications@xcite .    in our work here , we use the general green s function formulation presented by maki@xcite where the cooper pairs are given a finite center of mass momentum @xmath1 . this @xmath1 leads to a boost in the quasiparticle energy ( sometimes called a doppler shift ) . the superfluid velocity @xmath7 is taken as uniform in the case of discussing currents in thin films or wires , unlike the doppler shift effect in the context of superfluid currents in the vortex state , where @xmath8 varies with spatial position . this latter topic has been the subject of a large number of papers in the recent literature relating to d - wave superconductors@xcite . a very fine physical description of the effect of this doppler shift on the quasiparticle density of states and the resulting effect on the superfluid density is presented in a paper by xu et al.@xcite , where they consider the non - linear meissner effect in d - wave superconductors from a starting point that discusses the basics of the superfluid current density . thus , with a body of literature developing on the topic of critical currents and superfluid currents , it is of interest to elucidate the features in the critical current due to two - band superconductivity , where unusual effects can occur due to a transfer from one band to the other of the dominant contribution to superfluid current and hence the critical current . our paper is structured in the following manner . in section  ii , we introduce the basic theoretical equations which we have evaluated . we then examine , in section  iii , results for renormalized bcs theory near @xmath6 and at @xmath9 and apply these results to mgb@xmath5 . in section iv , we present our eliashberg results for finite temperature and with impurities , evaluating the critical current for mgb@xmath5 and other model parameters . we also compare our results to the data for mgb@xmath5 . finally , we form our conclusions in section  v.", "while various approaches have been used in the past for calculating the superfluid current , we will use the green s function method as presented by maki@xcite . thus the superfluid current density @xmath10 is given in terms of finite temperature green s functions as : @xmath11\\quad , \\label{eq : js1}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the electron charge , @xmath13 , the electron mass , @xmath14 is the electron momentum , and @xmath15 is the temperature . the green s function is given in terms of the matsubara representation by @xmath16^{-1 } , \\label{eq : greensfn}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the chemical potential , and the @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the pauli matrices for the particle -

( [ eq : bcs15 ] ) since the second band makes no contribution near @xmath113 , but now @xmath44 , @xmath13 , and @xmath131 are those of the first band only . in the general case , we need to return to eq . ( [ eq : bcs14 ] ) which tells us how material parameters affect the slope of @xmath132 which varies linearly with @xmath58 near @xmath6 . if we normalize the current , as we will in the next section , to a slope of negative one near @xmath6 , this will mean that the current at @xmath9 will vary with material parameters in contrast to the one - band bcs curve for which it is a universal number for the clean limit case that we are discussing here . a well known result of ginzburg - landau theory is that near @xmath6 , @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the thermodynamic critical field and @xmath135 is the london penetration depth , both for the case of zero current . in a previous paper@xcite , we have given expressions for @xmath134 and @xmath136 as @xmath99 . using these with eq . ( [ eq : bcs14 ] ) , we arrive at the expression relating the two - band @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 : @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the velocity of light and @xmath139 is a complicated material - dependent parameter . it is given by @xmath140^{-1 } \\label{eq : bcs18}\\ ] ] where we have found it convenient to change from electron density @xmath31 , to density of states at the fermi surface @xmath141 . this modifies the usual ginzburg - landau relation by a constant factor . for the decoupled case where @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 , @xmath139 becomes equal to 1 . there is no change in the ginzburg - landau relation and this makes sense since near @xmath145 we are dealing with the single band ( the first one ) . for the isotropic gap case , where @xmath122 for any @xmath146 , from eqs . ( [ eq : bcs6 ] ) and ( [ eq : bcs7 ] ) we obtain @xmath147 and @xmath148 , the average of the squares of the fermi velocities in the two bands , which gives @xmath149 for identical bands , this expression gives 1 , as it must . this also holds if either the two fermi velocities are the same or the two density of states match , but not if both parameters for one band differ from those of the other band . we see that , in general , @xmath139 can be either greater or less than one and the ginzburg - landau relation ceases to hold .    for identical bands but with gap anisotropy in the separable small anisotropy @xmath74 model , @xmath150 and @xmath151 , with @xmath104 and @xmath105 which gives @xmath152 to order @xmath74 . this result is expected since , as is well known , the @xmath74 anisotropy correction to @xmath134 and @xmath153 are both of the form @xmath154 which gives a factor of @xmath129 in the ratio @xmath155 . this agrees perfectly with the anisotropy factor we derived earlier for @xmath118 . thus , in this case , the ginzburg - landau relation will hold . we wish to comment on the use of the ginzburg - landau relation @xmath133 for comparison with data at all temperatures , which is done by substituting two - fluid model forms for @xmath134 and @xmath135 . the ginzburg - landau result should only hold near @xmath6 and indeed we find that when we form the ratio of @xmath155 using the @xmath134 and @xmath135 from the full eliashberg procedure , the resulting @xmath118 curve rapidly deviates from the eliashberg calculated @xmath118 . the results of using such a phenomenological procedure can give curves which are lower or higher than the true result , and will not even reproduce the qualitative feature of a kink in the @xmath118 that we have found in the two - band calculation . we conclude that the ginzburg - landau procedure should only be used near @xmath6 as is appropriate to its derivation and no reliable use can be made of it phenomenologically for lower temperatures . we now turn to low temperature and examine results of rbcs at @xmath9 . at zero temperature , the renormalized bcs gap equation ( [ eq : rbcsdel ] ) takes on the form @xmath156 where the barred quantities are renormalized by the factor of @xmath157 of eq . ( [ eq : rbcsz ] ) and @xmath158    ( 250,200 )    these equations need to be solved numerically . results are shown in the four lefthand panels of fig . the top frame is for @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 ( nearly decoupled bands ) and @xmath123 . because @xmath162 is so small , the larger gap @xmath163 exhibits the known behavior as a function of @xmath164 of a one - band s - wave superconductor@xcite with a small modification . in one - band , the gap would be unchanged until @xmath165 at which point it would begin a sharp drop toward zero which is reached at @xmath166 . here , the same behavior occurs but there is a very slight drop from the @xmath90 value of @xmath57 at @xmath167 due to the coupling to the second band . the lower gap behaves differently . it retains its @xmath90 value until @xmath167 at which point it also begins a rapid drop but retains a small finite value until the point when @xmath168 . this small tail is due to the coupling @xmath169 which guarantees that the second gap is nonzero , although it can be very small , as long as the first gap is finite . in the second frame @xmath169 has been increased to 0.1 . this results in a considerable integration of the two gaps . at @xmath90 the lower gap ratio @xmath170 has increased from the 0.4 value of the top frame to 0.57 . more significantly for the present paper , as @xmath1 increases both gaps retain their @xmath90 value until @xmath171 , which is the point at which the second gap starts to decrease , but this drop is not as fast as in the top frame because of the large interband coupling . at the same point as the second gap starts to decrease , the first is also reduced but by much less . beyond @xmath165 both gaps drop sharply as expected and reach zero together at @xmath172 , a value which is smaller than the one band value of 1.35 . this shift in zero along the horizontal axis is also accompanied by a shift to the left , relative to the decoupled case , of the inflection points just described , but these shifts are small . these are signatures of the two - band nature of our system . in the third frame of fig . [ fig1 ] ( lefthand side ) , we have retained @xmath173 but now have increased the ratio @xmath174 to 2.0 instead of 1.0 . this has the effect of reducing the region of @xmath1 in which the second gap remains constant at its @xmath90 value and is due to the increase in @xmath175 . for the last frame , we have kept the parameters as in the first frame but have increased @xmath176 to a value of 0.7 . this has the effect of increasing the @xmath90 value of the second gap and also increasing the range over which it stays constant . additionally , the tail beyond @xmath167 is not as small as it is in the top frame due to less gap anisotropy . ( 250,200 )    in renormalized bcs , eq . ( [ eq : rbcsjs ] ) for the partial current can be evaluated analytically at zero temperature to obtain @xmath177^{3/2}\\biggr],\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad \\qquad { \\rm for }   \\frac{\\bar s_i}{\\delta_{i0}}>1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] results for the current are presented in the righthand side frames of fig . [ fig1 ] for the four sets of parameters considered on the lefthand side . in all cases , the dotted lines give the results for the partial contribution to the current coming from the second band and the dashed for those from the first . the sum of the two partial contributions is the solid curve . a first feature to note is that for the three frames for which @xmath173 ( nearly decoupled ) , the dashed curves are essentially identical . the straight line segment has slope 0.5 in our units and the zero is very nearly at @xmath178 as in the one - band case . note that on the vertical axis , we have used the total electronic density of states @xmath179 with @xmath180 . if we had used only @xmath181 then the slope of the straight line segment would have been 1 which corresponds to what is expected in the one - band case . a second point to note is that increasing @xmath169 to 0.1 as in the second frame from the top has not had a large effect on the partial current from the first band except to reduce somewhat the value of @xmath1 at which the current goes to zero . this is accompanied by a small shift to the left in the position of the peak and a small reduction in its height . by contrast , the effect of the parameter changes are much more significant on the dotted curve ( the current in the second band ) . in the top frame , the slope of the straight line portion of the dotted curve is a little larger than 0.5 because of the renormalization factors on @xmath175 relative to @xmath182 . more significantly the partial current starts to deviate from linearity at @xmath183 at which point it drops rapidly towards zero but remains finite ( although small ) until the current in the first band has reached zero . this also applies to the third frame although in that case the current in the second band has been increased in value because of the increase in @xmath184 by a factor of two . in all cases the total current ( solid curve ) exhibits two peaks . the peak arising at lower values of @xmath1 has a significant contribution from both bands while the other peak at higher values of @xmath1 is due almost entirely to the partial current of the first band when @xmath169 is very small . on the other hand , when there is more integration of the two systems ( second frame from top ) both bands can make a significant contribution . in the top three frames , the first peak is lower than the second while in the fourth frame , the opposite holds . the height of the first peak can be made higher by increasing the value of @xmath184 as in the third frame compared with the first ( or equivalently , increasing @xmath185 as the density of states enters in combination with @xmath131 and so will have a similar effect , which is redundant to discuss here ) or by increasing @xmath176 as in the fourth , again compared with the first . it can also be increased by increasing the offdiagonal coupling as in the second frame . when this is done , however , the contribution of the second band to the total current in the second peak is also increased . finally we note that the peak heights in the two middle frames are only very slightly different and the lower @xmath1 peak could be made to be the highest through a small tuning of the parameters . as the highest peak determines the value of @xmath2 , this transfer from one peak to the other by varying parameters is very interesting and will produce nonstandard effects at finite temperature .      before leaving our discussion of rbcs at @xmath9 , it is of interest to consider the specific case of mgb@xmath5 now well - established to be a two - band electron - phonon superconductor . microscopic parameters have been calculated from extensions of bandstructure calculations to obtain the electron - phonon spectral densities . the coulomb repulsion parameters that enter the gap equations ( [ eq : del ] ) and ( [ eq : z ] ) are also known . the parameters are @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , with @xmath194 mev . the ratio of the two density of states @xmath195 and of the fermi velocities @xmath196 . to switch to our notation , @xmath197 . we start with rbcs results . in the top frame of fig . [ fig2 ] , we show the dependence of @xmath163 and @xmath198 normalized to @xmath199 as a function of @xmath164 . on comparison with some of the results of fig .  [ fig1 ] , we note that mgb@xmath5 shows considerable integration of the two bands and also both gaps become zero at @xmath200 which is considerably reduced from the one - band bcs value .    an interesting quantity that could be measured is the quasiparticle density of states @xmath201 in the presence of a current , which was first examined for one - band s - wave superconductors by fulde@xcite . such measurements have recently been reported for pb in ref . @xcite . for each band separately @xmath202\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath203 . in the bottom frame of fig . [ fig2 ] , we give results for @xmath204 as a function of @xmath205 for various values of @xmath1 as indicated in the figure . the solid curve is essentially the zero current limit and shows the expected superposition of two bcs quasiparticle density of states with square root singularities at the two gaps . as the current is increased in the linear region only ( cross - referencing with the upper frame of fig . [ fig3 ] which shows @xmath0 for mgb@xmath5 ) , the singular structure is smeared and the gap region fills as does the region between the two gaps . gapless behavior appears at a value of @xmath1 near the first peak in the total current due to the density of states in the small band going gapless . this is in contrast to what is found in a one - band s - wave superconductor@xcite where the gapless behavior occurs at the critical current . ( 250,200 )    the superfluid current @xmath0 versus @xmath1 for the rbcs calculation with mgb@xmath5 parameters is plotted in the upper frame of fig . the line types are defined in the same way as for the @xmath0 curves in fig . we note that this graph is very similar to that shown in the second frame ( righthand side ) of fig . [ fig1 ] , where it has been discussed in relation to other cases . as in that graph , the peak in the total current seen at low @xmath1 is lower than the one at higher @xmath1 , so that this second peak determines the critical current . it is of considerable interest to compare these renormalized bcs results with those from full eliashberg calculations based on the @xmath206 spectra given in ref . very similar values of the parameters can also be found in ref . such results are presented in the lower frame of fig . there are several differences that are worthy of note . the full eliashberg results are at @xmath207 and the rbcs are for @xmath9 . this difference in temperature is small and is not expected to lead to any significant differences . examination of the partial currents shows that the dashed curves are almost the same in both plots except that strong coupling effects have shifted the point of zero current to a slightly smaller value of @xmath1 . this is accompanied by a shift to the left of the position of the peak , a reduction in its height and an increase in the rounding , all small effects . these differences are seen to be slightly more prominent in the dotted curve . this shows that rbcs can be used with confidence as a first approximation . however , from this point on , we will consider only eliashberg results as we have available to us the electron - phonon spectral functions and we wish to consider the full effects of temperature and impurities . ( 250,200 )", "at the end of the last section , we showed a comparison between rbcs and eliashberg theory ( fig . [ fig3 ] ) . given that the electron - phonon spectral functions for mgb@xmath5 are available , it is appropriate to work with the full theory for @xmath2 as a function of temperature and impurity scattering . we begin with a consideration of temperature effects . in the upper frame of fig . [ fig4 ] , we show the current @xmath208 normalized by @xmath209 as a function of @xmath164 for nine values of temperature from @xmath207 to 0.9 in steps of 0.1 . the parameters used are those appropriate to mgb@xmath5 with the upper curve reproduced from the bottom frame of fig . [ fig3 ] . as the temperature is increased , the peak with larger value of @xmath1 remains the highest and therefore determines the critical current given as the solid curve in the lower frame . here , @xmath2 has been normalized by @xmath210 so that the slope at @xmath145 is negative one by arrangement for the typical critical current plot of @xmath211 , which is designed to bring out the ginzburg - landau behavior near @xmath6 . we see a smooth ( concave downward ) increase in @xmath118 as @xmath212 is reduced . the value of the critical current at @xmath213 is @xmath214 . this is lower than the one - band bcs value of 0.72 . this reduction could reflect the two - band nature of mgb@xmath5 as well as strong coupling corrections@xcite due to our use of the full eliashberg equations ( [ eq : del ] ) and ( [ eq : z ] ) to calculate the current given by eq . ( [ eq : js2 ] ) . however , reference to the lower frame of fig .  [ fig3 ] shows that the second band contributes only about 10% to the total critical current at @xmath9 and this remains true at @xmath6 . consequently , this curve is very nearly the single band result and deviates from the classical bcs curve almost entirely because of retardation effects . also shown is the data of kunchur@xcite , plotted as solid dots . there is good agreement between the data and the solid curve which is quite remarkable as the calculation has no free parameters , in principle , as they are all given in the literature . including impurity scattering has an effect on the temperature dependence of @xmath118 , as we will discuss later in relation to fig . unfortunately , information on the individual intraband scattering rates in these films for @xmath215 and @xmath216 bands , separately , is not available to us . including some impurity scattering in the @xmath215 band would futher improve the agreement with experiment . the other critical current curves in fig . [ fig4 ] are for different ratios of @xmath174 as indicated in the figure caption . in addition to allowing for some uncertainty in the reported @xmath131 values in the literature , this also mimics the possibility of currents associated with the c - axis where the @xmath216-band is known to have a much smaller @xmath131 than the @xmath215-band . likewise , we have not included the details of the full fermi surface average in the expression for the current , however , it is known that the @xmath216-band is quasi - two - dimensional as opposed to the more three - dimensional @xmath215-band . dahm and scalapino@xcite find significant geometrical corrections associated with such averaging which could also accentuate the difference between the two bands . this may also be approximately captured by our use of different @xmath131 ratios . all the curves are normalized to have a slope of negative one at @xmath145 . as @xmath184 is increased , the normalized critical current at zero temperature increases and can become considerably larger than its one - band bcs value . there is also a change in the temperature variation of the curves , the dashed curve shows a clear kink around @xmath217 while the long - dashed curve shows concave upward behavior at intermediate temperatures . this can be understood better when the pattern of behavior shown in fig . [ fig5 ] is considered . ( 250,200 )    the top frame gives the temperature evolution for the case @xmath218 and the bottom is for a ratio of 4 . the notation is as for the top frame of fig . [ fig4 ] and for the same nine reduced temperatures . in the top frame , it is the peak at lower @xmath1 which determines the critical current at @xmath213 while at higher @xmath212 , it is the peak with higher @xmath1 . this crossover occurs between @xmath219 and @xmath220 and leads to the kink seen in the dashed curve of fig . [ fig4 ] ( lower frame ) . if we look at the individual contributions from each band ( not shown here ) to the total current , we find that at @xmath9 it is the second band which makes the dominant contribution because of its large value of @xmath131 but near @xmath6 this contribution has decayed sufficiently that it only makes a 30% contribution to the total .    in the lower frame of fig . [ fig5 ] , the peak at smaller value of @xmath1 has greatly increased in magnitude over its value in the top frame . it has also moved to a lower value of @xmath1 as expected from fig .  1 . however , now there is no crossover from smaller to larger @xmath1 peak and hence no kink . nevertheless , the dotted curve is very different from a one - band bcs variation . we can understand better how this can arise by once more looking at the partial contribution to the critical current from each band . at @xmath9 it is the second band which dominates while at @xmath6 it accounts only for 2/3 of the total with the remaining 1/3 contribution from band one . this difference in admixture of the two bands with temperature is seen to be enough to cause an upward curvature in the dotted curve at intermediate temperatures as well as to increase the value of the normalized critical current at @xmath9 to a value considerably larger than the bcs value of 0.72 . increasing @xmath184 further as in the long - dashed curve of the lower frame of fig . [ fig4 ] increases the @xmath9 value even further as the peak at lower @xmath1 value becomes even more prominent . details of the temperature variation of the critical current clearly depend on details of the microscopic parameters of the two bands involved , such as values of @xmath221 . for example , it is possible to shift the kink in @xmath118 to higher values of reduced temperature and to make it sharper by considering other parameter sets . ( 250,200 )    to illustrate this , in fig . [ fig6 ] we show results for a lorentzian @xmath222 spectrum defined in detail in our previous paper@xcite . in this model , @xmath159 and we take @xmath223 to decrease the gap anisotropy as compared with mgb@xmath5 . we have also taken @xmath173 ( nearly decoupled bands ) . the top frame gives the current @xmath224 for the case of @xmath218 , for the nine values of reduced temperature previously chosen . with this @xmath131 ratio , the peak with lower value of @xmath1 remains highest at small @xmath212 and the crossover of the maximum to the other peak occurs at a reduced temperature between 0.6 and 0.7 . this manifests itself as a sharp kink in the solid curve for @xmath2 ( bottom frame ) at this same temperature . also shown in this same frame are results for the critical current when @xmath225 ( dotted ) and @xmath226 ( dot - dashed ) . for the larger value of @xmath184 , the normalized current at @xmath9 is increased over the @xmath218 case as expected and for @xmath227 it is reduced but remains above bcs . in this latter case , the two peaks in the current versus @xmath1 are closer together than they are in the top frame of fig .  [ fig6 ] and seem to almost merge before the crossover from lower to higher @xmath1 peak occurs , which means that the kink in the dotted curve can hardly be seen . it is clear that a rich pattern of behavior exists for the current versus @xmath1 at different reduced @xmath212 in a two - band model . this translates into quite distinct temperature dependence for @xmath118 as compared with the one - band bcs canonical behavior . some addition insight into this complicated behavior can be obtained from a consideration of simplified but analytic bcs results in the limiting case of two decoupled , well - separated bands , i.e. , for small values of the gap anisotropy @xmath228 . under this assumption , @xmath144 , @xmath229 , @xmath230 , and @xmath231 so that the critical current near @xmath6 given by formula ( [ eq : bcs14 ] ) reduces to @xmath232 and is determined entirely by band one , as previously commented upon . as the temperature is lowered , however , two possible circumstances can arise . the critical current can remain determined by the same band ( number one ) in which case we can write approximately @xmath233 a second possibility is that a crossover to the peak at lower @xmath1 value occurs and we have approximately @xmath234 for the first case , @xmath235 which is the one - band bcs result where we have normalized the critical current in such a way that @xmath211 has a slope of negative one at @xmath145 . this conforms with what we have done in the lower frames of figs . [ fig4 ] and [ fig6 ] . for the second case , by assumption , there is a crossover and @xmath236^{2/3}. \\label{eq : bcse}\\ ] ] this simplified approximate formula shows clearly that the anisotropy @xmath237 on its own reduces the value of @xmath238 below its universal bcs value of 0.72 while a large value of @xmath239 relative to @xmath240 or @xmath184 relative to @xmath241 increases it and that this reduced dimensionless quantity is no longer universal . it can depend on the band structure parameters as well as on the gap anisotropy . next we consider the effect of impurities on the current . it is instructive to begin by expanding eq . ( [ eq : js2 ] ) for @xmath224 to lowest order in @xmath1 . doing so leads to the well - known and physically expected result that for small superfluid velocity @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the superfluid density of the @xmath33th band given for a strong coupling superconductor by @xmath244^{3/2}}\\biggr ] \\label{eq : bcsg}\\ ] ] in bcs at @xmath9 , this becomes @xmath245 and @xmath246 for band 1 and band 2 , respectively . the slope of @xmath247 as a function of @xmath8 gives @xmath248 with eq . ( [ eq : bcsg ] ) valid for any temperature and any impurity content . the impurities enter only through the eliashberg gap equations ( [ eq : del ] ) and ( [ eq : z ] ) . as the temperature is increased , the superfluid density is reduced and so the slope of @xmath224 seen in figs . [ fig4 ] to [ fig6 ] is correspondingly reduced . impurities also reduce the superfluid density . in bcs , the known result for each of the two bands separately , to lowest order , is @xmath249 with @xmath250 and @xmath251 , the coherence length and impurity mean free path in the @xmath33th band , respectively . this applies to intraband scattering which reduces the initial slope of the partial current coming from each band . ( 250,200 )    results are presented in fig . [ fig7 ] , where we also consider the interband case @xmath252 . in the top frame , we show @xmath0 versus @xmath1 for the reduced temperature @xmath253 in the lorentzian model used in fig . the solid curve applies to the pure case and is for comparison . we show only three cases , one where @xmath254 ( dotted curve ) , @xmath255 ( dashed curve ) , and @xmath256 , where @xmath257 is the @xmath6 without impurities ( in the case of @xmath258 and @xmath259 , @xmath6 will be unaffected , but not so for interband impurities ) . intraband impurities reduce only the partial contribution to the current coming from that band . it reduces its value on the vertical axis and extends the x - axis to higher values of @xmath1 leaving the second band largely unaffected . of course , since both bands contribute significantly to the total current in the region of the peak corresponding to the smaller value of @xmath1 , its magnitude is reduced even in the dotted curve . on the other hand , for the dashed curve , there is little change in the region of the second peak which is dominated by the first band . by contrast interband impurities modify both bands in a similar fashion . the corresponding critical current as a function of @xmath260 is shown in the lower frame . the solid line is the pure case of fig . as expected , a finite value of @xmath258 has reduced the critical current below its value in the pure case at all temperatures , however , when normalized to a slope of magnitude one near @xmath6 , the effect pushes the curve up at low @xmath15 . a kink remains and the crossover temperature is only slightly shifted toward higher values . for the dashed curve , the significant modifications arise only below the kink temperature . by contrast the main effect of the interband impurities is to wash out the kink structure leaving the rest of the curve largely unaffected ( of course the @xmath6 would show a small shift downwards relative to @xmath257 , not shown here ) .", "in conventional one - band s - wave superconductors , the energy gap @xmath57 remains unaffected by the flow of a supercurrent up to a critical value of the superfluid velocity @xmath7 ( ie . , @xmath261 ) at which point pairbreaking becomes possible . in this region , the current @xmath0 is linear in @xmath8 with proportionality constant equal to the superfluid density . beyond this critical value of @xmath8 , the rapid reduction in the gap in addition to a quasiparticle backflow current leads to @xmath262 at @xmath263 . for two nearly decoupled bands , we would expect that the total current to exhibit a two - peak structure as a function of @xmath8 . a first one near the critical value of the superfluid velocity for band two and the other near the larger critical value of @xmath8 corresponding to the first band alone . the first peak has in general a significant contribution from both bands ( unless @xmath264 ) while the second peak could be due mainly to the first band . the relative admixture depends on microscopic parameters such as density of states @xmath265 and fermi velocities @xmath32 , as well as gap anisotropy . when @xmath184 is made large as compared to @xmath241 , the first peak moves to lower values of @xmath8 and can also become larger than the second at low temperature . as the temperature is increased the superfluid density in each band is reduced but that in the second band is more strongly affected because of its smaller gap value . consequently , since the critical current is determined by the height of the highest peak , one can have a crossover from the first to second peak as @xmath15 is raised from @xmath266 to @xmath6 and this will reflect itself as a kink in the temperature dependence of the critical current . such a feature is also found in the dirty limit calculations presented in ref . @xcite for the critical current along the c - axis . when there is a significant interband coupling or the two gaps are close in value ( isotropic case ) the two peaks in the total current cease to be independent and a rich pattern of behavior emerges for the temperature and impurity dependence of the two peaks . in particular , as the temperature is raised , the first peak can remain the determining peak for @xmath2 up to @xmath6 or it can become the smaller of the two at a crossover temperature which can be increased or decreased through judicious choices of parameters . another possibility is that the two peaks merge into one or that the second peak is the dominant one at all temperatures . application to the specific case mgb@xmath5 , which involves no adjustable parameters , gives good agreement with the in - plane data of kunchur@xcite . if the resulting critical current @xmath211 is normalized to have slope of negative one as a function of @xmath58 near @xmath145 , the corresponding value of the critical current at @xmath9 will differ from its classic one - band bcs value of 0.72 . strong coupling effects resulting from our use of the full eliashberg equations , with appropriate electron - phonon spectral densities describing the electron - phonon interaction , are known@xcite to always reduce the normalized value of @xmath267 while two - band effects can reduce or increase it depending on the detailed values of the microscopic parameters involved . in particular , a large value of @xmath184 relative to @xmath241 can lead to values that can be even larger than one . this is expected for the case of current orientated along the c - axis for the specific parameters representative of mgb@xmath5 . in this case , because the @xmath216 band ( band one in our notation ) is nearly two - dimensional , the fermi velocity of the @xmath215 band in the c - direction will be much greater than that for the @xmath216 band . the superfluid density in each subband , which determines the initial slope of the linear in @xmath8 regime for the supercurrent , is reduced with the increase in intraband impurity scattering . this fact can be used to manipulate the position along the @xmath8 axis and size of the two peaks in the total current and consequently the temperature dependence of the resulting critical current . introducing impurities in the first band will reduce the critical current at all temperatures since this band always makes a contribution to the total current . on the other hand , if they are introduced only in the second band , this will leave the critical current largely unaltered around @xmath113 . interband impurity scattering affects both bands although not necessarily in exactly the same way and leads to the smoothing out of the kink in @xmath268 versus @xmath212 when it exists .    in conclusion , we predict a complex pattern of behavior for the total current as a function of @xmath8 , temperature and impurity content which can be used to restrict further the values of the microscopic parameters involved in two - band superconductors , such as mgb@xmath5 . ejn acknowledges funding from nserc , the government of ontario ( prea ) , and the university of guelph . jpc acknowledges support from nserc and the ciar . this research was supported in part by the national science foundation under grant no . phy99 -

storm et al . @xcite have applied the same stress - strain relation to a crosslinked network by assuming the affine elastic strain acting on each filament and the probability distribution of semiflexible filament length of wilhelm and frey  @xcite . this model qualitatively describes how the network behaves when being deformed ; however , it can only be used numerically ( since no closed expressions are possible ) and it omits the pre - stress acting on the chains , as in this model the tension is assumed as zero when there is no deformation . wilhelm and frey also produced a numerical simulation of filament network elasticity on their own  @xcite , using the mikado model of connectivity and athermal rigid rods as elastic elements . although important issues of percolation rigidity threshold are exposed , this work can not be used to describe most experimentally relevant ( and most biological ) filaments . more recently , palmer and boyce  @xcite proposed a closed analytical form of elastic free energy , with the corresponding constitutive relation , using the same force - extension filament relationship as storm et al . they applied the ` 8-chain model ' originally introduced in the context of ordinary rubber elasticity  @xcite with an approximate expression for individual filament elasticity applied for each strand . this might be the best attempt in formulating the nonlinear elasticity of semiflexible network to date . on the other hand , unterberger et.al . @xcite developed a ` 1-chain ' model for a network , by assuming filaments have a homogenous orientational distribution in the equilibrium system , and the average ( imposed ) stretch of the network @xmath4 is a @xmath5-root average of deformations of individual filaments : @xmath6^{1/p } / a^{1/p}$ ] , where @xmath7 is the deformation of an individual filament , @xmath5 is the averaging parameter and @xmath8 the area of the unit sphere . this procedure allows the local stretch to fluctuate around its average value , and may partly account for the nonaffinity . this model could only be applied numerically to reproduce several key mechanical features ( shear and normal stress ) . most good models discussed here make a successful fitting of shear stress data of different filament networks , which captures the generic stress - stiffening effect originating from the characteristic divergence of the force - extension curve of an individual filament . usually , the authors employ the versions of celebrated marco - siggia interpolation formula  @xcite , which gives the correct response for filaments near full - extension ( but much less so for more flexible filaments ) . in fact , the well - known mackintosh scaling of differential shear modulus with stress , @xmath9 , in the stress - stiffening regime is entirely based on the mentioned divergence of an individual filament near full extension  @xcite ( it holds even for an athermal network of undulating filaments , as long as the tensile force is proportional to the inverse - square of the compression , as is the case near full extension  @xcite ) . therefore , a mere agreement ( good fitting ) of shear stress - strain curves is not a sufficient test of different theories . in particular , they must simultaneously descibe the effect of negative normal stress in the network of stiffer filaments , with a positive normal stress ( also known as the weissenberg effect ) for networks made of more flexible chains  @xcite . it turns out that none of the mentioned theories , including the 8-chain model of palmer and boyce , are able to produce the correct normal stress , or address the network stability increasing with filament pre - tension@xcite . in this paper we develop and discuss a continuum theory of semiflexible network ( in closed analytical form ) that addresses these issues , while retaining accurate fitting of a wide range of shear stress data .", "before introducing free energy of a semiflexible network , we need to discuss the properties of a single semiflexible filament . a filament connecting two neighboring crosslinks in a network is sketched in fig . [ fig_1](a ) , with coordinates @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the arc - length coordinate along the chain . different approaches to the chain ( in)extensibility have been tested over the years  @xcite , from the strict constraint to the requirement that the length of filament remains constant on average ( while small local fluctuations are allowed )  @xcite , to the models that explicitly include filament stretching  @xcite . it turns out that in the regime of high extension , when there are no foldbacks ( hairpins ) on the chain , all length - constraining models give the same divergence of the force - extension , @xmath12 , with the end - to - end ratio @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the end - to - end length of the filament , fig . [ fig_1](a ) . this was used by the famous interpolation formula of marko and siggia  @xcite . more recently , a complete theory of filament entropic elasticity has been developed , which spans the full range of extensions and the full range of bending modulus  @xcite .    in the worm - like chain model  @xcite , the bending energy can be expressed by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the bending rigidity . the key physical quantity for describing the stiffness of a polymer chain is the persistence length @xmath17 . when the contour length of the filament , @xmath18 , is comparable with its persistence length @xmath19 , the chain is regarded as  semiflexible \" . combining the effects of enthalpy arising from bending and entropy of conformation fluctuations , the closed form of the single chain free energy  @xcite can be expressed as a function of its end - to - end factor , @xmath13 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a dimensionless stiffness parameter reflecting the competition between bending and thermal energy ; in our notation @xmath22 . in ref.@xcite one can find the comparison with several notable models of semiflexible filament ( marko - siggia and ha - thirumalai ) and where they deviate from the accurate expression ( [ achain ] ) .    , and end - to - end length @xmath14 being the mesh size . ( b ) the relationship @xcite between the tensile force , @xmath23 , and end - to - end factor , @xmath24 , plotted for semiflexible chains with different stiffness @xmath25 , and marking the position @xmath26 for a chain to stay at the force - free state . ] as shown in fig  [ fig_1](b ) , if the value of @xmath25 is smaller than a critical value @xmath27 , the minimum of the free energy ( or the force - free natural length ) will be at @xmath28 ; such a chain can be regarded as flexible . when @xmath29 , one recovers the gaussian entropic spring form : @xmath30 . the marko - siggia ( in fact , fixman - kovac ) limit commonly used for quick fitting of force - extension curves is reached for flexible chains at high extension @xmath31 : @xmath32 . when @xmath33 , the chain can be regarded as a stiff rod with a natural length @xmath34 , and its energy is dominated by elastic bending : @xmath35 $ ] . under compression @xmath36 such a filament undergoes euler buckling instability . note that on forming a crosslinked network , @xmath37 does not need to be equal to @xmath26 for each strand in equilibrium , meaning there can be pre - tension in the network . we now construct the continuum elastic free energy of a network of such filaments using the methodology that was successfully developed in rubber elasticity  @xcite . if the sample shape is changed with a deformation tensor @xmath38 , then the corresponding cauchy - green tensor  @xcite is @xmath39 , with eigenvalues : @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . the values @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 can be interpreted as stretching ratios along the principal directions of deformation . a class of simple , yet powerful theories of rubber elasticity is formulated in terms of invariants of the c - g tensor , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . famous examples of this class are neo - hookean ( gaussian ) , mooney - rivlin , and gent models ( see @xcite for review ) . note that polymer networks are frequently treated as incompressible , so @xmath49 .        for a polymer network , the chains are distributed and crosslinked randomly throughout the material , which is the main difficulty in obtaining an analytical expression of the total free energy of the network ( unless the individual chain is gaussian ) . to incorporate a more complicated chain , such as eq . ( [ achain ] ) , into a constitutive framework , it is necessary to have a model that relates the chain deformation to the applied affine strain . this can be accomplished by representing an element of volume in the average network as a `` mesh cell '' , which is then symmetrically multiplied to fill the volume . here we need to distinguish  affinity \" and  non - affinity \" in a filament network constructed by the unit - cell method . a  mesh cell \" is deformed differently from the material , as these cells are constructed in orientation aligned with the principal stretching direction of the material , which is referred to as  non - affinity \" by palmer and boyce  @xcite . all mesh cells deform in the same way , with repeated deformed structure . however , the real non - affinity can arise from the different responses among different  mesh cells \" , due to local force relaxation . in this work we refer to the concepts of  affinity \" or  non - affinity \" in the local context of individual filament junctions and mesh cells , rather than the global one between the orientation of a mesh cell and the macroscopic deformation of the material . in assuming a symmetry of repeated mesh cells , we automatically discard the effects of the local non - affine deformations  @xcite , i.e. take all mesh cells deforming uniformly , which we know must be the case at least for stiff filaments @xcite . since there is no quantitative way of assessing the degree of the error introduced by the affine approximation ( in our interpretation ) , we will have to look at the fits to the experimental data for validation . within a mesh cell , chains or crosslinks have several possible arrangements , reflecting what one assumes about the topology of the network mesh , see fig . [ models ] . most acceptable structures include the homogeneous sphere ( hs ) in 1-chain network model , the primitive cubic ( pc ) in 3-chain model , tetrahedral ( th ) in 4-chain model , and body - centered cubic ( bcc ) in 8-chain model ( see @xcite and a review @xcite for detail ) .    in 1-chain model  @xcite , one end of a polymer chain is fixed at the center of a sphere , while the other end is on the sphere surface at an arbitrary orientation @xmath50 , distributed isotropically . when deformed by @xmath38 , with stretching ratios along principal directions @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath51 , the lengths of the three semi - axes will change from @xmath14 , to @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . the elastic energy density of the network can be expressed as an orientational average of a deformed filament : @xmath55,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the density of crosslinked chains and @xmath57 . if one takes the ` entropic spring ' limit of the gaussian chain , the average @xmath58 reduces to the classical neo - hookean rubber - elastic expression @xmath59 $ ] . however , in the general case the free energy in 1-chain model can not be expressed in analytical form as a function of strain invariants , which renders it less convenient . in the following , we compare the 3- and 8-chain models , and decide on the 3-chain model preference , in particular due to the failure of 8-chain model in reproducing the normal stress .    in the 3-chain model , a primitive cubic is constructed with lattice points representing the crosslinking sites , and the edges are aligned along the principle directions of deformation tensor @xmath38 . three chains are linked with their end - to - end vectors along the edges and the equilibrium mesh size @xmath14 . on deformation , the lengths of three perpendicular edges at one lattice point become @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively . then the free energy density of a semiflexible network can be expressed as @xmath63 equation  ( [ 3chain1 ] ) can be rearranged as a function of the strain invariants : @xmath64\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath13 as used in eq .

[ constitutiverelation](a ) . the stiffness , @xmath25 , and the initial end - to - end factor , @xmath83 , obtained by fitting with 3-chain model are a bit smaller than those in 8-chain model , but both in the semiflexible regime . this is because the eight chains in a bcc are stretched equally ( in principal axes ) and share the deformation , while the three chains in a pc are stretched differently and the most stretched one contributes the most to the nonlinear elastic energy . we believe the intrinsic heterogeneity in the 3-chain model , and the fact that the chain lying along the maximum principle stretch direction dominates the response of the whole cubic in semiflexible networks , is closer to the realistic case of filament network . in addition , we shall see below that the 8-chain model can not explain negative normal stress . hence we apply the 3-chain model in the following . figure  [ constitutiverelation](b ) shows fits to experimental data for a wide variety of semiflexible filaments . in this figure we plot the shear modulus @xmath84 instead of stress , because the fitting convergence is much better when the initial data section is close to 1 . fitted parameters @xmath85 are listed in table  [ thenetwork ] , along with other parameters for each material that we list from the literature . .fitting parameters @xmath85 for collagen , actin , vimentin , fibrin and neurofilament data obtained from @xcite . also shown are the linear modulus @xmath0 extracted from the original data and used for scaling in fig .

[ constitutiverelation](b ) are pre - compressed , rather than pre - stretched in the equilibrium state of the network . as table  [ thenetwork ] shows , no matter what the effective stiffness of the examined biofilaments , the ratio of fitted parameters @xmath93 remains close to 1 . later , when we discuss the network stability ( fig . 6 ) , it will become clear that all the networks we examined here lie very near the stability boundary . it is not clear to us whether the fact that the mesh size is close to the filament persistence length is an unintended result of different crosslinking density in experiments  @xcite , or is a relevant and universal biological feature . it is clear that networks of biological filaments have a great variety even within the same substance . figure [ actin32 ] shows the published data for in - vitro crosslinked actin networks reported by different groups , all performing the simple - shear experiment ( the data is digitized from a reference given in the plot ) . the stress - strain plotted in log - log format allows a clear identification of the linear regime @xmath94 ( the modulus varying between 95pa and 1pa for different sets ) , and the subsequent stiffening at higher shear . all curves in fig .

[ actin32](a ) , for each data set . one has to make a comment here , in the context of @xmath107 scaling and different experiments . in many cases , such as in unterberger et.al . @xcite , the actin network was crosslinked by hmm and apparently retains some transient activity , producing the stress - softening and plasticity at higher stress ( this is also the case in  @xcite before the actin filaments formed bundles , or with f - actin crosslinked by filamin ) . of course , our theory is not intended to deal with network plasicity ( we assumed all crosslinkes permanent ) and therefore we only retained the experimental data points in the early stress - stiffening regime to see the 3/2 scaling .    on the other hand , just by examining the actual data for the actin network of storm et.al . @xcite , one might conclude that it strongly and systematically deviates from the 3/2 scaling . in fact , the authors of  @xcite develop their own theory invoking various additional factors ( e.g. filament extensibility ) to account for this data . however , our basic theory , assuming permanent crosslinks , bulk incompressibility and inextensible filaments , evidently fits both @xmath120 and @xmath118 data very well . the fact that the data ( and the predicted curve ) do not appear to follow the 3/2 scaling is be due to the fact that , for these values of @xmath25 and @xmath37 , the final crossover to this characteristic scaling regime would occur at an even higher stress ( at which point the network would probably not survive in practice ) .", "though simple shear deformation was helpful in this analysis , the important issue of normal stress remains controversial . this is mainly because of the uncertain boundary conditions , see ref.@xcite for detail . since the experiments reporting normal stress measurements are most commonly conducted in rotating cylindrical geometry of a standard rheometer   @xcite , we will consider this geometry and realistic boundary conditions to describe the response of the material in its normal direction when a shear is applied , as shown in fig . [ poynting](a ) . suppose the height and the radius of the undeformed cylinder are @xmath121 and @xmath122 , respectively ; on deformation they may become @xmath123 and @xmath124 . incompressibility maintains @xmath125 . in the @xmath126 coordinate system , after rotating the top plate by the angle @xmath127 , the coordinates change as : @xmath128 : @xmath129 where @xmath130 denotes the shear strain , which is a function of the radial position in this parallel - plate geometry . the strain invariants become : @xmath131/\\lambda_h$ ] and @xmath132/\\lambda_h^{2}$ ] . given the shear strain at the outermost surface , @xmath133 , the total free energy then becomes a function of the stretching ratio @xmath134 along the @xmath135 axis , after integration over radius : @xmath136 the equilibrium @xmath134 can be obtained by minimizing this free energy . when the cylinder radius becomes smaller ( or larger ) upon shear , with its height becoming correspondingly larger ( or smaller )  this phenomenon is called the positive ( or negative ) poynting effect @xcite . this geometric effect with stress - free top plate corresponds to the positive ( negative ) normal stress required to maintain the fixed plate separation in a more common rheometry experiment @xcite . the 8-chain model fails in obtaining the correct normal stress in a sheared network : due to its core assumption that eight chains in a cell are identically deformed ( stretched ) upon shear , the elongation ratio of the network along the stretching direction is always larger than 1 , making the normal stress always positive .     at the outer surface of the cylinder ( black curve ) and the normal strain @xmath137 for a flexible network ( red curve ) with @xmath138 , and a more stiff network ( blue curve ) with @xmath139 . ] figure  [ poynting](b ) shows the results for equilibrium @xmath134 , presented as a response to an oscillating imposed shear @xmath140 , for two model materials with different filament stiffness and pre - tension . a flexible network ( @xmath138 ) has a positive poynting effect , or positive normal stress is required to counter the expansion along the height ( in other setting , this is called the weissenberg effect ) . in a flexible network ( @xmath141 ) , when the mesh size is much smaller than the contour length of the subchains connecting the neighboring crosslinks , _ i.e. _ , @xmath142 , the entropic energy plays a main role . though chains are stretched along the principal extension direction in the shear geometry illustrated in fig . [ poynting](a ) , the chains in other two principle directions are more likely being compressed , leading to the material contraction along the radial and circumferential directions . however , if the mesh size is comparable with the contour length of the subchains , @xmath143 , the material can behave in a negative poynting effect manner : the height of the cylindrical sample contracts , or negative normal stress is required to counter that and maintain the fixed height . this is because the force acting on the chains directed along the principal extension in fig .  [ poynting](a ) is close to a divergence if @xmath144 , and it causes less energy when the material is compressed in the longitudinal direction , rather than stretched . similar reason works also for a network of more stiff filaments ( see red curve for @xmath145 ) . we did not specifically calculate the normal stress here ( this would be a cumbersome process involving the full tensor form of eq . ( [ strain ] ) , first fixing the pressure @xmath71 from the condition of zero radial stress on the free outer surface ) . however , the magnitude of normal stress can be easily estimated from the linear relationship @xmath146 , which uses the fact that the normal strain is quite small ( i.e. the linear regime is justified ) and the young modulus is @xmath147 . taking the fibrin values in table  [ thenetwork ] as an example , the normal stress is about @xmath148pa under a shear strain of @xmath149 . these are very close to the observations in experiments @xcite . the magnitude of @xmath150 pa for the same shear also accurately matches the actin results obtained in @xcite . figure  [ map ] gives the full ` phase diagram ' of the stiffness - tension parameter space ( @xmath151 ) with phase boundaries separating positive / negative normal stress regions . in order to generate this diagram , for each parameter set ( @xmath152 ) we have calculated the value of @xmath153 by minimizing @xmath154 , under the given shear . in this way the boundary separating the positive ( @xmath155 , @xmath156 ) and the negative ( @xmath157 , @xmath158 ) normal stress regions in fig .  [ map ] is calculated . there is also a weak dependence of this boundary on the magnitude of the applied shear strain , which is due to the inherent non - linearity of stress - strain response ; however , we are not showing this in the figure to avoid clutter . figure  [ map ] shows that a loose flexible network usually has a positive poynting effect , while a network of more stiff filaments has a negative poynting effect , especially when the filaments are crosslinked with increasing pre - tension .    , and filament pre - tension , @xmath37 , showing the boundaries of positive / negative poynting effect and the boundary of network stability ( the dashed line of the neutral filament , @xmath26 , was defined in fig . [ fig_1 ] ) . three ` softer ' filament networks from table [ thenetwork ] are shown in this map : @xmath159 - vimentin , @xmath160 - fibrin , and @xmath161 - neurofilament networks . three actin networks from fig . [ actin32 ] also fit on this map : @xmath162 - @xcite , @xmath163 - @xcite , and @xmath164 - @xcite . ]", "one can see from figs .  [ constitutiverelation](b ) and [ actin32](b ) that the linear regime when @xmath94 persists for a different range of strain in different filaments ; the onset of hyperelastic regime is determined by how much pre - tension is in the filaments , i.e. how @xmath37 compares with @xmath165 from eq . ( [ achain ] ) . the linear shear modulus @xmath80 can be easily obtained from our theory : in 3-chain model it is given by the first term in eq . ( [ ktaylor ] ) . the marginal rigidity condition @xmath166 determines the strand pre - tension that is required for achieving a stable network . the stability criterion here is : @xmath167 note that the expression in the right hand side is always greater than @xmath168 as defined in section 2 . flexible chains with @xmath169 are therefore always stable in the rubbery network , that is , @xmath170 always . on the other hand , stiff filaments have to be crosslinked with @xmath171 exceeding the pre - tension threshold given by eq . ( [ stabil ] ) , which turns out to be slightly lower than @xmath165 defined in fig .  [ fig_1](b ) . in other words , there have to be tensile forces acting on the crosslinked filaments in the network in order for it to be mechanically stable with a non - zero shear modulus . this notion is familiar from the `` tensegrity '' concept in biology and engineering  @xcite . for stiff athermal filament network , the window of pre - tension between the linear modulus @xmath172 at @xmath173 , and @xmath174 at @xmath110 ( we assume inextensible chains ) is very narrow . the stability boundary of the network is plotted in fig . the condition for @xmath172 gives the equilibrium case labelled as @xmath175 in the phase diagram . however , the full analysis shows that the magnitude of the shear strain modifies the stability condition , as represented by the coloured curves for @xmath176 and @xmath177 . this shift means that the region of mechanical stability of filament network expands on increasing deformation , which matches exactly what the recent paper by sharma _ states  @xcite . to summarize , in this work we develop a continuum elastic theory of a network of semiflexible filaments , by implementing the general free energy of one semiflexible chain into that of a disordered network . on reflection , we choose the 3-chain model as most closely matching the realistic system  and achieve various quite stringent fits a number of different experimental data sets over the full range of nonlinear stress - strain range . we demonstrate that the general theory produces the conditions for positive / negative poynting effect ( normal stress ) in a network under imposed shear . the greatest weakness of this model is omitting the effects of local strain non - affinity , which might play an important role when crosslink density of the network is small and filaments stiff . the effect of tensegrity , or linking of filament pre - tension to the network stability and the magnitude of the shear modulus @xmath178 is an unexpected result of this theory . the stringent match of experimental data is reassuring , and we believe that the presented analytical continuum model can provide as an efficient and portable tool for studying the mechanical properties of semiflexible networks . + * acknowledgments : *   this work has been funded by the tcm critical mass grant from epsrc ( ep / j017639 ) . we are grateful for informative discussions with masao doi and zhongcan ouyang , and thank cornelius storm for providing their raw experimental data @xcite . b.  wickstead and k.  gull , _ j. cell . biol . _ , 2011 , * 194 * , 513525 g.  faury , _ pathol . _ , 2001 , * 49 * , 310325 s.  zbek , p. g. balasubramanian , r.  chiquet -

the intracluster medium ( icm ) . the icms are shocked and stirred throughout their formation @xcite . the resulting icm flow structures provide vital information about the large scale dynamics of cluster formation , as well as about the physics of the icm plasma@xcite . cluster - scale shocks , in particular , are tell - tale consequences of merger events @xcite . tracing and deciphering these icm flow structures are essential to our understanding of cluster formation . while thermal x - rays have successfully revealed some icm shocks and other flow features @xcite , distinct x - ray signatures are often subtle and hard to isolate and measure cleanly . observations of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect add some statistical information about the icm pressure and velocity distributions@xcite . but , a full , clear picture requires additional , complementary tools . thankfully , non - thermal synchrotron emissions from @xmath2 gev electrons ( cre ) in the icm and in embedded objects may help reach this goal . so far , the principal non - x - ray tool in efforts to characterize icm dynamics has been cluster - scale , diffuse radio emissions ( radio `` halos '' , `` mini - halos '' and `` relics '' ) by electrons within the icm that are energized or re - energized by cluster shocks and/or turbulence @xcite . there are multiple plausible origins for those diffuse cre , which in various models may be recent or ancient @xcite . their links to local , current icm dynamics result from the fact that they have rather short lifetimes against synchrotron losses and inverse compton scattering of cmb photons ( @xmath3 100 myr ) . observed cre must be `` energetically younger '' than this . since icm flow velocities are characteristically @xmath4 kpc / myr , such embedded cre must have been energized relatively close by on cluster scales . although these emissions place essential constraints on icm physics , their translation into distinct and firm icm dynamical properties has so far proven to be quite challenging @xcite .    at the same time , radio - bright , bipolar plasma outflows from active galactic nuclei ( radio agn , henceforth , simply agn ) are common in clusters @xcite . interactions between those outflows and icm dynamical structures on scales of 10s to 100s of kpc offer an additional and potentially very useful diagnostic probe of the icm dynamics and physics . that is quite separate from the increasing evidence that agn - icm feedback loops on those scales in the cores of relatively undisturbed clusters are central to the properties of those icms @xcite . the focus of our discussion here , instead , is the consequences of agn outflow encounters with cluster scale icm flow structures ( especially shocks ) , and , in particular , impact on the consequent dynamical form of the agn structures that develop as the agn plasma penetrates and generate cavities in the icm .    specifically , we explore major distortions to the agn flows and the potential for using such distortions to identify and characterize icm flow structures , including shocks . in subsequent publications we will present analyses of high resolution 3d mhd simulations of agn outflows in related dynamical icm situations . there we will examine details such as coherence and disruption of the agn flows , development of turbulence , magnetic field evolution , as well as relativistic electron propagation , acceleration and emissions . our purpose now is more restricted ; namely it is to outline a simple , but coherent formalism that we have found to be useful in predicting behaviors of the above simulation experiments and that hopefully captures essential physics needed to interpret observed agn interactions with dynamical icms . we note , in the context of the hedla workshop that inspired this work , that many of the dynamical components laid out below should be testable in laboratory experiments .    the best known and most widely discussed agn distortion produced by asymmetric icm interactions are those that have formed tails as a result of relative motions between the agn host galaxy and the surrounding icm . so - called `` narrow angle tailed '' ( nat ) agns , in which the originally collimated agn outflows appear deflected into a pair of quasi - parallel trails in the wake of the galaxy are especially common in disturbed clusters , where relatively high velocity icm motions are likely @xcite . if there are apparent , but less dramatic deflections , the agns are typically called `` wide angle tailed '' ( wat ) agns @xcite . both are obvious candidates as probes of icm dynamics @xcite . the idea that icm shocks encountering plasma bubbles or cavities left behind by expired agn might rejuvenate their cre populations has also been widely discussed @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , however , expected behaviors of active agn outflows colliding with icm shocks has not been previously outlined , although there have been several recent suggestions that observed nat agn may , in fact , be associated with cluster radio relics @xcite . here we do not address that issue directly , but do outline the essentials of dynamical encounters of that kind , in order to facilitate future discussions . basics of the formalism we outline have been in the literature for some time . our objective is to set them down as a package , extending them as needed for application to the issues at hand , while looking for parameterizations that may be useful for diagnostic purposes . we specifically target agn outflow / shock encounters , although the necessary formalism has broader applications . we also include along the way some preliminary results from simulations in order to illustrate the kinds of behaviors that result . we ignore here a number of complications that will ultimately be important to detailed models , but that do not seem essential to a `` first order '' picture . although our goal in this paper is to set out a simple set of analytic relationships , we do show illustrations of behaviors from high resolution numerical simulations that will be discussed in detail in subsequent publications . those simulations were carried out using the wombat mhd code employing a second order mhdtvd riemann solver @xcite . an adiabatic equation of state with @xmath5 was employed . steady bi - polar jets were formed within a small cylindrical volume , where the jet pressure , @xmath6 , was kept approximately equal to the ambient pressure , and the jet plasma was accelerated to a velocity , @xmath7 . all the simulations shown in this paper kept the density within the jet - source cylinder , @xmath8 , at 1% of the undisturbed ambient density . we have , however , varied these parameters to confirm relations described below . we also allowed jet power to cycle off in some cases . the simulated jets were weakly magnetized with a toroidal geometry and nominal @xmath9 within the jet - source cylinder . magnetic stresses are too small to influence dynamics at the levels relevant to this paper . the simulations did include cre ; in follow - up discussions we will discuss in detail synchrotron emission properties . that is beyond the scope of the present paper , however . the paper outline is this . section [ sec : shock - cavity ] reviews the interactions between a plane shock and a low density cavity . in section [ sec : jet - wind ] we outline in simple terms the propagation of a jet into a head or tail wind ( section [ subsec : term ] ) and into a cross wind ( section [ subsec : cross ] ) that would , for instance , represent post - shock ambient conditions . for completeness section [ sec : cocoon ] sets out a simple model to estimate the form of the plasma cocoon inflated by jets nominally prior to the above interactions .", "typically the initial encounter between an icm shock and an agn will involve the shock penetrating the agn cocoon / cavity inflated by the agn outflow . the basic dynamics of such an encounter are qualitatively simple : the core of the cavity is crushed relatively quickly , while the perimeters of the cavity roll into a vortex ring structure @xcite . here we simply outline of the physics . consider then a planar icm shock of mach number , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the speed of the shock in the icm and @xmath12 is the icm sound speed . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the pre - shock icm pressure and mass density , while @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the icm adiabatic index . typical icm shocks will have modest mach numbers , @xmath17 , @xcite but to allow a wider application of this discussion we do not restrict @xmath18 . we then assume the shock encounters a low density cavity , which we take initially to be in pressure equilibrium with the icm ( @xmath19 ) . let the undisturbed density inside the cavity be @xmath20 , with @xmath21 . the initial cavity sound speed is , @xmath22 , where , acknowledging that the cavity includes relativistic plasma , we allow the cavity potentially to have an adiabatic index , @xmath23 , distinct from the icm . as the shock encounters the cavity , it penetrates at a speed @xmath24 pulling icm gas with it . pressure balance between the original cavity and un - shocked icm leads to the condition , @xmath25 . the original icm - cavity contact discontinuity ( cd ) follows the shock at a speed , @xmath26 , intermediate between the icm shock and the cavity shock . at the same time a rarefaction propagates back into the post - shock icm at the post - shock icm sound speed . pfrommer and jones @xcite presented the full , nonlinear , 1d riemann solution to this problem . here we need only a few , approximate behaviors in order to understand what happens during the encounter . generally , even though the shock speed is greater inside the cavity , the shock strength is less than the incident shock ; that is , @xmath27 . there is no general , analytic formula for @xmath28 , although it can be found numerically from the riemann solution . in the strong shock limit , when @xmath29 , pfrommer and jones found @xmath30 ; that is @xmath31 . in the weak shock limit ( as @xmath32 ) , of course , @xmath33 . in either regime the internal shock speed considerably exceeds the incident , icm shock speed whenever @xmath21 . consequently , the shock passes through the cavity much more quickly than it propagates around it . the velocity of the cd within the cavity , @xmath34 , obtained in the riemann solution is , @xmath35 this measures the cavity collapse rate . it will generally be less than @xmath36 . however , pfrommer and jones found , so long as @xmath37 and @xmath21 , that @xmath38 . under those circumstances , the cavity is crushed ( the initial cd pushes all the way through the cavity ) _ before _ the icm shock propagates around it . we note that if the cavity has previously developed a thick boundary layer within which @xmath39 is not very small ( e.g. , through turbulent mixing ; see section [ sec : cocoon ] ) , the internal shock speed within this layer will be slower than above , but @xmath28 can remain comparable to @xmath18 through that boundary layer . this can , for instance , significantly influence such things as particle acceleration during shock passage and shock amplification of turbulence . if the initial cavity is `` round '' ( e.g. , a sphere ) , the shock intrusion into the cavity begins sooner and is usually stronger at the normal , `` point of first contact . '' on the other hand , the oblique penetration towards the extremes of the cavity boundary also generates vorticity . an initially spherical cavity will , thus , evolve into a torus , or vortex ring that mixes icm and cavity plasma @xcite . analogously , even if the cavity boundary is planar , but the shock normal is oblique to the cavity boundary , refraction of the shock and penetrating cd will produce vorticity and mixing @xcite . examples of shocks impacting icm cavities have been presented previously @xcite . outcomes are also evident in figures [ fig : aljet ] and [ fig : orjet ] .", "if an agn jet remains active following shock impact , so that it drives into the post - shock icm , its propagation will be modified because the post - shock icm is denser than the pre - shock icm and also because the post - shock icm plasma is put in motion by the shock . in this section we outline a toy model to address these effects . the basic geometry is illustrated in figure [ fig : cartoon ] . cartoon illustrating the basic geometry of bipolar agn jets propagating into an ambient wind.,scaledwidth=48.0%,scaledwidth=41.0% ]    we approximate the dynamics as that of a jet within an ambient wind , decomposing the wind velocity into components parallel ( head wind or tail wind ) and orthogonal ( cross wind ) to the jet velocity vector , @xmath40 , near its terminus . that is , we set @xmath41 where @xmath42 . when @xmath43 ; that is , whenever there is a tail wind , @xmath44 , or a head wind , @xmath45 , the rate of advance of the jet terminus will be modified ; when @xmath46 the jet propagation will be deflected laterally . although we present the model in the context of a post - shock flow , the formalism applies to any relative motion between the agn and its ambient medium . indeed the model is essentially a merger and modest extension of classical cartoons of agn jet propagation @xcite . simply stated , jet advance and deflection are influenced by parallel and transverse ram pressures created by the wind . we begin by considering the influence of an ambient wind motion aligned with the jet velocity ; that is , consequences of @xmath43 . to keep the discussion simple we consider here only steady , collimated jets ( zero opening angle ) and homogeneous ambient media . we adopt the standard picture that the advance of the jet terminus into the icm can be expressed in terms of the propagation of a contact discontinuity that forms at the head of the jet @xcite . _ relative to the agn _ , that boundary ( the jet `` head '' ) propagates at velocity , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 represents the length of the jet from the agn . there will be a bow shock propagating into the wind , ahead of the head , as well as a reverse , `` terminal '' shock in the jet . the simple , 1d cartoon model ignores these details , drawing a box around all this and assumes the jet thrust ; that is , the total jet momentum flux coming in through an area , @xmath49 , is balanced by the total wind momentum flux coming in on the opposite side of the box , again , through an area , @xmath50 . in reality , because both jet and wind plasma will , as `` back flow '' , exit the face of the box through which the jet enters ( and box sides ) , the effective sizes of the box faces need to be larger than @xmath50 . we can crudely account for this asymmetry by setting the effective area allocated to the wind , @xmath51 , to be larger than the nominal cross section of the jet . we comment , as well , that even for a collimated jet the radius , @xmath52 , will not generally be a constant along the length of the jet , especially when it becomes over or under pressured with respect to its surroundings . in that case , for instance , the propagating jet plasma will execute a sequence of expansions and rarefactions around an equilibrium radius . consequently , the jet velocity , @xmath7 , density , @xmath8 , and pressure , @xmath6 , will all vary along a real jet . our analysis here does not try to account for dynamics at that level of detail , so we will assume below that the jet has some suitably chosen characteristic radius , @xmath52 , density , @xmath8 and pressure , @xmath6 . we allow both the jet velocity and equation of state ( eos ) to be either non - relativistic or relativistic , although we will assume the propagation of the wind and the head through the wind in the agn reference frame are non - relativistic . then , the jet 4-velocity is @xmath53 , with @xmath54 the lorentz factor of the jet velocity , @xmath7 , while the enthalpy density of the jet plasma in the jet plasma frame is @xmath55 , with @xmath56 the internal energy density of the jet plasma , including rest mass energy , @xmath57 . the jet momentum flux density in the agn frame can be written @xcite @xmath58 the jet thrust is @xmath59 for a non - relativistic eos , where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , while for a relativistic eos , where @xmath62 , @xmath63 . it will be useful later on also to have expressions for the jet energy flux density in the agn frame . subtracting off the rest mass energy this is @xmath64,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the `` luminosity '' of the jet is @xmath65 we define the _ internal _ jet mach number as , @xmath66,@xcite where @xmath67 is the jet sound speed , with @xmath68 . for a relativistic eos @xmath69 , while @xmath70 , so @xmath71 . note in this limit that the jet mach number , @xmath72 , which , if @xmath73 gives @xmath74 . this makes clear that the fact that a jet velocity is close to the speed of light does not , by itself , imply a high mach number for the jet dynamics . a non - relativistic eos with @xmath75 recovers the familiar @xmath76 .    with these definitions the momentum flux density is @xmath77.\\ ] ] setting @xmath78 , this becomes simply @xmath79 . \\label{eq : momflux}\\ ] ] for a relativistic eos @xmath80 , whereas for a non - relativistic eos , @xmath81 , the usual gas adiabatic index . written in this form the expression for the jet momentum flux is virtually the same for relativistic or non - relativistic jets . if , as is often the case , @xmath82 we can neglect the second term in square brackets . then , the jet thrust for either relativistic or non - relativistic flow is @xmath83 in either regime the thrust depends simply on the internal jet pressure and the internal jet mach number .    the jet luminosity is not quite so tidy , but still simple to express . for a non - relativistic eos the luminosity would be @xmath84 a_j,\\ ] ] which , with @xmath85 , but @xmath86 and @xmath87 takes the simple familiar form , @xmath88 at the other extreme , with a relativistic eos , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , the luminosity is also simple to express ; namely , @xmath91 since , now @xmath92 . again , in this form the relativistic and non - relativistic expressions are almost the same . the jet luminosity can , like the thrust , be described in terms of the jet pressure and mach number , but now also in terms of a jet speed , @xmath7 , ( which may @xmath93 ) . we return now to estimating the rate at which the jet terminus propagates through its surrounding plasma . the momentum flux balance condition determining the propagation velocity , @xmath94 , is actually measured in the frame of the head , so we should transform the momentum flux relations to that frame . however , provided @xmath95 , it is easy to show that the fractional change in @xmath96 is small . we will neglect that correction below . the momentum balance condition becomes , @xmath97.\\ ] ] using equation [ eq : momflux - ap ] this leads to @xmath98 \\approx    \\mathcal{m}_j^2 \\frac{\\gamma'}{\\gamma_w}\\frac{a_j p_j}{a_h p_w }   \\label{eq : headv - vel}\\ ] ] or , @xmath99 \\approx    \\mathcal{m}_j^2 \\frac{\\gamma'}{\\gamma_w}\\frac{a_j}{a_h}\\frac{p_j}{p_w }   \\label{eq : headv - mach}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the mach numbers of the jet head advance and the head / tail wind with respect to the agn . then , of course , @xmath102 is the wind sound speed . in equations [ eq : headv - vel ] and [ eq : headv - mach ] the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to a tail ( head ) wind . if @xmath103 we have the simple result @xmath104 that is , the mach number of the advance of the head relative to its ambient medium is similar to the internal mach number of the jet modified by a factor that depends mostly on the ratio of the integrated jet pressure , @xmath105 , to the integrated wind pressure ( isotropic pressure , not ram pressure ) `` across the head '' , @xmath106 . in our simulation experiments with steady , fixed axis , non - relativistic jets @xmath107 provides reasonable matches between simulated jet propagation and equations [ eq : headv - vel ] , [ eq : headv - mach ] and [ eq : headv - app ] . some insights into appropriate @xmath108 are useful going forward . our discussions relate to jets that are pressure confined as they propagate . so , we expect @xmath109 , where @xmath110 represents the pressure of whatever medium is immediately surrounding the jet . if a jet enters a region where it is out of pressure balance , it will generally expand or converge to compensate . as noted above , the pressures within simulated jets are actually quite non - uniform as a result . on average , however , we find , independent of the pressure assignd to a simulated jet at its origin , the average pressure along the propagating jet becomes roughly comparable to the ambient pressure . we also find in simulations and argue in section [ sec : cocoon ] that the pressure inside jet cocoons are commonly roughly similar to those in the undisturbed surroundings , even though the cocoon formation drives a shock into its surroundings . consequently , we expect within a factor of a few that @xmath111 . nonetheless , we leave such ratios as undetermined in our analyses , in order to reveal their roles . we note also for non - relativistic jets with non - relativistic eos that , since for both the jet and the ambient medium , @xmath76 , equation [ eq : headv - app ] can be written @xmath112 independent of @xmath108 . this recovers the commonly applied assumption that , modulo `` an efficiency factor '' ( @xmath113 ) the advance speed of the jet head is roughly the jet speed reduced by a factor of the square root of the density ratio between the ambient medium and the jet when the jet and its advance are both highly supersonic @xcite . it is further evident from these relations , as we would expect intuitively , that the advance speed of the jet with respect to the agn , @xmath114 , is greater when it propagates downstream with a wind ( a `` tail wind '' ) than if it propagates upstream into a wind ( a `` head wind '' ) . in fact a jet propagating into a sufficiently strong head wind can be stopped , or even reversed . using equation [ eq : headv - app ] the approximate condition for the head wind to stop forward progress of the head is @xmath115 we have verified this condition in our simulations ( see figure [ fig : aljet ] ) . although the above results would be applicable for any agn relative motion through its ambient medium when the agn jets are aligned with the relative motion , we introduced the issue in the context of post - shock icm flows . in that case it is useful to express these relations in terms of wind properties resulting from icm shocks . to keep it simple , we assume that the pre - shock icm plasma was at rest with respect to the agn , although that is easily modified . again expressing the icm shock mach number as @xmath18 we have ( assuming @xmath116 ) , @xmath117 where , as above , the subscript index ` i ' identifies the unshocked icm , and ` w ' indicates post - shock icm ( the `` wind '' ) .    applying equations [ eq : jump - d ] - [ eq : jump - a ] to equation [ eq : headstop ] we obtain an approximate relation for the strength , @xmath118 , of an icm shock that can stop the advance of an approaching jet of internal mach number , @xmath119 in a `` head on collision '' when the agn is at rest in the undisturbed icm ; namely @xmath120 where @xmath121 . as noted above , we expect for steady jets with fixed axes , @xmath122 . the function @xmath123 , for @xmath124 , corresponding to expected `` merger - related '' icm shock strengths . as a rough rule of thumb , then , an agn jet running head on into a shock will be stopped or reversed if the mach number of the shock is comparable to or even a bit less than the mach number of the jet . the above behaviors are illustrated in figure [ fig : aljet ] for two , simulated non - relativistic shock - jet interactions with different relative shock strengths . the views are 3d volume renderings of jet mass fraction ; that is , only plasma that originated from the agn is shown . in both cases , @xmath125 , and the shock normal was aligned with the ( bi - polar ) jet axis . icm shock propagation was left - to - right , although in this view the shock plane was rotated 40 degrees from the line of sight , in order to reveal the structures more clearly . the location of the agn is marked by an x in each case . the color map of the mass fraction tracer runs from `` white '' ( 100% ) through yellow , red , green and blue ( @xmath126 30% ) . the figure upper panel represents the outcome for an icm shock with @xmath127 , whereas the lower panel involves a @xmath128 shock . both are shown at approximately the same time interval since initial contact between the shock and the left - facing ( upwind ) jet . in the bottom panel the stronger shock has left the computational domain to the right after reversing the left - facing jet and crushing the two original jet plasma cocoons and stripping them from the jets . the `` smoke ring '' to the right is the resulting vortex ring structure , whose formation out of the pre - shock cavities was outlined in the previous section . the flaring seen at the right end of the remaining ( downwind ) jet represents the head of that jet . the shocked jet plasma is unable to propagate back to the agn through the strong right - facing wind behind this shock . it is not able to refill a cocoon ( see section [ sec : cocoon ] ) . the jet remains `` naked '' . several agns in disturbed clusters have been seen that are candidates for this interaction . probably the best known example is the radio source ` c ' in a2256 , @xcite which has a roughly 1 mpc , very thin ( unresolved ) `` tail '' extending to the west of an agn , but nothing evident to the east . indeed , that agn is seen projected near a strong  radio relic  in the cluster , suggesting that it could have passed through a moderately strong cluster merger shock . the weaker and slower icm shock involved in the upper figure [ fig : aljet ] panel dynamics is still in the volume illustrated , although not directly visible in this rendering . in the undisturbed icm its position along the jet axis is about 2/3 of the distance from the agn x to the right end of the right - facing jet head . inside the right - side cocoon , the shock has just reached the head at this time . we found experimentally in this case that an incident shock with @xmath129 would just stop the approaching ( left facing in the figure ) jet . illustration from simulations of icm shocks colliding head on with @xmath125 agn jet pairs . both panels are volume renderings of a passive jet mass - fraction tracer . shock propagation was left to right . x marks agn location . the jet axes are rotated 40 degrees out of the plane of the sky with the left jets approaching the observer . * top * : @xmath130 . * bottom * : @xmath131 . see text for details.,scaledwidth=48.0%,scaledwidth=41.0% ]    thus , evidence for relative agn foreshortening to one side has the potential to find and even measure the strengths of icm shocks or winds .      in the presence of a cross wind , @xmath46 ( see figure [ fig : cartoon ] ) , the jet is subjected to an unbalanced transverse ram pressure force , @xmath132 . particularly , if that cross wind results from a crossing shock , the jet cocoon ( cavity ) will be crushed and stripped away from the propagating jet ( see figure [ fig : orjet ] ) . from that point on the jet interacts directly with the wind , and we can estimate the induced transverse pressure gradient within the jet as @xmath133 then the transverse acceleration of a steady jet is determined by the relation @xmath134 we can use @xmath135 as a way to estimate the length @xmath136 over which the transverse ram pressure from the wind will deflect the jet by 90 degrees ; that is , the `` jet bending length '' . neglecting the ( initially small ) second term inside the parentheses in equation [ eq : ftrans ] this gives , @xmath137 where the final expression has used equation [ eq : momflux - ap ] . analogous to the results of the previous subsection we can also write this final form in terms of the jet mach number , @xmath119 and the cross - wind mach number , @xmath138 , @xmath139 if the jet and wind pressures are comparable , the ratio of the jet bending length , @xmath136 , to the jet diameter , @xmath140 , is roughly @xmath141 . a little bit of algebra shows that equation [ eq : ellbend ] matches the bending radius of curvature derived in @xcite for an agn moving supersonically through an ambient medium at right angles to the jet axis . of course , only relative motion matters , and here we emphasize that it is not necessary that the cross wind is supersonic for the bending to develop . the bending radius will , however , scale inversely with the square of the mach number of relative motion . so , once again , obvious distortion in the agn points to relatively large mach number of the relative motion between the agn and its immediate surroundings . assuming the cross wind under discussion comes entirely from an icm shock propagating transverse to the jet axis , we can use equations [ eq : jump - d ] - [ eq : jump - a ] to give a relation between the jet bending length , the jet radius , the jet mach number and the icm shock mach number , @xmath18 , @xmath142 by convention , when the jet length , @xmath48 satisfies @xmath143 , but @xmath144 the resulting agn morphology would be describe as a `` wide angle tail '' radio galaxy , or a  wat \" . as the ratio @xmath145 becomes smaller , the morphological label would shift to `` narrow angle tail '' or `` nat '' .    figure [ fig : orjet ] illustrates results from a simulation of a @xmath131 shock that crossed from the left and collided at right angles with a pair of @xmath146 jets oriented vertically in the image . equation [ eq : lbend - mi ] predicts @xmath147 , which is actually very close to the empirical result of the simulation . as in figure [ fig : aljet ] this image shows a volume rendering of the passive jet mass fraction tracer . the shock plane has again been rotated 40 degrees from the line of sight to make 3d structures more distinct . we comment on the close resemblance between the structures visible in figure [ fig : orjet ] and the `` classic '' nat source , ngc1265 @xcite , whose morphology has long been modeled in terms of a strong cross wind in the rest frame of the host galaxy . here the wind is a feature of the post - shock environment . that has also been suggested for ngc1265 @xcite . simulation of an @xmath131 shock that crossed from the left and collided at right angles with an @xmath146 agn jet pair ( vertical jet axis in the image ) . shown is a volume rendering of a passive jet mass - fraction tracer after the shock has passed through the volume shown . x marks agn location . view orientation is the same as figure [ fig : aljet ] . see text for details.,scaledwidth=48.0%,scaledwidth=41.0% ]    note that the two jets in figure [ fig : orjet ] remain stable long after they are deflected by @xmath148 degrees into `` tails '' , even though turbulent mixing regions develop around them and enlarge downstream . the tails merge at the far right into a pair of merging vortex rings that formed along the lines outlined in section [ sec : shock - cavity ] as the icm shock crushed the two jet cocoons produced before shock impact . the jets can be traced as coherent structures almost to the vortex rings . the shock itself has left the observed volume to the right at the time shown .    finally , we comment on the more complex case where an incident shock collides at an arbitrary angle with respect to the agn jet axis , or more generally when the agn jets encounter an oblique wind . since @xmath149 is initially the same for both jets , the rate of jet deflection indicated by equation [ eq : ftrans ] would , before deformation , be the same for both jets ( see figure [ fig : cartoon ] ) . the aligned wind velocity , @xmath150 , has the same magnitude , but opposite sign on the two jets . the downwind jet , where @xmath151 , thus advances more rapidly . as the jets begin to be deflected , however , the upwind jet , where @xmath45 , is deflected to be more nearly transverse to the wind ( @xmath149 increases along the jet on that side ) , while the downwind jet is deflected to be more nearly aligned with the wind ( @xmath150 increases along this jet ) . consequently , the upwind jet becomes more sharply bent than the downwind jet . we have confirmed in simulations a regular transitioun along these lines between the aligned wind interactions described in section [ subsec : term ] . and cross wind interactions outlined at the beginning of this section . evidently , such asymmetries can provide information about both the relative mach numbers of the jets and a wind and the relative orientations of the wind and the jets . the shape evolution of the two jets depends distinctively on the ratio of two mach numbers as well as the orientation between the agn jet axis and the wind velocity vector , @xmath152 . thus , the resulting shape provides a means to determine both @xmath153 and @xmath154 . also , it is obvious that if the `` weather conditions '' encountered by jets vary as they extend through the icm , additional morphological features are likely to develop that can be used to identify and characterize these icm structures .", "we began this discussion with an outline of shock propagation through a pre - existing cavity formed by agn outflows ; that is a jet cocoon . then we outlined propagation of the jets themselves in the post - shock flow . the shocks both crush the cocoon and may , if the wind `` stripping '' is faster than replacement from the jet terminus , remove the cocoon ( see figures [ fig : aljet ] and [ fig : orjet ] ) . we did not , however , address what might be learned from the cocoons themselves , in order to tie the pieces together , here we outline briefly some of the related physics connecting the jet propagation to the formation of the jet cocoon before shock impact . since our purpose is only to lay out a rough picture of cocoon inflation , we ignore in this section complications such as relative motions between the agn and its ambient icm , the presence of large scale pressure or density gradients , or icm turbulence . all of these will modify cocoon morphology and quantitative measures , although they should not fundamentally change the basic picture presented here .    in simple terms the cocoon represents the reservoir of plasma that has previously passed through the jet . the cocoon plasma will generally be of substantially lower density than the surrounding icm , with the two media nominally separated by a contact discontinuity . because it is also a `` slip surface '' , that boundary is likely to be unstable to kelvin - helmholtz instabilities ( khi ) , so that some degree of mixing will take place ( unless , for instance , magnetic fields in or around the cocoon are strong enough and coherent enough to stabilize the contact discontinuity @xcite ) . figure [ fig : noshock - color ] shows volume renderings of cocoons formed from two simulated steady agn jet pairs . in each case the agn ( marked by an ` x ' ) expelled identical , but oppositely directed jets . the rendered quantity is the same passive mass fraction tracer shown in figures [ fig : aljet ] and [ fig : orjet ] . in this case the jet axis is viewed in the plane of the sky . the upper image corresponds to a @xmath125 jet pair , while the lower image represents the cocoons of a @xmath146 jet pair . the structures are viewed when @xmath155 . the jets , themselves , are faintly recognizable inside the cocoons and along the cocoon axes . the cocoon boundaries are clearly influenced by khi ; some mixing has occurred . indeed the small differences between the left and right cocoons come from detailed differences in the khi on the two sides that are seeded by the mismatch between a mathematically circular jet and a cartesian numerical grid . khi details depend on the exact placement of the agn on the numerical grid . the jet mass fraction dominating the images @xmath156 . despite such complications , there is a relatively clear cocoon boundary , so we assume below that the jet cocoon and the surrounding icm are cleanly separated .     jet `` backflow '' cocoons formed by @xmath125 ( * top * ) and @xmath146 ( * bottom * ) steady jets . a passive , jet mass - fraction tracer is volumed rendered in the images . the jets are `` in the plane of the sky '' and shown when they have approximately the same lengths , @xmath48 . the location of the agn is marked by an ` x ' . see text for details.,scaledwidth=48.0%,scaledwidth=41.0% ]    the energy deposition from the jet into the cocoon will generally drive a shock laterally outward into the icm . we will call this the `` inflation shock '' . provided the jet terminus propagates supersonically into the icm ( @xmath157 , equation [ eq : headv - mach ] ) there will be a bow shock attached to the jet head , which will generally merge with the inflation shock . in figure [ fig : noshock - color ] the tips of the two cocoons are confined by bow shocks . the tighter `` mach cone '' of the higher mach number jet leads to `` sharper points '' in the cocoons . although the bow shock may be quite strong , both observations and simulations suggest that the inflation shock is typically rather weak . for example the @xmath146 jets shown in the bottom of figure [ fig : noshock - color ] and in figure [ fig : noshock - mach ] produce bow shocks with @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) on the nose of the jet in agreement with expectations from equation [ eq : headv - app ] . on the other hand , over much of their surfaces the accompanying both inflation shocks have mach numbers , @xmath160 for the duration of the simulation ( see figure [ fig : noshock - mach ] ) . there is no fixed value , however . the relatively small mach numbers of most of the inflation shock surfaces also point to the fact that the pressure inside the shocks and inside the cocoons is not much greater than the ambient pressure , @xmath13 ( see equation [ eq : jump - p ] ) . because these properties do not inherently lead to scale - free structures , we do not try to model cocoon formation in terms of self - similar behavior @xcite . volume rendering of the shocks associated with the @xmath146 simulation shown in the bottom image of figure [ fig : noshock - color ] . the * top * image matches the orientation of the bottom image in figure [ fig : noshock - color ] , while the * bottom * image has the jet axis rotated 40 degrees , with the left jet approaching ( so similar to figures [ fig : aljet ] and [ fig : orjet ] . shocks are color coded , with the strongest shocks , @xmath161 shown in white , with @xmath162 represented by purple . x marks agn location . see text for details.,scaledwidth=48.0%,scaledwidth=41.0% ]    still , it makes sense to estimate the volume of the cocoon simply by comparing the work required to inflate the cocoon to the energy that has passed down the jet into the cocoon . very simply , we set @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is a numerical factor that accounts for energy lost by the cocoon plasma as it inflated . accounting for adiabatic work done on the icm would lead to @xmath165 . for a non - relativistic jet with @xmath87 , this would give @xmath166 , while for a jet with a relativistic eos and @xmath167 , the equivalent consequences would give @xmath168 . empirical estimates from non - relativistic simulations do , indeed , suggest @xmath169.@xcite the exact value for @xmath170 is not essential to our purposes here .    as a primitive model for cocoon geometry we assume the cocoon length is set by @xmath171 , giving @xmath172 where @xmath173 represents a characteristic cocoon cross sectional area . we do not imply in this that the cocoon cross section is constant , and , indeed , it generally will not be ( see figure [ fig : noshock - color ] ) . in practice we treat it as a geometric average cross section . to simplify our treatment further , we express the jet luminosity in the form applicable to both relativistic and non - relativistic jets suggested by equations [ eq : ljet - nonrel ] and [ eq : ljet - rel ] ; that is , @xmath174 where @xmath175 . for a relativistic jet @xmath73 in this expression . from equation [ eq : headv - app ] we write @xmath176 combining equations [ eq : cvol - simp ] , [ eq : ljet - simp ] and [ eq : headv - simp ] gives a simple estimate for @xmath173 , @xmath177 we expect @xmath178 , and , indeed using equation [ eq : ac - nonrel ] , below , and the simulation parameters for the cocoons shown in figure [ fig : noshock - color ] we get consistent estimates for @xmath173 using @xmath179 . note that , if these various jet parameters are time independent , the effective cocoon cross section , @xmath173 is steady in time . that is , the ratio @xmath180 . we briefly address alternative possibilities below .    for a relativistic jet with a relativistic eos , @xmath181 , while @xmath182 , and equation [ eq : ac - gen ] becomes , @xmath183 while for a non - relativistic jet , @xmath184 the only difference between equations [ eq : ac - rel ] and [ eq : ac - nonrel ] is a relative factor @xmath185 in equation [ eq : ac - rel ] . we can see from these relations that the cocoon cross section scales with the geometric mean of the jet cross section , @xmath50 and the jet head cross section , @xmath51 . it is strongly boosted if the jet mach number is large ( especially for non - relativistic jets ) , and , with less sensitivity , to a large density contrast between the icm and the jet , @xmath186 . that is , cocoons will be somewhat fatter for jets with larger density contrast , @xmath187 , but especially fatter for larger mach numbers . we are assuming in these comments that , as argued previously , we should expect @xmath188 . the mach number sensitivity of @xmath173 is evident in a comparison of the non - relativistic jet cocoons shown in figure [ fig : noshock - color ] , where the only difference in the two simulations was jet mach number ; above , @xmath125 , while below , @xmath146 . the @xmath146 cocoon , in particular , is , as noted above , strongly tapered , representing the fact that the mach cone at its nose has strongly confined it . we associate @xmath173 with the mean cross sectional area , which here would be roughly midway between the agn and the jet terminus . the reader may have noticed at the same time that the cocoons from the jets shown in figure [ fig : noshock - color ] are relatively skinny compared to typical , observed radio galaxy cocoons . that is characteristic of the properties of moderate mach number , non - relativistic agn jet simulations that are steady and maintain a precise axis for the jets . on the other hand , if either the jet power cycles substantially or the axis of the jet wanders or precesses , the relative rate at which the jet advances is reduced @xcite . in order to maintain the same cocoon volume indicated in equation [ eq : cvol - simp ] the cross section must increase . this effect can , be roughly accounted for in equations [ eq : headv - simp ] - [ eq : ac - nonrel ] by adjusting the effective head area , @xmath51 . for instance , a precessing jet will balance its thrust during a precession period over an area , @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is the instantaneous length of the jet . applied into equation [ eq : headv - simp ] the head advance rate , @xmath191 . if we maintain constant jet luminosity , @xmath192 , so @xmath193 . now , @xmath194 const , rather than @xmath180 . simultaneously , the volume swept out by the precessing jet itself will be @xmath195 , where @xmath196 is the opening angle of the precession cone . this sets a scale for the effective @xmath197 . these effects both fatten the cocoons relative to what we derived above .    finally , we mention that equation [ eq : ac - rel ] predicts rather fat cocoons for high mach number relativistic jets propagating in an environment where @xmath198 . that is consistent with results of numerical simulations of relativistic hydrodynamical jets @xcite , and also simulations of jets dominated by their poynting flux ( so , internally highly relativistic ) @xcite .", "the plasma media in galaxy clusters , icms , are dynamical . they are stirred by many processes associated with cluster assembly . the dynamical state of an icm provides unique information about how this takes place , so it is important to find and evaluate icm dynamical conditions , especially those far away from equilibrium . x - ray observations can reveal critical information about icm thermodynamical properties , some statistical characteristics of icm dynamical states and find relatively strong shocks in higher density icm regions . but , much of the story is not visible in the x - ray window . on the other hand , agns in so - called `` radio mode '' are common in clusters , and especially in disturbed clusters . those agns expel fast plasma jets that plow through the icm . those interactions will influence the icm and its evolution . more to the point of this paper , however , is the considerable impact of icm dynamics on the trajectories and of the agn jets and the distributions of their debris . in particular , impacts between icm shocks and winds will distort and even disrupt the agn structures that form . through an understanding of how those distortions develop and how they depend on the agn and icm properties we hope to open a clearer window to revealing the dynamical structures of icms . by relating those structures to other information about the dynamical state of the cluster , and , for instance , evidence for merging , strong accretion events or gravitational disturbance by dark matter halos , these insights can provide vital probes of cluster formation processes and their relative roles . we have laid out in this paper a simple summary of some of the essential dynamical relationships involved in agn / icm interactions , with a special focus on interactions involving icm shocks . the nominal target application is icm shocks colliding with agn outflows . we pointed out , however , that the relations we developed have application to any relative motion between the agn and its immediate environment . the formalism allows agn jets that are either non - relativistic or relativistic . we set down basic relations to evaluate shock interactions with the low density cavities created by agn jets , as well as to follow the propagation of the jets within post - shock flows . for completeness , we used the same formalism to provide a basic context for the formation of the cavities themselves . one notable aspect of the relationships we derive is the essential roles of the internal mach number of the jet flow and the mach number of the icm shock . more directly , the ratio of these two mach numbers seems central to evaluating the interactions between the agn and a dynamical ambient environment . this provides a potentially useful link that can help develop quantitative understandings of icm dynamical states that otherwise are likely to remain obscure for some time . twj and bo were supported in this work at the university of minnesota by nsf grant ast1211595 . cn was supported by an nsf graduate fellowship under grant 000039202 . twj , cn and bo gratefully acknowledge support and hospitality of the minnesota supercomputing insitute . we thank an anonymous referee for constructive comments that improved the manuscript . 2ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ]  + 12$12  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty a. kravtsov & s. borgani , `` formation of galaxy clusters '' , araa * 50 * , 353 -

like structures were sometimes seen : abrupt changes of the color excess over very small distances . @xcite and @xcite are examples showing an onset of reddening at @xmath7100 pc in the general direction of scorpius . @xcite is a more recent example where @xmath8 data has been used to outline lb .    in order to indicate the size of the lb some of the parameters characterising it must be known . the confinement of the bubble is encountered when one or more of these parameters are changed in a significant way . such a parameter could be @xmath9 or the average line of sight reddening / extinction , @xcite , @xcite . for the size abt quotes the range 50 -

kalers color system differs from that given in the hipparcos 1 catalogue the difference is ignored . classification is as given in hipparcos 1 but for the deklination zone covered by the michigan 5 catalogue , @xcite , which was not available for the first publication of the hipparcos catalogue , @xcite , it has been replaced by this more precise one . for stars with a spectral type but no luminosity class we use the @xmath13 @xmath2 @xmath14 = @xmath3 diagram to distinguish between the dwarfs and giants . the parallax @xmath15 is taken from hipparcos 2 , @xcite . our first assumption is that any shift of a stars intrinsic position in the @xmath16 @xmath2 @xmath17 diagram is caused solely by reddening / extinction . we notice that the slope of the main sequence in the color magnitude diagram does not differ that much from the ratio @xmath18 and is nummerically smaller , implying that the rather small reddenings presumed to be present in the hipparcos catalog will not mix the dwarfs and the giants . a dividing curve introduced in the color magnitude diagram can accordingly be used for the luminosity separation . subgiants are assumed to have colors identical to the dwarfs with the same spectral type . the spectral type and the location relative to the dividing curve then provide an estimate of the intrinsic color . since most hipparcos stars have 2mass colors the giant dwarf separation might also result from a diagram as fig . 29 in @xcite .    this way most stars with a positive parallax have estimated reddenings . the sample may , however , be refined from a comparison to the comments given in the simbad data base . most of the hipparcos stars do have comments . we may accordingly sort out variables , stars in multiple systems , pms stars , stars with close companions etc . there is one important group of nearby stars that singles out : the high proper motion stars , many of which concentrates in a small region between the late main sequence and the giants in the @xmath13 @xmath2 @xmath14 diagram . they do accordingly not comply to the dividing curve scheme and we have left them all out - which is unfortunate since they all are very close and would be ideally suited for lb studies if their properties were better known . neither are stars located in clusters included . our extinction sample consists only of stars having the star assignment in simbad . the sample is reduced to some 85000 possible , single non -

[ f3 ] shows the clouds are almost superposed on the boundary of the low density contour . are they then part of the lb confinement ? in fact they may not be because in @xcite it was found that each of these small clouds was located in front of other clouds at 100 , 135 and 125 pc respectively . these later distances agree much more to the canonical lb confinement . recently @xcite , from a very large photometric sample of @xmath723.000 stars with various distance indicators , have presented a @xmath10 map for stars within 100 pc , among many others maps with different distance cuts , with a strong resemblence to fig . so , is the lb boundary , as indicated by the rise in color excesses / extinctions , real within 100 pc as indicated by the @xmath10 @xmath7 0.1 mag contour , @xcite , but not for stars within 55 pc with an @xmath21 @xmath7 0.1 mag contour corresponding to @xmath10 @xmath7 0.03 mag as the conclusion would be if the three shadow clouds mentioned really are @xmath750 pc in front of the proper lb boundary ? but if we may rely on the median extinctions and the map in fig . [ f3 ] and accept the median @xmath21 = 0.1 mag as defining the onset of extinction from the lb confinement we could possibly state that in the northern part of the first and second quadrant the lb limit is within 55 pc and in the southern part of the third and fourth quadrant it is further away .", "we have constructed what was termed the hipparcos extinction sample with about 85.000 distance extinction pairs . the classification originally in the hipparcos catalogue was supplemented with the @xmath28 classification of hd stars . we introduced a simple dwarf / giant separation of the @xmath29 in order to have a 2d classification of the stars with no luminosity class given in the catalog . our main purpose has been to demonstrate that the hipparcos extinction sample in addition to estimating distances to individual clouds , e.g. @xcite , possibly also may be used to trace large scale features , extending over large fractions of the sky . it seems justified to conclude that further investigation of the hipparcos extinction sample at larger distances may be worth while .", "the investigation of the milky way ism is supported economically by fonden af 29 . december 1967 . simbad has been used for the extraction of the hipparcos 1 , hipparcos 2 , michigan v catalog data and for the comments on each of the hipparcos stars . 99 abt , h.a . , 2011 , @xmath30 141 , 165 berghoefer , t.w . , bowyer , s. , lieu , r. , knude , j. 1998 , @xmath31 500 , 838 de geus , e.j . , de zeeuw , p.t . , lub , j. 1989 , @xmath32 216 , 44 frisch , p.c . redfield , s. and slavin , d. 2011 @xmath33 49 , 327 houk , n. and swift , c. 1999 @xmath34 , department of astronomy university of michigan , ann arbor michigan knude , j. 1987 @xmath32 171 , 289 knude , j. and h@xmath35 g , e. 1998 @xmath32 338 , 897 knude , j. 2010 arxiv:1006.3676 lallement , r. , vergely , j .- l.,valette , b. , pusspitarini , l. , eyer , l . , casagrande , l. 2013 @xmath36 perryman , m.a.c . , lindegren , l. , kowalevsky , j. et al . , 1997 , @xmath32 323 , 49 reis , w. , wagner , c. , de avillez , m.a . , santos , f.p . 2011 apj 734 , 8 schmidt - kaler , th . 1982 landolt - boernstein vi 2b van leeuwen , f. , 2007 , @xmath32 474 , 653 vergely , j .- l . , valette , , b. , lallement , r. , raimond , s. 2010 , @xmath32 518 , a31"], "summary": "in the mapping of the local ism it is of some interest to know where the first indications of the boundary of the local bubble can be measured . the hipparcos distances combined to @xmath0 photometry and some sort of spectral classification permit mapping of the spatial extinction distribution . photometry is available for almost the complete hipparcos sample and michigan classification is available for brighter stars south of @xmath1 = + 5 ( 1900 ) . for the northern and fainter stars spectral types , e.g. the hd types , are given but a luminosity class is often missing . the @xmath0 photometry and the parallax do , however , permit a dwarf / giant separation due to the value of the slope of the reddening vector compared to the gradient of the main sequence in a color magnitude diagram , in the form : @xmath0 @xmath2 @xmath3 = @xmath4 , together with the rather shallow extinction present in the hipparcos sample . we present the distribution of median @xmath5 for stars with hipparcos 2 distances less than 55 pc . the northern part of the first and second quadrant has most extinction , up to @xmath60.2 mag and the southern part of the third and fourth quadrant the slightest extinction , @xmath60.05 mag . the boundary of the extinction minimum appears rather coherent on an angular resolution of a few degrees    [ firstpage ]    local bubble interstellar extinction hipparcos distance extinction pairs", "ranking": [0, 2, 3, 1, 4]}

earth such as la , pr , etc . and b stands for divalent alkaline - earth elements , such as ba , sr , etc . materials refinements have revealed that very large magnetoresistances , of over three orders of magnitude change in resistance , can be observed in such compounds prepared through special heat - treatment @xcite . these materials have since been refered to as colossal magnetoresistance materials , or cmr materials . the large magnetoresistance effect in these compounds was referred to as cmr  effect . the physics of cmr  is complex due to the similar energy scales involved for interactions among the lattice , electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom . the basic electronic interactions in these materials were investigated back in the fifties . the double - exchange model @xcite was proposed to explain the simultaneous onset of metallic conductivity and ferromagnetism as doping concentration @xmath5 is increased across the insulator - metal transition point of @xmath6 . it was also understood then that there is a strong correlation between the mn - o - mn bond length and bond angle and the magnetic coupling of adjacent mn ions @xcite . a jahn - teller distortion lifts the double - degeneracy of mn @xmath7-electrons @xmath8 orbitals , and provides a mechanism for strong coupling between the electronic , magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom . in bulk ceramic materials a jahn - teller distortion - related orthorombicity is present in la@xmath3ca@xmath4mno@xmath2 in the doping range of @xmath9.@xcite . above @xmath10 such static distortion of lattice is no longer observable . to explain the cmr effect , recently it was proposed that even for @xmath11 , dynamically fluctuating local jahn - teller distortion still exists , which provides a mechanism for the localization of ferromagnetic polarons @xcite . for cmr  materials at @xmath12 in temperatures above the curie point @xmath13 , these polarons are localized . electrical conduction occurs via hopping process . for temperatures well below @xmath13 on the other hand , the electornic states appear more extended , and a band - like conduction is more appropriate . local spin - density approximation calculation @xcite has been carried out for la@xmath3ca@xmath4mno@xmath2 in the region @xmath14 . their results suggest an almost completely spin - polarized mn @xmath7-band . therefore these materials may behave as half - metals at temperatures below @xmath13 , and hence may exhibit a large spin - dependent conductance across a tunneling barrier @xcite .    for magnetic field - sensing applications , low - field responsivity is necessary . large mr is desired in field ranges of tens to hundreds of oe . this presents a challenge for cmr materials , since cmr effect observed in the generic doped manganate perovskites involves a magnetic field above 1 tesla @xcite , and the low - field magnetoresistance in the field range of 10 - 100oe remains minimal . one might expect large spin - dependent conductivity across a macroscopic interface between two cmr electrodes across which the magnetization abruptly changes direction . this may either be due to local spin - dependent hopping , as prescribed by the double - exchange mechanism , or it maybe due to spin - dependent tunneling , if the interface is electrically insulating enough to behave as a tunneling barrier . such a macroscopic interface disrupts the magnetic exchange - coupling , so that easy rotation of magnetic moment from one electrode to the other can be obtained . three approaches have been taken to experimentally exploit this concept . the first approach is to use a crystalline grain - boundary as the interface , and study the spin - dependent transport across . the role of grain boundary in providing additional contributions to low - field magnetoresistance has long been suspected @xcite . direct experimental observation of grain - boundary - originated magnetoresistance has recently been made @xcite which shows a 30% magnetoresistance in a field of less than 500 oe . the second approach uses the naturally occuring inter - planar conductivity in the 2-dimensional version of the cmr  material la@xmath15sr@xmath16mn@xmath17o@xmath18 @xcite . they demonstarted a large magnetoresistance of 240% in less than 500oe at 4.2k , using the layered single crystal compound of la@xmath19sr@xmath20mn@xmath17o@xmath21 at @xmath22 . the transport direction was perpendicular to the planes of layering , and the authors argued that transport in this direction may be due to spin - dependent tunneling . the third approach makes use of thin film trilayer junctions , fabricated from epitaxial trilayer films to support current - perpendicular ( cpp ) transport . successful demonstration of large low - field magnetoresistance in cmr - based devices was first realized in such junctions @xcite . the devices are lithographically fabricated from la@xmath0(ca , sr)@xmath23mno@xmath2 - srtio@xmath2 - la@xmath0(ca , sr)@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( lsmo - sto - lsmo , or lcmo - sto - lcmo ) trilayer epitaxial thin films . the junctions show large low field magnetoresistance , of about a factor of two to five , in a field around 100oe at 4.2k . these results provide an existence proof that low - field cmr is possible . this paper focuses on experimental issues concerning spin - dependent transport in cmr trilayer junctions .", "a typical structure for thin film trilayer magnetic junction is illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] . the junction is comprised of a top and a bottom magnetic electrode , made of epitaxial cmr  thin films . the two electrodes are separated in between by a thin layer of foreign material such as srtio@xmath2 , which disrupts the magnetic exchange coupling between the electrodes , and makes it possible to macroscopically rotate the magnetic moment of one electrode with respect to another . transport current is forced to flow perpendicular to barrier in the cpp geometry . if the barrier is thin enough , it will allow some passage of electrical current , either via metal - insulator - metal tunneling , or by some other more complex and inhomogeneous processes , such as defect - assisted hopping through the barrier . one hopes to directly observe spin - dependent transport across the barrier . by spin - dependent transport we mean that , on a macroscopic scale , the conductance across the barrier is dependent on the relative orientation of the ferromagnetic ( fm ) moments of the two electrodes . usually , the transport resistance across such a structure would be minimum when the two fm electrodes moments are parallel , and maximum when they are antiparallel . this is true in many mechanisms including spin - dependent tunneling , double - exchange - mediated nearest neighbor hopping , or in metallic two - channel spin - scattering limited conduction . when such a trilayer is subjected to an applied magnetic field , the junction resistance will show a particular type of field dependence . the junction stays in its low resistance state in sufficiently high field . but when the applied field is swept from its negative value to positive , one electrode will magnetically rotate before the other if the device is designed such that the two electrodes have different magnetic anisotropy . this will result in a momentary antiparallel arrangement of the relative moments across the barrier , and the junction resistance will register its high value in this field range . this is schematically illustrated in fig.[fig1](c ) . the conduction mechanism across the barrier layer can vary . in metal or alloy - based thin film trilayers , several types of separation layers have been experimented with . the separation layer can either be a non - magnetic metal , as in the case of a spin - valve @xcite , or an insulator , as in spin - dependent tunneling @xcite . spin - dependent tunneling has been observed in elemental and alloy ferromagnetic metal electrode systems @xcite . there are still debates as to whether such type of tunneling should be observable in @xmath7-band dominant cmr materials @xcite , since @xmath7-electrons decay much more rapidly into the barrier than @xmath24-electrons @xcite .    for cmr  trilayers , the most commonly used barrier material is a thin layer of epitaxial srtio@xmath2 film , 20 to 50  thick . the role of this barrier material is yet to be fully understood , as will be further discussed later . non - linear current - voltage characteristics have been observed in cmr - barrier - cmr junctions @xcite . these current - voltage ( @xmath25 ) characteristics appear roughly consistent with a metal - barrier - metal tunneling process . however , non - linear @xmath25 characteristic alone is insufficient for establishing a tunneling transport mechanism , and other mechanisms have been known to give rise to non - linear @xmath25s as well @xcite . the exact conduction mechanism in these cmr  junctions remains unclear at present .      in our lab , thin film trilayers were made using epitaxial la@xmath0sr@xmath23mno@xmath2 ( lsmo ) electrodes and srtio@xmath2 ( sto ) barriers @xcite . briefly , epitaxial growth was achieved by using _ in situ _ pulsed - laser deposition . typical growth conditions included a substrate temperature of 600 to 800c , and an oxygen pressure of 300mtorr . a  nd - yag laser was used in its frequency tripled mode ( 355 nm ) at 10hz repetition . the laser intensity on target surface was estimated to be around 3 to 5 joules/@xmath26 . deposition was done using the sequence of 600  lsmo , followed by 20 to 50  of sto , followed again by 400  of lsmo . typical deposition rate for lsmo  was around 2.6 / sec , sto about 1.8 / sec . single crystal substrates of srtio@xmath2(100 ) , laalo@xmath2 ( 100 )  and ndgao@xmath2 ( 110 ) have all been used for experimentation . after deposition , the substrate was cooled in 300torr of oxygen to room temperature in about 1 hr . a  thin layer of silver , typically 500  or less , was sputter deposited to the surface of the trilayer before it was taken out of the vacuum system for further processing . structurally , on the local scale of several thousand angstroms at least , the lsmo / sto / lsmo  interfaces are well - formed , and are free of gross defects . the continuation of epitaxial growth of lsmo  across the sto  barrier layer is confirmed by x - ray diffraction as well as by cross - sectional transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) . a representative tem picture of the trilayer interface is shown in fig.[fig2 ] , in which case a coherent lattice fringe can be seen to carry across the sto  barrier layer from the bottom lsmo  to the top . optical photolithography was used to fabricate cpp  junctions from trilayers . the shape of the base - electrode layer was formed first , by ion milling through a photoresist stencil . ion milling was done using neutralized ar ions , 500ev , 0.3ma/@xmath27 , 45@xmath28 incidence angle . after stripping the resist , a second resist pattern was put on , which defined the pillar structure forming the junctions . again ion milling was used , in this case to etch half way into the film , timed to stop immediately past the stobarrier layer , forming the pillar structure from the trilayers . a blanket sio@xmath17 layer , typically about 3000  thick , was then sputter deposited on top , followed by a lift - off step that removes the resist layer on top of the pillars , opening up self - aligned holes for top metallic contact . a  layer of about 2000  sputtered gold was used for top contact , which was subsequently etched using yet another level of photoresist step , forming the cross - bar structure from which 4-probe measurements could be made of individual junction pillars underneath each gold contact bridge . a scanning electron micrograph ( sem ) of a typical device structure made with this process is shown in fig.[fig4 ] . to make certain there is no interdiffusion - related insulation problem between sio@xmath17 and gold , as well as for promoting adhesion , a thin layer of titanium , usually about 20 to 50   thick , was put down between the sio@xmath17 and the top gold layer . the quality of sio@xmath17 insulation was further confirmed by the consistency between results from devices fabricated using mgo insulation layer and from devices made using sio@xmath17 .", "two types of junction behaviors were observed . they can be classified according to their temperature dependence . fig.[fig5 ] presents a summary . in one type of junctions , typically with sto  barriers on the thicker side ( 30 to 50 ) , the junction resistance increases with decreasing temperature , as shown in fig.[fig5](a ) . these typically involve junctions of sizes below 10@xmath29 , and are devices with the largest observed magnetoresistance at low temperatures . for this type of junctions , the magnetic field dependence of junction resistance , @xmath30 , tends to be rather complex , an example is shown in fig.[fig5](b ) . another type of junctions , typically involving thinner sto  barriers ( below 30 ) , shows a decreasing junction resistance upon the lowering of sample temperature . these junctions often have cleaner , more reproducible @xmath30 loops , as shown in fig.[fig5](d ) . the interpretation of data from these low - resistance junctions is tricky , because the junction resistance could approach the base - electrode s sheet resistance . for a 600lsmo  base electrode with resistivity of @xmath31 to @xmath32 at 4.2k , we have a base - electrode @xmath33 to @xmath34 . when junction resistance approaches that of @xmath35 , distributed voltage drop in the base electrode can no longer be ignored , and one has to be careful in distinguishing between true junction resistance and the apparent resistance caused by voltage distribution inside the base electrode @xcite . such artifacts can cause a superficially high value of magnetoresistance @xcite . another difficulty in studying low resistance junctions has to do with sample heating . it is difficult to apply a large voltage across a low resistance junction without significantly heating up the _ junction area _ of the sample . perovskites such as srtio@xmath2 have relatively low thermal conductivity ( around 10 w / km for sto at room temperature , compared to about 144 w / km for single crystal silicon , for example . ndgao@xmath2 single crystal substrates have probably even lower thermal conductivity ) . therefore , sample heating can be significant on a local scale for the junction , even when the input power is insufficient to cause much observable heating over the chip ) . for these two reasons , most of our discussions will be focused on devices of the first type , namely the high resistance junctions whose resistance increase upon cooling of the sample , and whose resistance value is at least an order of magnitude larger than the base - electrode @xmath35 .      a  representative temperature dependence of junction resistance is shown in fig.[fig6 ] . two regions of temperatures involving distinctively different junction behaviors can be identified . in the first region , typically between 130k and 300k , the junction resistance rises almost exponentially upon the decreasing of temperature , resembling a @xmath36 scaling relation commonly seen in systems exhibiting variable range hopping @xcite . a replot of the junction resistance vs. temperature data according to the scaling relation @xmath37 $ ] is shown in the inset of fig.[fig6 ] . in this region the magnetoresistance is minimal , typically less than 0.5% for a field sweep of couple of hundred oe . below 130k , the junction enters its second region , where the junction resistance is less sensitive to temperature variation . it becomes more noisy , and exhibits large magnetic field - exposure history dependence . this is the temperature region where large low - field magnetoresistance is observed . an example is shown in fig.[fig7 ] , where the junction resistance is measured as a function of sweeping magnetic field at a constant temperature of 4.2k . such response to sweeping magnetic field is expected conceptually from the simple two - fm - electrode junction picture as shown in fig.[fig1](c ) . details about the shape of the @xmath30 loops will be discussed in the next section , here we merely use fig.[fig7 ] to point out that the low - field magnetoresistance is large . for the junction shown here , a factor of 5 change in resistance is observed at a switching field of around 100 oe at 4.2k . this is the first observation of large mr  at low - fields in cmr  materials , proving that cmr  is not a phenomenon limited to high magnetic fields . we define two resistance values from data such as shown in fig.[fig7 ] , namely @xmath38 and @xmath39 , corresponding to the dc resistive high- and low - state of the junction . the magnetoresistance contrast can then be conveniently defined as @xmath40 , according to the conventions used in literatures . the temperature dependences of @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath41 are shown in fig.[fig5 ] , fig.[fig6 ] and fig.[fig8 ] . as mentioned above , the magnetoresistance decreases with increasing temperature , and it disappears around 130k . this is well below the curie temperature @xmath13 of the thin film material which is close to the resistance peak temperature . the resistance peak temperature of the base electrode is shown in fig.[fig8 ] to be above 300k . separate measurements confirm the base - electrode s resistance peaks around 350 - 360k . clearly , something other than the film s @xmath13 is limiting the upper temperature of the junction magnetoresistance . the high temperature behavior of junction resistance as shown in fig.[fig6 ] may suggest defect - assisted hopping as a possible conduction mechanism across the sto  barrier . indeed such temperature dependence of resistance is common in oxide perovskite semiconductors having a large population of defect sites . the defect assisted conduction process may provide additional high temperature conduction channels that progressively shunt out the direct , spin - dependent conduction process manifested at low temperatures . for this scenario to work , the defect - assisted hopping has to have a large spin - flipping rate , because the high temperature conduction apparently has lost all spin - dependence information , judging from its minimal value of magnetoresistance . there are other possibilities for a premature decrease of magnetoresistance . spin - dependent transport across a trilayer is sensitive to interface magnetic states which may be different from that deep inside the film . this may be caused by a reduced magnetic coupling at the interface , by a discontinuous electronic structure , or by interface diffusion or oxygen deficiency . a different stress environment at the interface may cause change in electrode s magnetic states . excitation of surface magnons have also been suggested as a possible source for the suppression of magnetoresistance , both for high temperature and for elevated junction bias@xcite . the magnetic coercivity of 33%-doped lsmo  thin films is of the order of 100 to 200 oe at helium temperature @xcite . in cmr junctions , the situation is more complex . additional magnetic interactions need to be considered . four major contributors are : the shape anisotropy of the junction pillar , the edge - coupling , the dipolar coupling across a rough junction interface , and the magnetostriction - induced anisotropy . the complexity of magnetic states in the junction pillar is apparent from our measurement such as data shown in fig.[fig7 ] . junctions with high resistance have more complex @xmath30 loops . in fig.[fig9 ] , @xmath30 loops from two junctions of different resistance are compared to the magnetic hysteresis loop of a blank film of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath42 . the top panel shows a representative magnetic hysteresis loop taken on a blank la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 epitaxial film . the middle panel ( b ) shows the @xmath30 loop for a low - resistasnce junction . the switching field for this type of junction agrees well with that of the coercivity of the blank film . the lower panel ( c ) shows the @xmath30 loop of a high - resistance junction . here the lower switching field agrees well with the magnetic coercivity of the blank thin film . however , the upper switching field is significantly above the coercivity of the blank film . this suggests the presence of magnetic states with enhanced magnetic anisotropy , be it from shape , strain , or interface coupling . the @xmath30 curves for high - resistance junctions are noisy and often show preferred multiple discrete resistance values , suggesting the switching of multiple magnetic domains inside the electrodes . over the many junctions we have measured to date , a wide variety of magnetic behaviors have been seen . fig.[fig10 ] shows some other @xmath30 loops with complex magnetic structures . apparently , much better understanding and control of the electrode s magnetic state is necessary . it is also possible that part of the @xmath30 loop complexities comes from magnetic defect - sites inside the barrier , rather than from the magnetic states of the electrodes alone . barrier - related magnetic defects has been shown in small ( @xmath4380 nm diameter ) ni - nio - co junctions to cause magnetic field - dependent fluctuations that can lead to large apparent magnetoresistance at low frequencies @xcite . non - linear @xmath25 characteristics are present in all junctions that show large magnetoresistance . following definitions similar to that from fig.[fig7 ] , at a given bias current for a junction we define @xmath44 and @xmath45 as the high- and low - voltage state corresponding to @xmath38 and @xmath39 . we trace @xmath44 and @xmath45 as a function of bias current , and the resulting two branches of the @xmath25 characteristics and the bias - dependent magnetoresistance ratio @xmath41 are shown in fig.[fig11 ] . the two branches of @xmath25s show pronounced non - linearity . at the same time the magnetoresistance ratio shows a bias - dependence , with the contrast @xmath41 decreasing as junction bias is increased . this behavior is similar to what is observed in metal - based magnetic tunneling junctions @xcite , although the characteristic voltage scale for the reduction of magnetoresistance is at least a factor of 3 to 5 smaller than in the case of metal junctions such as cofe / al@xmath17o@xmath2/co @xcite . the bias - dependent junction transport can be further examined by plotting the differential junction conductance as a function of bias voltage . this is shown in fig.[fig12 ] , where the specific differential junction conductance is plotted as a function of junction bias , showing a relatively sharp conductance minimum at low - bias riding on top of a more gradually rising high - bias conductance slope . the origin of this characteristic is not well understood . it is more complex than one would expect from a simple metal - insulator - metal tunneling junction as the simmons tunneling model @xcite would predict ( dotted lines ) . more knowledge about the barrier and the interface states of the cmr  materials is necessary . cmr  trilayer junctions fabricated to date show large amount of inhomogeneities . junction conductance in most cases do not scale with junction area in any simple way . this is evident in data presented in fig.[fig12 ] . if the junction conductances were to scale with the area , one would expect all specific conductance curves to be roughly the same in value . instead in fig.[fig12 ] the specific conductance increases with increasing junction size . fig.[fig13 ] shows two sets of junction resistances as a function of pillar size for two rows of junctions on one chip . a clear cross - over from high junction resistance to low junction resistance can been seen as the junction dimension is increased beyond a cross - over region between 2 and 10@xmath46 m . this indicates non - uniform conduction over the junction area , where high conductance paths are small in area compared to junction sizes , and they distribute with a mean distance on the order of 2 to 10@xmath46 m . pinhole conduction is a possibility , at least for junctions of the size above the cross - over dimension . the mr of manganate junctions appears to correlate to junction resistance . fig.[fig14 ] shows data obtained on several manganate junction chips . the junction magnetoresistance ratio @xmath47 is plotted against the specific junction resistance on a log - log plot . these data appear bunched into a cone boardered on the high mr  end by a line of slope @xmath48 , and on the low mr  end by a line of slope of about @xmath49 . a slope - equal - to-1 corrlation could indicate the presence of a parallel shunt that is magnetoresistively inactive . the meaning of the lower - bound line is not clear . the presence of inhomogeneity further complicates the nature of conduction across these cmr  junctions . although the non - linear @xmath25s from these devices can be roughly described by the simmons tunneling formula , it is dangerous to conclude that such fits lead to any insight of the barrier physics or the nature of the junction . fig.[fig15 ] shows a collection of the apparent barrier thickness @xmath50 and barrier height @xmath51 extracted from fitting simmons model to various cmr junction @xmath25s obtained at 4.2k . the values of @xmath52 appears to form a correlation defined by @xmath53 . this apparent correlation as it turns out is a sure sign that we are not looking at clean tunnling junctions but rather are just parameterizing a complex non - linear device with a functional form of the simmons formula . a more quantitative analysis is given in the appendix .", "large low - field magnetoresistance is demonstrated in cmr  trilayer junctions at temperatures below 130k . for the first time in cmr materials system a large magnetoresistance of a factor of 5 is observed in an applied field around @xmath54 oe . this provides an existence proof that cmr  effect can be obtained in low - fields . non - linear @xmath25 characteristics and bias - dependent magnetoresistances have been observed in cmr  trilayer junctions . these behaviors are qualitatively similar to what was observed in metal - insulator - metal spin - dependent tunneling systems . much of the physics for cmr junctions remains to be explored . the major experimental challenge is to master the materials science in the preparation of a well controlled , well characterized barrier interface , so that transport over the junction region could be more uniform , which will then allow more quantitative examination of the transport process .    the control of the electrodes magnetic state requires more study . better control of the shape of the junction pillar is needed to assure a reproducible micromagnetic boundary condition . one particular issue is the control of the amount of over etch during the fabrication of the pillar , as illustrated in fig.[fig1](b ) . because the over - etch step height determines to a large degree the amount of anti - parallel coupling the two fm  electrodes have . also necessary is a controlled pre - setting of the magnetic easy - axis for the manganates . in most devices studied so far , the magnetic easy - axis is uncontrolled . that contributes to the observed complexity of magnetic states . further , exchange - biasing of the manganate electrode could be looked into , since that could significantly simplify the micromagnetics of the trilayer junction structure , and make its response to applied magnetic field more predictable . the control of magnetic state is particularly important in cmr  junctions . because of its large magnetoresistance , detailed transport study is possible only when there is a stable and well - controlled magnetic state . the low - field magnetoresistance in trilayer cmr  junctions tends to vanish at temperatures around @xmath55 to @xmath56k , well below the curie temperature of the electrodes which is around @xmath57 to @xmath58k . the reason for this is not understood at present .    from an applications point of view , one would like to extend the temperature range for large magnetoresistance . room temperature operation of large low - field cmr  has not been demonstrated at this point , although cmreffects of @xmath59 in @xmath60 tesla has been seen in la@xmath0ba@xmath61mno@xmath2 epitaxial thin films @xcite . materials stability , device yield and compatibility to existing circuit fabrication processes are all issues that need to be resolved . we wish to thank stuart parkin , jammie kaufman at ibm  almaden research center , john slonczewski , bill gallagher , arunava gupta , lia krusin -

uniformities , and @xmath24 describes the parasitic conductance brought forth by shunts ( assumed to be ohmic for simplicity ) . there is little difference in the appearance of eqn.([e3 ] ) compared to eqn.([e1 ] ) . in fact they are equivalent in functional form up to @xmath68 . thus a two - parameter fit to eqn.([e1 ] ) will always give a reasonable fit to the first order , but with modified fitting parameters @xmath52 . the problem is , these @xmath52 do not have the same physical meaning as they do in the simmons model eqn.([e1 ] ) .    to see this let us create a situation where a real junction can be represented by an ideal simmons junction with @xmath69 defined according to eqn.([e1 ] ) . assume the real junction has parasitic @xmath70 and @xmath24 and its @xmath25 can be described by eqn.([e3 ] ) . what happens if we use the ideal junction formula , eqn.([e1 ] ) , to fit the real junction s @xmath71 as defined by eqn.([e3 ] ) ? the fit will give an apparent @xmath52 described by the minimization condition of :                    with @xmath77 and @xmath78 defined by @xmath69 through eqn.([e2b ] ) . so the real junction will also fit the ideal simmons model eqn.([e1 ] ) reasonably well , but with an off - set to parameters @xmath79 , thus to @xmath52 . it is therefore very misleading to use the definition of eqn.([e1 ] ) to interpret @xmath52 and infer from that anything about the barrier height and barrier thickness . what makes matter worse is such fits based on eqn.([e1 ] ) seem to give reasonable values for @xmath52 . the reason behind this is the strongly exponential dependence of the apparent conductance on @xmath80 in eqn.([e1 ] ) . many non - linear odd - function @xmath25 characteristics can be expanded to @xmath81 and be assigned an @xmath82 to the junction conductance @xmath83 . an @xmath24 thus defined would give a value to @xmath80 according to eqn.([e2b ] ) . assume @xmath84 for simplicity ,      the value of @xmath86 @xmath87m@xmath88 is large compared to typical conductance @xmath24 ( usually around @xmath89m@xmath88 ) for any reasonable barrier thickness @xmath50 , therefore it is self -

ruffini theorem , we use numerical root - finding methods . there are numerous numerical methods available to find roots of univariate polynomials with floating point coefficients , e.g. , companion matrices , the aberth method , and the jenkins - traub method . all of these methods work well in certain cases ( see ref . @xcite for an extensive review ) . there are also several symbolic methods to solve polynomials with rational coefficients , but the random polynomials under consideration will generally not have rational coefficients .    approximating the roots of univariate polynomials with moderate degrees starts becoming an increasingly difficult task . however , in theory , numerical approximation methods typically have complexity around @xmath7 , but have the disadvantage of yielding only approximated results . this introduces the need to define what we actually consider a `` good approximation '' of a polynomial root . `` good '' numerical methods often are backward - stable , that is , the results obtained at the end are exact results of a slightly perturbed input . unfortunately , for ill - conditioned problems , even if they are posed in an exact setting , this might not be enough to provide bounds on the quality of the result . smale defined `` good enough '' as being in the quadratic convergence zone of newton s method for an exact root of the polynomial so that the exact root can be efficiently approximated to arbitrary accuracy . a point in such a quadratic convergence zone is called an _ approximate root _ and smale showed how to certify using only data computed at the test point that it was an indeed an approximate root via @xmath0-theory . an implementation of @xmath0-theory is provided in alphacertified  @xcite . other results of this kind also exist in the literature , e.g. , @xcite . other certification techniques are available for the univariate case , which , as we will see , can lead to better inclusion results . in this paper , we compare @xmath0-theory with a global approach used in the mpsolve package @xcite . the mpsolve package implements an efficient multiprecision univariate polynomial solver which our tests show is efficient and effective at solving polynomials even as the degree increases . the main inclusion result , originally proved in the paper by tilli @xcite , roughly states that if the distance of an approximation from the root is less than @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a constant depending on the separation of the roots , then newton s method converges quadratically from the start . the constant @xmath9 can be easily computed or bounded without computing the roots by means of gerschgorin s theorem applied to a particular companion matrix . one may view this as a global method since @xmath9 depends on all of the roots whereas @xmath0-theory is a local method . since we are focusing on random polynomials where , with probability @xmath10 , @xmath4 has @xmath2 distinct roots , the global root separation bound will be positive . thus , this global method is applicable for the problems under consideration . the output of the software mpsolve is well - suited for this random context : it can deliver good approximations using multiprecision arithmetic ( given exact input , it obtains the roots to an arbitrary number of digits ) , can guarantee the inclusion radii , and can certify if a root is real . in this way , we were able to solve large samples of random polynomials and to certifiably count the number of real roots .    for concrete problems , we work with two different sets of random polynomials : coefficients are independently picked from the gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance one , and from the standard cauchy distribution . since the gaussian case is well studied with many analytical results available , we use this as our benchmark system . the cauchy case is relatively under - studied and , except for the mean number of real roots , analytical results are usually not available . hence , our numerical results for the cauchy case can provide much needed input for potentially leading to new analytical results . the rest of the paper is organized as follows . section  [ sec : numerical_methods ] describes numerical methods under consideration for approximating roots of univariate polynomials as well as discusses two certification methods . we also pictorially show the certifiable regions of a simple and exactly solvable polynomial equation . section  [ sec : numerical_set_up ] describes our setup for solving and certifying the roots of random polynomials . section  [ sec : results ] highlights some differences between the two certification methods , especially as the degree increases , and provides numerical results for various quantities associated to random polynomials .", "one common approach for solving univariate polynomial equations is to use the companion matrix . this method is widely used in mathematical software such as matlab . after describing the companion matrix method , we summarize smale s @xmath0-theory followed by the certification approach based on gerschgorin s theorem used in mpsolve . the global nature of certification based on gerschgorin s theorem generally provides larger certification regions due to exploiting more information about the roots than the local @xmath0-theory approach . this section ends with certification methods for detecting real roots . suppose that for @xmath4 presented in , the leading coefficient @xmath11 is nonzero , i.e. , @xmath4 is a univariate polynomial of degree  @xmath2 . one can find the roots of @xmath4 by computing the eigenvalues of the companion matrix : @xmath12 since @xmath4 is the characteristic polynomial of @xmath13 . the eigenvalues of @xmath13 can be computed , for example , using the qr algorithm as implemented in lapack @xcite . the roots ( ) command in matlab uses this companion matrix method .      due to conditioning of @xmath13 , the approximations of the roots of @xmath4 computed by , for example , lapack or matlab , using double precision may not be in a quadratic convergence zone of newton s method . one way to certify they are indeed in a quadratic convergence zone is to use @xmath0-theory . although the approach works for more general situations , we focus on univariate polynomials @xmath4 of degree @xmath2 . let @xmath14 be the first derivative of @xmath4 and @xmath15 be the @xmath16 derivative . a newton iteration of @xmath4 starting at @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18 clearly , if @xmath19 , then @xmath20 if and only if @xmath21 .    newton s method relies upon repeatedly applying newton iterations . for simplicity , the @xmath16 newton iteration will be denoted @xmath22    after defining the notion of an approximate root , we state a theorem which can be used to certify that a point is indeed an approximate root without _ a priori _ knowledge about the exact root . a point @xmath17 is an _ approximate root _ of @xmath4 with associated root @xmath23 if , for each @xmath24 , @xmath25 that is , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is in the quadratic convergence basin of @xmath23 for @xmath4 . [ thm : alpha ] if @xmath17 and @xmath4 is a univariate polynomial of degree  @xmath2 such that @xmath19 and @xmath28 then @xmath27 is an approximate root of @xmath4 with associated root @xmath23 where @xmath29 moreover , @xmath30 .    given two approximate roots @xmath31 and @xmath32 , they must have distinct associated roots , via the triangle inequality , if @xmath33 this and several other @xmath0-theoretic algorithms are implemented in the software package alphacertified @xcite which , among other things , has been recently used to certify solutions to multivariate problems arising in theoretical physics and chemistry @xcite .    in the present article , we take advantage of the fact that random polynomials of degree @xmath2 have , with probability @xmath10 , @xmath2 distinct complex roots . this means that if we find @xmath2 approximate roots with distinct associated roots , we have accounted for _ all _ of the roots . another way to certify a point is an approximate root of a univariate polynomial is the following global approach . [ thm : newtonisolation ] let @xmath4 be a monic univariate polynomial of degree @xmath34 with distinct roots @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath36 with @xmath37 for @xmath38 . suppose that @xmath17 and @xmath39 such that @xmath40 then , @xmath27 is an approximate root of @xmath4 with associated root @xmath41 . this theorem involves computing the distance from a point to the _ a priori _ unknown roots of @xmath4 . the following lemma provides an effective bound . [ lem : newtonradius ] if @xmath4 is a monic univariate polynomial of degree @xmath2 and @xmath17 such that @xmath19 , then @xmath42 contains at least  one  root  of  @xmath4 . see @xcite . the following combines theorem  [ thm : newtonisolation ] and lemma  [ lem : newtonradius ] to allow one to algorithmically verify that a given point is an approximate root given information about all of the roots . this type of global approach is used in the mpsolve package @xcite . let @xmath4 be a monic univariate polynomial of degree @xmath34 with @xmath2 distinct roots and suppose that @xmath43 . if , for all @xmath38 , @xmath44 is an approximate root of @xmath4 with distinct associated roots .    by lemma  [ lem : newtonradius ] , the ball @xmath45 centered at @xmath46 of radius @xmath47 contains at least one root . for @xmath38 , it follows immediately from that @xmath48 . thus , each @xmath49 contains a distinct root of @xmath4 , say @xmath41 . for @xmath38 , @xmath50 thus , for all @xmath38 , @xmath51 and the statement follows from theorem  [ thm : newtonisolation ] . the balls @xmath52 provides some information about the roots . gerschgorin s theorem is another way to obtain strict and useful inclusion results to analyze clusters of roots , such as the following statement . let @xmath53 be a @xmath54 matrix with @xmath55 . let @xmath56 and @xmath57 be the ball centered at @xmath58 with radius @xmath59 . then ,    1 . each eigenvalue of @xmath60 is contained in @xmath61 , and 2 . every connected component of this union made up of @xmath62 balls contains exactly @xmath62 eigenvalues of @xmath60 ( counted with multiplicity ) . suppose that @xmath4 is a monic univariate polynomial and @xmath43 are distinct . define @xmath63 . consider the following matrix : @xmath64\\ ] ]    the matrix @xmath60 is a companion matrix for @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath65 . let @xmath66 , @xmath67^t$ ] and @xmath68^t$ ] . recall that @xmath69 . we have then that @xmath70 so we can write : @xmath71 the expression above proves that we have @xmath72 for every @xmath73 . recalling that @xmath74 is a degree @xmath2 polynomial we can conclude that the relation must hold for every @xmath75 . in particular , for every @xmath76 , we know @xmath77 and so we can conclude that @xmath78 . since we have that @xmath60 is a companion matrix for @xmath4 , we can state the following . [ cor : gerschgorin ] let @xmath79 be distinct and let @xmath80 be the values defined above . the union of the balls @xmath81 contains all the roots of @xmath82 . moreover , every connected component of this union made up of @xmath62 balls contains exactly @xmath62 roots . one may wonder which one between gerschgorin radii and newton radii is more strict . it turns out that if each @xmath46 is a good approximation of a simple root @xmath41 ( or more formally , when @xmath83 ) , we have that they are exactly the same and are both equal to @xmath84 up to the first order expansion . this can be verified by the following simple computation under the assumption that @xmath85 with @xmath86 sufficiently small . in the cases of gerschgorin radii , we have @xmath87 while , for newton radii , we obtain @xmath88    this implies that not only they are essentially equivalent , but also that they are optimal up to a factor of @xmath2 .      for a polynomial @xmath4 with real coefficients , it was observed in @xcite that @xmath0-theory can be used to certifiably decide the reality or nonreality of the associated root given an approximate root . this local certification test is based on the simple fact that a root of @xmath4 is real if and only if there is a real approximate root . corollary  [ cor : gerschgorin ] can be used to develop a global certification test as developed in the following which uses @xmath89 and @xmath90 to denote the real and imaginary part , respectively , of a number @xmath91 . [ thm : mpsolve_real_classification ] let @xmath4 be a monic univariate polynomial of degree @xmath34 with @xmath2 distinct roots and @xmath43 . suppose that @xmath39 such that for all @xmath92 ,    1 . @xmath93 , 2 . @xmath94 , and 3 . @xmath95 . then , @xmath4 has a real root @xmath41 such that @xmath96 .    to prove by contradiction , suppose that @xmath41 is the unique root of @xmath4 in the ball @xmath97 such that @xmath98 . hence , the conjugate of @xmath41 , namely @xmath99 , is also a root of @xmath4 . so , there must exists @xmath100 such that @xmath101 . observe that condition @xmath102 implies that every circle centered in @xmath103 , @xmath104 can not intersect the circle @xmath105 . in particular , this implies that the complex conjugate of @xmath41 can not be a root of @xmath4 , unless @xmath41 is a real root .    in the random setting where , with probability @xmath10 , the univariate polynomial @xmath4 of degree @xmath2 will have @xmath2 distinct roots , we are trying to yield a set of @xmath2 points consisting of approximate roots with distinct associated roots . when the roots have a large pairwise separation , numerical methods such as those implemented in mpsolve yield an effective tool for approximating such points . as the minimum of the pairwise distance decreases , one needs to use higher precision in order to yield approximations to separate the roots and achieve quadratic convergence of newton s method . in the limit when the minimum pairwise distance is zero , standard newton s method can only achieve linear convergence . in this case , for example , mpsolve can compute an approximation correct to @xmath62 digits , where the integer @xmath62 is selected by the user .      as a comparison of the two certification methods , we consider a `` wilkinson - type '' polynomial @xmath106 which has exact integer roots in order to compare numerical results . figure  [ fig : alphaconv ] summarizes results from @xmath0-theory and figure  [ fig : convmpsolve ] summarizes results from mpsolve . in both of these plots , the white regions correspond to certifiable regions where the black points are approximations computed by the roots ( ) command in matlab and mpsolve , respectively . when using mpsolve , the roots are inside the certifiable regions while the roots ( ) command , probably due to the limitation of using double precision computations , obtained roots outside of some @xmath0-theoretic certifiable quadratic convergence basins .            in the rest of the figure the areas were filled with different colors based on the root to which the newton method converges if using that point as the starting  one . we can note how the regions obtained through mpsolve s certification procedure have a similar radius , while this is not true for alphacertified . this is a direct consequence of the uniformity of the constants involved in the first strategy .", "the following describes our numerical setup for generating random polynomials . in particular , we generate a random polynomial of degree @xmath2 by drawing the coefficients from a chosen random distribution such as the uniform distribution or the gaussian distribution with specified mean and variance using matlab which generates random numbers with 32-bit precision . then , we use two numerical root - finding methods and two certification methods .    first , we approximate all of the roots using either the companion matrix method as implemented in matlab s roots ( ) command or using mpsolve .    to use @xmath0-theory to certify the roots , we compute a set of @xmath107 rational approximations @xmath108 of the coefficients of the polynomial @xmath109 such that , for each @xmath110 we have @xmath111 . with numerically estimated roots and rational coefficients in hand , we use alphacertified using @xmath112-bit floating point arithmetic to certify the approximated roots . if any of the @xmath2 roots is not certified , then we run several newton iterations on the uncertified root until it finally reaches the quadratic convergence zone of some exact root . in our experiments , we obtained  @xmath2 certified distinct roots for the random sample and then counted the real roots . as an alternative approach , we use the approach presented in section  [ subsec : mpsolve ] to obtain approximate solutions for the roots of a given polynomial . mpsolve provides a matlab interface which allows the user to request an arbitrary number of digits and certify the result . this approach is valuable because it alleviates the numerical ill - conditioning issues that may be encountered when solving high degree polynomials with ( possibly big ) integer coefficients . for these cases , the matlab s roots ( ) command , even if using a backward stable algorithm , can give very poor approximations of the roots . as a consequence , it is possible that alphacertified may not be able to certify them due to large errors . this issue is solved by mpsolve using a global approach that is guaranteed to produce @xmath113 correct digits on the output ( and certify they are approximate solutions ) . a suitable level of floating point multiprecision will be used by mpsolve internally to achieve this , but it may be not necessary to expose this to matlab ( unless more than @xmath113 digits are required ) . this method is effective in our experiments . as an example , we solved @xmath114 random polynomials of degrees between @xmath115 and @xmath116 using mpsolve , which was able to certify all the roots and determine their reality . while in principle it may happen that a root can not be classified via theorem  [ thm : mpsolve_real_classification ] , this did not happen in our experiments .", "the following presents our results for the roots of random polynomials with coefficients taking indenpendent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) values from two distributions : the gaussian distribution with mean @xmath117 and variance @xmath10 which is one of the most extensively studied cases and can serve as our benchmark as many analytical results are available here , and the cauchy distribution for which only a handful of analytical results are available and hence our numerical results can provide valuable input to the theory .      while trying to approximate the roots , we wished to ensure that our numerical approximations were in the quadratic convergence zone of newton s method . in section  [ sec : numerical_methods ] , two different certification methods are discussed . the first , based on @xmath0-theory , which requires that @xmath118 , is a local certification approach in that it requires only data from one point . the second , based on gerschgorin s theorem , which requires that the newton correction is smaller than the relative distance between the roots divided by approximately @xmath119 , is a global certification approach in that it requires information about all roots simultaneously . the second approach can be reformulated in the same framework as @xmath0-theory if we replace @xmath120 with @xmath121 . one can now compare the mean value of @xmath122 at the roots of @xmath4 with @xmath123 with the smaller value leading to a larger  certification  region . if we assume that the distance of the roots is proportional to @xmath124 , which is a realistic expectation for random polynomials , then @xmath125 . experimentally , we have verified that @xmath120 in the @xmath0-theory has an exponential growth , as can be clearly seen in figure  [ fig : meangamma ] . this causes certification to be computationally prohibitive as @xmath2 increases . for example , using only double precision , figure  [ fig : meangamma ] suggests that degrees less than @xmath115 are feasible using double precision , but may be insufficient for degrees larger than @xmath115 due to large values of @xmath122 .     and @xmath126 constants for random cauchy polynomials with degree between @xmath127 and @xmath115 . ]    it is important to note that the comparison between these two strategies is not fair since @xmath120 is directly computable given a single approximation while @xmath126 needs to be bounded using some kind of inclusion theorem since it relies on the ( unknown ) distance between roots of @xmath4 . however , our numerical results should provide valuable feedback when comparing the two certification procedures . in particular , our experiments showed that the usage of the second strategy , using a global approach , is much more effective for the cases under consideration .    in section  [ subsec : mpsolve ] , we showed that the gerschgorin radii are suboptimal only up to a factor of @xmath2 . this additional factor of @xmath2 leads to a moderate overestimate of  @xmath123 , namely @xmath128 .      for a first experiment , we analyzed the number of real roots of random polynomials . many theoretical results are known , but further analysis could be carried out to obtain more information about the real roots . in particular , the following summarizes some experimental results that we have obtained by solving @xmath114 polynomials of degrees @xmath115 , @xmath129 ,  , @xmath116 . we measured the mean and variance for our sample and checked our results against the theoretical predictions , when available . the average number of real roots is one of the most well - studied quantities in the context of random polynomials . we have estimates both for the gaussian case and for the cauchy case . we only summarize the main results here and leave more in - depth information to @xcite . let @xmath109 be a random polynomial of degree @xmath2 where @xmath5 are i.i.d . selected from a standard normal distribution . if @xmath130 is the number of real roots of @xmath4 , there exists a constant @xmath131 such that @xmath132 the constant @xmath131 is approximately equal to @xmath133 . let @xmath109 be a random polynomial of degree @xmath2 where @xmath5 are i.i.d . with a standard cauchy distribution . if @xmath134 is the number of real roots of @xmath4 , then there exists constants @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 such that @xmath138 the constants @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 are approximately equal to : @xmath139        the experimental results are summarized in figure  [ fig : cauchy_gauss_mean ] . this figure shows that the theoretical results agree with the experimental results , but the convergence can be quite slow . that is , even with @xmath114 sample polynomials , there are still some oscillations around the theoretical value that are visible from the plot .      from the experimental data , we can estimate the variance on the number of real roots . for the gaussian distribution , we compare this with the following theoretical result obtained in @xcite . [ thm : maslova ] let @xmath109 be a random polynomial such that the random variables @xmath5 are i.i.d . and satisfy the following :    * @xmath140 , and * the random variables @xmath5 do have a moment of order @xmath141 for some @xmath142 . if @xmath143 , then @xmath144        we can see from figure  [ fig : variance ] that the experimental estimate and theoretical value seems to be off by a constant . this is due to the fact that , unlike in the case of the expected value , we do not know all the terms of the expansion so we can only state that the limit of @xmath145 as @xmath146 .    moreover , the plot seems to confirm that both the gaussian and the cauchy case have a logarithmic behavior as @xmath2 increases . note that the hypotheses of theorem  [ thm : maslova ] are not satisfied in case of the cauchy random polynomial since the random variables do not have moments of any order .      in figure [ fig : gauss_no_real_roots_hist ] and [ fig : cauchy_no_real_roots_hist ] we report the number of real roots for random polynomials of degree @xmath116 in form of an histogram . we analyze both the gaussian and the cauchy case . the plots were generated starting from a sample of @xmath147 random polynomials with the different distributions for the coefficients . .45   random polynomials obtained using cauchy and gauss distributions.,title=\"fig : \" ]    .45   random polynomials obtained using cauchy and gauss distributions.,title=\"fig : \" ]      motivated by the problem of finding the average number of positive and negative real eigenvalues of real matrices , which amounts to finding the average number of positive and negative real roots of the corresponding characteristic polynomials , we ask what is the average number of positive and negative real roots for our random polynomials . we expect that the mean of the number of positive roots is equal to the mean number of negative roots since both of our random distributions are symmetric with respect to the origin . that is , it is easy to check that the polynomial @xmath148 has roots the opposites of the ones of @xmath82 but the distribution of the coefficients is the same ( since both in the gaussian and in the cauchy case multiplying by @xmath149 does not change the random variable ) .    even though this is clear from an asymptotic point of view , it may be interesting to further examine the topic by looking at the variance of the number of positive and negative roots .        as a further experimental proof of the above statement , one can look at figure  [ fig : ratio ] that shows the ratio between the number of positive and negative real roots for a sample of random polynomials . we have kept the number of samples low to show that there is still some floating around the value @xmath10 , but it is quite clear that the problem of counting the roots is symmetric in the change of sign . figure  [ fig : variancepositive ] plots our experimentally computed variance on the number of positive real roots using @xmath114 random polynomials for each sample point . as far as we know , there are no theoretical estimates for the variance of the number of positive roots . unfortunately , since the variance is increasing very slowly , is not easy to guess its  asymptotic  behavior . a natural extension of the questions that we have tried to address in the previous section is the analysis of the distribution of complex roots . we are considering real random distributions so we expect to have a certain number of real roots and some complex conjugate ones . the following present evidence about the distribution of the real and imaginary parts and on their modulus . figures  [ fig : realdistcauchy][fig : imagdistgauss ] plot the approximate density of the distribution of the real and imaginary parts of the roots of cauchy and gauss polynomials , respectively . .45     .45     we also analyze the distribution of the modulus of the complex roots . the results of our experiments are reported in figure  [ fig : gaussdistabs ] and in figure  [ fig : cauchydistabs ] . only the case with @xmath150 is reported since all our plots look very similar and the modulus of almost all the roots have modulus near @xmath10 . .45     .45     in many areas of science and engineering , studying the surface defined by a multi - dimensional hypersurface described by a multivariate nonlinear function , called potential energy function , is a fundamental problem  called analyzing the potential energy landscape of the given system @xcite . in particular , a great deal of research is invested in finding stationary points of potential energy landscapes of different multivariate systems . finding stationary points of multivariate functions amounts to solving the system of equations obtained by all the first derivatives with respect to all the variables equated to zero . to obtain statistical information about generic potential energy landscapes , it is customary to explore the potential energy landscapes of the random potentials , i.e. , multivariate functions whose coefficients are randomly picked from a random distribution @xcite . using our numerical setup , we mimic exploring the random potential energy landscapes of the univariate random potential @xmath151 , where @xmath152 in other words , we solve @xmath153 . the number of maxima can be obtained by just dividing the number of real zeros of @xmath154 by @xmath102 , since the number of inflection points is of measure @xmath117 ( see @xcite ) .      with our numerical setting we have performed a simulation on @xmath114 random polynomials to check the theoretical estimates in @xcite . the results can be seen in figure  [ fig : cauchy_gauss_mean_maxima ] .      with the same data obtained above we can also estimate the variance of the number of zeros , which is summarized in figure  [ fig : maxima_variance ] . we note that the analysis for the minima is totally symmetric . we now measure the minima for which @xmath156 . in a string theory set up , such minima are called _ de  sitter minima_. in this set up , @xmath151 evaluated at a minimum corresponds to the cosmological constant . since the observations have revealed that the cosmological constant is always positive definite , the search is then restricted to minima with @xmath156 . it is easy to see that in our case if @xmath157 and @xmath158 then by defining @xmath159 we have that @xmath160 and @xmath161 . in particular this implies that the mean number of minima points where @xmath162 are bound to be equal to the mean number of minima points where @xmath151 is negative due to symmetry reasons . so we can expect that the number of positive minima will be half of the negative ones . the only question that we can ask is what can be said about the variance of this number . the results of this analysis are reported in figure  [ fig : variancepositivemaxima ] . similarly to the variance of positive roots , we see that the variance is slowly increasing with the degree and it is also slowly converging with the size  of  the  sample .          for multivariate random potentials , an important physical quantity is the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix evaulated at the real stationary points . the distribution of the eigenvalues of random multivariate potentials is well studied in theoretical and statistical physics . it is shown that in certain cases the distribution follows wigner s semicircle law . here , for the univariate random potential case , we want to analyze the distribution of the evaluations of @xmath163 on the real roots . due to the very high oscillations of the value of @xmath163 given the high degree of the polynomials , we were able to easily analyze only the case of degree @xmath115 . we decided to numerically estimate the distribution of @xmath164 instead of estimating @xmath163 to obtain a much more meaningful plot . the expermiental results obtained for @xmath165 are reported in figures  [ fig : cauchy_density_fpp ] and [ fig : gauss_density_fpp ] . .45   on the real roots of @xmath151.,title=\"fig : \" ]    .45   on the real roots of @xmath151.,title=\"fig : \" ]", "finding roots of high - degree univariate polynomials with coefficients chosen from particular random distributions , though a very important task that is related to advances in many different areas of science , mathematics and engineering , is a highly nontrivial task . though there are several numerical root - finding methods available , the numerical approximates found by these methods may turn out to be in the linear or even worse in the chaotic convergence region of the nearby exact root . in this work , we attempted to find certified roots of such high - degree univariate polynomials . in particular , we used two different certification methods to certify if the numerical approximates are within the quadratic convergence region , namely based on smale s @xmath0-theory , a local method , and gerschgorin s theorem , a global method . we first find all the potential numerical approximates of a univariate polynomial using traditional methods such as the companion matrix method as implemented in matlab s roots ( ) command , or the multiprecision method implemented in mpsolve . then , we certify if the numerical approximates are certifiable in the above mentioned sense , using both the certification methods via alphacertified and mpsolve . we compared these methods based on the local conditioning constant @xmath122 from @xmath0-theory with @xmath123 arising from gerschgorin s theorem . in our experiment , the average of @xmath122 increases exponentially with the degree whereas @xmath123 increases polynomially in the degree . one advantage of smale s @xmath0-theory is that it is a local method . that is , it can be performed using data computed at one point . this allows for a quite independent and self - contained analysis of the method . on the other hand , relying on universal , worst - case methods often causes the bounds to grow very fast . global methods , which are based on the minimum distance between the roots , can alleviate the fast growth at the expense of computing all of the roots . we emphasize that , given a high - degree polynomial , multiprecision computations may be needed to perform the computations . this is also true in cases where only floating point output ( @xmath113 digits ) is desired but , due to the ill - conditioning of the problem , an intermediate algorithm implemented in multiprecision might be able to obtain all the @xmath113 digits .      1 .   the available theoretical results are easily verifiable experimentally , as we have shown , for example , in figure  [ fig : cauchy_gauss_mean ] for the expected value for the number of real roots ; 2 . there is some additional difficulties in the theoretical analysis of cauchy random polynomials given by the fact that the cauchy distribution does not have moments of any finite order , e.g. , it is not possible to apply maslova s theorem , but experimental results show that the variance of the number of real roots has a behaviour compatible with the maslova s estimate . d. bshouty and a. lyzzaik , _ problems and conjectures for planar harmonic mappings : in the proceedings of the icm2010 satellite conference : international workshop on harmonic and quasiconformal mappings ( hqm2010 ) _ , special issue in : j. analysis 18 ( 2010 ) , 69 -

dependent acceleration theories or rigidity - dependent escape models .    in the region above the knee , the fly s eye experiment has reported a changing composition from a heavy mix around @xmath0ev to a proton dominated flux around @xmath5ev @xcite . this result makes this particular energy region much more interesting than the expectation from a naive rigidity model . this changing composition may imply that there may be multiple sources of cosmic rays . the agasa experiment shows broad agreement with this trend if the data are interpreted using the same hadronic interaction model as used in the fly s eye analysis @xcite . the recently reported hires / mia@xcite hybrid observation on the cosmic ray composition in a narrower energy region , @xmath6 ev , shows a general agreement with fly s eye experimental result . the new result gives a somewhat more rapid change in the composition . the reliability of these experimental results depends on how well we understand the development of all components of extensive air showers ( eas ) produced by cosmic rays , how well we understand the response of our detector to the eas , and how well we have done in the eas reconstruction . in this paper , we address all those issues in detail . we start with a general description of the techniques of cosmic ray composition measurement in the high energy region . the fly s eye and agasa experiments use different techniques to study composition . the fly s eye experiment technique is based on the assumption that the speed of the development of eas depends on the mass of the primary particle : a heavier nucleus induces earlier eas development in the atmosphere . the rapid break - up of a heavy nucleus at the early stage of the cascade in the air leads to an effectively higher multiplicity than that produced by a light nucleus or a proton at the same depth in the atmosphere . the consequence is that the eas is built up by a superposition of smaller subshowers induced by nuclear fragments . in this case , since the subshowers have lower energies , the eas will have a shower maximum higher in the atmosphere than in the case for a proton primary . the fly s eye experiment is designed to measure the size , or total number of charged particles , of an eas as a function of atmospheric depth . it is thus an ideal detector to measure the depth of maxima of showers directly .    in practice , the intrinsic fluctuations in the depth of shower maximum and the detector resolution effects imply that one can not directly resolve the type of primary nucleus on an event by event basis . what one can do is to extract an average eas primary composition by comparing the data to a monte carlo simulation with a given primary composition . since the shower development is somewhat dependent on the choice of a hadronic model , this method leads to results which have some model dependence . the other method for studying composition depends on the assumption that the muon content of eas produced by a superposition of sub - showers ( as in the case of heavy nuclei ) is larger than those with fewer sub - showers . this is due to the fact that the dissociation of a heavy nucleus produces a relatively higher multiplicity in its interaction with atmospheric nuclei . the resultant sharing of the primary energy between the nuclear fragments make the secondary pions less energetic . as a consequence , those pions have a greater decay probability into muons than those produced by a lighter nucleus in the early stage of shower development . this leads to a difference in the muon content between the eas s induced by heavier and lighter nuclei , e.g. iron and protons . this difference shrinks with energy because the available path for the decay of the high energy pions decreases as the shower develops deeper in the atmosphere . according to the simulations the difference is still resolvable in the energy region 10@xmath7 @xmath8 10@xmath9 ev .    in principle , one can obtain the information about the composition of the primary particle by either measuring the total number of muons in eas or a local density of shower muons at a specific distance to the core of the shower . however , as in the case of the previous method , the fluctuations are large compared with the separation between the different types of eas , so that the resolvability is not strong . the hadronic model dependence of the predicted @xmath10-content from a particular composition is also significant for this method . the hires / mia hybrid experiment is designed to combine the two methods together using two independently developed co - sited experiments . the two experiments share a trigger to simultaneously record both the longitudinal development information and the eas muon density . this results in a unique data set useful for the investigation of cosmic ray composition . results on comparison of the flourescence and muon methods have previously been published@xcite . in this paper , we use the mia array to improve the geometrical reconstruction and concentrate on the fluorescence technique for composition and spectrum studies . the hybrid timing information enhances the accuracy in the determination of the geometry of the eas . this accurate shower geometry plays a crucial role in the subtraction of the cerenkov light component of the eas and in the corrections for detector acceptance . these turn out to be the two key issues in the shower longitudinal development profile determination . this profile provides directly the size at shower maximum and its location while the integral of the profile yields the shower energy . the improvement in shower geometry determination is the main advantage of a hybrid experiment . the other advantage resulting from the coincident measurement with the surface muon array is the existence of a fully efficient triggering region in the central detector volume . this is very helpful for the cosmic ray energy spectrum measurement . one of the challenges for this experiment is that the two devices are separated by only 3.3 km . because the mia detector can not be triggered by remote showers , most of the triggered events are located @xmath8 4 km away from hires detector . this short shower - detector distance gives rise to difficulties for reconstruction of those eas s . the lateral distribution of shower electrons is no longer a negligible effect . the broadened source of light increases the uncertainty in the shower geometry determination and in the acceptance correction of the signals . the limited effective trigger area of mia largely suppresses the aperture of hires detector . the energy coverage of our data is one decade of magnitude over 3 years of observation , much smaller than that from the fly s eye experiment . the geometry of the triggered events is such that the fraction of cerenkov light is often large . this implies the need for tight criteria for event selection to reduce cerenkov contamination , which in turn may cause a bias . we must search for a balance between the tightness of the selection criteria and the minimization of bias . we describe our resolution of these problems in the following sections .", "in this experiment , we use a hybrid detector consisting of the prototype high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) air fluorescence detector and the michigan muon array ( mia ) . the detectors are located in the western desert of utah , usa at @xmath11 and @xmath12 . the hires detector is situated atop little granite mountain at a vertical atmospheric depth of @xmath13 g/@xmath14 . it overlooks the casa - mia arrays some 3.4 km to the northeast . the surface arrays are some 150 m below the fluorescence detector at an atmospheric depth of 870 g/@xmath14 . the hires prototype has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite . it views the night sky with an array of 14 optical reflecting telescopes . they image the eas as it progresses through the detection volume from 3@xmath15 to 70@xmath15 in elevation , 64@xmath15 in azimuthal angle at the top and 32@xmath15 at the bottom of the field of view . nitrogen fluorescence light ( in the 300400 nm band ) is emitted at an atmospheric depth @xmath16 in proportion to the number of charged particles in the eas at that depth , @xmath17 . the triggered tube directions and the time of arrival of light signals can be used to determine the shower - detector - plane and the tilt angle of the shower in this plane , denoted by @xmath18 . part of the shower development profile ( at least 250 g/@xmath14 long ) can be mapped by measuring the light flux arriving at the detector . assuming @xmath17 to be the gaisser - hillas  @xcite shower developement function and correcting for cerenkov light contamination and atmospheric scattering effects one can measure the primary particle energy @xmath19 , and the depth , @xmath20 , at which the shower reaches maximum size@xcite . the mia detector  @xcite , consisting of 16 patches formed with 64 scintillation counters each , covers about @xmath21 m with the active area over 2500 m@xmath22 . the patches are buried about 3 m under the surface . the data acquisition system records the identity and firing time of each counter participating in a given event . the eas muon arrival times are measured with a precision of 4 ns and all hits occurring within 4 @xmath23 of the system trigger are recorded . the average efficiency of mia counters for detecting minimum ionizing particles was @xmath24 when they were buried , and the average threshold energy for vertical muons is about 850 mev . the mia detector determines the muon density via the number and pattern of hit counters observed in the shower @xcite . the hires detector collects data on clear moonless nights . a focal plane camera , consisting of 16@xmath2516 photo - multiplier - tubes ( pmt ) , is triggered if two of its 4@xmath254 `` sub - clusters '' contain at least 3 fired tubes(two of them must be physically adjacent ) in a 25 @xmath10s interval . tubes trigger if the signal generates a voltage greater than a threshold , set at approximately 4 @xmath26 above nightsky background noise . this yields a mirror trigger rate of about 30 to 120 per minute . once a trigger is formed , hires sends a xenon light flash to mia as a confirming trigger for a coincident event . mia has a 100% duty cycle and a trigger rate of about 1.5hz formed by requiring at least 6 patches fired ( with at least 3 hits found in each patch ) . however , a coincident event is not selected until either it is confirmed by a hires light flash communication signal if it is received within 50@xmath10s , or the event triggers casa ( a surface scintillation detector array for eas electron observation@xcite ) simultaneously and is coincident with a hires event within @xmath273 ms according to the gps clocks in each site . more details about the trigger formation and coincident event matching can be found in @xcite .    during the lifetime of this hybrid experiment between aug . 23 , 1993 and may . 24 , 1996 the total coincident exposure time was 2878 hours corresponding to a duty cycle of 11.9% . 4034 coincident events were recorded . for events passing a set of coincidence assurance cuts the shower trajectory , including arrival direction and core location for each event , was obtained in an iterative procedure using the information from both hires and mia @xcite . 2491 events survive this reconstruction procedure . further cuts are performed in order to maintain high resolutions in energy and shower maximum which are essential to the composition analysis . the criteria are based on a thorough monte carlo simulation of the detectors as described below . after quality cuts , 891 events are employed in this composition study and energy spectrum measurement . accurate knowledge of the shower geometry is important in the reconstruction of the shower profile in the atmosphere . the first step is to use the pointing directions of triggered pixels in the hires detector to determine the shower - detector - plane . this is a simple linear fit weighted by the amount of light received by each tube . the shower - detector - plane is determined quite precisely because the hires detector records showers with an average of 36 triggered pixels and the quality cut ensures that the lengths of tracks is longer than 20@xmath15 . the typical error in the horizontal position of the plane is about 0.1@xmath15 , while the error in the tilt angle of the plane is somewhat larger . the overall error in the shower - detector - plane normal direction is about 0.7@xmath15 . muon timing information from mia plays a key role in the determination of geometric parameters in the shower - detector - plane , including the shower - detector distance and shower orientation , and in the improvement of the shower - detector - plane determination . the initial trial shower arrival direction is determined by fitting the muon arrival time with a flat shower front . projecting this direction onto the shower - detector - plane yields the tilt angle of the shower , @xmath18 , defined as the angle between the shower axis and the horizon in the shower - detector - plane . once @xmath18 is known , the light arrival time , t@xmath28 , on the @xmath29-th fired hires tube is fit to the timing formula @xmath30 in which @xmath31 refers to the elevation angle of the @xmath29-th fired tube . @xmath32 and @xmath33 are two parameters indicating the time as the shower front passes the detector and the perpendicular distance from the shower axis to the detector respectively , while @xmath34 refers to the speed of light ( see the sketch in fig.[sketch ] ) .    the core location can be derived by using the shower - detector - plane normal vector , @xmath18 and @xmath33 . the shower front shape can now be more accurately represented as a cone with the delay parameter @xmath35 , where @xmath36 refers to the delay of a conical muon front relative to the original flat front at a perpendicular distance , @xmath37 , to the shower axis . this procedure is iterated after additional corrections , including correction to the shower - detector - plane direction . this iteration stops when the difference between the core parameters is less than 10 m . the details of this iterative procedure can be found in @xcite . the distributions of those parameters are shown in fig.[rp_dis ] and fig.[core_dis ] . the hires tube signal , consisting mainly of the fluorescence light produced by charged particles from the shower , can be used to reconstruct the shower development , i.e. to calculate the shower size at the corresponding depth in the atmosphere . for this purpose , the raw tube signal must be corrected for several effects . if a triggered tube has a center that is not exactly in the shower - detector plane , its signal requires correction for a number of effects . these include the finite transverse width of the shower due to multiple scattering of shower electrons , the finite size of the optical spot on the face of the focal plane camera , the response function of the pmt cathode , gaps between the pixels , and the effective light collecting area of mirrors . all these effects can be taken into account by performing a `` ray tracing '' procedure , namely we trace the photons from the source direction , which can be wider than a line source due to the lateral distribution of shower electrons , all the way down to the face of the pmt via the spherical mirror surface . the response function of the pmt cathode is folded into the ray tracing . the pixel signals are then re - organized into a series of longitudinal `` bin signals '' with a 1@xmath15 bin size along the shower axis . the signals are recalculated in units of `` number of photon - electrons per unit angle along the track per unit collecting mirror area '' . @xcite provides the details of this correction and binning procedure for interested readers . the fluorescence light yield ( photons per meter ) of a single charged particle varies slightly with the atmospheric pressure and temperature and has an energy dependence given by the de / dx energy loss curve@xcite . these effects are taken into account in our shower reconstruction . the energy dependence of the fluorescence light yield is folded in by taking an average over the shower electrons at age @xmath38 , defined as @xmath39 , with an energy distribution of the shower electrons at age @xmath38 being extracted from the simulation results using the corsika package@xcite . this energy distribution is consistent with measurements by richardson @xcite and a parameterization from hillas @xcite . in addition to the corrections associated with those issues , the cerenkov light component of the bin signal must be subtracted as well , because only the pure fluorescence light is proportional to the size of shower at a given depth . this gives rise to some complications . first of all , the cerenkov light component is composed of the cerenkov light produced by the shower electrons directly illuminating the detector and the light scattered into the direction of the detector . because the cerenkov light is very forward along the direction of the electrons , the angular distribution of cerenkov light in a shower is narrowly beamed and falls exponentially with the angular distance from the shower axis . the average angular scale has been measured to be @xmath40@xcite . therefore , when the shower points towards the detector , the estimate of the cerenkov light becomes very sensitive to the geometry of shower . in this case , the signal is also dominated by direct cerenkov light . we avoid this sort of events in this analysis by a cut on the minimal viewing angle from the detector to the track , illustrated as the angle @xmath41 in fig.[sketch ] . the scattered cerenkov light , which we still have to deal with , includes components due to the rayleigh scattering from the atmospheric molecules and mie scattering from aerosols . rayleigh scattering is well understood in terms of the distribution of scattering centers and their fluctuations , angular distribution of light , frequency response and the overall extinction length for ultraviolet ( uv ) light . this scattering is used to estimate the attenuation of cerenkov light along the shower , how much of this light is scattered into the pmt direction , and the attenuation of the light during the propagation from the source to the detector . the scattering of uv light by aerosols is more uncertain . the distribution of aerosols depends on weather conditions . because of the variation in the size distribution of aerosols , the scattering phase function can vary . there are several models for this function which lead to different estimates of the amount of scattered light . we use the `` standard desert aerosol model '' with an exponential increase of the aerosol extinction length with height above a mixing layer of height @xmath42 below which the aerosol extinction length is constant . the change in extinction length with height above this is governed by a `` scale height '' parameter @xmath43 while below @xmath42 , the extinction length is given by the `` horizontal attenuation length '' , @xmath44 . we monitor the aerosol variation by the use of several xenon flashers which shoot light pulses at different angles into the atmosphere at different distances to the detector . by detecting the scattered light from these flashers with the hires detector , we monitor the variation of aerosols@xcite and partially constrain the range of those parameters . this will be discussed further in sec . iv .    after subtracting the cerenkov light components , the bin signals , now proportional to the size of the shower , are fit to a function describing the longitudinal development of eas suggested by gaisser and hillas@xcite , ( g - h function ) : @xmath45 in which @xmath46 and @xmath47 refer to the size of the shower and its maximum , @xmath16 represents the atmospheric depth where the shower front passes the specific angular bin , and @xmath48 and @xmath20 the depths where the shower starts and reaches its maximum , respectively . the depth @xmath16 is calculated based on the shower geometric parameters and the pointing directions of each effective angular bin . the choice of this eas longitudinal development curve has recently been experimentally confirmed @xcite as accurate based on the same data set . the g - h function is one of the best parameterizations of longitudinal development according to this study . an example of shower reconstruction is shown in fig.[example ] . in a ) , the four components of light contributing to the best fit results are plotted : fluorescence light ( thick solid line ) , direct cerenkov light ( thin solid line ) , cerenkov light from rayleigh scattering(dotted line ) and cerenkov light through aerosol scattering ( dashed line ) . in b ) , we show the fit of the sum of all the components to the bin signals(dots ) . this shower reaches its maximum size of 1.6@xmath2510@xmath49 at a depth of 630 g/@xmath14 . note that the parameter @xmath48 is the point at which size @xmath50 according to ( [ ghfunc ] ) . we are not sensitive to light from early shower development and we fix @xmath48 at -20 g/@xmath14 in our fitting procedure . the justification for this will be given below . once we know the longitudinal development profile of an eas , we can integrate over its depth to calculate the total path length of all shower charged particles and calculate the total deposited energy @xmath51 by the charged particles in this shower , i.e. , @xmath52 where the critical energy and the radiation length of electrons in air are @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . a recent study@xcite based on the monte carlo simulation package corsika verifies this formula and re - evaluates the constant @xmath55 as 2.19 . since some of the primary energy is carried away by neutrinos and muons penetrating the ground , a correction for this effect must be applied . in that study , the authors establish a new empirical formula for the converting @xmath51 into total energy of the shower , @xmath56 . it reads @xmath57 where the parameter @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . these parameters are determined by taking an average between proton and iron initiated showers , since it is impossible to know the primary particle mass in advance of the reconstruction . this causes a systematic uncertainty in @xmath56 of less than 10% . the energy distribution of our data set is displayed in fig.[e_dis ] . the vertical axis represents the number of events within a bin of @xmath61e . the figure shows that the threshold of our detector is about 5@xmath2510@xmath62 ev . the hybrid detector approaches a fully efficient operation above 4@xmath2510@xmath7 ev .", "in order to test this complex eas reconstruction procedure and evaluate the resolution in shower geometry , shower depth of maximum and energy based on this reconstruction scheme , we have developed a monte carlo code to simulate the eas shower and detector . we have made this as realistic as possible both for shower development in the atmosphere and for the response of our detector to the shower . in this section , we will address how this event generator is driven with a full monte carlo simulation of eas , how the production and propagation of light through the atmosphere is treated , how the acceptance and response of the detector to the light is simulated , and what the final resolution functions and their relationship with the event quality cuts are . the driver of the shower simulation is a series of parameterizations of the results from a full eas simulation using the corsika package@xcite . this is one of the most modern and complete simulation codes for eas development . it traces shower particles from very high energy at top of the atmosphere down to the threshold energy of 100 kev . a `` thinning '' technique is used in the simulation to reduce the size of the calculation . only one secondary particle is traced if the interaction energy falls below the thinning threshold , e.g. 10@xmath63 of the shower total energy . a weight is assigned to this traced particle to represent those not being traced . depending on the degree of realism in the fluctuations that is required , the user can set an appropriate thinning threshold if the cpu time limit allows . another advantage of the corsika code is that the user can switch between several optional hadronic interaction models . the authors have made efforts to test the program for primary particle energies up to 10@xmath62 ev , but do not claim reliability for energies higher than 10@xmath7 ev . however , it is one of the best eas models currently available . low energy shower particles , down to the tens of kev level , are treated carefully by employing the well known egs package @xcite etc .    in our simulation with corsika ver . 5.624 , the thinning threshold is set to be 10@xmath63 of the shower energy and the qgsjet@xcite and sibyll@xcite hadronic interaction models are selected . the number of eas electrons as a function of depth and eas muon information , including arrival direction , time and energy for every muon above 870/cos@xmath41 mev at 870 g/@xmath14 , are recorded . we simulated 500 events for each of the 5@xmath254 grid points in energy from 3@xmath2510@xmath62 ev to 5@xmath2510@xmath9 ev and zenith angle from 0@xmath15 to 60@xmath15 . the same number of events were generated for proton and iron induced showers and under different hadronic interaction model assumptions . based on this large simulated event data set , we parameterized all the distributions of eas parameters such as the first interaction depth @xmath64 , shower decay constant @xmath65 , shower maximum @xmath47 , its position in depth @xmath20 , and the correlations between them . as an example , the @xmath20-distribution is shown in fig.[xm_mc_dis ] . it is clear that the proton induced showers possess larger fluctuation in @xmath20 than iron initiated ones . though they overlap each other , the means for each distribution are about 100 gm/@xmath14 apart , which is resolvable if sufficient statistics are available . the model dependence appears to be significant , but is smaller than the proton - iron separation . the comparison between the histogram for simulated data and curves for parametrized results shows that the parameterization faithfully represents the fluctuation in @xmath20 . a similar situation is found for the other parameters . among the parameters , we find that @xmath65 and @xmath47 are correlated and we put this correlation into our generator . we find that the parameter @xmath48 is quite insensitive to the type of primary particle and energy if we use the g - h function ( [ ghfunc ] ) to fit the longitudinal development of simulated showers . the fitting quality remains quite good by fixing it at a value of -20 g/@xmath14 . the other parameter @xmath65 is found to have a slow variation with energy and mass of the primary particle , with a central value of 70g/@xmath14 . we fix both at the values suggested here in our reconstruction procedure for real events . one of the benefits of fixing those relatively insensitive parameters is to reduces the chances of the parameter search being trapped at a local minimum of @xmath66 . once the shower parameters are determined as a function of energy , the number of electrons can be calculated by using the g - h function ( [ ghfunc ] ) at depth @xmath16 . the electrons are distributed laterally according to the nkg function at corresponding age @xmath38 of the shower . the fluorescence and cerenkov light and the corresponding signal appearing at the hires detector can then be generated . the simulation of muons in an eas is much more complex . the dependence on both zenith angle and energy is important since the observation is done at a fixed altitude . in order to simulate the mia trigger correctly , we generate the muon density , @xmath67 at a distance @xmath68 to the core according to the muon lateral distribution . @xmath67 and its fluctuation behavior are parameterized based on simulations . the muon density generated based on our parameterization is plotted in the fig.[muon ] a ) . as a comparison , the agasa muon lateral density function(ldf)@xcite and the griesen ldf are plotted in the same figure . our simulation agrees with the agasa ldf well except in the small core distance area in which our simulation is closer to the griesen function . the arrival time of the eas muon is essential in the simulation for mia triggering . we parameterize the distribution of arrival time for each muon in the shower disk within different annular rings at a distance @xmath68 from the core , and at all zenith angles and energies in the grid mentioned above . the shape of the arrival time distribution changes quite rapidly with @xmath68 as can be seen in fig.[muon]c ) . note the vertical scales are different for the different cases . we use a single function @xmath69 to describe all these distributions . the parameters @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are tabulated as functions of @xmath68 , energy and zenith angle . the parameters are generated with due regard to correlations if they exist and the muon arrival time are generated individually depending on how many muons are generated at @xmath68 and for a specific direction . the median time for muons generated in an annular ring at @xmath68 reveals the curvature of the shower front . in figure b ) , we plot two examples at zenith angle @xmath73 and @xmath74 . the small differences between proton and iron induced showers are also shown in the figure . the lines represent the results directly from corsika simulation and the dots are from our proton shower generator . once the shower is generated by the corsika based driver , fluorescence and cerenkov light contributions are calculated for each 0.04@xmath15 angular bin along the axis of the shower . cerenkov light generated in the previous bins is accumulated taking account of the attenuation between the bins due to the scattering of the light on atmospheric molecules and aerosols . the propagation and attenuation of light through the air and acceptance of the light by the detector are simulated in detail . the effective area and reflectivity of the mirror , filter transmission on the face of the focal plane camera , quantum efficiency of the pmt cathode , the gain of pmt and all electronics triggering and charge integration are realistically simulated . the variation of all these effects with wavelength is considered by tracking the light in 16 different uv wavelength bands covering from 300 to 400 nm . finally , the simulated signal in each pixel is built up by summing all the angular bins involved and the 16 wavelength bands . the night sky background light is also added to the signal according to results of an on site measurement@xcite . the trigger time slewing ( i.e. late triggering for small pulses ) is also taken into account for the hires sample - and - hold electronics . the mia signal is generated by sampling the number of muons for each counter at the perpendicular distance @xmath68 to the shower axis , then run over all muons in each counter to generate the arrival time for each of them . the pulse from a given counter is built up by passing all the muon signals through the electronics sequentially . dead counters , counter efficiencies , trigger formation , time windows for accepting counter hits and noise muons are taken into account in the simulation . both the hires and mia signals are written in the same format as for the real data . 8000 proton and 4000 iron induced showers are generated with a spectrum of trial energies from @xmath75 to @xmath76ev . the differential spectral index is set as -3.0 . all the simulated events are passed through the same reconstruction procedure as real data and all geometrical and shower development parameters are determined . events must pass the  quality cuts \" defined below . we compare the overall distributions from the simulated events with data . this is plotted in fig.[rp_dis],[core_dis],[e_dis ] . the solid(open ) squares represent the showers induced by protons(iron nuclei ) in those figures . the consistency between the data and simulation builds up our confidence in the simulation , and hence in the resolution functions we now present . since we know the input parameters for every event , we can study the detector response and the corresponding resolution function on an event by event basis . in fig.[resolutions ] , the resolution functions in shower arrival direction , core location , energy and @xmath20 are plotted for iron induced showers . in a ) , we plot the distribution of the `` opening angle '' between the `` real '' shower axis vector given by the input shower and the `` reconstructed '' shower axis vector which is determined by using of the timing information from both hires and mia . similarly in b ) , we plot the distribution of the distance between the input shower core and the reconstructed core position . those two geometrical resolution functions peak at zero but the long tails imply that some events are measured poorly . we now move to a more quantitative discussion of parts c ) and d ) in the figure , the resolution functions in energy of primary particle and shower maximum depth , respectively . these are the most important results for the energy spectrum measurement and the composition study described in this paper . the better the geometrical parameters of a shower are determined , the better the shower development profile can be extracted . of all geometrical parameters , the shower - detector - plane is the most crucial and depends strongly on how many tubes are triggered and how long the track formed by those tubes is . the number of muons detected by mia is the other contributor to precise time fitting . in order to locate the shower maximum , it and a good fraction of the rest of the profile must bee seen by the detector . moreover , as mentioned before , we must avoid those events which are dominated by cerenkov light . poorly fitted events should also be rejected . the set of quality cuts listed in table.[cut_tab ] addresses these issues . .event criteria . @xmath77(@xmath78 ) refers to the depth of the highest(lowest ) section of the shower track seen by the detector . @xmath79 is the estimated error in @xmath20 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      as mentioned in the introduction , the distribution of @xmath20 can be used with the help of monte carlo simulations to extract an average composition of primary cosmic rays . the results depend on the hadronic interaction model , the eas simulation model and resolution of the detector in energy and @xmath20 . in this paper , we compare data to the predictions of two hadronic models : qgsjet and sibyll . other , lower multiplicity models have been shown to be inconsistent with any normal composition of cosmic rays .    according to the simulation , the average @xmath20 for showers induced by protons is separated from the average for iron by about 100 g/@xmath14 and this separation is almost independent of energy in the range from 10@xmath7ev to 10@xmath9ev . since the resolution of the detector is 44g/@xmath14 , we can tell if the data is closer to one than the other . the absolute position of @xmath81 for a given composition assumption is model dependent ( about 25 g/@xmath14 shift ) . at any given energy , a measurement of @xmath81 implies a particular composition which is thus systematically uncertain . on the other hand , an apparent departure of the data points from either of the predictions based on proton or iron showers as a function of energy will reveal information on the change in the composition of cosmic rays . the rate of this change can be much more reliably determined than the absolute composition itself . the variation of the separation between the measured and simulated pure composition @xmath20 can be quantitatively evaluated using the so called `` elongation rate '' . based on models , it is found that the average @xmath20 increases with energy logarithmically over the energy range of interest . the `` elongation rate '' is symbolized by @xmath70 in this paper and defined by @xmath82 it is remarkable that the elongation rates are almost the same for proton and iron induced showers and nearly independent of the interaction models . they are @xmath83g/@xmath14 per decade of energy for proton showers and @xmath84g/@xmath14 per decade of energy for iron showers according to the qgsjet model . any other values for e.r . observed from the data will indicate a change in composition . an important issue associated with measuring the elongation rate is possible existence of a bias caused by tight cuts . to test this , we compare the average @xmath20 as a function of energy using the simulated events . one set of data is based on all the corsika sampled events and the other is based only on those that trigger the detector , are able to be reconstructed and pass the tight cut criteria . as shown in fig.[er ] , no matter what interaction model is used , we do not see any bias using the cuts set in the table.[cut_tab ] . the thin lines in the figure show the sampled events and the circles and the squares show the reconstructed results ( see the figure legends for details ) . the hires / mia experimental data as shown in the fig.[er ] demonstrates an unambiguous change in average @xmath20 with energy . this indicates a change towards a lighter mix of nuclei in the average composition from @xmath0 to @xmath1ev . this indication of change in composition can be evaluated by using the elongate rate measured in the experiment , i.e. @xmath85 where the number in parentheses represents the systematic error discussed below . in comparison with the predicted number for a unchanging or pure composition mentioned above , the difference is larger than any known uncertainties . the uncertainty in predicted elongation rate due to hadronic model dependence is small . we can estimate the change of the composition in the form of the average logarithm of atomic number of the primary nuclei , @xmath86 , as @xmath87 over the energy range covered by the data . this number is quite model independent assuming equal elongation rate for all different pure compositions . the systematic uncertainty in @xmath70 is included here . the absolute value of @xmath88 is strongly model dependent as implied by fig.[er ] . uncertainties in @xmath20 come both from choice of theoretical models and detector resolution . we first look into the uncertainty in the predictions . in fig.[er ] , the average difference in @xmath20 at any given energy between the predictions based on qgsjet and sibyll models is about 25g/@xmath14 . both are compatible with the data and both lead to the same qualitative conclusion of a lightening in the composition . however , the value of the average @xmath89 at any given energy is model dependent .    from the experimental point view , we have made a detailed effort to understand the systematic error in shower @xmath20 and energy . for @xmath20 , we have considered systematic errors in the atmospheric transmission of light and in the production of cerenkov light . these are related since scattered cerenkov light can masquerade as fluorescence light if not accounted for properly . for atmospheric scattering , there is uncertainty in the aerosol concentration and its vertical distribution . the uncertainty , equivalent to one standard deviation with respect to the mean , is expressed as a range of possible horizontal extinction lengths for aerosol scattering at 350 nm ( taken as 11 km to 17 km based on measurements using xenon flashers , @xcite ) and a range of scale heights for the vertical distribution of aerosol density above the mixing layer ( taken as 0.6 km to 1.8 km ) . for cerenkov light production , we have varied the angular scale for the cerenkov emission angle over a one standard deviation equivalent . at ground level , we take the distribution as an exponential function of the angle from the shower axis , with a scale of @xmath40@xcite . those uncertainties are shown by the shaded area in fig.[er ] .    the systematic error in the energy is about 25% and comes from fluorescence efficiency uncertainty@xcite , detector calibration uncertainty@xcite and the atmospheric corrections@xcite . the first two are intrinsically independent of the primary particle energy over this range . the fluorescence efficiency has been measured with an error of 10% . the percentage atmospheric corrections are also independent of energy because the sample of showers is restricted to core locations within 2 km of the mia detector center . therefore there is no significant atmospheric path length difference between an eas and the detector for different energies . an energy independent systematic fractional error in energy has no effect on the measured elongation rate . the magnitude of the systematic error in energy due to atmospheric attenuation can be estimated by varying the atmospheric parameters over the range described above . it is not greater than 10% . the detector calibration systematics is less than 5% .      in fig.[xm_mc_dis ] , we can see that the fluctuations about the average @xmath20 for simulated proton showers is larger than that for iron showers . the fluctuations for both proton and iron induced showers are too large to allow us to distinguish one from the other on an event by event basis . however , we can determine the gross properties of the composition statistically . in fig.[xm_dis ] we plot the predicted distributions of @xmath20 for proton and iron showers together with dotted and dashed lines , respectively . the detector response has been folded into those distributions . by studying those distributions in different energy ranges as shown in the figure , one can compare the data to pure proton and pure iron composition distributions . the data clearly requires a mixed composition of light and heavy particles to account for the width and peak value of the @xmath20 distribution . the cosmic ray energy spectrum measured by all modern experiments are summarized in the fig.[spe_all ] covering the whole energy range from @xmath90 to @xmath91 ev . the consistency between this experiment and the fly s eye stereo data has been discussed previously . we have shown the marginal confirmation of the break in the spectrum at @xmath92 ev there . by comparing with the observations @xcite in the `` knee '' region , we see that both the intensity and spectrum index imply a good continuity from the results at energy lower than @xmath93 ev . we especially note that the change in cosmic ray intensity around @xmath92 ev is comparable in power law index with the change that occurs around the `` knee '' . a confirmation of this break with better statistics and similar energy resolution is important . all the other experimental results are consistent with the akeno result : the spectrum follows a single index power law between @xmath94 and @xmath0 ev . the only existing experimental result based on direct measurements of shower longitudinal development is that from fly s eye experiment . as a successor of that experiment , the hires / mia experimental result qualitatively supports old fly s eye s result , i.e. there exists a trend in the composition of cosmic rays to a lighter mix with energy . quantitatively , they are consistent with each other , taking into account the systematic errors in the original fly s eye result of about 25 gm/@xmath14 on individual @xmath20 measurements . the elongation rate measured in hires / mia experiment is marginally larger than that in fly s eye@xcite which is @xmath95g/@xmath14/decade where the quoted error is statistical only . we should also note that experimentally measured elongation rates are not corrected for acceptance . differences in acceptance for two experiments could introduce differences in elongation rates . the safest method is to compare each experiment to its own simulated proton and iron data sets . the conclusion on the composition of cosmic rays based on this kind of comparison is meaningful because the detector effects are counted in exactly the same way for both real and simulated events . for the present experiment , based on our simulation , we believe that the detector biases for the elongation rate are minimal . in summary , when all the errors are taken into account , the results on @xmath20 distribution and elongation rates , from the two experiments are consistent , in spite of the differences in the analysis . the other existing result on elongation rate in the same energy range is from the yakutsk experiment@xcite . the systematic error is not provided and the method using a ground array experiment is more indirect than the present experiment . nevertheless , the results are marginally in agreement with the result reported here . there are several measurements of elongation rate at lower energies , between @xmath3 and few @xmath94 ev . these results and ours are shown in fig.[er_all ] together . the trend of a changing cosmic ray composition shows a pattern correlated with breaks in the energy spectrum . it can be characterized qualitatively as follows . there is a rather clear break around @xmath96 ev which is related to the `` knee '' in the energy spectrum . this break seems to be confirmed by several experiments @xcite . the elongation rate shows an increasingly heavy composition around this knee . above @xmath92 ev , the composition changes to a lighter mix . it seems to be correlated to the spectral break observed by fly s eye experiment which is marginally confirmed by this experiment . those experiments imply a relatively unchanging region between @xmath94 and @xmath0 ev but no measurements of elongation rate exist between @xmath97 and @xmath0 ev .", "the hires / mia hybrid experiment has measured the cosmic ray energy spectrum between @xmath0 and @xmath91 . the spectral index and intensity are given in table.[spectab ] . the result is in agreement with the fly s eye experiment . this result marginally supports the fly s eye stereo observation of a break in the energy spectrum at @xmath2 ev . the hires / mia hybrid experiment confirms the fly s eye experimental result that the elongation rate is different from simulation with an unchanging composition . modern hadronic interaction models and improved detector resolution in energy and @xmath20 do not change the original conclusion . within errors , the elongation rate observed in this experiment , @xmath98g/@xmath14/decade , is consistent with previous experiments , such as fly s eye and yakutsk@xcite . while the conclusion regarding the absolute value of @xmath88 of the primary composition depends on the interaction model used , this study shows that the elongation rate is stable with respect to choice of models . in the light of this , the amount of the change in the average composition , i.e. @xmath99 , is largely model independent , no matter what value of @xmath88 the change starts from .    putting all experimental results together from @xmath90 to @xmath91 ev , we note that there seems to be a correlated patterns in the energy spectrum and elongation rate , @xmath20 vs. energy , plot . both measurements in energy spectrum and @xmath20 imply a continuity from lower to higher energies , with a flat bridge between @xmath94 and @xmath0 ev . we note that following the break , the fly s eye experiment @xcite reports a hardening of the spectrum near @xmath76 ev . this has been interpreted as evidence for the emergence of an extragalactic component above a softer galactic component @xcite . a change from a heavy to a light composition in this energy region also gives support to a changing origin for those cosmic rays . the lack of a strong galactic anisotropy at the highest energies would also rule out galactic sources for energetic protons @xcite . a number of new experiments , such as hires , the pierre auger project , the telescope array , euso and owl will address this issue .", "we acknowledge the assistance of the command

rich nuclei with the radioactive isotope beam . such as , the scientists discovered @xmath8 new neutron - rich nuclei on radioactive isotope beam factory in 2010  @xcite . one of the important issue in nuclear physics is to understand the nuclei from the stability line to the drip line . thanks to the extensive experimental and theoretical study on the properties of proton- and neutron - rich nuclei in recent years , the position of the drip line is known up to oxygen isotopes  @xcite .    in a theoretical view , how to solve the nuclear system is a long standing big challenge . the common theoretical methods are roughly divided into three categories : the _ ab initio _ methods , the methods based on the mean field approximation , and the nuclear shell model  @xcite . the nuclear shell model solves the many - body schrodinger equation in a truncated model space . the modern nuclear shell model includes the configuration mixing and the residue interactions . the binding energies and the wave functions of both the ground and excited states can be given simultaneously after the diagonalization process . the observed binding energies , levels , electromagnetic properties , @xmath9 decays , and many other properties can be well describe through shell model approach in light and medium mass region  @xcite .    for light nuclei in @xmath5 region , some well determined shell - model hamiltonians are constructed by fitting to the observed binding energies and levels , such as mk  @xcite , wbt and wbp  @xcite . the fitting procedure of these hamiltonians is limited in the @xmath10 model space and considers the strength of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 parts of the interaction . the two - nucleon excitation from @xmath0 to @xmath1 shell and the corresponding @xmath6 interaction are not included in the construction of the hamiltonians . recently , a new hamiltonian for @xmath5 shell , ysox , is introduced  @xcite . ysox well describes the binding energies , levels , electromagnetic properties , and gamow - teller transitions of boron , carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen isotopes  @xcite . the construction of the ysox includes the consideration of the @xmath6 interaction , which allows an investigation on the two - nucleon excitation from the @xmath0 to @xmath1 shell . the percentage of the @xmath4 configuration dramatically decreases from @xmath14o to @xmath15o , which indicates its importance in the description of nuclei from the stability line to the drip line  @xcite . it is easy to understand such changes on the isospin degree of freedom . the main configuration @xmath14o fully occupies the @xmath0 shell in the independent particle model ( ipm ) . after the inclusion of the residue interaction , the ground state of @xmath14o shows strong mixing between the @xmath16 and @xmath4 configurations . actually , the higher @xmath17 configuration is also important for the exactly description of @xmath14o  @xcite . from @xmath14o to @xmath15o , the valence neutrons in @xmath1 shell increase . the mixing between the @xmath16 and @xmath4 configurations contribute less in the total energies . the two - nucleon excitation shows its effect on the degree of freedom of excitation energy . in @xmath18b and @xmath19c , levels of some excited states are strongly affected by the strength of the @xmath6 interaction , but others are almost independent on that interaction . the present work investigate how and why the @xmath4 configuration influence the levels in @xmath2c and @xmath3c in the frame work of shell model .", "modern shell model includes the residue two - body interactions and treats the states of nuclei as the configuration mixing of all possible states . in principle , the energies and wave functions can be obtained through solving the schrodinger equation . but for the majority of nuclei with many protons and neutrons , the model space is too huge . one can limit the cost of the calculations by selecting a core , normally a doubly magic nuclei . the model space is then reduced to several valence proton and neutron orbits . the energies and wave functions can be obtained by solving the schrodinger equation in the truncated model space . because the model space is reduced to the effective model space , a corresponding effective hamiltonian is needed to be used when solving the schrodinger equation . effective hamiltonian is normally derived from nucleon - nucleon potential in two ways , one is phenomenological by fitting the nucleon - nucleon potential to the experimental binding energies and energy levels , the other is realistic by using nucleon - nucleon potential derived from the pion - nucleon scattering and the nucleon - nucleon scattering data .    in this paper , the effective model space is @xmath5 space , and corresponding effective hamiltonians are mk  @xcite , wbt  @xcite , wbp  @xcite , and recently suggested ysox  @xcite . these phenomenological hamiltonians fit their two - body matrix elements ( tbme ) to the nuclear structure data , especially the binding energies and energy levels . shell - model calculations are forwarded through the programme oxbash  @xcite . the new hamiltonian for @xmath5 region ysox  @xcite is developed from @xmath20  @xcite , sfo  @xcite and sdpf - m  @xcite . the @xmath21 and @xmath22 parts of tbme are from sfo and sdpf - m , respectively . the @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) tbme are calculated through @xmath20  @xcite plus m3y  @xcite spin - orbit force as follows , @xmath25 the @xmath26 is the original @xmath20 . in the present study , we reduce the central force in tbme in @xmath23 and @xmath27 by factors @xmath28 and @xmath29 from the original @xmath20 , respectively . more details can be found in ref .", "the percentage of @xmath4 configuration changes in each isotope when neutron number increasing , such as , from @xmath30 in @xmath14o to @xmath31 in @xmath15o  @xcite . it may also change from ground to excited states . @xcite discussed the effect of the @xmath6 interaction on the energy levels of @xmath18b and @xmath19c . the @xmath6 interaction is the interaction between @xmath7 and @xmath4 configuration . if the excited state has the similar @xmath4 configuration to the ground state , the strength of @xmath6 interaction rarely affect the excitation energy , and vice versa . but both in @xmath18b and @xmath19c , the excitation energies of some states changes a lot when the strength of @xmath6 interaction changes . such results indicate the percentage of @xmath4 configuration in these excited states are different from those of the ground states . it is interesting to see that some low lying states in @xmath18b has relatively large @xmath4 configuration . although the valence nucleons of @xmath18b are mainly active in the @xmath0 shell , the @xmath32 state has @xmath33 @xmath4 configuration , around @xmath31 larger than that of the ground state . the previous investigations show that the mixing of @xmath7 and @xmath4 configuration is important in the description of both ground and excited states in both stable and exotic nuclei . the present work aims to extend the knowledge on the effect of the two - nucleon excitation from @xmath0 shell to @xmath1 shell . [ 12c ] and  [ 14c ] present the levels of @xmath2c and @xmath3c as the function of the strength of the @xmath6 interaction . as discussed before , if the excited states have similar @xmath4 configuration to the ground state , the excitation energies do not change much when the @xmath6 interaction changes . in fig . [ 12c ] , it is seen that the levels of @xmath2c changes little as the @xmath6 interaction increasing or decreasing . but for @xmath3c , the excitation energies of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 states are dramatically dependent on the @xmath6 interaction .    to further investigate the @xmath4 configuration in different states of @xmath2c and @xmath3c , the percentage of both @xmath7 and @xmath4 configuration are presented in fig .  [ per ] it is clear seen that the @xmath4 configuration is almost the same in each states of @xmath2c , but very different in those of @xmath3c . the valence nucleons of @xmath2c are mostly excited inside @xmath0 shell . the two - nucleon excitation from @xmath0 to @xmath1 shell is around @xmath31 in each state and does not change the level of @xmath2c much . in @xmath3c , the most important configuration for ground state is @xmath37 . the @xmath38 is mainly excited by one protons moving to @xmath39 orbit , which does not increase or decrease the @xmath4 configuration compared with that of ground state . but for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , they are mainly excited by moving two neutrons to @xmath1 shell , rather than two protons to @xmath39 orbit . the @xmath4 configuration becomes the most important configuration ( @xmath40 ) . the @xmath36 is all contributed by @xmath4 configuration . because the two proton holes in @xmath0 shell can not couple to the angular momentum @xmath41 .    as a results of the @xmath4 configuration in each state , the levels are affected by the @xmath6 interaction . when the strength of the @xmath6 interaction is increasing , the ground state , @xmath38 , and @xmath32 states are more binding because of the @xmath4 configuration around @xmath42 . but for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 states , they are ( almost ) purely @xmath4 configuration . therefor their binding energies are rarely dependent on the strength of the @xmath6 interaction , resulting a changing level relative to ground state .", "the present work discuss the two - nucleon excitation from @xmath0 to @xmath1 shell in light nuclei based on the framework of shell model . the @xmath4 configuration is important in the investigation of binding energy in a long isotope chain and in the different states in one nucleus . the relationship between the strength of the @xmath6 interaction and the levels of @xmath2c and @xmath3c are researched through hamiltonian ysox . it is shown that the strength of the @xmath6 interaction is very influential to the levels of states with different @xmath4 configuration from that of the ground state . the strength of such interaction linked the @xmath7 and @xmath4 configuration is rarely investigated because its effect is not obvious in the levels of many nuclei . it is interesting to further find the nuclei of which the level is sensitive to the strength of the @xmath6 interaction , which is helpful for the understanding how the nuclear force driving the nuclear structure .", "the author acknowledge to the useful suggestions from furong xu , takaharu otsuka , and toshio suzuki .      thoennessen m and sherrill b. nature , 2011 , * 473*:25 . thoennessen m. at data nucl data tabl , 2012 , * 98*:43 . brown b a. prog part nucl phys , 2001 , * 47*:517 . caurier e , martnez - pinedo g , nowacki f , poves a , and zuker a p. rev mod phys , 2005 , * 77*:427 . millener d j and kurath d. nucl phys a , 1975 , * 255*:315 . warburton e k and brown b a. phys rev c , 1992 , * 46*:923 . yuan c x , suzuki t , otsuka t , xu f r , and tsunoda n. phys rev c , 2012 , * 85*:064324 . brown b a , etchegoyan a , and rae w d m. oxbash , the oxford , buenos - aires , michigan state , shell model program , msu cyclotron laboratory report no . 524 , 1986 . suzuki t , fujimoto r , and otsuka t. phys rev c , 2003 , * 67*:044302 . utsuno y , otsuka t , mizusaki t , and honma m. phys rev c , 1999 , * 60*:054315 . otsuka t , suzuki t , honma m , utsuno y , tsunoda n , tsukiyama k , and hjorth - jensen m. phys rev lett , 2010 , * 104*:012501 . bertsch g , borysowicz j , mcmanus h , and love w g , nucl phys a * 284*:399 ."], "summary": "the effect of the two - nucleon excitation from @xmath0 to @xmath1 shell is discussed in @xmath2c and @xmath3c in the frame work of shell model . the recently suggested shell - model hamiltonian ysox provides an suitable tool to investigate the @xmath4 excitation in @xmath5 region . because the strength of the @xmath6 interaction , which represents the interaction between the @xmath7 and @xmath4 configurations , is considered in the construction of the ysox the level of @xmath2c is almost independent on the @xmath6 interaction , but excitation energies of certain states in @xmath3c are strongly affected by it . further investigation shows that the percentage of @xmath4 configuration in these states is quite different from that of the ground state .    nuclear shell model , @xmath5 model space , hamiltonian ysox , @xmath4 configuration .", "ranking": [3, 1, 2, 0, 4]}

dimensional information with phase and amplitude of the propagating wave [ 1,2 ] . this makes it possible to retrieve the wavefront of original propagating wave by illuminating the hologram with reconstructing wave . however , in digital holography , the holography has difficulty in the recording and reconstructing processes of the hologram image because of high spatial frequency of the fringe pattern [ 3 - 5 ] . the hologram is the interference fringe of the recording wave and the object wave , and therefore , for retrieving the hologram image with sufficient viewing angle the spatial frequency gets to the extent of the wavelength of the light field .    in holographic display , the hologram is sampled with sampling frequency of the device with pixel structure to avoid aliasing effects [ 6,7 ] . present modulator encoding hologram fringe has much lower resolution than the required specification . now , the limitation of the spatial frequency due to the device performance obstructs widening view angle of the hologram image , although the holographic display can reconstruct the image to the display size . for the realization of holographic display , solving the problem of widening viewing angle is essential . current researches for improving the viewing zone have been carried out through temporal and spatial multiplexing of the spatial light modulators [ 8 - 10 ] . multiplexing method of the hologram effectively enhances the viewing angle of the reconstructed image , whereas the large space - bandwidth product is still required . since only the high - definition resolution of the real image is sufficient , the use of the massive hologram data for generating holographic high -

axis hologram illuminating by a tilted plane wave , @xmath0 is expressed as the product of a hologram component , @xmath1 $ ] and the illuminating wave . @xmath2 \\exp(j k_{0 } x \\sin \\theta)\\ ] ]    when the plane wave with unit amplitude is used in recording the on -

axis hologram made by the recording plane wave , @xmath0 , where the coaxial reconstruction wave is assumed . equation ( 2 ) can be also rewritten by varying together incidence angle values of the recording and reconstructing plane waves in the off - axis hologram . in a view of the carrier frequency holography , the on - axis hologram fringe is unique because it has a constant form as the modulating signal irrespective of the spatial carrier . therefore , in two cases of the on - axis holography by an inclined plane wave and the off - axis holography , there is only the variation of the carrier frequency . @xmath6    figure 1 depicts the reconstruction by illuminating the on - axis hologram with the plane wave at an incidence angle , @xmath7 . here , we notice only the real image from the complex amplitude modulation in order to clarify our analysis . the viewing angle of the image by the coaxial plane wave is determined by means of the spatial frequency of the fringe pattern . since the local spatial frequency is given by @xmath8 , the viewing angle , @xmath9 is double the size of @xmath10 . the higher spatial frequency leads the wider viewing angle of the image . in the tilted plane wave , since the exponential term of a carrier frequency generates the deflected beam of the retrieved image , the viewing zone of the object image changes to new @xmath11 region in fig . we find that the tilted plane wave plays a role in a modulated carrier similar to a carrier signal of the off - axis holography , which makes the diffractive wave propagating to new optical axis direction . in the sampled hologram , the viewing zone of the reconstructed image has a limitation because it has the bandlimit signal to the nyquist frequency to avoid the aliasing effect [ 11 ] . but , the viewing zone variation of the object image by a tilted plane wave is irrespective of the aliasing in principle . this case is different from the aliasing arising in sampling the modulated carrier signal to the hologram . here , the modulating hologram signal of the object is already recorded in the sampled hologram , and only the inclined reconstruction wave related to the carrier signal is illuminated . thus , by controlling the incidence angle of the reconstruction wave for the on - axis sampled hologram , we can get the reconstruction effect of the off - axis holography making a new viewing zone . let us investigate the change in the reconstructed image of the hologram transparency , @xmath12 by a tilted plane wave . the complex field of the image in the fresnel propagation is developed as the convolution of the input field , @xmath13 g(x , y)$ ] and the spatial impulse response , @xmath14 $ ] . @xmath15 \\int\\!\\!\\!\\int \\exp[jk_{0 } ( x ' \\sin \\theta + y ' \\sin \\varphi ) ] g(x',y ' ) \\nonumber\\\\ \\times \\exp \\left[-j \\frac{k_{0}}{2z_{0 } } ( x'^2 + y'^2 ) \\right ] \\exp \\left[j \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda z_{0 } } ( xx ' + yy ' ) \\right ] dx ' dy'\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the integral part can be calculated from the convolution operation of two fourier transforms of the product term of the hologram and the plane wave and the quadratic phase term . @xmath16 \\ast h(f_{x},f_{y})\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is the transfer function in the fresnel diffraction . @xmath18    by inserting eq . ( 6 ) into eq . ( 4 ) , above equation is the angular spectrum representation of the field propagation in the fresnel diffraction . if we substitute the variables , @xmath19 by @xmath20 and @xmath21 by @xmath22 and rearrange the equation , it becomes the expression for the complex field of the object shifted to the transversal axis . @xmath23    the tilted plane wave causes the image reconstructed at the shifted position to the transversal axis . this analysis is applicable to the arbitrary incidence angle of the tilted plane wave , because the diffraction beam to retrieve an image can be regarded as the paraxial propagation along the new diffraction optical - axis . figure 2(a ) shows two - dimensional plane image vertical to optical axis retrieved at the shifted position by an inclined plane wave to @xmath24-axis . we find that in a plane object , new viewing angle of the image is generated , because only the lateral position of the reconstructed image is shifted without distortion of the object shape . however , in a three - dimensional object , a change of an image shape occurs . the three - dimensional object image can be calculated at various @xmath25 values . @xmath26    the amount of shifted value to transversal axis depends on the @xmath25 value , which invokes an image deformation along the depth direction . the retrieved image of the hologram composed of the point sources in @xmath24-@xmath25 plane is illustrated in fig . 2(b ) . the point image is obtained from the simple convolution expression about one - point hologram [ 12 ] . @xmath27   \\ast h(x , y;z_{0 } ) \\nonumber\\\\ \\sim \\int\\!\\!\\!\\int \\exp \\left\\{j \\frac{k_{0}}{z_{0 } } \\left [ ( x+z_{0 } \\sin \\theta)x '    + yy ' \\right ] \\right\\ } dx ' dy ' \\sim \\delta(x+z_{0 } \\sin \\theta , y)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for convenience , the coefficient of each term shall drop . the first line of above equation is also presented as the reconstruction of the off - axis hologram as like @xmath28 \\right\\ } \\ast h(x , y;z_{0})$ ] . the real image appears as the delta function . if @xmath29 is written by @xmath30 , the point image moves to @xmath31 amount at @xmath24 axis . four real images are reconstructed at following locations , where the interval between two points in the axial direction is put to be @xmath32 . @xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the values , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . as shown in fig . 2(b ) , shearing transformation arises along @xmath24-axis . the image deformation by a tilted reconstruction plane wave , @xmath13 $ ] is described in terms of affine transformation . @xmath38    we find that the reconstruction plane wave incident on at a different angle from that of the recording process definitely induces the deformation of a retrieved image , which holds for both on - axis and off - axis holograms . although the plane object image makes a new viewing zone in terms of an inclined plane wave , three - dimensional image does not form new entire view in the fresnel hologram . that is , at a viewing direction observer sees the projection scene of reconstruction image by coaxial plane wave with respect to vertical plane of deflection axis , but deformed image shape . figure 3 illustrates the reconstruction process for the fourier hologram by a tilted plane wave . the hologram plane is placed in the front focal plane of the convex lens of focal length , @xmath39 . the field distribution of the image in the vicinity of the back focal plane , @xmath40 is obtained from below equation [ 13,14 ] . @xmath41 g(x',y ' ) \\nonumber\\\\ \\times \\exp \\left(-j\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda } \\left [ \\frac{(x'^2 + y'^2 ) \\delta z}{2f^2 }   - \\frac{(xx ' + yy')}{f } \\right ] \\right ) dx ' dy'\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath42=@xmath39-@xmath40 indicates the image depth distribution . from the similar interpretation of eqs . ( 4)-(7 ) in the fresnel hologram , we can get the expression for the complex field of the object image shifted to the transversal axis . @xmath43    here , the shift quantity to the transversal axis has a constant value as @xmath44 or @xmath45 irrespective of the image depth , and thus , as different from the fresnel hologram , the image deformation does not occur along the viewing direction . the tilted plane wave does not change the shape of the reconstructed image and only moves the image to lateral position , as depicted in fig . 3 . therefore , the inclined plane wave can vary effectively the viewing angle of some object image reconstructed optically as a function of the incidence angle in the fourier hologram . we clearly confirm that the perspective of the object image changes according to the propagation direction of diffracted beams . considering the virtual image formation with opposite view of the real image , it is apparent that even the hologram with extremely low spatial - frequency shall retrieve the whole view of the object image optically in a transparent object . this is possible because the hologram has entire information of three - dimensional object .", "the pixel structure of spatial light modulator sampling the hologram data generates high - order diffracted beams . the diffracted beams propagate in the direction at an angle with respect to the optical @xmath25-axis . we investigate the possibility of widening viewing angle by collecting high - order diffracted beams . figure 4 illustrates the schematic diagram of obtaining the wide viewing angle of the holographic image on the basis of our deduction . high - order diffraction beams are collected through the fourier lens and new hologram fringe is imaged on the image plane through one - lens imaging system [ 15 ] . for convenience , only the first - order beam along the @xmath24-axis is displayed . the complex field of the reconstructed image of the fourier hologram is obtained from eq . we consider the normally incident plane wave with unit amplitude . @xmath46 \\right ) d\\xi d\\eta\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 is the sampled fourier hologram by rectangular pixels in fig . 5 , which has the pixel interval @xmath48 and the pixel size @xmath49 in the @xmath50-direction , and @xmath51 , @xmath52 in the @xmath53-direction . @xmath54\\ ] ]    where rect ( ) is a rectangular function . above complex field of eq .

( 17 ) , the transformed image is the dirac combo function . when the hologram data is encoded in pixel array , the hologram image is generated . the size of the pixel array is 200@xmath73200 and the interval of the pixels , @xmath74 is set to be 4 @xmath75 m . the number of subpixels is put to be ten , and then , the total resolution of the device encoding the sampled hologram becomes to be 2000@xmath732000 . as shown in fig . 8 , we prepared the sampled fourier hologram with 200@xmath73200 resolution , based on in eq . the object as ` holo ' letter placed at different depth , @xmath42 is used . the hologram was synthesized at a focal length of 0.1 m by using the recording plane wave with wavelength of 632.8 nm . here , the border between pixels is one subpixel with 0.4 @xmath75 m thickness and the pixel size , @xmath76 becomes 3.6 @xmath75 m . the hologram data is recorded in the 200@xmath73200 corresponding pixel array . that is , the hologram data within a single pixel of the device has the same value . figure 9 is the numerically reconstructed image by using above sampled hologram . for convenience , the complex modulation is considered . we find that high - order reconstructed images generate , whose intensity varies according to the envelope of the sinc function . the ten high - order images up to fifth order are displayed in figure . figure 9(b ) shows the central cross - section spectrum along the @xmath24-axis . as discussed in fig . 6 , there is a misalignment between high - order images and the envelope of the sinc function . the mismatch of high - order images can be improved by using the hologram made by adding the phase - shift component . it is desirable that the zeroth order image is placed in the half main lobe of sinc function . here , half spatial bandwidth of the zeroth order diffraction is available . the board portion between pixels also causes the mismatch of the images . the envelope of the sinc function and the image spectrum are placed with period of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively . the ratio of the pixel size , @xmath76 to the pixel interval , @xmath74 determines the number of images in one lobe of the sinc function . we confirmed that the number of images increases with decreasing the ratio . in above pixel structure , since the ratio is 90% , there appears the mismatch of up to 10% per one order image . for well matching , the pixel size should be designed very close to the pixel interval . high - order images in fig . 9 have the same plane picture , which is consistent with interpretation of section 2 . that is , diffraction beams only move the images to the transverse axis without their deformation . in order to investigate the object view of high - order images , the object image should be numerically reconstructed in the direction of the optical diffraction axis . as expressed in eq . ( 20 ) , since each high - order image is the reconstructed one by an inclined plane wave , each order image is obtained from the coordinate transformation to the new @xmath79-@xmath80 optical axes [ 10,16 ] , in fig . 10 . @xmath81)\\ ] ]    where    @xmath82    the images reconstructed in the several diffraction directions are appeared in figure 11 . the tilted angle is determined by diffraction order , where for visualization , large diffraction angle was adopted . the numerical simulation is carried out for each diffraction order independently , where the interpolation operation is applied [ 16,17 ] . we used the fourier hologram made by two object letters with different depth , @xmath832 mm with respect to a focal length . the reconstructed image is shrunk in the @xmath79-axis direction , which is because the reconstructed images can be regarded as the projection images to the tilted plane . we find that especially the object view varies according to the diffraction order , as depicted in fig . however , in the fresnel hologram we confirmed that the object view is deformed as described previously . the variation of the viewing angle shall be clarified by the numerical simulation of three - dimensional object . finally , we can extend the viewing zone angle of the reconstructed image by collecting diffraction beams to the image plane . for this method , all of diffraction beams should have the same intensity to form the uniformly extended viewing - zone . the spatial filter placed on the focal plane is one of methods for adjusting each beam intensity and controlling unwanted beams . furthermore , the spectrum intensity of a particular order can be arbitrarily controlled by the design of the diffracting grating . therefore , the realization of this holographic display depends on the design of the pixel structure sampling the hologram data .", "the fourier hologram makes it possible to retrieve three - dimensional image with other perspective by a tilted plane wave . in the sampled fourier hologram with pixel structure , the viewing zone angle of the reconstructed image is effectively increased only by collecting high - order diffraction beams with different viewing direction . the design of the pixel structure creating high - order diffraction beams uniformly distributed is important for this holographic display . further study for making various types of diffraction beams is required . this becomes one of the methods for overcoming the low spatial frequency making the narrow viewing angle . d. gabor ,  a new microscopic principle , \" nature @xmath84 , 777 -

2012 lhc data . for higgs particle beyond 600 gev or so , one enters the strong @xmath22 scattering domain , and the  higgs \" becomes a broad object  @xcite , which requires both high energy ( 14 tev ) and high luminosity to explore . for such a heavy higgs boson , if the @xmath2 or @xmath3 quarks were however found below 500550 gev or so , then the yukawa sector may not be strongly coupled enough to link with the strongly coupled  higgs sector \" . thus , we have in mind the scenario where neither the ( sm - like ) higgs boson , nor the 4 g quarks , are found below 600 gev and 500550 gev , respectively . it is important to remember that new @xmath25 violating phases associated with 4 g quarks may link to  @xcite the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) . thus , the existence of a very heavy 4 g may touch both ewsb and bau , which are two of the greatest problems in particle physics . this provides strong motivation for continuing the pursuit of 4 g in this volatile time . if the higgs boson is heavy ( and  fat \" ) , while the 4 g quarks are above the ub , then whether the large yukawa coupling induces @xmath23 condensation  @xcite or not , it would be important to explore possible _ bound states _ of this strong coupling . this is not just about potentially interesting lhc phenomenology , but may be necessary to provide a guide for the search of ultraheavy chiral quarks beyond ub . the main purpose of this paper is to explore lower lying bound states of strong yukawa coupling , and the associated properties . however , by venturing above the ub , one immediately encounters the perils of the breaking down of perturbation theory . thus , in lieu of genuine nonperturbative approaches , such as  @xcite lattice field theory ( lft ) , our work is only of an illustrative kind . one aid to the study is a new , heavy isospin . if 4 g quarks exist , by which we mean a sequential left - handed doublet and a pair of right - handed singlets under the weak interaction , the @xmath26 , @xmath27 variables  @xcite or electroweak precision tests ( ewprt ) require the @xmath2 and @xmath3 to be nearly degenerate ( and here , independently , a heavier higgs is also required  @xcite ) . of course , some small splitting is needed to satisfy @xmath27 , but in this paper we will treat the @xmath2 and @xmath3 as degenerate , hence one has a new  isospin \" . this isospin , in contrast to the chiral limit of @xmath28 and @xmath29 quarks under qcd , is in the opposite limit of degenerate _ we thus borrow the notation of isovector @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 $ ] ) and isoscalar @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( or @xmath35 ) etc . , for the heavy @xmath36  mesons \" . as we will see , unlike technicolor , the  @xmath31 \" meson does not play a major role for yukawa bound states , nor does the @xmath33 . another interesting point is that , if the yukawa interaction is the dominant binding mechanism , since it is color blind , the @xmath36 mesons , unlike the qcd situation , come not only in color singlets , but color octets as well  @xcite . we find the states @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath10 and @xmath39 , where the subscript indicates the color representation , to be of phenomenological interest . in particular , @xmath37 and @xmath10 may be accessible in the near future .    in sec . ii , we bring forth the issues of strongly coupled relativistic bound states . we contrast the necessarily relativistic @xmath40 coupling of weak nambu  goldstone boson ( ng ) , or longitudinal vector boson exchange , to the coulombic qcd bound state , as well as scalar exchange . because the higgs scalar should be treated as heavy now , its effect is less prominent than ng exchange . we compare the traditional relativistic expansion  @xcite with a relativistic bethe - salpeter approach  @xcite , and illustrate why the yukawa bound state involves highly relativistic motion of its constituents . an issue appears regarding the treatment of @xmath41-channel ng exchange , towards strong yukawa binding . this , plus other issues , forces us to compromise in the study of the possible spectrum at this stage , and we restrict ourselves to @xmath42 in the range of 500700 gev , i.e. not far above the ub . in this way , the relativistic expansion provides a partial guide , while we offer a peek beyond and consider binding energies of order @xmath43 gev or more , for the possible spectrum around and above the tev scale . this leads us to focus on , from the production point of view , an @xmath37 state ( effectively a  @xmath44 \" , or gluon -

like chiral quarks to make sense . but in reality , crossing the ub just implies that the yukawa couplings are becoming so strong , they are turning nonperturbative . we have seen how the remarkable theory of qcd turns nonperturbative in the infrared , resulting in the rich phenomena of hadrons . we will not dwell on deeper short - distance ( uv ) gauge theories like technicolor , but just take the large yukawa couplings  @xcite at face value : if chiral quarks @xmath47 ( a left - handed doublet of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in our case ) exist at or above the ub , what could be the emergent phenomena ? consider first heavy quarkonia bound by qcd . since qcd is perturbative at short distance , we have the familiar coulombic bound states with a @xmath48 enhancement factor , where @xmath49 is the velocity . this is the domain of non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) , where one expands in velocity , which is of order @xmath50 . the nr nature makes good contact with the familiar atomic systems . exchanging higgs bosons brings in the yukawa couplings , which has been considered in the literature . for our case , we will treat the higgs boson as above  @xcite 600 gev and heavy , which suppresses the binding effect due to higgs exchange . however , ng or longitudinal vector boson exchange ( transverse gauge boson exchange has coupling constant @xmath51 or @xmath52 , hence subdominant and largely ignored by us ) also couples with the yukawa coupling strength , but it involves the @xmath40 , which couples the upper and lower components of the massive dirac quark . since the lower component vanishes when the heavy quark is at rest , ng exchange is suppressed in the nr limit . conversely , the coupling to high momentum heavy quarks is large , the more so the heavier the quark . this reflects the derivative coupling nature of longitudinal vector bosons . the upshot is that , yukawa interactions between very heavy quarks are large when these quarks are in relativistic relative motion , i.e. with momentum @xmath53 .    with this insight , and ignoring the higgs exchange for the moment , if the bound state formation is dominated by qcd , then the nr nature of the bound state ( @xmath54 ) actually suppresses the effect of yukawa coupling . however , as the yukawa coupling increases with @xmath42 , although the qcd - bound system becomes even more nonrelativistic , at some point ng exchange would ( perhaps suddenly ) take over , and one would find the bound state system turns ultrarelativistic . we shall illustrate with two different perspectives , one a traditional relativistic expansion  @xcite , the other a relativistic bethe - salpeter approach  @xcite . a standard approach in considering bound state phenomena is to make a relativistic expansion around the leading potential . the higgs potential for very heavy quarks , in the context of forming bound states , was considered a long time ago  @xcite . the relativistic corrections were recently calculated in ref . the scattering amplitudes for @xmath17-channel higgs , neutral and charged ng ( called fictitious scalar in ref . @xcite ) , and gluon exchange , as well as @xmath41-channel ng exchange , were computed . @xcite , however , did not put in @xmath41-channel higgs and gluon exchange , even though both color singlet and octet @xmath23 configurations were discussed . touching both @xmath55 gev and @xmath56 cases , a variational approach was used to estimate the size @xmath57 ( equivalent to wavefunction ) and binding energy for @xmath58 , @xmath59 , color singlet and octet states . we will not repeat what was already done here , but just give some salient features . as a control on validity of the relativistic ( @xmath60 or @xmath61 ) expansion , the authors of ref . @xcite required @xmath62 ( @xmath63 is the relative momentum ) , which translates into @xmath64 . since @xmath17-channel gluon exchange gives the coulomb potential , it is clear that one has a coulombic qcd bound state when @xmath42 is not yet too large , with bohr radius @xmath65 . the low mass higgs case is no longer tenable with 4 g , both by direct search  @xcite , and indirectly  @xcite from ewprt due to the heaviness of 4 g quarks . for the heavy higgs case illustrated with @xmath56 , as one can see from fig . 8 of ref . @xcite , the radii @xmath57 of the @xmath38 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( the subscript @xmath68 stands for color singlet ) states decrease rather slowly below @xmath65 as @xmath42 increases . the @xmath39 radius rises slowly above @xmath65 due to the extra repulsion it receives from @xmath41-channel ng exchange . the yukawa effect is subdominant compared with qcd , where inspection of the binding energies offer further support : they rise slowly from @xmath69 gev around @xmath70 gev , to @xmath71 gev at @xmath72 gev , with @xmath39 only slightly lower . however , just before @xmath42 reaches 400 gev , radius @xmath57 for @xmath38 drops precipitously , while the binding energy rises sharply from around @xmath73 gev , to around @xmath43 gev at @xmath74 gev . the condition @xmath64 is violated shortly above @xmath75 gev .    the  kink \" around 400 gev is the point where the ng exchange has wrestled the mechanism for binding away from the usual nr qcd binding . the sudden drop of the size of the bound state is due to tapping the large attraction at large momentum @xmath76 for the bound quark ( besides the @xmath40 coupling of the ng bosons , the heavy higgs also defines a very short range for the strong yukawa coupling to be effective ) . the resulting larger binding energy overcomes the much increased kinetic energy . for @xmath66 , the onset is delayed until @xmath77 gev or so , with binding energy of @xmath78 gev at @xmath79 gev .    for color octet states , which are not bound by qcd , the binding energy for @xmath37 , due purely to yukawa coupling , turns on sharply around @xmath80 gev , rising to @xmath81 gev for @xmath79 gev . the @xmath82 state turns on much later , around @xmath83 gev . but , unlike @xmath39 , because there is no @xmath41-channel repulsion , @xmath10 is degenerate with @xmath37 . it should be noted that the yukawa effects of neutral and charged ng exchange is weaker but constructive for @xmath37 , while the converse is true for @xmath10 , so this degeneracy could be accidental . furthermore , this degeneracy should be lifted by @xmath41-channel gluon annihilation , which would raise @xmath84 but was not considered by the authors of ref .  @xcite . as we shall soon see , the vector channel also has @xmath26- and @xmath85-wave mixing .    although identifying the @xmath38 as the lightest color singlet , and @xmath37 ( and @xmath10 ) as the lightest color octet , it is ironic that the relativistic expansion breaks down almost immediately after the strong yukawa binding becomes potent . but it does illustrate that one needs a genuine relativistic approach in treating strong yukawa binding . we turn to such an approach that is in principle nonperturbative , but carrying its own dubious features : the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation . a long time ago , around the time the ssc ( superconducting super collider ) was under construction but then unfortunately canceled , the authors of ref . @xcite pursued the bs equation approach to the relativistic bound states of very heavy sequential 4th generation quarks . it consists of a ladder sum of the scattering amplitudes that appear in the relativistic expansion . in the heavy isospin limit and treating @xmath86 , a clear isospin reorganization separates into @xmath87 and @xmath88  mesons \" .    for @xmath36 meson with total momentum @xmath89 and relative momentum @xmath76 , one has a set of integral equations , with loop momentum @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the momentum exchange in @xmath17-channel . however , for @xmath41-channel annihilation contribution , the annihilation momentum is @xmath89 itself , and the integral over loop momentum @xmath90 carries no @xmath76 dependence , giving a possibly divergent constant . to remedy this , ref . @xcite took a fixed @xmath76 subtraction at @xmath92 . in this way , all the @xmath41-channel diagram contributions were eliminated from the bs equation . this includes even the @xmath41-channel gluon exchange for the octet , isosinglet vector channel , which was not considered in ref . @xcite , as the authors concerned themselves with color singlet states only .    in terms of mathematical physics , to set up integral equations to be solved in a self - consistent way , the subtraction at constant @xmath76 seems reasonable . however , as admitted by the authors of ref . @xcite in a footnote , the @xmath41-channel ng exchange leads to repulsion . thus , in discussing bound state solutions , there is the issue of the physical correspondence , and therefore the range of validity ( in @xmath42 ) for implementing the subtraction . in the relativistic expansion , one clearly would not drop the @xmath41-channel diagrams . our purpose here is not to make a full treatment of the bs equation , as it is only a ladder sum of @xmath17-channel exchange diagrams , with higher order corrections ignored . furthermore , while the bs equation is relativistic , its solution depends very much on the approximations and ansatz made . ref . @xcite illustrated with covariant gauge ( but employing a weak coupling relation between spatial and temporal spinor components ) , the instantaneous approximation with positive frequency potential only , as well as keeping both positive and negative frequency potentials . although the numerical solutions share common features , the bound state mass ( @xmath93 ) values differ . starting all from @xmath94 for low @xmath42 , they decrease smoothly as @xmath42 increases , without exhibiting the kink seen in the relativistic expansion . as such , the bs approach is an improvement . but , as a common feature , once the binding energy @xmath95 becomes significant ( e.g. @xmath43 gev or so ) , at high enough @xmath42 , the low lying mesons collapse . that is , the binding energy becomes so large such that the total mass drops to zero . ( solid ) and @xmath96 ( dashed ) potentials in eq . ( 1 ) for the @xmath39 state , for @xmath97 gev , and @xmath98 gev , plotted along @xmath99 . both vanish for @xmath92 , or zero relative motion , but go to rather large values for large @xmath76 , with @xmath96 turning on rather sharply for @xmath100 gev . , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    having bound state solutions numerically turning tachyonic for a strongly coupled system is not particularly astounding . for qcd ( and likewise for qed ) , quarkonium masses calculated at fixed order could also vanish at large enough coupling strength . the system has turned fully relativistic with strong coupling , and the familiar bohr - schrdinger solution is no longer valid . for the bs equation , however , it is already relativistic . the collapse of the meson state may be related to the symmetry breaking itself  @xcite , but because of the approximate nature of the bs equation , as well as the numerical approximations made in its solution , we refrain from dwelling further on this . rather , we wish to use the bs equation and its numerical study to compare and contrast with the previously discussed relativistic expansion , to project what may really happen for relativistic , strong yukawa bound states , before any  collapse \" , such as illustrated in ref . @xcite , could occur . for this purpose , we note that with the _ subtracted _ bs equation , hence with the @xmath41-channel repulsion removed , the @xmath39 turns out to be the most attractive system , i.e. the lightest bound state : the ng , gluon and higgs exchange are all attractive , as can be seen also from ref . the behavior for @xmath38 is indeed similar , but the formalism is more complicated for the @xmath101 system , where the @xmath26- and @xmath85-wave channels are coupled . note that ref . @xcite used ( sometimes tacitly ) a higgs mass around 100 gev , which is no longer valid . in our mind , we are interested in the bound state dominated by yukawa coupling , i.e. by ng exchange , hence we will view gluonic exchange as correction , with higgs exchange perhaps even milder . this matches to what one finds in the relativistic expansion , that the yukawa binding suddenly turns on , bringing on a rapid rise in binding energy . in effect , we use the bs equation approach to check , and probe beyond , the  kink \" seen in the relativistic expansion . the equation for @xmath39 is the most compact . in the impulse approximation , integrating over @xmath102 gives the amplitude @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the relative momentum . keeping both positive and negative frequency amplitudes @xmath105 , one has the coupled equations , @xmath106 , \\label{bspi1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the eigenvalue , and @xmath107 . the potentials @xmath108 , where we have absorbed a factor of @xmath109 into its definition as compared to ref . @xcite , arise from @xmath17-channel diagrams as described earlier . let us understand the @xmath110 and @xmath111 potentials . the less familiar one is @xmath111 , which couples @xmath112 to @xmath113 , while @xmath110 is  diagonal \" . in the limit that @xmath114 , one simply has @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is analogous to the expectation value of the potential ( @xmath117 is like @xmath118 ) of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics . on the other hand , if @xmath119 , then @xmath120 , hence the @xmath111 contribution is more suppressed than the corresponding @xmath110 contribution when it is weak . the potentials @xmath121 are symmetric in @xmath76 and @xmath90 , and is steepest along @xmath99 . we plot @xmath122 in fig . [ vpm ] , for heavy @xmath98 gev , and for @xmath75 , 500 , 600 , 700 gev . we have checked that the @xmath123 potential drops by a factor of two or more as @xmath124 moves from 100 to 700 gev , but @xmath96 is rather insensitive to @xmath124 . we see from fig . [ vpm ] that both the @xmath123 and @xmath96 potentials are suppressed for low relative momentum @xmath76 , agreeing with the relativistic expansion view . as @xmath76 increases , @xmath123 increases relatively slowly , reaching @xmath125 at @xmath126 ( 700 ) gev for @xmath74 ( 700 ) gev . but @xmath96 turns on more sharply , reaching beyond @xmath127 at @xmath128 gev , and @xmath129 at @xmath130 gev . so what does the strength of @xmath131 mean ? take the @xmath132 equation , the binding energy @xmath133 is equal to @xmath134 , the kinetic energy due to motion , plus the right hand side of eq . ( [ bspi1 ] ) , which should be the  potential \" . let us normalize @xmath90 by @xmath42 . since @xmath135 is steepest for @xmath99 , we see that @xmath136 for @xmath137 means the  potential \" is comparable to @xmath42 in strength when the momentum is comparable to the rest mass , and the kinetic energy due to motion is @xmath138 . we can now sense why there is a tendency for the @xmath39 state to collapse already for @xmath42 not far above 500 gev in the numerics of ref . @xcite . we have illustrated how the binding energy for the ( heavy ) isovector , color singlet @xmath140 state , which we call @xmath39 , could be already moving towards collapse for @xmath42 as low as 500 gev ( this number from ref . @xcite contains the attraction due to light higgs exchange ) , if the bs approach of eq . ( [ bspi1 ] ) holds true . however , this state receives a repulsive @xmath41-channel ng annihilation contribution . furthermore , as the tendency towards collapse approaches , the ladder sum bs equation may no longer be sufficient . even within the bs approach , where eq . ( [ bspi1 ] ) gives rise to the earliest collapse , if one drops the negative frequency amplitude , the collapse is delayed  @xcite by almost a factor of two in @xmath42 . in the covariant gauge but using a weak coupling relation between temporal and spatial spinor components , the collapse of @xmath39 occurs slightly before the positive frequency only case . it is not clear at what @xmath42 the collapse truly occurs numerically . in any case , we would not touch the collapse here , as it is not yet well understood . it seems prudent , then , to consider binding energies of @xmath43 to @xmath141 gev , but not more , to make a preliminary study of possible phenomena at lhc , running at @xmath142 tev .    a similar equation as eq . ( [ bspi1 ] ) holds for the isosinglet , color singlet @xmath140 state , the @xmath67 . although gluon and higgs exchange are attractive , ng exchange turns repulsive  @xcite . thus , @xmath67 is much heavier than @xmath39 , and can not be a low - lying state .    turning to vector mesons , ref . @xcite found , similar to the relativistic expansion of ref . @xcite , that the isoscalar @xmath38 has the tightest binding , though it is weaker than ( @xmath41-channel subtracted ) @xmath39 . this concurs with our earlier observation that yukawa effects are weaker but constructive for vector , while stronger but destructive for pseudoscalar . however , there is no repulsive @xmath41-channel effect for @xmath38 . on the other hand , checking the formalism , we find that there is @xmath143-@xmath144 mixing , resulting in a set of more complicated coupled bs equations . from the numerics of ref . @xcite , we expect that for @xmath42 in the range of 500700 gev , binding energies of order @xmath43 to @xmath141 gev is reasonable for @xmath38 . the @xmath66 state , analogous to @xmath67 in receiving the repulsive ng exchange , is far less binding , which is also seen from the relativistic expansion . turning to color octet counterparts , one can treat gluon exchange as a perturbation when binding energies are much large than qcd bound states . given that the bound state should be rather small , the repulsion due to gluon exchange should be larger than typical qcd binding . but without fully solving for the bound state , octet - singlet splitting is uncertain . however , there should be no doubt that @xmath10 and @xmath37 would be the low - lying octet states , in agreement with the relativistic expansion . the octet @xmath145 and @xmath82 are likely not ( or at best weakly ) bound , hence we do not consider these .    to summarize , the states to keep in mind are @xmath39 , @xmath38 , @xmath10 and @xmath37 . there are possibly other states with different quantum numbers , but in general they would not be lighter , while likely possessing more complicated properties . the absence of @xmath31 states is distinct from qcd - like gauge theories such as technicolor . for @xmath42 in the range of 500 to 700 gev , staying short of very tight binding , these states would probably populate the 1 to 1.4 tev range , with binding energies of order @xmath43 to @xmath141 gev . the ordering of the spectra , according to ref . @xcite ( which did not actually consider octet states ) , would be @xmath146 .    since we are concerned with lhc phenomenology and the heavy quark search program in the near future , we should consider briefly issues regarding production :    * @xmath39 and @xmath38 can not be produced via @xmath147 fusion , but can be produced via weak drell - yan processes , hence have a weak production cross section ; * @xmath10 can be pair produced by @xmath147 and @xmath7 scattering  @xcite , but it is heavier and less efficient at 7 tev . this leaves @xmath37 , which has the same quantum numbers as the gluon , that is the most attractive in the near future in terms of production cross section . it can not be produced by @xmath147 fusion , as two massless vectors can not forge a massive vector ( yang s theorem ) particle , hence the production is limited to @xmath7 fusion . in the next section , we turn to the production and decay properties of the @xmath37 meson . note that if an @xmath145 or @xmath67 state existed , such as for qcd binding , it could tap @xmath147 production  @xcite .", "in this section , we discuss the production and decay of the @xmath148 meson , which we have portrayed as the likely leading harbinger of 4 g bound - states in our scenario , where a very heavy quark _ isospin _ symmetry prevents the production of some mesons directly at hadron colliders .    for the numerical study of the production cross - sections and decay rates , the following parameters are needed as input : the decay constant @xmath149 , the 4 g quark masses @xmath150 ( we assume degeneracy of @xmath2 and @xmath3 as a simplifying approximation , hence an isospin symmetry ) , the mass of resonances , _ i.e. _ the binding energy of resonances , and finally the quark mixing elements @xmath151 . once the constituents as well as their interactions are fixed , the decay constant and binding energy are the consequence of the dynamics of the system . as we stressed previously , in the range of strong yukawa couplings we consider , their estimation has to be done by lft approach  @xcite for more quantitative understanding . however , such an endeavor is beyond the scope of this paper . instead we parameterize them in our phenomenological study . the decay constant of @xmath148 is defined through @xmath152 which we parameterize by a dimensionless parameter @xmath153 . the mass @xmath84 is the most important , as we discuss the production and decay of @xmath148 . we also assume @xmath154 is the dominant quark mixing element , and ignore mixings with lighter generations .     at hadron colliders.,width=113 ] the dominant production mechanism for @xmath148 is , as illustrated in fig . [ fig : prod ] , via @xmath155 annihilation . because one can not fuse two massless gluons into a massive vector boson , gluon - gluon fusion is not operative . we have also computed the higher order @xmath156 process as a check .    at the parton level , the total cross section is @xmath157 convolving with the parton luminosity @xmath158 we get the hadronic cross section , @xmath159 we plot on the left - hand side of fig . [ fig : pro ] the cross section for inclusive @xmath148 production at the lhc with @xmath160  tev . we use cteq6l  @xcite parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , and set the renormalization and factorization scales to @xmath161 . we use three values of @xmath162 , 0.03 and 0.01 for illustration . although we do not have any suggestive estimation for the decay constant , since the yukawa bound state is highly relativistic , we expect the larger ( smaller ) value of @xmath163 corresponds to a stronger ( weaker ) bound meson . we note that the decay constant divided by meson mass for usual @xmath31 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 are @xmath166 . however , we are not dealing with usual qcd - bound meson production  @xcite , so we leave @xmath163 as a parameter . the cross section is proportional to @xmath167 and decreases with increasing @xmath84 . because of our ignorance of the decay constant @xmath149 , the cross section @xmath168 ranges from pb to fb , for @xmath84 ranging from 900 to 1400 tev . the plot extends to 2 tev , since it depends only on @xmath163 , which we view should be experimentally determined . as the gluon density at the lhc is large , we have checked the higher order @xmath156 scattering process , and find the contributions to be quite small for the region of our interest , @xmath169  tev .    for comparison , we also plot the open @xmath23 pair production cross section at lo and nlo  @xcite , as a function of @xmath170 , matching ( approximately ) to @xmath171 on the same plot . the cross section should be multiplied by two to take into account the production of the degenerate 4 g doublet . in nlo calculation , we use cteq6 m pdfs  @xcite . to see the uncertainty of the cross section , as well as the size of nlo correction , we vary the scales in each calculation from @xmath172 to @xmath173 . the uncertainty for lo ( nlo ) prediction is expressed as the dotted ( hatched ) band .     at the lhc running at 7  tev ( left ) and 14  tev ( right ) for various @xmath153 values . the open @xmath23 cross sections at lo and nlo are also plotted for comparison.,width=306 ]    at the lhc running at 7  tev , the @xmath148 production cross section with @xmath174 is about the same order as twice the open @xmath175 production cross section in the lower mass region , but exceeds the latter in the higher mass region . on the other hand , when @xmath163 is smaller , the cross section could be well below the open production cross section . thus , @xmath148 production can be interesting if @xmath163 is sizable , such as of @xmath176 order . note that @xmath37 is produced through @xmath7 , while open @xmath23 is produced dominantly through @xmath147 fusion . we plot on the right - hand side of fig . [ fig : pro ] the @xmath148 cross section for lhc at @xmath177  tev , which is an order of magnitude larger than those for lhc at 7  tev . the open production cross section grows relatively larger than the @xmath148 production because of increase in gluon luminosities . the decay channels of @xmath148 we consider are    * annihilation decay : @xmath178 , @xmath179 ; @xmath180 , @xmath181 ; * free - quark decay : @xmath182 , @xmath183 ; * meson transition : @xmath184 ; @xmath185 .    in the following , we discuss each decay mode separately . first , @xmath148 can decay into dijets or @xmath179 by the co - annihilation of the 4 g quarks inside the bound state through qcd , as shown in fig . [ fig : anni ] . these are the reverse processes of the production mechanism , therefore the existence of these decay modes is robust .     into light quark pair ( dijets ) or @xmath179 . , width=113 ]    the decay partial width in this mode is proportional to @xmath167 . the two - body decay width is calculated at born level to be @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the number of light quark flavors , and @xmath188 is the velocity of the top quark in the @xmath148 rest - frame . due to the number of light quark flavors , the decay partial width into dijets is larger than that into @xmath179 by @xmath189 . analogous to @xmath190 production , we have also estimated the three - body @xmath191 decay rate , following the tree - level calculation of ref . @xcite , and found that it can be ignored . another type of annihilation decay channel is caused by weak boson exchange , where an off - diagonal quark mixing element acts on one of the bound quarks , as shown in fig . [ fig : weak](a ) . this is rather similar to the binding mechanism , where the quark mixing elements are always within 4 g . once the cross - generation interaction occurs , the recoil due to the energy release from the mass difference between the 4 g quarks and lower generations would eject the lighter quark and destroy the bound state , followed by subsequent decay of the leftover 4 g quark . the lower generation quark mass is too light such that it can not bind with the heavy 4 g quark by yukawa coupling . the decay width is calculated in terms of the decay constant in eq .

[ fig : weak](b ) . it is similar to the weak boson exchange decay discussed just before , and quantum mechanically speaking , the exchanged boson escapes the system as an on - shell particle . we call this the  free \" quark decay mode , even though the decaying quark is bound . the decay partial width in this mode depends crucially on @xmath13 and @xmath12 , but not strongly on the structure of @xmath148 . this last statement would no longer hold when one enters the realm of deeply bound states , where binding energy is much larger than the @xmath43 gev adopted here .    inside the bound state system , the decay of the constituents is suppressed by phase - space and time dilatation effects  @xcite . that is , the decaying quark constituent is off - shell . however , for simplicity , we ignore these effects in our rate calculation , and use @xmath201   = \\gamma_{t'}+\\gamma_{b'},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath202 , @xmath203 are given at born level as @xmath204 with @xmath205 or @xmath206 , and @xmath207 with @xmath208 as defined earlier . note that we have kept @xmath196 here , since the decay process is quite similar to the familiar top quark decay . the decay width of the 4 g quarks is suppressed by the small @xmath13 and @xmath12 , but grows rapidly with the 4 g quark mass . if @xmath148 decays through @xmath2 , the final state would be @xmath200 , and @xmath209 if decay is through @xmath3 . the search of these signal can be along the standard 4 g quark search strategy  @xcite , except that , if heavy quark mass could be reconstructed , then for example one @xmath210 pair has a lower mass ( due to binding energy ) than the other @xmath210 pair from on - shell @xmath2 decay  @xcite .    , and @xmath211 . , title=\"fig:\",width=132 ] , and @xmath211 . , title=\"fig:\",width=132 ]      finally , a third class of decay is for @xmath148 to turn into other resonances . we consider the two channels of @xmath212 and @xmath184 . the other possible channel @xmath213 is forbidden by the heavy isospin . the partial width for these decays depend on the mass difference as well as the transition amplitude of these resonances . the meson transition to @xmath185 would open only if @xmath214 . for @xmath215 , @xmath148 can decay into @xmath216 or @xmath217 through the off - shell @xmath15 boson . however , the partial width would be negligibly small . we can write down a general vector to pseudoscalar transition amplitude via ( color singlet ) vector or axial - vector currents as , @xmath218,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath219 , @xmath220 are 4-momentum of @xmath148 , @xmath221 respectively , @xmath222 is the polarization vector of @xmath148 , and @xmath223 and @xmath224 are form factors in @xmath225    a straightforward calculation gives ( @xmath192 ) @xmath226 with @xmath227x(1-x^2+y^2)\\lambda^3    { \\nonumber}\\\\   & \\ ; + \\frac{1}{4}|a_2+a_3|^2\\lambda^5 + 2|v^2| \\ , y^2\\lambda^3 ,   \\label{eq : hpw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath228 as already defined . here , @xmath196 has to be kept , since transverse @xmath15 emission has a @xmath61 phase space factor , while longitudinal @xmath15 emission has a @xmath229 factor and more suppressed . using the assumption that a free quark inside a meson interacts with currents , the form factors are reduced to @xmath230 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 and @xmath233 . for simplicity , we use this limit in our numerical calculation , and eq .

[ fig : br ] the branching ratio of various @xmath148 decays as a function of @xmath84 for cases  1 to 4 . in case  1 , the dominant decay modes are the transition decay into @xmath185 , especially for lighter mass region , and free quark decay , i.e. via the decay of 4 g constituent quark for heavier mass region . the branching ratios of free quark decay and the @xmath13-dependent annihilation ( @xmath15 boson exchange ) decay increase with @xmath84 , because @xmath257 reflects a larger yukawa coupling . the @xmath7 is of order 10% and drops slightly at higher @xmath84 , with @xmath179 branching ratio a factor of 5 lower , at the percent level . the transition decay into @xmath258 is at the percent level or less .    in case  2 , because of the small decay constant , the annihilation decay channels @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath7 and @xmath259 are suppressed . in this case , free quark decay and transition decay into @xmath185 are the two predominant modes .    in case  3 , the large mass differences enhance the branching ratio of the transition decays , and the @xmath185 mode dominates . the other transition decay into @xmath258 can also be enhanced , especially in the lighter mass region . it could be that the mass difference of only @xmath260 is large , i.e. when the mass spectrum is like @xmath261 . if so , @xmath185 could be considerably suppressed , and @xmath258 would be more prominent , especially for low @xmath84 .    in case  4 , the free quark decay and the @xmath13 induced annihilation decay are suppressed , due to small @xmath13 . the decay width of 4 g quarks is also suppressed for the same reason . in this case , the transition decay into @xmath185 dominates , and the annihilation decay into dijets can be sub - dominant with branching ratio at ten percent order . however , this sensitively depends on the @xmath262 mass difference , as well as the decay constant . if @xmath185 becomes kinematically suppressed , dijets would be dominant . let us summarize some general features regarding branching ratios . basically , the transition decay into @xmath185 is large , because of the large yukawa coupling and no suppression effect by bound state deformation . this decay mode can be more enhanced if the mass difference is large , but much suppressed if the mass difference is small , especially if less than @xmath196 , as we have seen . free quark decay has sizable contribution for the heavier mass region , if @xmath13 is close to the current upper limit of 0.1 . 0.13 cm   and @xmath221 for the four parameter sets . the upper curves are for @xmath148 , where case 3 is enhanced by a larger @xmath262 mass difference . the lower curves , plotted 100 gev less in mass , are for @xmath221 , where cases 1 and 2 are barely distinguishable.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    in fig . [ fig : wid ] , we show the total decay width of @xmath148 as a function of @xmath84 for the four parameter sets . the decay width increases with @xmath84 , from a few gev to around 10 gev . for case 3 , due to the rapid decay into @xmath185 from a relatively large @xmath262 mass difference , the width is at 20 gev range , and increases mildly with @xmath84 . still , compared with its tev scale mass , @xmath148 is a heavy but narrow meson resonance . we see that the binding energy , therefore strong yukawa dynamics , and flavor structure through @xmath13 all play crucial role for the eventual phenomenology one expects at lhc .      to be able to address lhc phenomenology , we need to treat @xmath38 and @xmath10 further , as they may appear in @xmath37 decay final state . from fig . [ fig : br ] we see that in general @xmath263 is the leading decay . note , however , that we have assumed @xmath264 gev . the rate would drop sharply as this vector  scalar splitting diminishes , and becomes practically negligible when @xmath15 turns virtual . on the other hand , if the strong binding found by ref . @xcite in the bethe  salpeter approach with @xmath41-channel subtracted has any bearing , then @xmath10 may be deeper bound than @xmath37 . for this situation , case 3 stands as an illustration , where @xmath265 decay would be preeminent . in contrast , the process @xmath266 is never more than 10% , and more typically at @xmath267 order or smaller . the exception would be if @xmath268 is of order @xmath196 or less , but @xmath269 is sizable ( plot of case 3 in fig . [ fig : br ] , but with @xmath265 removed ) . viewing this exception as unlikely , we relegate the discussion of @xmath38 to a concurrent discussion of weak drell  yan production . but we need to address how @xmath10 decays . it is interesting that @xmath270 vanishes because it is a @xmath271 transition , which we have verified by direct computation . the @xmath272 exchange diagram of fig . [ fig : weak](a ) is absent for charged @xmath273 ( i.e. @xmath274 and @xmath275 mesons ) because of isospin , while the @xmath41-channel annihilation is absent by the octet / isovector nature . the upshot is that we are left with only two decay processes : the familiar free quark decay , and a new type of decay , @xmath276 , where the @xmath15 is transverse . the latter is an inverse process of @xmath265 , with @xmath51 replacing @xmath148 . however , the annihilation rather than transition nature implies that @xmath276 is relatively suppressed .     for the four parameter sets , ranging from predominance ( case 4 ) , to below @xmath267 ( case 2).,width=272 ]    direct computation gives @xmath277 where @xmath278 is the @xmath10 decay constant normalized by @xmath10 mass . the rate of @xmath279 is suppressed by @xmath280 compared to the rate of @xmath281 of eq . we have checked explicitly that longitudinal @xmath15 emission again vanishes . we plot the @xmath10 width in fig . [ fig : wid ] , and the @xmath282 branching fraction , in fig . [ fig : pi8 ] . the width is at gev order , narrower than @xmath37 , but could be much smaller if a small @xmath13 suppresses the free quark decay widths . thus , @xmath279 decay branching fraction is below 10% , and much smaller for case 2 ( suppressed by a smaller decay constant ) . for case 4 , the small @xmath13 case , @xmath279 could dominate .     into dijets , for the four parameter sets at the lhc 7  tev . cms upper limit  @xcite for the cross section of dijet resonance production is also plotted.,width=264 ]", "we now discuss the possible phenomenology , as well as other issues . let us first comment on the dijet decay of @xmath148 , which could appear as a dijet resonance . absence of dijet features in tevatron and lhc searches constrains or rules out any model with particles in tev range . in fig . [ fig : jj ] , we plot the total cross section times dijet branching ratio for @xmath148 production at the lhc 7 running at tev , as a function of @xmath84 for the four parameter sets . we compare with the cms dijet resonance search  @xcite with @xmath283  fb@xmath284 data at @xmath160  tev . we note that the data includes acceptance cuts for dijets , but our model numbers do not , which makes the comparison conservative . we find the cross section times dijet branching ratio are at least an order of magnitude lower than the current upper limit for all four cases , with case  4 the largest . even with @xmath285 channel removed making @xmath281 the leading decay , one is still below the cms limit . let us call this special situation case  @xmath286 . our results show that , while a narrow resonance signal might start to show up with a considerably larger data set , it could show up soon for case  @xmath286 . that is , if @xmath285 decay is forbidden , while free quark and exchange decays are suppressed by small @xmath13 . the need for these two conditions to be met , however , makes this possibility not particularly likely .    in general , the @xmath285 decay is the dominant @xmath148 decay mode , unless it is kinematically suppressed by @xmath262 being too close to , or smaller than , @xmath196 . we have investigated the decay of @xmath10 itself , and found that it is dominated by free quark decay , with @xmath287 subdominant for cases 13 . it is important now to spell out the isospin nature : isosinglet @xmath288 , @xmath289 with a @xmath290 ratio , where the subscript @xmath41 indicates a relatively soft vector boson , and @xmath291 stands for the @xmath292 boson , as we have ignored heavy isospin breaking . thus , the signature for @xmath293 leads to @xmath294 , @xmath295 , and @xmath296 , plus c.c . except for the last case with presence of a @xmath292 boson ( the identification via dileptons would be costly in branching fraction ) , the additional @xmath297 which is relatively soft makes it an even more complicated signature than direct open @xmath23 production . the same sign dilepton approach  @xcite remains a good one , but more jets would be present . note that the @xmath292 is usually vetoed against in same sign dilepton studies . however , if boosted @xmath15 and top jets can be exploited to isolate the @xmath298 and @xmath299 ( both in @xmath300 final state ) , then the associated soft @xmath301 could be an extra tag for @xmath5 production . besides the relatively low @xmath302 @xmath15 , the 7-jet system has rich imbeddings of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 jets . it can be part of the @xmath303 search program , which would in any case be a background . but the multi - jet system is of rather high mass , and with different signature content , that one may be able to separate . if the total jet mass resolution is good , one may discover both the @xmath273 in multijets with a soft @xmath15 tag , with the @xmath273 and the @xmath304 reconstructing to @xmath37 . the lhc experiments should also look for a @xmath292 boson associated with high jet multiplicity , perhaps with a hint of unusual @xmath305 plus multijets as backdrop . given that @xmath221 is very narrow , one could look for a relatively soft @xmath292 recoiling from 6 or 8 hadronic jets with very high , but relatively specific mass , containing substructures of multiple boosted @xmath15 jets or boosted top jets . the whole event , @xmath306 6 or 8 jets , would also reconstruct to a narrow resonant mass . one might think that @xmath307 multijets can be similarly pursued . however , eq .  ( [ eq : opw ] ) does not apply to @xmath308 : the @xmath309 term vanishes with @xmath310 . the photonic decay involves heavy quark spin flip , hence suppressed by @xmath311 . treating @xmath312 , since we allow @xmath313 gev at best , the radiative rate is @xmath314 . since a larger @xmath315 ( case  3 ) gives a larger total @xmath148 width , we find that @xmath316 is always below the percent level . however , photon detection does not suffer from the factor of 0.06 as for @xmath317 detection . hence , the lhc experiments might also consider @xmath307 multijet studies . case 4 offers yet again an intriguing signature , assuming @xmath285 decay dominance . from fig . [ fig : pi8 ] we see that @xmath287 is dominant , as free quark decay is suppressed by a small @xmath13 . one therefore has a unique signature of @xmath318 ( @xmath319 and @xmath320 ) . here , one @xmath15 is soft , and the other hard , with @xmath302 greater than 500 gev , accompanied by a similarly hard gluon . both @xmath15 s tend to be transverse , but the hard @xmath15-jet and the gluon jet would form a rather narrow resonance ! this case offers dramatic signature and should be quickly searched for . the production cross section , of course , is modulated by @xmath149 ( see fig . [ fig : pro ] ) . case 4 , which is the limiting case of small @xmath13 , has better likelihood than the even more special case 4@xmath321 discussed earlier .    leaving case 4 , i.e. if @xmath13 is closer to 0.1 , the next prominent decay compared with @xmath285 in general is  free \" quark decay , i.e. one of the bound @xmath2 or @xmath3 quarks decays , dissolving the bound state system . this could be practically the only other decay mode , if the exchange and annihilation decays are suppressed by a small decay constant ( case 2 ) . the signature is @xmath322 , @xmath323 ( plus c.c . ) , where the notation implies the associated @xmath324 or @xmath325 decays on - shell , but the @xmath210 and @xmath326 are decay products of a bound , somewhat off - shell @xmath2 or @xmath3 quark , which is not too different from open @xmath23 production . unless the on - shell nature is used in the direct search , the search limits would not be affected . however , once 4 g quarks are discovered , one should check whether , for some fraction of the events ( depending on resonance vs open @xmath23 production ratio ) , one of the heavy quarks is in fact off - shell , which would be an indication for bound state phenomena . we remark that open @xmath23 production at the lhc is dominantly through @xmath147 fusion , while the @xmath148 resonance production is through @xmath7 fusion . there is little resonance phenomena in @xmath327 via yukawa effects . in fact , in the @xmath328 channels , it is even repulsive . thus , even above the unitarity bound , standard search can continue , except that there may be some  anomalies \" as we have discussed , if any thing is found at all . we have already dealt with the special case of dijet resonance for case 4 . dijets from @xmath329 tend to be subdominant in all other cases ( i.e. 13 ) , but it could be at 10% level . it would provide a spectacular dijet resonance signal , and definite measurement  @xcite of resonance mass , and spin if there is good signal over background . if the branching ratio could be measured in some way , one could access the important decay constant . in general , a resonance would also appear in @xmath259 ( boosted top jets ) , with cross section 1/5 the dijet resonance .    finally , there is also the exchange decay to @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which is a subdominant channel typically below 10% . it mimics  single @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) \" production , and can be studied that way . but an associated boosted top , or a high @xmath302 @xmath16-jet that tags a resonant @xmath326 , could be quite distinct . we offer some remarks on the @xmath330  @xcite and @xmath331  @xcite anomalies at the tevatron . naively , one might think that the presence of resonance production of @xmath259 could be relevant for @xmath330 . but @xmath148 has same quantum numbers as the gluon , i.e. the coupling to @xmath259 is fully vector . thus , it can not generate @xmath330 suggested by tevatron data . for the @xmath331 anomaly , the yukawa bound resonances are so massive , they can have nothing to do with it . this brings us to comparing with technicolor ( tc ) models . low scale tc has been invoked  @xcite for the @xmath331 anomaly suggested by cdf . our @xmath148 and @xmath221 are yukawa bound @xmath23 mesons with an operative heavy isospin , from degenerate chiral quark doublet @xmath47 not too far above the unitarity bound . thus , our @xmath148 and @xmath221 mesons are much heavier than those in low scale tc . for more generic tc models @xcite , since  walking \" is generally required , the technipion @xmath332 tends to be closer to the technirho @xmath333 in mass such that @xmath334 is absent , while ( near ) degeneracy of @xmath335 and @xmath336 with @xmath333 is also often invoked . the signature for these technimesons are typically @xmath337 , @xmath338 and @xmath339 . thus , not only the spectrum is rather different  absence of @xmath31 and @xmath340 mesons  the decay signature is also in strong contrast . the bound states due to strong yukawa coupling , which follow simply from the existence of new heavy chiral quarks without assuming new dynamics , should be easily distinguished from technicolor . the yukawa - bound ultraheavy mesons are also quite distinct from qcd bound states . not only there is the absence of @xmath33 ( where @xmath147 fusion would be possible ) and @xmath31 type mesons , they have a much larger binding energy , and are much smaller in size . this is brought about by not only a strong coupling constant , but facilitated by a @xmath40 coupling due to goldstone or longitudinal vector bosons ; the @xmath341 higgs boson , being heavy , would in fact be subdominant . thus , the tight bound states involve ultrarelativistic motion of its very heavy constituents , hence somewhat counterintuitive . by far we have not attempted any actual solution of the bound state problem here . we therefore chose to remain close to the unitarity bound , considering bound state masses not more than 1.5 tev . we have chose to parameterize with a few key parameters . our numerics , and associated phenomenology , should be viewed as only illustrative , with the _ key parameters to be determined by experiment_.    what mass scale would nature actually choose , if she so chooses to offer an extra chiral doublet above the existing three generations ? it may be related to the electroweak symmetry breaking through @xmath36 condensation . it could in principle lead to very deeply bound states , with binding energy approaching @xmath42 order or more . we have only scratched the surface of yukawa - bound heavy mesons , the treatment of which would require genuine nonperturbative methods , such as  @xcite lattice field theory . paradoxically , it is not impossible that heavier quark masses than considered here could result in lower heavy meson masses . again , experiment might take the lead here .", "with the experimental limits on sequential chiral 4th generation already at 500 gev , i.e. at the doorsteps of the unitarity bound , we have considered the possibility of new @xmath36 mesons bound by strong yukawa couplings . comparing a relativistic expansion approach ( which indicated nonapplicability ) , versus a relativistic bethe  salpeter equation approach , we chose to illustrate what might appear in early data of lhc running , i.e. bound states just above the tev scale , but with relatively complicated decay final states . electroweak precision tests suggest a new ( heavy ) isospin symmetry , such that the leading production would be a color octet , isosinglet vector meson , which we call @xmath148 . it can be produced via @xmath4 fusion , through an unknown decay constant , @xmath149 . for decay , the key parameters besides @xmath149 are the quark mixing element @xmath13 , and the mass differences @xmath262 and @xmath269 where @xmath221 is a heavy color octet  pion \" and @xmath238 a color singlet  we find the leading decay is likely @xmath285 , while the other transition channel into @xmath258 is relatively suppressed . the other leading decay is  free \" , or constituent , quark decay . illustrating with four cases for large / small decay constant , nominal / suppressed mass differences or @xmath13 , together with the two decay channels of free quark decay and @xmath11 decay of @xmath221 , we considered the possible lhc phenomenology . we find in general the @xmath37 to be narrow compared to its mass . the special case of small @xmath13 leads to two possible spectacular signatures . one is @xmath342 , where a massive back - to - back @xmath11 system is accompanied by a relatively soft @xmath15 . this mode could become suppressed if @xmath262 is close to or less than @xmath196 . then , one could have a dijet resonance close to current lhc limits , and a narrow dijet resonance could appear soon . in the general case , dijet signal is suppressed by a decay branching ratio . other than the above two ( perhaps unlikely ) spectacular signals , the generic leading decay is @xmath343 , @xmath344 , followed by free quark decay of @xmath221 ( @xmath287 is typically subdominant ) . this leads to possible multijet signals with an associated relatively soft @xmath15 or @xmath292 tag , where the multijet system is very massive , and with multiple @xmath16 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 jet substructures . if such massive multijet systems can be studied , one could possibly reconstruct both the @xmath221 and @xmath148 resonances . assuming single channel dominance , one can measure the meson decay constant by the total cross section . if @xmath285 is suppressed by kinematics , however , the likely leading decay would be by the constituent heavy quark decay , which is very similar to standard @xmath23 signal , except one heavy quark decays somewhat off - shell . since in any case the leading @xmath327 fusion does not exhibit resonance phenomena , _ the current 4th generation @xmath18 and @xmath19 search can continue beyond the unitarity bound_. but if 4 g quarks are discovered , then some good fraction of the events would have one quark decaying below threshold , indicating bound state phenomena . one , of course , would have to disentangle also @xmath285 , as already discussed . we have provide some definite signatures for yukawa - bound heavy @xmath23 mesons in the 1 to 1.5 tev range . but our study is only of precursory nature . as lhc energy increases , and with higher luminosity , it could uncover new chiral quarks above the unitarity bound , with new unusual bound states . one could probe into the truly nonperturbative regime , which our results only offer a glimpse of what might happen . there may be a host of new heavy mesons awaiting us beyond the horizon .    0.3 cm * acknowledgement*. we thank k .- f . chen , a. djouadi , k. ishiwata , b. kniel , t. kugo , m.b . wise , b .- young and c .- p . yuan for discussions , and k. hagiwara for encouraging comments . wsh thanks the national science council for academic summit grant nsc 99 -

( 1997 ) , stein ( 1997 ) , adami et al . ( 1998 ) , metevier et al . ( 2000 ) . these works have , however , not fully determined whether this morphological segregation is simply a function of redshift and/or the cluster environment _ e.g. _ does the galactic content of clusters evolve with cosmic epoch or as a function of the cluster s virial mass ? to try to understand these issues , there has been considerable effort over the last two decades dedicated to studying the dynamical and morphological evolution of clusters via multi  object spectroscopy and photometric imaging ; for example , dressler ( 1980 ) ; butcher & oemler ( 1984 ) ; gunn et al . ( 1986 ) ; couch et al . ( 1991 ) ; bower et al . ( 1997 ) ; carlberg et al . ( 1997 ) ; dressler et al .

( 2000a ) and holden et al . the cop survey contains approximately 650 galaxy redshift measurements ( from 6 nights of cfht time ) towards more than 10 pdcs clusters at a mean redshift of 0.4 . we have also obtained r  band photometry at the cfht for these targets . we have combined our r - band data with the published pdcs photometry in v and i. this combined data set is allowing us to study the dynamical and morphological status of optically selected distant clusters of galaxies . we can then directly compare with the enacs ( eso nearby abell cluster survey : e.g. katgert et al . 1996 ) and cnoc samples ( carlberg et al . 1997 ) . due to the relatively low number of galaxies , the statistics of an individual cluster are too low to compare individually to nearby clusters . therefore , we combined the data from all the clusters in our cop study ( at z@xmath00.4 ) whose velocity dispersions were greater than 500 km.s@xmath7 into one composite cluster . we also applied the same technique to the available cnoc data from which we built two composite clusters , one at z@xmath00.32 and one at z@xmath00.48 . our results and conclusions , then , are based upon the comparison of the composite clusters constructed in the same way from the enacs , cop and cnoc surveys .    in section 2 , we summarize the data and describe the methods used in analyzing them . we then discuss evolutionary effects , since our clusters extent over a relatively large redshift range and have been all analyzed in the same manner . in section 3 , we describe our measurements of galaxy segregation . in section 4 we discuss the galaxy evolution in our cluster sample as a function of redshift and the implications that our data pose on the formation epoch of these clusters . we use q@xmath8=0 and @xmath9=0 . distances are given in units of h=@xmath10/100 .", "in this paper we use the cop data described in adami et al . ( 2000a ) and holden et al . ( 2000 ) as well as the enacs and cnoc data . the cop survey is an imaging and spectroscopic follow - up of 10 pdcs ( postman et al . 1996 ) lines  of  sight which contain 15 pdcs cluster candidates at z@xmath110.4 ( adami et al . 2000a and holden et al . 2000 ) . here , we compare the dynamical characteristics of the galaxies belonging to those pdcs clusters to their enacs ( adami et al 1998 ) and cnoc counterparts . the low redshift data are based on a compilation from the enacs database ( katgert et al . 1996 , mazure et al . 1996 ) and the literature ( adami et al . 1998 ) . all the galaxies in the nearby sample have a redshift and a magnitude that were derived in the same manner as the current data . they have also been classified into morphological types , but no color data comparable to our cop data are available .    we also use 5 cnoc clusters available in the literature ( ms0016 + 16 , ms0302 + 16 , ms1008 - 12 , ms1224 + 20 and ms0451 - 03 ) . ms1358 + 62 and ms1621 + 26 were excluded from the sample because of their distorded apparent shape . the cnoc galaxies have r and g magnitudes and are classified into spectral types according to their color and spectral distribution ( yee et al . we compute an absolute magnitude according to the redshift and the spectral type of each galaxy using the k - corrections given in frei @xmath3 gunn ( 1994 ) ( see below for the definition of the cnoc spectral types ) . we used the most massive ( @xmath12 ) clusters in the pdcs sample in our comparison with the enacs and cnoc surveys in order to match the same class of clusters . we compute the velocity dispersions of the massive systems detected in the cop survey ( adami et al . 2000a ) using the bi  weight robust estimators of beers et al . ( 1990 ) and applying a `` 3-@xmath13 clipping '' . this is exactly the same methodology used by adami et al . ( 1998 ) for the enacs systems and this ensure us to have robust estimators despite the relatively low numbers of galaxies used . our final velocity dispersion measurements are within 5@xmath14 of those presented in holden et al . ( 2000 ) for all the clusters in common except pdcs30/45 . this last group has a complicated structure in redshift space which probably produced deviations from holden et al . in the velocity dispersion determination . however , if we excluded that cluster from our sample , the results described in the following sections do not change by more than 5@xmath14 . we decided , therefore , to not exclude those galaxies when building our composite cluster ( see next section ) . due to the small number of redshifts per cluster in our sample ( @xmath15 ) , we were unable to distinguish between inter - loper galaxies  those which are passing - through the cluster but are not physically bound to the cluster  and real cluster members . katgert et al . ( 1996 ) showed that not excluding inter - lopers results in an increase of the velocity dispersion of the clusters by between 10@xmath14 and 25@xmath14 . to account for this effect in our sample , we have , therefore , systematically decreased our measured velocity dispersions by 15@xmath14 .    for this paper , we selected only the clusters with a redshift greater than 0.25 , a velocity dispersion greater than 500 km.s@xmath7 and with more than 7 redshifts ( see table 1 ) . in total , we have 6 clusters at a mean redshift of 0.4 and 74 cluster galaxies with measured redshift and v@xmath16 and i@xmath16 magnitudes ( 56 have also measured r magnitude ) . only one of the clusters in our sample has fewer than 9 redshifts . this is not a problem because the velocity dispersion can be reliably estimated using bi - weight estimators with 9 or more redshifts ( see lax 1985 ) . we analyzed the cnoc clusters in the same way as the pdcs and enacs clusters . first of all , we defined groups along the lines of sight by using the same gap technique as in adami et al . ( 1998 ) or adami et al . ( 2000a ) . this technique searches for gaps of more than 1000 km.s@xmath7 in the distribution of the galaxies ordered by increasing redshift . the choice of 1000 km.s@xmath7 is well adapted to the data we have ( see also katgert et al . we checked , however , that values between 600 and 1500 km.s@xmath7 do not significantly change the results . when more than 5 galaxies were between two velocity gaps , we assumed that this was a structure . with this technique we detected all the groups defined in carlberg et al . ( 1997 ) with very similar mean redshifts ( see table 2 ) plus several small and probably diffuse groups not listed by carlberg et al .    in order to use a uniform set of selection criteria , we chose only groups with a velocity dispersion larger than 500 km.s@xmath7 . when the detected groups were found to be listed in carlberg et al . ( 1997 ) , we used the velocity dispersion quoted in that paper . for groups not detected by carlberg et al , we computed the velocity dispersion by the same method described in the previous section . we kept only groups with velocity dispersions larger than 500 km.s@xmath7 . in total , only one structure was added to the 5 main structures in the cnoc sample ( carlberg et al . this group , in the ms0016 + 16 field , is at a redshift of 0.328 and has a velocity dispersion of 610 km.s@xmath7 ( denoted ms0016 + 16@xmath17 in the following ) . excluding this group did not change the results significantly . finally , we only used the cnoc galaxies within a radius of 1 h@xmath7 mpc from the center in order to match approximately the pdcs and enacs criteria . for ms0016 + 16@xmath17 , we used the position of the brightest galaxy as the center . ccccccc @xmath5 & mean z & vel . disp . & sampling + ms0016 + 16 & 0.548 & 1243 km.s@xmath7 & 42 + ms0016 + 16@xmath17 & 0.326 & 610 km.s@xmath7 & 8 + ms0302 + 16 & 0.425 & 656 km.s@xmath7 & 33 + ms0451 - 03 & 0.539 & 1354 km.s@xmath7 & 43 + ms1008 - 12 & 0.307 & 1059 km.s@xmath7 & 75 + ms1224 + 20 & 0.326 & 798 km.s@xmath7 & 24 +    [ ]    the end result was 6 cnoc structures ( see table 2 ) : three of them at z@xmath00.32 ( ms0016 + 16@xmath17 , ms1008 - 12 and ms1224 + 20 ) ; the other three in the redshift interval [ 0.4;0.55 ] ( ms0016 + 16 , ms0302 + 16 and ms0451 - 03 , mean redshift of z@xmath00.48 ) . we built as described in section 2.3 two cnoc composite clusters with these structures . the z@xmath00.32 composite cluster has 107 galaxies and the z@xmath00.48 composite cluster has 118 galaxies . these numbers are similar to the number of galaxies in the cop composite cluster .      following adami et al . ( 1998 ) , we built `` composite clusters '' made by combining the data from all the individual systems . we compute galaxy velocities relative to the mean velocity and normalized to the velocity dispersion of each cluster . the normalized velocity of galaxy  i  in cluster  j  , v@xmath18 , is defined as    v@xmath18 = ( v@xmath19-v@xmath20)/@xmath21 ,    with v@xmath20 being the mean velocity of cluster @xmath22 , @xmath21 being its velocity dispersion and v@xmath19 the original velocity of galaxy `` i '' . we merged these normalized velocities into the composite clusters . the uncertainties could be introduced by systematic errors on the @xmath21 ; however , the use of robust estimators prevents us from severe biases in the estimation of the @xmath21 . we stress that this technique of using composite clusters has been already used successfully , for example in adami et al . ( 1998 ) . we have also investigated possible bias due to velocity dispersion inhomogeneity between the 3 composite clusters . we are not very likely to have such selection effects because at z@xmath00.32 , 0.40 and 0.48 , the mean velocity dispersions of the individual clusters used to make the composite clusters are 966 km.s@xmath7 , 1047 km.s@xmath7 and 1119 km.s@xmath7 and they are overlapping if we consider error bars . ccccc color ( z ) & e & sbc & scd & i m + v@xmath23i ( z=0.25 ) & 1.69 & 1.21 & 1.00 & 0.78 + v@xmath23r ( z=0.25 ) & 0.74 & 0.46 & 0.42 & 0.31 + r@xmath23i ( z=0.25 ) & 0.95 & 0.75 & 0.58 & 0.47 + v@xmath23i ( z=0.30 ) & 2.00 & 1.28 & 1.08 & 0.81 + v@xmath23r ( z=0.30 ) & 0.87 & 0.53 & 0.48 & 0.35 + r@xmath23i ( z=0.30 ) & 1.13 & 0.775 & 0.60 & 0.46 + v@xmath23i ( z=0.40 ) & 2.22 & 1.43 & 1.24 & 0.87 + v@xmath23r ( z=0.40 ) & 1.13 & 0.66 & 0.60 & 0.43 + r@xmath23i ( z=0.40 ) & 1.09 & 0.77 & 0.64 & 0.44 + v@xmath23i ( z=0.45 ) & 2.33 & 1.55 & 1.34 & 0.97 + v@xmath23r ( z=0.45 ) & 1.12 & 0.73 & 0.64 & 0.49 + r@xmath23i ( z=0.45 ) & 1.21 & 0.82 & 0.70 & 0.47 +    [ ]    before we begin to discuss the morphological content of the pdcs clusters , we must first establish a common language by which we can compare our results to past and present work in the field _ e.g. _ the use of the early and late morphological types . our imaging data did not have the resolution necessary to allow us to assign galaxies a morphological type . we could , nevertheless , classify our galaxies in terms of their spectral energy distribution using our photometry and spectroscopy . our first classification scheme separates galaxies into emission line and non - emission line objects . this classification relates well to the early / late morphological type classification ( e.g. biviano et al . 1997 ) . however , in some cases early type galaxies , like sos , can exhibit emission lines features in their spectra . in any case , biviano et al . ( 1997 ) have shown that less than 4@xmath14 of elliptical or so cluster galaxies have emission lines . this implies that our spectroscopically  determined `` late type galaxies '' ( see fig . 4 ) are probably free from significant contamination by early type objects . in other cases , some late type galaxy spectra do not have strong emission lines , however . moreover , we used blocking filters to obtain the spectra of the cop galaxies ( see adami et al . 2000a ) which significantly reduced the available spectral range . it is possible , therefore , that we missed emission line features due to this reduced spectral coverage . our `` early type galaxies '' bin may , therefore , be contaminated by late type objects . the other classification scheme we used was based on the three - color information ( v , r and i ) we had for most of the galaxies in the sample ( 56 out of 74 ) . once the redshift was known , the spectral energy distribution was constrained and a rough classification between different spectral types was assigned . we used the frei @xmath3 gunn ( 1994 ) colors to classify our galaxies into 4 spectral types . table 3 gives the v@xmath23i , v@xmath23r and r@xmath23i colors from frei @xmath3 gunn ( 1994 ) for the 4 different morphological types we used and for the 4 redshifts of our composite clusters . we matched the 3 colors of each object with this table . first , we transformed the v@xmath24i@xmath16 , v@xmath24r@xmath25 and r@xmath26i@xmath16 into the standard johnson system used in frei @xmath3 gunn ( 1994 ) . as in postman et al . ( 1996 ) and adami et al ( 2000a ) we applied the following relations for the color transformations :    v@xmath23i = 0.41 + 0.855(v@xmath24i@xmath16)+ 0.012(v@xmath24i@xmath16)@xmath17 ,    v@xmath23r = @xmath230.02+(v@xmath24r@xmath25)@xmath270.056(v@xmath24i@xmath16)+ 0.012(v@xmath24i@xmath16)@xmath17 , and    r@xmath23i = 0.43+(r@xmath26i@xmath16)@xmath230.089(v@xmath24i@xmath16 ) . each color will , in principle , correspond to a single color - type , but this did not always happen . we therefore developed a method of using the colors to uniquely determine the galaxy color - type . first , if all 3 independent color - type determinations derived by the colors did yield the same result , we selected that color - type . this occurred for 24@xmath14 of the sample . second , if 2 color - types among the 3 were identical , and if the third color - type was close to these two ( for example , i m is close to scd ) , we selected the two identical color - types ( 50@xmath14 of the sample ) . third , if 2 color - types among the 3 were identical , but if the third color - type was not close to these two ones ( for example , i m is not close to sbc ) we again selected the two identical color - types ( 5@xmath14 of the sample ) . fourth , if the 3 color - types were different and close ( for example , e , sbc and scd ) , we selected the mean color - type ( 14@xmath14 of the sample ) . finally , if the 3 color - types were different but not close ( for example , e , sbc and i m ) , we selected the color - type providing the lowest difference with the values of table 3 ( 7@xmath14 of the sample ) . we have assumed that the @xmath28 bin of frei @xmath3 gunn ( 1994 ) was a mix of elliptical and so galaxies , the @xmath29 bin was a mix of sa , sb and sc galaxies , the @xmath30 bin was a mix of sd and sm galaxies and the @xmath31 bin contained only irregular galaxies . this classification technique is similar to the one used in the cnoc survey ( carlberg et al . 1997 ) , except that we used three colors instead of two , and we assigned a morphological type ( called color - type hereafter ) using the frei @xmath3 gunn ( 1994 ) templates . the classification estimates with the largest uncertainties are for the last two cases and they constitute only 21@xmath14 of the sample . the main uncertainties in the color classification scheme came from the uncertainties in the magnitudes . possible dust obscuration found , for example , in cl0039 + 4713 ( z=0.41 : smail et al . 1999 ) can lead to misclassifications , but we ignored this effect . we also compare the predicted types of our two classification schemes . overall , emission line galaxies should be mostly late type galaxies and absorption line galaxies should be mostly early type galaxies . the direct comparison shows that , on one hand , 100@xmath14 of the emission line galaxies of our sample have a color - type later than sbc ( sbc : 33@xmath14 , scd:42@xmath14 , i m : 25@xmath14 ) . on the other hand , 14@xmath14 of the non - emission line galaxies have a color - type later than scd ( e : 50@xmath14 , sbc : 36@xmath14 , scd:0@xmath14 , i m : 14@xmath14 ) . these percentages are well within our expectations ( see above ) and these results give strength to our classification schemes . however , we must consider this color classification scheme ( red galaxies : early types , blue galaxies : late types ) only as an @xmath32 of the true morphological type . the spectral assignment is clearly not as reliable as the @xmath33 morphological types obtained , for example , via hst observations by dressler et al . ( 1999 ) or lubin et al . the morphology and the stellar content of a galaxy can be affected differently by various astrophysical processes and consequently the two tentative classifications by colors or spectral features described in this section must be considered only as an approximation of the morphological types . however , in order to compare our distant cluster with their local counterparts ( enacs ) we needed to establish such a relation between spectral and morphological classifications .      in order to relate the cnoc composite clusters with the rest of our sample ( significantly increasing the number of galaxies ) , we decided to split the cnoc spectral classification into two bins that could be related to our previous classification . hereafter , we refer to these subsamples as early and late type cnoc galaxies    we assigned the cnoc spectral types 1 , 2 ( elliptical galaxies ) and 3 ( e+a galaxies ) to the early type class . these are mainly elliptical galaxies because the cnoc type 3 galaxies represent less than 2.5@xmath14 of the sample . the cnoc types 4 and 5 are assumed to be late type galaxies . in order to compare with the enacs data , we associated this late type bin to the bin sc+sd+sm+irr of adami et al .", "as shown in adami et al . ( 1998 ) , there exists both a magnitude and a morphological segregation of galaxies in nearby clusters that agrees with simple dynamical models of cluster formation and evolution . the bright galaxies have a lower velocity dispersion compared to the fainter ones . this variation is expected from energy equipartition in clusters . the elliptical galaxies have a lower velocity dispersion compared to the later morphological types in nearby clusters . the ratio of these dispersions between the elliptical and the late type spiral galaxies is consistent with a model where the late type spirals are currently falling into the cluster . we now compare the results of adami et al . ( 1998 ) for nearby clusters with the results from the 3 distant composite clusters . we plot in figures 1 , 2 and 3 the variation of the normalized velocity dispersions versus the absolute magnitude for the 3 distant composite clusters . we made 4 bins of 17 distant galaxies for the pdcs composite cluster at z@xmath00.4 ( fig . 2 ) , 5 bins of 17 galaxies for the cnoc composite cluster at z@xmath00.32 ( fig . 1 ) and 6 bins of 17 galaxies for the cnoc composite cluster at z@xmath00.48 ( fig . we transformed the v@xmath16 magnitudes into r magnitudes ( v@xmath24r@xmath111 ) to over plot the results for the pdcs composite cluster on the results for the nearby clusters ( which used r magnitudes ) . we have not modified the values of the cnoc r magnitudes because according to frei @xmath3 gunn ( 1994 ) , the correction between r and r magnitudes is less than 0.2 magnitudes . this uncertainty is negligible compared , for example , to the uncertainty in the v@xmath24r value . we have excluded galaxies whose velocities were @xmath343-@xmath13 away from the mean in each bin for the z@xmath00.4 and z@xmath00.32 composite clusters . the figures show qualitatively the same results of adami et al . ( 1998 ) superposed to each composite cluster . for the z@xmath00.32 and z@xmath00.4 composite clusters , the agreement is apparently good except for the faintest bin of the z@xmath00.4 composite cluster and the r@xmath0 - 21.5 point of the z@xmath00.32 composite cluster ( see the discussion section for an explanation of this peculiar value ) . for the z@xmath00.48 composite cluster , the r@xmath0 - 22.3 and r@xmath0 - 22 points seem to be higher than the corresponding z@xmath00.07 points as well as the energy equipartition prediction ( thick solid line ) . the energy equipartition law ( e.g. adami et al . 1998 : @xmath13=10@xmath35 with m the magnitude ) has been normalized to r = @xmath2321.5 ( + 5@xmath36log@xmath37(h ) ) . the agreement with the low redshift data and the energy equipartition for this last composite cluster seems to be worse compared to the other two composite clusters at z@xmath00.32 and z@xmath00.4 . however , taking into account the error bars , the differences are not very significant and we need to estimate quantitatively the level of agreement .    in order to find a way to quantify more efficiently the possible differences between the z@xmath00.07 results and the higher redshift distributions , we used a two dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov test ( e.g. press et al . 1992 ) in the normalized velocity dispersion - r magnitude phase space . we used all the individual values of each galaxy ( without binning ) in the magnitude interval r=[-23.;-19.5 ] . each kolmogorov - smirnov test was run 1000 times ( bootstrap resampling ) to estimate the significance level . at the 10@xmath14 level , we found no significant differences between the normalized velocity dispersion versus r magnitude for the z@xmath00.07 , z@xmath00.32 and z@xmath00.4 composite clusters . however , the distribution of the z=0.48 cluster was found to be significantly different ( even at 1@xmath14 level ) from the three lower redshift composite clusters . the results show , therefore , a significant evolution of the magnitude segregation in the most distant composite cluster , but none for the z@xmath00.07 , z@xmath00.32 and z@xmath00.4 composite clusters .      in this section , we also compared the variation of the @xmath38 versus the @xmath39 . aa a first step , we do not consider the spatial distribution of the galaxies ( see next section ) . the types 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 of fig . 4 were respectively assigned to the closest galaxy types : elliptical , so , sa+sb and sc+sd+sm+irr . we stress that the error bars are too large to draw firm conclusions regarding the morphological segregations shown in fig . 4 . however , the variation of the mean values is still suggestive . we now comment on this .    for the z@xmath00.4 galaxy sample , we used both the emission line ( large filled squares ) and color ( large empty squares ) classifications to assign morphological types . we used the previously defined early and late spectral types for the z@xmath00.32 and z@xmath00.48 cnoc samples . the results are shown in figure 4 , together with the z@xmath00.07 results ( small empty circles ) of adami et al . ( 1998 ) . to plot these results on the same figure , we assumed that the z@xmath00.4 pdcs galaxies with :    only absorption lines were an equal mix of elliptical and so galaxies    only emission lines were an equal mix of spiral and irregular galaxies    a color - type equal to the @xmath28 type of frei @xmath3 gunn ( 1994 ) corresponded to type 1 of adami et al . ( 1998 )    a color - type equal to the @xmath29 type of frei @xmath3 gunn ( 1994 ) corresponded to type 3 of adami et al . ( 1998 )    a color - type equal to the @xmath30 + @xmath31 type of frei @xmath3 gunn ( 1994 ) corresponded to type 4 of adami et al . ( 1998 )    further , we assumed that the cnoc galaxies which are classified as early types were elliptical galaxies and that those classified as late types were type 4 of adami et al . ( 1998 )    the results were found to be qualitatively similar for the z@xmath00.07 , z@xmath00.32 and z@xmath00.4 cluster galaxies . the trend shown is in agreement with the theoretical predictions . for example the ratio between the two z@xmath00.32 bins is close to the @xmath4 value predicted for a relaxed and an infalling galaxy population ( see e.g. adami et al . the ratio is also close to the value given in carlberg et al . ( 1997 ) . the results for the z@xmath00.48 are , however , slightly different compared to the other redshifts . the ratio of @xmath4 is still observed . there seems to be a systematic shift towards higher values of the normalized velocity dispersions , however . these distant clusters could be dynamically younger compared to the other not so distant clusters . we now consider the spatial distribution of the galaxies with respect to their magnitude and spectral type . ccccccccccc z bin / r & -22.75 & -22.5 & -22.25 & -22 & -21.75 & -21.5 & -21.25 & -21 & -20.75 & -20.5 + 0.32 & - & 0.69 & 0.65 & 0.83 & 0.98 & 0.98 & 0.95 & 0.98 & 0.98 & 0.99 + 0.40 & - & - & - & - & 0.25 & 0.65 & 0.95 & 0.95 & 0.95 & 0.91 + 0.48 & 0.79 & 0.94 & 0.99 & 0.99 & 0.99 & 0.99 & 0.99 & 0.99 & 0.99 & 0.99 +    [ ]    we used a two dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov test based on the distance from the center _ versus _ normalized velocity dispersion phase space ( d-@xmath13 phase space hereafter ) to investigate the segregation as a function of spectral type and magnitude . in the z@xmath00.32 , z@xmath00.4 and z@xmath00.48 composite clusters , we showed that the distribution of the early type is significantly different , at the 10@xmath14 level , compared to the late type galaxies . this agrees with the results of adami et al . ( 1998 ) : early type galaxies in nearby clusters are more concentrated at the cluster center than late type galaxies . we also investigated the spatial distribution of the different spectral types as a function of magnitude using a kolmogorov - smirnov test ( with 1000 bootstrap resampling for each case ) . the results are given in table 4 . for the z@xmath00.32 cluster , we show that the distribution in the d-@xmath13 phase space of early type galaxies brighter than r@xmath11 - 21.75@xmath60.25 is significantly different at the 10@xmath14 level compared to the distribution of late type galaxies . in the same time , there is no significant difference between late type and early type galaxies fainter than r@xmath11 - 21.75@xmath60.25 . this means that only the bright early type galaxies are more concentrated at the center than the late type galaxies . biviano et al . ( 2000 ) found a similar result in nearby clusters . for the z@xmath00.4 cluster , we found the same trend if we used the emission line / absorption line classification . this time , the segregation appears at magnitudes brighter than r@xmath11 - 21.25@xmath60.25 . for the z@xmath00.48 cluster , however , the segregation starts to be significant at r@xmath11 - 22.5@xmath60.25 , brighter than for the z@xmath00.32 and z@xmath00.4 clusters . once again , the most distant composite cluster seems to be different form the less distant composite clusters . only the very bright early type galaxies show a more concentrated distribution than the late type galaxies . the cop clusters are @xmath40 while the cnoc clusters are @xmath41 selected . we now consider whether these different selection methods are responsible for the differences seen between the z@xmath00.48 composite cluster ( x - ray selected ) and the other composite clusters at lower redshift . for the magnitude and the spatial distribution segregations , these different selection methods did not seem to play a significant role because the z@xmath00.32 ( x - ray selected ) composite cluster exhibits the same characteristics as the z@xmath00.07 and z@xmath00.4 composite clusters ( optically selected ) and it was selected in the same way as the z@xmath00.48 composite cluster . in the case of the morphological segregations , this effect is not statistically significant . we , therefore , assume that our results do not depend on whether the clusters were x - ray or optically selected .", "we stress that our conclusions are strictly valid only for the clusters of our sample . however , these clusters are a fair sample of the general massive cluster population , and the results presented here can probably be generalized to other clusters .      based on our previous analyses we found no evidence for redshift evolution of the dynamical state in our cluster sample from z@xmath42 to z@xmath43 . we detected , however , significant evolution between the z@xmath43 and z@xmath44 composite clusters using a kolmogorov - smirnov test . we also find that the cluster galaxy content changes from z@xmath00.07 , z@xmath00.32 , z@xmath00.4 to z@xmath00.48 . in the nearby sample of cluster galaxies of adami et al . ( 1998 : z@xmath00.07 ) ,    the type  1  galaxies ( ellipticals ) are 24@xmath14 of the sample ,    the type  2  ( so ) are 49@xmath14 ,    the type  3  ( sa+sb ) are 20@xmath14 and    the type  4  ( sc+sd+sm+irr ) are only 7@xmath14 .    in the sample at z@xmath00.32 , the early type galaxies are 78@xmath14 ,    the late type galaxies are 22@xmath14 ( type  4  ) .    in the sample at z@xmath00.4 ,    the redder galaxies ( assumed to be  1+2  : ellipticals + so ) are 44@xmath14 of the sample ( versus 24@xmath14 + 49@xmath14 for the nearby sample ) ,    the intermediate color galaxies ( assumed to be type  3  ) are 38@xmath14 and    the bluer galaxies ( type  4  ) are 18@xmath14 .    and finally , in the sample at z@xmath00.48 ,    the early type galaxies are 70@xmath14 ,    the late type galaxies are 30@xmath14 ( type  4  ) . the percentages of late type galaxies are higher in the distant cluster samples . the estimate of the uncertainties in these percentages is not straightforward but we assumed the section 2.4 maximum contamination of 21@xmath14 ( @xmath03-@xmath13 ) in assigning spectral types when using colors in the z@xmath00.4 sample . to be conservative , we applied this to the relative percentages of red , intermediate and blue galaxies of our sample . the uncertainties on the numbers given in this paragraph are , therefore , based on a 7@xmath14 uncertainty .    in other words , the distant cluster galaxies are statistically bluer ( or present later types ) than the nearby cluster galaxies . this is the `` classical '' butcher @xmath3 oemler ( 1984 ) effect that already has been extensively reported in the literature . at even higher redshifts , van dokkum et al . ( 1999 ) found the same effect in the cluster ms1054 - 03 at z@xmath00.83 . they showed clear evidences of further evolution of late type galaxies into early types ( so @xmath45 e ) .    in order to compare results free from possible bias in our classification for the z@xmath00.4 sample , we also compare the percentage of emission line galaxies in this sample ( 19@xmath63@xmath14 ) to the enacs sample of nearby clusters ( biviano et al . 1997 : 10@xmath61@xmath14 ) , without using any color classification . we see that the emission line galaxy fraction increases by a factor of @xmath02 . in principle , our ability to measure redshifts for emission line galaxies is higher than that for absorption line galaxies , but this effect is canceled out by the short spectral ranges we used ( see adami et al . 2000a ) which occasionally can lead to missed emission line features . the region ( @xmath46 mpc ) covered by the cop and enacs surveys are similar ( see adami et al . 2000a and adami et al . 1998 ) , which is important as we discuss below . the evolution in the galaxy content of the clusters in our sample between z@xmath00 and z@xmath00.48 seems to be real . it does not depend on the sample used to test it , whether it is selected according to their spectral features or to their colors . these results are consistent with the recent studies of dressler et al . ( 1999 ) of z @xmath47 clusters . they find evolution of the morphological types of cluster galaxies . the metric aperture used , however , plays a key role in determining the blue fraction : for example , the implied evolution of the blue fraction with redshift was not confirmed by lubin et al . ( 1998 ) and postman et al . they showed that the massive cluster 1604 + 4304 at z=0.84 has a morphological content similar to that of nearby clusters . but , these studies used images of the inner core of the cluster ( @xmath48 ) which is significantly smaller than the area sampled in adami et al . ( 1998 ) , our comparison study . if we assume that the percentage of late type galaxies increases from the inner part to the outer parts of the clusters ( e.g. adami et al . 1998 ) , then this is an explanation of the discrepancy between our results and the results of lubin et al . ( 1998 ) and postman et al . ( 1998 ) . in order to check this point , we have computed the percentage of red , intermediate and blue galaxies in our z@xmath00.4 sample but in the same physical area as in lubin et al . ( 1998 ) : the core of the clusters . we found in this region , 65@xmath14 red galaxies , 18@xmath14 intermediate galaxies and 17@xmath14 very blue galaxies . these percentages are in agreement with the work of lubin et al . the choice of metric aperture is therefore important , and it could be an explanation for why the longer look  back time studies of lubin and postman did not yield evidence for evolution . it may be that at longer look back times ( z@xmath00.8 ) other effects could lead to a relatively low blue galaxy fraction ( see section 5 ) . the entire evolutionary process is complicated , however , and it probably also relates to the dynamical state of the clusters as well as its redshift . for example , wang et al . ( 1997 ) showed a correlation between cluster ellipticity and blue galaxy fraction , and metevier et al . ( 2000 ) showed that there exist nearby clusters that have bi - modal galaxy or x - ray distributions which have relatively high blue fractions and are yet at low ( @xmath49 ) redshifts . when we compared the dynamical and the cluster content evolution of our composite clusters between z@xmath00.4 and z@xmath00.48 , the situation is consistent : we both found `` younger '' clusters and a `` younger '' population at higher redshift . however , the composite clusters from z@xmath00.07 to z@xmath00.4 give the following puzzle : how did the cluster contents evolve in morphological type , while the clusters have not apparently evolved in terms of their dynamical state ? we now examine this point . the answer is , it is possible to have the bright galaxies virialize before changing morphological type . this would explain why our composite nearby and distant clusters have the same distribution of galaxies versus magnitude , but they do not have the same ratio of late to early type galaxies . we can see this by assuming that galaxies virialize via dynamical friction , which takes 0.1 gyrs for the brightest galaxies for example in our @xmath50 sample and 1 to 1.5 gyrs for the faintest galaxies ( sarazin , 1986 ) . yet , if galaxy - galaxy interactions cause the galaxies to change morphological type , the galaxies take about 1 gyr to change ( crossing time ) , and clearly the more massive ( brighter ) galaxies can reach a `` relaxed state '' before changing morphological type . without additional assumptions , however , this scenario runs into a difficulty ; namely , the time between @xmath51 and @xmath50 is about 4 gyrs , and the nearby clusters should have virialized such that the dynamical state of the nearby and distant clusters should not be the same . a way to deal with this is to assume that clusters are ( not surprisingly ) continually evolving ( e.g. ulmer et al 1992 and references therein ) . this scenario is clearly not new and has been investigated in details by authors such as oemler ( 1974 ) , melnick @xmath3 sargent ( 1977 ) , dressler ( 1980 ) or whitmore @xmath3 gilmore ( 1991 ) . however , here , we have a unique case to check this scenario with homogeneously analyzed clusters from z@xmath00 to z@xmath00.5 . clusters are evolving being fed continuously by the in - fall of field galaxies and groups ( or other clusters ) . the majority of the infalling field galaxies are late - type . the most recent episode of in - fall could have been such that the relative low mass late type galaxies in the outer regions have been able to evolve into early type galaxies ( @xmath01 gyr ) while yet not virializing ( @xmath01.5 gyr ) . this leads to the nearby clusters having higher velocity dispersions in their outer portions while , at the same time , having relatively low fractions of late - type galaxies . this hypothesis is consistent with finding a correlation with dynamical age and blue fraction ( wang et al . it is not completely clear how this hypothesis relates to finding nearby clusters which have bi - modal distributions and appear to have relatively large blue fraction ( metevier et al . 2000 ) . in a high matter density universe , however , the cluster formation occurs at late epochs ( close to the present time ) and a high density universe could then leads to the production of dynamically young structures until relatively recent epochs .    if we assume the general picture of cluster evolution and formation , we can extrapolate this scenario back in time to place a lower limit on when clusters formed and also suggest what clusters should look like in terms of morphology and dynamical state if we are able to extend studies to redshifts up to @xmath52 . this is discussed in the next subsection . an interesting question to ask is : when did all these clusters form ? this epoch depends strongly of the cosmological model ( e.g. oukbir @xmath3 blanchard 1992 and 1997 ) . in a high @xmath53 universe , the clusters form later than in a low @xmath53 universe , but they evolve faster . to adress this question , we can use the composite clusters of our sample from z@xmath00.07 to z@xmath00.4 . these are already , at least partially , relaxed . we can then assume that the `` formation '' process has occurred at an epoch earlier than z@xmath00.4 . the clusters of the z@xmath00.48 sample have younger dynamical characteristics and we can assume that they are close to the @xmath54 of their `` first formation '' process , which probably occured around z@xmath00.5 . now we have to estimate the time needed to form such a cluster to estimate the epoch of the @xmath55 of the formation process .    the surface covered by the clusters of our samples is a circle of about @xmath01h@xmath7 mpc radius . the minimal time to form such a cluster is then less than 1 gyear in a violent relaxation process ( 1 crossing time , see sarazin 1986 ) . adding 1 gyear to z@xmath00.5 gives the epoch of the beginning of the cluster formation , i.e. in a q@xmath8=0 universe @xmath07.2 gyears ( not significantly different from when we use low values of q@xmath8 but different from 0 ) . we then conclude that the cluster formation process for the clusters of our sample began at z@xmath340.8 . consistent with this hypothesis are the recent detections of clusters of galaxies at z@xmath00.8 ( in addition to the two quoted in section 4.1 : ms1054 - 03 and 1604 + 4304 ) . nichol et al . ( 1999 ) and ebeling et al . ( 1999 ) report the discovery of an x - ray luminous cluster ( rxj0152 ) at z=0.83 , gioia et al . ( 1999 ) has also discovered a young x - ray luminous cluster at z=0.81 and donahue et al . ( 1998 ) reported one at z=0.82 . there is also the detection of an x - ray cluster ( rosati et al . 1999 ) at z=1.26 with a low x - ray luminosity . nearly all these clusters at z@xmath340.8 have a disturbed x - ray shape ( elongated and clumpy ) and their nature ( partially relaxed clusters or proto - clusters ) is not clear yet . the formation epoch of these massive clusters of galaxies , though , was probably only slightly greater than z=0.8 , which is consistent with our estimates of the minimum z of cluster formation . selection effects may also have played a role in finding only distorded clusters ( cf . adami et al . 2000b ) , however , and the cluster formation may occur at even higher redshifts ( cf . rosati et al . 1999 ) for ( at least ) the low mass clusters .", "we have produced different composite clusters based on combining the results of 6 rich optically selected clusters with redshifts near 0.4 , and 6 x - ray selected clusters with redshifts near 0.3 and 0.5 . we compared these to a similar composite cluster at redshift 0.07 . we have shown that in terms of brightness , type and radius versus velocity dispersion , the @xmath51 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 composite clusters are very similar ( at least within the statistical limitations of the data ) while the @xmath58 composite cluster is significantly different . we conclude from this work that the clusters of the sample have at least partially virialized by a redshift of 0.5 and that massive clusters ( @xmath010@xmath59 solar masses ) have formed at the very latest at z = 0.8 . our derived lower limit to the time of cluster formation epoch is consistent with work on finding massive clusters at z = 0.8 or higher . we have confirmed that the more distant clusters of our sample contain more late - type galaxies that nearby clusters , as found many times before . at the same time , however , we have shown that the dynamical state of these clusters does not seem to evolve for the redshifts lower than 0.4 . in order to explain this , to the extent that there are some bright blue galaxies in the core of the clusters , we hypothesize that these massive blue galaxies have virialized before changing morphological classification . this is not a large effect , however , as the cores of the clusters are mainly red ( cf . section 4.1 ) . we must , therefore , conclude ( at the level of statistics we have here ) that it is primarily the outer regions of the clusters that contribute the relatively large blue fractions of distant clusters . although the nearby clusters should have virialized completely , the outer portions of these clusters are not virialized and yet are dominated by red galaxies . continuous in - fall of relatively numerous , low mass galaxies such that the galaxies have evolved into early type galaxies is just consistent with the time scales involved ( 1gy for relaxation for low mass or faint galaxies and 1.5 gy for virialization ) . it is not clear what our proposed scenario predicts at greater look back times . one possibility is that early type galaxies formed first and formed the initial clusters ( this hypothesis is , however , not supported by van dokkum et al . 1999 ) . then the later type galaxies , having formed later _ in the field _ are just beginning to fall into the cluster and even the bright , massive ones have not yet fallen in . in this scenario , the cluster core will have a low blue fraction / low fraction of late type galaxies even at the bright end . this is approximately consistent with the finding of wirth et al . ( 1994 ) on cl 0016 + 16 ( albeit an x - ray luminous cluster ) or of butcher @xmath3 oemler ( 1984 ) or as suggested by lubin et al ( 1998 ) and postman et al ( 1998 ) ( see , however , section 4.1 regarding the lubin et al . 1998 and postman et al . 1998 results )    the detailed scenario we suggested to explain the results of our analysis and comparisons with a nearby optically selected sample should be considered only that , a suggestion . more elaborate theoretical work , that is beyond the scope of this paper , is necessary to develop the full range of possibilities . the statistics of the results we found here also clearly need to be improved by analyzing the data from more clusters with larger telescopes . what our discussion has showed is the power of the analysis we performed here , and how more analysis of @xmath60 systems coupled with an extension to even higher redshift systems will do much to clarify picture of how galaxy populations evolve within clusters . adami , c. , ulmer , m.p . , romer , a.k . 2000b , apj , submitted adami , c. , holden , b.p . , castander , f. , et al . 2000a , aj , submitted adami , c. , biviano , a. , @xmath3 mazure , a. 1998 , a@xmath3a , 331 , 439 beers , t.c . , flynn , k. , @xmath3 gebhardt , k. 1990 , aj , 100 , 32 biviano , a. , et al . 2000 , a@xmath3a , in preparation biviano , a. , katgert , p. , mazure , a. , et al . 1997 , a@xmath3a , 321 , 84 bower , r.g . , castander , f.j . , ellis , r.s . , couch , w.j . , @xmath3 boehringer , h. 1997 , mnras , 291 , 353 butcher , h. , @xmath3 oemler , a. 1984 , apj , 285 , 426 carlberg , r.g . , yee , h.k.c . , ellingson , e. , et al . 1997 , apj , 476 , 7 couch , w.j . , ellis , r.s . , maclaren , i. , malin , d.f . 1991 , mnras , 249 , 606 van dokkum , p.g . , franx , m. , fabricant , d. , kelson , d.d . , @xmath3 illingworth , g.d . 1999 , apj , 520 , l95 donahue , m. , voit , g.m . , gioia , i.m . , et al . 1998 , apj , 502 , 550 dressler , a. , smail , i. , et al . 1999 , apjs , 110 , 213 dressler , a. 1980 , apj , 236 , 351 ebeling , h. , jones , l.r . , perlman , e. , et al . 1999 , apj , submitted astroph : 9905321 frei , z. , @xmath3 gunn , j.e . 1994 , aj , 108 , 4 gioia , i.m . , henry , j.p . , mullis , c.r . , et al . 1999 , aj , 117 , 2608 gunn , j.e . , hoessel , j.g . , oke , j.b . 1986 , apj , 306 , 30 holden , b.p . , 2000 , aj , submitted katgert , p. , mazure , a. , perea , j. , et al . 1996 , a@xmath3a , 310 , 8 kent , s.m . , @xmath3 sargent , w.l.w . 1983 , aj , 88 , 697 lax , d. 1985 , j. am . assoc . , 80 , 736 lubin , l.m . , postman , m. , oke , j.b . , et al . 1998 , aj , 116 , 584 mazure , a. , katgert , p. , den hartog , r. , et al . 1996 , a@xmath3a , 310 , 31 melnick , j. , @xmath3 sargent , w.l.w . 1977 , apj , 215 , 401 metevier , a. , romer , a.k . , ulmer , m.p . 2000 , aj , in press nichol , r.c . , romer , a.k . , holden , b.p . , et al . 1999 , apj , 521 , 21 oemler , a.jr . 1974 , apj , 194 , 1 oukbir , j. , @xmath3 blanchard , a. 1997 , a@xmath3a , 317 , 1 oukbir , j. , @xmath3 blanchard , a. 1992 , a@xmath3a , 262 , l21 postman , m. , lubin , l.m . , oke , j.b . 1998 , aj , 116 , 560 postman , m. , lubin , l.m . , gunn , j. , et al . 1996 , aj , 11 , 615 press , w.h . , teukolsky , s.a . , vetterling , w.t . , flannery , b.p . 1992 , numerical recipes : second edition rosati , p. , stanford , s.a . , eisenhardt , p.r . , 1999 , aj , 118 , 76 sarazin , c.l . 1986 , rev . phys . , 58 , 1 smail , i. , morrison , g. , gray , m.e . , et al . 1999 , apj , 525 , 609 stein , p. 1997 , a@xmath3a , 317 , 670 ulmer , m.p . , wirth , g.d . , kowalski , m.p . 1992 , apj , 397 , 430 wang , q.d . , ulmer , m.p . , lavery , r.j . 1997 , mnras , 288 , 702 whitmore , b.c . , @xmath3 gilmore , d.m . 1991 , apj , 367 , 94 wirth , g.d . , koo , d.c . , @xmath3 kron , r.g . , 1994 , apj , 435 , l105 yee , h.k.c . , ellingson , e. , abraham , r. , et al . 1996 , apjs , 102 , 289"], "summary": "in this paper , we present an analysis of the dynamics and segregation of galaxies in rich clusters from z@xmath00.32 to z@xmath00.48 taken from the cfht optical pdcs ( cop ) survey and from the cnoc survey ( carlberg et al . 1997 ) . our results from the cop survey are based upon the recent observational work of adami et al .

carollo and danziger 1994 ) , thus indicating that the gradients of mg and fe inside the galaxies are roughly the same . the existence of such gradients seems to be now well established ( carollo et al . 1993 ) and clearly indicates that some dissipative processes have occurred during the formation of ellipticals . elliptical galaxies are also known to have large halos of gas emitting in the x - ray band . these halos represent an indirect indication that these galaxies should contain extended dark matter halos . other indications of the existence of such halos comes from hi kinematics , planetary nebulae , gravitational lensing and dynamical studies ( see carollo et al . 1995 and references therein ) . the abundances measured by asca in the x - ray emmitting gas indicate a very low iron abundance in disagreement with the results from stellar populations . however , the derivation of abundances from the x - ray spectra is still affected by many uncertainties , as recently discussed by arimoto et al . another result from asca , influencing the evolution of ellipticals , concerns the abundances derived for the icm in galaxy clusters . they indicate a clear overabundance of @xmath1-elements relative to iron in the icm ( mushotzky 1994 ) . this result is relevant to the chemical evolution of elliptical galaxies , since they are the major contributors to the enrichment of the icm , as we will see in the next sections .", "the model we are going to discuss has been developed first in matteucci and tornamb ( 1987 ) and subsequently refined in matteucci ( 1992 ) , matteucci and gibson ( 1995 ) and gibson and matteucci ( 1997 ) where a detailed description can be found . we will only remind here that it belongs to the category of the supernovae ( sne)-driven galactic wind models . in this model , efficient star formation leads to the development of a galactic wind , once the thermal energy of the gas , due to the energy injection from sne and stellar winds , is equal or larger than the binding energy of the gas . the star formation is assumed to stop after the occurrence of the galactic wind and the galaxy evolves passively thereafter . during this stage the only active process is the restoration of gas from the stars into the interstellar medium ( ism ) . the only active sne in this phase are the type ia which continue exploding until the present time in agreement with the observational evidence . the model includes the most recent ideas on sn progenitors and nucleosynthesis , indicating that sne ia originate from long living stars whereas sne of type ii originate from short living stars . type ia sne are believed to produce roughly @xmath2 of fe , and the sne of type ii roughly @xmath3 of fe . the so - called @xmath1-elements ( o , mg , ne , si , etc .. ) are thought to be preferentially formed in type ii sne . we follow the evolution of the abundances of 13 chemical elements as described in matteucci and gibson ( 1995 ) . the initial mass function @xmath4 is assumed to be constant in time and expressed as a power law . we explore several prescriptions for the imf : a ) salpeter ( 1955 ) , b ) arimoto and yoshii ( 1987 ) and c ) kroupa et al . ( 1993 ) . the star formation rate is assumed to be simply proportional to the volume gas density through a constant , the star formation efficiency . this efficiency is constant in time but is assumed to vary with the galactic mass in the sense that the efficiency decreases when the total mass increases . this is based on a suggestion from arimoto and yoshii ( 1987 ) that the efficiency of star formation should be inversely proportional to the dynamical timescales . this assumption is not necessarily true since we could think that the star formation efficiency may increase with galactic mass as suggested by tinsley and larson ( 1979 ) and matteucci ( 1994 ) in the hypothesis of the formation of ellipticals by merging of gaseous fragments . according to these different assumptions on the star formation efficiency we can predict very different behaviours of the abundances and abundance ratios as functions of galactic mass , as we will see in the following . the binding energy of the gas is computed by assuming that elliptical galaxies possess heavy but diffuse halos of dark matter and we follow the formulation of bertin et al . according to these authors and matteucci ( 1992 ) we can write the binding energy of the gas as the sum of two terms , one being the binding energy of gas due to the luminous matter and the other the binding energy of the gas due to the interaction between dark and luminous matter : @xmath5    @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the mass of gas , the mass of luminous matter and the mass of the dark matter , respectively . the quantities @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the half - light radius and the the radius of the dark matter core , respectively . in the bertin et al . ( 1992 ) formulation the ratio @xmath14 can vary in the interval 0.1 @xmath15 0.45 . the case with dark matter distributed like luminous matter , although unrealistic , is represented by @xmath16 . the total mass of the galaxy is defined as : @xmath17 which can be written as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the ratio between the mass of the dark and luminous component .    for the sake of simplicity we assume that every galaxy , irrespective of its luminous mass , has @xmath20 and @xmath21 . this means heavy but diffuse halos of dark matter . the choice of relatively diffused dark matter halos seems to be appropriate for elliptical galaxies as shown by the models matteucci ( 1992 ) and matteucci and gibson ( 1995 ) as well as by the lack of dynamical evidence for dark matter inside one or two optical radii ( carollo et al . however , we do not exclude a possible variation of the amount and/or concentration of dark matter with galactic luminosity , as it seems to be the case in spiral galaxies ( persic and salucci 1988 ; persic et al . the possibility of such variations has been already discussed by renzini and ciotti ( 1993 ) in order to explain the properties of the fundamental plane for ellipticals . the thermal energy of the gas is calculated by considering both the sn and stellar wind energy injection . the contribution to the thermal energy of gas from sne is written as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the sn rate ( either type i or ii ) and @xmath24 is the fraction of the initial blast wave energy which is transferred into the ism as thermal energy and @xmath25 is the explosion time . for the particular form of @xmath26 see matteucci and gibson ( 1995 ) and gibson and matteucci ( 1997 ) . the contribution to the thermal energy of the gas from stellar wind is calculated according to gibson ( 1994 ) and is written as : @xmath27    when the total thermal energy of gas is equal or larger than its binding energy , a galactic wind develops and lasts until this condition is reversed . whether there is only an early wind episode or whether more episodes occur is a delicate point and depends crucially on the balance between the effects of the potential well and the injection of energy from stars . clearly the presence and distribution of dark matter plays a very important role in determining the onset and the entity of galactic winds .", "for standard model described herein the star formation efficiency decreases with galactic mass . this model predicts that more massive galaxies develop a galactic wind later than the less massive ones , the reason being that the potential well depth increases with the total mass of the galaxy , while the efficiency of star formation decreases . this behaviour can change if one assumes that the efficiency of star formation is increasing with the total mass and one can obtain the situation where the more massive galaxies develop a galactic wind before the less massive ones . matteucci ( 1994 ) analysed this case and referred to it as the inverse wind scenario . the reason for requiring an inverse wind situation resides in the fact that one can not explain the increase of the [ mg / fe ] ratio in the nuclei of ellipticals as a function of galactic luminosity ( worthey et al . in fact , the standard model predicts exactly the opposite behaviour , due to the winds developing later in more massive ellipticals , which drives the average [ mg / fe ] downward . this `` downward '' trend results from the increased contribution of fe - donating type ia sne in the more massive galaxies . this behaviour is well illustrated in figure 1 where we show the predictions of the standard model concerning the [ o / fe ] ratio ( oxygen and magnesium should vary in lockstep ) in the gas for model computed with different imfs and different initial luminous masses . the times for the occurrence of the galactic wind is marked on each curve . from this figure it is easy to see that if the times for the occurrence of the galactic wind become shorter and shorter with increasing galactic mass , then the average [ o / fe ] would increase with galactic mass instead than decrease . another possibility , in order to obtain an inverse wind situation , might be to vary the amount and/or the concentration of dark matter in a way such that the more massive galaxies would have less and/or less concentrated dark matter . this sounds like an interesting possibility , although it has not yet been calculated in detail , since it seems to happen in spiral galaxies ( persic and salucci 1988 ; persic et al . 1996 ) and in dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( kormendy , 1990 ) . from this discussion it becomes evident how abundance ratios in stellar populations and gas in ellipticals can be used to constrain the amount and concentration of dark matter in these objects . another possibility , however , could be a variable imf from galaxy to galaxy . in this case , in fact , one does not need to have an inverse wind situation , as shown in matteucci ( 1994 ) . this possibility has also the advantage of reproducing the slight increase of the @xmath28 ratio with galactic mass ( bender et al . the variation of the imf should be such that more massive galaxies should have more massive stars relatively to less massive galaxies . finally , a very important feature of figure 1 is that , independently of the assumed imf and time for the occurrence of a galactic wind , a high [ o / fe ] ratio in the dominant stellar population is achieved only if the period of major star formation has been short , namely no longer than @xmath29 years . this is a very strong conclusion since it implies a very fast process for the formation of big ellipticals , at variance with the hierarchical clustering scenario for galaxy formation . matteucci and gibson ( 1995 ) calculated several models for ellipticals of initial luminous mass in the range @xmath30 for the three imf cases a ) , b ) and c ) . one set of models was calculated with an increasing star formation efficiency . their results are shown in table 1 . cccccccccc@xmath31 & @xmath32 & @xmath33 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 & @xmath36 &

mass of gas which is ejected during the wind phase , while in column 4,5,6 and 7 are shown the masses ejected in the form of fe , o , mg and si . in column 8 we show the present time type ia sn rate in units of snu which should be compared with the observed rate : @xmath43 snu ( turatto et al . 1994 ) , where @xmath44 . finally in column 9 we show the predicted @xmath28 ratios and in column 10 the predicted mass - weighted average @xmath45>$ ] in the dominant stellar population", "matteucci and gibson ( 1995 ) derived power relationships between the ejected masses @xmath46 of gas / chemical species and the final galactic mass from the results shown in table 1 . then they integrated these ejected masses on the cluster mass spectrum ( schechter 1976 ) under the assumption that mainly ellipticals and s0 galaxies contribute ejected gas to the icm . this assumption is generally supported by the observational evidence that there is a clear correlation between the total visual luminosity of the ellipticals in clusters and the total masses of iron and gas measured in the x - ray band ( arnaud 1994 ) . however , as we will see in the next section , there could be the possibility that dwarf galaxies , previously underestimated in clusters , contribute non - negligibly to the total gas mass in clusters . the derived integrated masses together with the predicted [ o

majority of the icm should have a primordial origin . this conclusion had already been reached by matteucci and vettolani ( 1988 ) but in this case the discrepancy with the observed total gas masses is even stronger since , due to the presence of dark matter halos , the galaxies do not eject all of their available gas as it was the case in the matteucci and vettolani ( 1988 ) models . therefore , the presence of dark matter in galaxies has important consequences also for the interpretation of the origin of the icm as we will see even better in the next section . another important result is the predicted [ o / fe ] ratio in the icm . recent asca data suggest that [ o / fe ] is high and positive ( @xmath55 , mushotzky 1994 ) . from table 2 we can see that only models with a flat imf ( case b ) can reproduce the observed values . it is worth noting that the existence of only early winds is also a necessary , although not sufficient , condition to achieve this situation . in fact , if all the gas restored by stars is allowed to eventually be lost , the resulting [ o / fe ] ratio in the icm is low and negative as a result of the continuous injection of fe from sne of type ia , as it was the case in matteucci and vettolani(1988 ) s model . abundance ratios in the icm are therefore an extremely useful and tight constraint to understand the evolution of ellipticals . however , before drawing firm conclusions we should be confident of the abundances derived from the x - ray spectra , whereas the situation is not yet clear as already mentioned before .", "while the bright and intermediate part of the luminosity function of a cluster is consistent with a slope @xmath56 ( ferguson and sandage , 1995 ) , there are recent indications that the faint - end slope ( @xmath57 ) of the luminosity function may be significantly steeper ( @xmath58 , de propris et al . trentham ( 1994 ) suggested that , if the faint - end slope of the luminosity function is taken into account , we can explain all the gas in clusters as due to galaxies and in particular to dwarfs .    in particular , in order to achieve this , one has to assume that each galaxy , irrespective of its mass , looses a fraction of its total mass ( luminous+dark ) of the order of @xmath59 . the range of galactic masses contributing to the gas being @xmath60 and the slope of the faint- end of the luminosity function being in the range @xmath61 . under these prescriptions he was able to account for all the gas in clusters as due to galaxies , but he predicted for dwarf galaxies @xmath62 not in very good agreement with the observational estimate . kormendy ( 1990 ) , in fact , suggests that the exponent of this law for dwarf galaxies is @xmath63 . this exponent @xmath64 measures how rapidly dwarf galaxies become dark matter dominated as their luminosity decreases . later , nath and chiba ( 1995 ) calculated more realistic @xmath65 values varying with galactic mass and found that in order to explain all the gas in clusters as due to dwarfs one needs to assume @xmath66 , thus obtaining a @xmath67 , totally outside the observed range . therefore , they showed that more realistic assumptions weaken the argument of trentham ( 1994 ) . recently , gibson and matteucci ( 1997 ) extended the model for elliptical galaxies described before to dwarf spheroidal galaxies , included updated physical inputs and calculated the total contribution to the gas and metal of the icm from dwarf and giant elliptical galaxies . these authors calculated also the photometric evolution ( see gibson 1996 for details ) of the considered galaxies in order to have a larger number of constraints to compare with the results and took into account the extreme case where all the gas produced by stars , after the early wind phase , is eventually lost . they found that the simple suggestion of trentham ( 1994 ) about the amount of mass which should be ejected by each galaxy is extremely unrealistic . in order to reproduce realistic galaxies , namely with the right colors and luminosities , they found @xmath68 . they used a slope for the faint end of the luminosity function @xmath1=-1.9 . their results indicate that also under these extreme conditions and for any reasonable choice of the main parameters is not possible to explain all of the gas in clusters as due to galaxies . in particular , they found that the contribution of dwarfs to the total gas is not negligible and it raises the galactic contribution up to @xmath69 to compare with the negligible amount of galactic gas obtained by matteucci and gibson ( 1995 ) by considering only normal ellipticals . in figures 2 and 3 we show the predicted total masses of iron and gas as functions of the total visual luminosity of the cluster galaxies compared with the data from arnaud ( 1994 ) . from these figures it is clear that the contribution of dwarfs to the gas in not negligible whereas their contribution to metals is negligible . this conclusion is in agreement with nath and chiba ( 1995 ) who also showed that dwarfs contribute negligibly to the iron content in clusters . finally , we would like to stress the fact that this result about the origin of gas in clusters is quite robust . in fact , gibson and matteucci ( 1997 ) have chosen the most favorable conditions for the galaxies to loose mass . in particular , they assumed that the amount and concentration of dark matter in dwarfs is constant thus underestimating their potential well . the @xmath64 value that they predict is , in fact , @xmath70 , lower than the observed range . arimoto , n. , matsushita , k. , yshimaru , y. , ohashi , t , renzini , a. 1996 , , in press arimoto , n. , yoshii , y. 1987 , , 173 , 23 arnaud , m. 1994 , clusters of galaxies , ed

( i ) _ delayed channel information at transmitter _ : in this scenario , nothing but the past channel information is given at the transmitter . the channel information implies either channel state information or time index information . output feedback is not assumed in this case . ( ii ) _ delayed output feedback without csit _ : in this scenario , nothing but the past output feedback information is given at the transmitter and the channel information is not available at the transmitter . we devise effective interference management strategies in the @xmath0-user interference channel for these two scenarios . the proposed schemes are developed in the framework of ergodic ia @xcite and enables interference - free decoding of the desired message at the receiver . it is shown that the proposed strategies achieve @xmath8 dof in the @xmath0-user interference channel for the scenarios of the delayed channel information and the delayed output feedback without csit . the proposed schemes achieve higher dof than the retrospective ia @xcite in the @xmath0 user interference channel with the same assumptions of delayed feedback .", "the received signal in the @xmath0-user interference channel is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10^t$ ] , the transmitted signal vector @xmath11 @xmath12^t\\in   \\mathbb{c}^{k \\times 1 } $ ] with power constraint @xmath13 , @xmath14 represents the time varying fading channel matrix and is given by @xmath15.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 denotes the channel coefficient from transmitter @xmath17 to receiver @xmath18 and is an independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) complex gaussian random variable with distribution @xmath19 . at receivers , full channel state information is assumed to be available , i.e. , csir . the element of the additive white gaussian noise vector @xmath20^t$ ] is assumed to follow complex gaussian distribution @xmath21 . the ergodic ia @xcite requires perfect knowledge of channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) . for a @xmath0-user interference channel , @xmath22 total dof can be achieved in an ergodic sense if the channel is time varying . contrary to other ia techniques , the ergodic ia works for infinite snr as well as any finite snr since interfering signals are canceled out when the channel matrices at two different time instants satisfy a certain condition . specifically , let @xmath23 and @xmath24 be the time instants ( or time indices ) at which the the channel matrices satisfy the following relationship : @xmath25\\label{eq : channel1}\\\\                  \\textbf{h}(t_2 ) & = c(t_2)\\cdot\\left [                    \\begin{array}{ccc }                      h_{11}(t_1 ) & \\cdots & -h_{1k}(t_1 ) \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots~ \\\\ -h_{k1}(t_1 ) & \\cdots & h_{kk}(t_1 ) \\\\                    \\end{array }                  \\right ] \\label{eq : channel2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is a complex valued constant and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 . at the time @xmath24 , the message which was previously sent at the time @xmath23 is again sent from the transmitter . in other words , the transmitted signal vector @xmath31 is equal to @xmath32 . to decode the message , receiver @xmath33 adds the received signals at @xmath23 and @xmath24 and constructs a sufficient statistics for the message @xmath34 as @xmath35 then , the achievable rate is determined by @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 . correspondingly , the total @xmath2 dof is achievable @xcite .", "contrary to the existing ergodic ia , we assume only full csir and imperfect or partial csit by feedback delay . specifically , all receivers feed either channel state information or time indices back to the transmitters . each transmitter can not use the current channel information but can use the outdated channel information due to feedback delay .      in this subsection , we propose a new strategy to achieve high dof when the receivers feed csi back to the transmitters . to effectively establish the concept of the proposed scheme , we start from the three - user interference channel , i.e. , @xmath39 .    three - user interference channel with delayed csit can achieve total @xmath40 dof by ergodic ia . the proposed ergodic ia is carried out over two phases :    _ transmission phase 1 _ : transmission phase 1 for data transmission is continued until @xmath24 . at each time until @xmath24 , new messages are continuously transmitted . for the time @xmath23 and @xmath41 at which the channel condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied , the received signals are given by @xmath42 due to delayed csit , the transmitters can not recognize what the current channel states are so that they can not send the same message of @xmath23 at @xmath24 as in the conventional ergodic ia . thus , they just send independent messages at @xmath23 and @xmath24 . after the channel changes , the transmitters can figure out that the channel condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied at the previous time @xmath24 due to delayed csi feedback . then , transmission phase 2 is entered . _ transmission phase 2 _ : if the previous time was @xmath24 , the transmitters send the following signals at time @xmath43 , respectively : @xmath44 after transmission phase 2 is completed , the transmission mode goes back to transmission phase 1 . each receiver adds its received signals at @xmath23 and @xmath24 and constructs the following variables . @xmath45    _ decoding at receiver 1 _ : using the received signal at @xmath46 and @xmath47 , receiver 1 removes the interfering signals from the other senders in ( [ eq : rx1 ] ) . then , we have an equation for @xmath48 . using another equation for @xmath49 received at @xmath50 , receiver 1 can decode both @xmath51 and @xmath52 . _ decoding at receiver 2 _ : similarly , receiver 2 removes the interfering signals in ( [ eq : rx2 ] ) using the received signal at @xmath50 and @xmath47 and decodes @xmath53 and @xmath54 using the received signal at @xmath46 and ( [ eq : rx2 ] ) .    _ decoding at receiver 3 _ : similarly , receiver 2 removes the interfering signals in ( [ eq : rx3 ] ) using the received signal at @xmath50 and @xmath46 and decodes @xmath55 and @xmath56 using the received signal at @xmath47 and ( [ eq : rx3 ] ) .    according to the decoding procedure , the proposed scheme enables each receiver to decode its 2 messages in 5 symbol times . that is , total 6 messages are decodable over 5 symbol times and hence total 6/5 dof is achievable . total @xmath8 dof is achievable in a @xmath0-user interference channel with delayed csit by ergodic ia .    for a @xmath0-user interference channel , two independent messages sent at time @xmath23 and @xmath24 are decoded at each receiver over @xmath57 symbol times . as in the three - user interference channel , the time @xmath23 and @xmath24 correspond to transmission phase 1 . if the transmitters realize the channel matrix at time @xmath24 satisfies the condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) , transmission phase 2 starts . then , transmitter @xmath33 , @xmath58 , sends the signal @xmath59 at time @xmath60 . similarly to the three - user interference channel , each receiver can decode its two messages over @xmath57 symbol times . therefore , total @xmath8 dof is achievable in a @xmath0-user interference channel by the proposed ergodic ia . [ fig : p1 ] shows the achievable dof by the proposed ergodic ia ( solid line ) and the retrospective ia @xcite ( dashed line ) with delay csit according to the number of users in a @xmath0-user interference channel . the total achievable dof by the retrospective ia is @xmath61 . it starts from @xmath62 for a three - user case and converges to @xmath63 as @xmath0 goes to infinity . on the other hand , the total achievable dof by the proposed ergodic ia starts from @xmath40 and converges to @xmath64 . if the receivers feed the time indices at which the condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied , total achievable dof is the same as the case that delay csit is used . total achievable dof by the proposed ergodic ia with delay time index feedback in a @xmath0-user interference channel is @xmath8 . the strategy in section [ kudcsit ] can be applied . instead of using the channel state information ( i.e. , channel matrix ) to find the time @xmath23 and @xmath24 at which the condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied , the receivers send the time indices @xmath23 and @xmath24 since receivers can find them by the assumption of full csir . after receiving the time indices , the transmitters realize that the previous time was @xmath24 and enter into transmission phase 2 .", "in this section , we assume full csir and delayed output feedback . the received signals themselves are fed back to the transmitters . each transmitter can not use the channel information but can use only the delayed received output feedback . it is also assumed that the receivers can reform the output signals and feed them back to the transmitters if necessary . our new proposed strategy is first applied to a three - user interference channel for better explanation of the proposed idea . total @xmath40 dof is achievable by the proposed ergodic ia in a three - user interference channel when only delayed output feedback information is available . the operation of the proposed ergodic ia is classified into two phases :    _ transmission phase 1 _ : the transmission phase 1 for data transmission is continued until @xmath24 . at each time until @xmath24 , new messages are continuously transmitted . for the time @xmath23 and @xmath41 at which the channel condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied , the received signals are given by ( [ rs1 ] ) and ( [ rs2 ] ) . similarly to the case of delayed cit in section iii , the transmitters can not send the same message at @xmath23 and @xmath24 because they can not realize that @xmath24 is the time instant at which the channel condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied due to the absence of csit . therefore , the transmitters continue to send independent messages at @xmath24 . however , the receivers know that the channel condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied at @xmath24 owing to full csir so that they construct the following output feedback information and send them back to the transmitters after receiving the signals at @xmath24 . @xmath65 then , the transmitters can figure out that the previous time @xmath24 was the time instant at which the channel condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied after receiving the delayed output feedback information . however , note that they do not know the time instant @xmath23 as well as the message sent at @xmath23 . once after receiving the delayed output feedback information , transmission phase 2 is entered . _ transmission phase 2 _ : after the output feedback signals are received , the transmitters send their signals at time @xmath43 , respectively : @xmath66 after transmission phase 2 is completed , the transmission mode goes back to transmission phase 1 . _ decoding at receiver 1 _ : linearly combining the received signals at @xmath50 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , receiver 1 can obtain the values of @xmath49 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . by substituting the values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 to @xmath69 , the value of @xmath48 can also be obtained . then , receiver 1 can decode both @xmath51 and @xmath52 because it has two independent equations on @xmath51 and @xmath52  one is given in terms of @xmath49 and the other is given in terms of @xmath48 . _ decoding at receiver 2 _ : similarly , receiver 2 can decode @xmath53 and @xmath54 using linear combination and substitution . _ decoding at receiver 3 _ : similarly , receiver 3 can decode @xmath55 and @xmath56 using linear combination and substitution .    in this way , all 6 messages are decoded in 5 symbol times so that total 6/5 dof is achievable by the proposed ergodic ia .      when only delayed output feedback information is available at the transmitters , total @xmath8 dof is achievable in a @xmath0-user interference channel by the proposed ergodic ia    for a @xmath0-user interference channel , two independent messages sent at time @xmath23 and @xmath24 are decoded at each receiver over @xmath57 symbol times , where the time time @xmath23 and @xmath24 correspond to transmission phase 1 . after the receivers receive the signals at @xmath24 , receiver @xmath33 , @xmath58 , feed the output @xmath70 back to its own transmitter . after the output feedback signals are received , the transmitters realize that the previous time instant was @xmath24 at which the channel condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied and enters into transmission phase 2 . in transmission phase 2 , transmitter @xmath33 sends the signal @xmath71 at only time @xmath60 . as in the three - user interference channel , each receiver decode its two messages over @xmath57 symbol times . therefore , total @xmath8 dof is achievable in a @xmath0-user interference channel by the proposed ergodic ia .

[ fig : sparam ] . the dependence on the hadronic model is much smaller , about 5% . +     the muon contribution to @xmath1 , which includes muon decay products in our definition , depends strongly on the primary particle ( 40% difference between proton and iron ) and the hadronic model ( fig . [ fig : sparam ] ) . however , the functional dependence on @xmath7 is universal .    after accounting for geometrical effects such as the projected tank surface area , the electromagnetic shower signal ( averaged over proton and iron ) is parameterized as function of the energy @xmath8 , distance to shower maximum @xmath7 , and zenith angle @xmath9 . the difference between proton and iron shower profiles is included in the calculation of the systematic uncertainties later on . similarly , the universal shape of the muon signal profile is parameterized simultaneously using a gaisser - hillas function for all models and primaries ( fig . [ fig : sparam ] ) , leaving only normalization factors free . the expected detector signal at 1000 m can then be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the parametrized muon signal adopting the normalization for proton - qgsjet ii at 10eev , so that @xmath12 is the number of muons relative to that of qgsjet - ii proton showers at 10eev .", "within the current statistics , the arrival directions of high - energy cosmic rays around 10  eev are found to be isotropic , allowing us to apply the _ constant intensity _ method to determine the muon signal contribution . dividing the surface detector data into equal exposure bins , the number of showers with @xmath1 greater than a given threshold @xmath13 , should be the same for each bin . @xmath14 using the independently measured mean depth of shower maximum @xmath15 @xcite , the only remaining free parameter in eq . ( [ eq : cic - muons ] ) is the relative number of muons @xmath12 . for a given energy @xmath8 , @xmath12 is adjusted to obtain a flat distribution of events in @xmath16 .    more precisely , scanning through a range of @xmath12 values , we calculate the @xmath17/dof of the event histogram relative to a flat distribution in @xmath16 . we then fit a two - branch parabola around the minimum of @xmath18 , which results in a best - fit @xmath19 and its asymmetric error , @xmath20 . the sensitivity of this method to the muon number parameter in eq . ( [ eq : s1000 ] ) is illustrated in fig . [ fig : cic - results ] . clearly , @xmath21 ( top histogram in the lower panel of fig . [ fig : cic - results ] ) is ruled out by the data . the best description of the data above 10eev requires @xmath22 . however , we have to take into account shower - to - shower fluctuations and the finite resolution of @xmath1 which lead to a slightly biased @xmath12 measurement in this method . in order to estimate this bias , we have simulated a large number of monte carlo realizations of sd data sets of the same size as the auger data set , distributed according to the observed cosmic ray spectrum and assuming different primary compositions ( pure proton , iron , or mixed composition ) , and different `` true '' @xmath12 . for each shower , @xmath23 is obtained from distributions which closely match the observed @xmath23 distributions in the fluorescence data . the electromagnetic and muon signals are fluctuated according to the model predictions @xcite . note that the magnitude of fluctuations in @xmath23 and @xmath12 are robust predictions which only depend on the primary particle . ( [ eq : s1000 ] ) is then used to calculate the signal at 1000 m from the shower core , @xmath1 , which is smeared with an experimental reconstruction accuracy @xcite . a realistic trigger probability is also applied .    for each simulated data set , we then apply exactly the same analysis as used on the real data . we found that @xmath12 is systematically _ overestimated _ by 3@xmath246% . this bias is due to a combined action of shower - to - shower fluctuations and detector resolution which depends on the signal size . we have found that the bias in @xmath12 is independent of the `` true '' value of @xmath12 adopted , and primarily depends on the size of reconstruction uncertainties on @xmath1 and the primary composition . [ fig : bias ] shows the relative bias on @xmath12 as a function of primary energy , for different assumed compositions and increased / decreased detector resolution . clearly , the bias is quite robust to rather extreme changes in those assumptions . we then subtract the bias expected for a mixed composition ( black dots in fig . [ fig : bias ] ) from the measured @xmath19 , obtaining a corrected @xmath12 of : @xmath25 three main sources of systematics enter in the determination of @xmath12 using the constant intensity method : the uncertainty on the electromagnetic signal due to universality violation ( sec . [ sec : univ ] ) ; the uncertainty on @xmath26 at this energy ; and the uncertainty on the bias of @xmath12 determined from the monte carlo simulations .    in order to quantify the first two systematics , we measure @xmath12 using an electromagnetic signal rescaled by @xmath276% , bracketing the observed universality violation , and measuring @xmath12 with varying @xmath26 , adopting the systematic and statistical uncertainty reported by auger @xcite . for the uncertainty on the bias , we adopt @xmath28% . summing the different contributions in quadrature , we obtain the total systematic error on @xmath12 quoted in eq . ( [ eq : nmucic ] ) . once @xmath12 at 10  eev is measured , and using the measured mean depth of shower maximum , the signal size at @xmath29 can be calculated : @xmath30 within the uncertainties , this value of @xmath31 is consistent with the energy scale from fluorescence detector measurements , whose systematic uncertainty ( 22% @xcite ) is dominated by the uncertainty on the fluorescence yield . ( [ eq : energy - scale ] ) corresponds to assigning showers a @xmath32% higher energy than done in the fluorescence detector - based auger shower reconstruction ( @xmath33 ) .", "the pierre auger observatory has the unique capability of measuring hybrid events which have been simultaneously detected by the surface detector array and fluorescence telescopes . for each of these events , a calorimetric measurement of the energy @xmath8 and depth of shower maximum @xmath23 are available , in addition to the signal @xmath1 from the surface array . hence , we can use our parameterization of the universal electromagnetic signal @xmath34 to determine the electromagnetic contribution to @xmath1 . the remainder of the signal is attributed to muons , and we can determine a muon normalization for each event : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is again the reference muon signal ( proton - qgsjetii at 10  eev ) . we select high - quality hybrid events for which the shower maximum is in the field of view of a telescope , @xmath37 , and the mie scattering length is measured . furthermore , the cherenkov light fraction is limited to less than 50% , and we apply all cuts used in the measurement of the elongation rate @xcite which have been carefully chosen in order to ensure an unbiased @xmath23 distribution of the air showers . the surface detector event has to satisfy the t5 selection cuts which are also applied in @xcite .        the average muon normalization in hybrid events at 10eev is found to be @xmath38 in excellent agreement with the constant intensity method results , when compared at the same energy scale .    a similar study has been performed for inclined hybrid events ( @xmath39 ) . while the statistics are limited , no subtraction of @xmath40 is necessary for these events , as the electromagnetic part has been attenuated in the large depth of atmosphere traversed . thus , inclined hybrid events yield a clean measurement of @xmath12 , and good agreement between muon numbers of the inclined and the vertical data sets is found . [ fig : hybrid - muons ] shows the muon signal derived from the hybrid events as a function of shower evolution ( @xmath7 ) . while the muon signal is clearly higher than that predicted in the simulations , the behavior as a function of @xmath7 follows the prediction very well , which serves as a consistency test of our method .    in fig . [ fig : comparison ] we compare the results of the different methods applied for inferring the muon density at 1000 m from the shower core . the relative number of muons is shown as function of the adopted energy scale with respect to the auger fluorescence detector energy reconstruction . only the constant intensity method yields an independent measurement of the energy scale . good agreement between the presented methods is found , when compared at @xmath41 .", "assuming air shower universality , which was tested with simulations of various primaries and hadronic interaction models , we have determined the muon density at 10  eev and the energy scale with which the data of the pierre auger observatory can be described self - consistently . the number of muons measured in data is about 1.5 ( 1.7 ) times larger than that predicted by qgsjet ii ( sibyll ) for proton showers , with statistical and systematic errors of the order of 0.1 . this value of @xmath12 is even slightly larger than that predicted for iron showers , by a factor of 1.1 and 1.2 for qgsjetii and sibyll , respectively . a similar excess has been found at energies from 3  eev to 50  eev . consistent results were obtained with several analysis methods on independent data sets : the constant intensity method ( sec . [ sec : cic ] ) uses only the surface detector data and is independent of the fluorescence energy scale . vertical hybrid events ( sec .  [ sec : hybrid ] ) allow for a direct and unbiased measurement of @xmath12 for each event , albeit depending on the flourescence energy . the signal in inclined hybrid events ( @xmath42 ) is purely muonic , and the resulting @xmath12 independent of the subtraction of the electromagnetic signal . the fact that all three methods agree within errors for an energy scale of @xmath43 indicates that increasing the number of muons by 50% ( relative to proton - qgsjetii ) yields a consistent description of the auger data . if interpreted in terms of cosmic ray composition , the derived muon density would correspond to nuclei heavier than iron , which is clearly at variance with the measured @xmath44 values at this energy . the discrepancy between air shower data and simulations reported here is qualitatively similar to the inconsistencies found in composition analyses of previous detectors @xcite . this points towards a deficiency of hadronic models in predicting the number of muons produced in air showers at large distances from the shower core . however , it is important to note that the method presented here relies on a correct description of the electromagnetic shower component in the simulations . p. billoir , lecture given at corsika school , http://www-ik.fzk.de/corsika/corsika-school , 2005 ; m.  giller _ et  al . _ , j. phys . g31 ( 2005 ) 947958 ; f.  nerling _ et  al . _ , 24 ( 2006 ) 421437 ; d.  gora _ et  al . _ , 24 ( 2006 ) 484494 ; a.  s. chou [ auger collab . ] , proc . 29th icrc ( pune , india ) , p. 319"], "summary": "the pierre auger observatory , recently completed , has been operational since 2004 . as a hybrid experiment , it allows for a wide range of measurements of uhecr - induced extensive air showers ( eas ) , including measurements of the eas particle content on ground which is sensitive to high - energy hadronic interactions . we present the results of several independent measurements of the eas muon content on ground in auger data at a primary energy of 10  eev . we discuss implications on high - energy hadronic interaction models and cosmic ray composition .", "ranking": [4, 0, 1, 3, 2]}

[ snap ] . inside the corotation radius ( cr , 6kpc ) , gas is concentrated on the leading side of the bar . then , as shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] , the bar gravity torques make gas lose 1015% of its angular momentum over one rotation , while the shear viscosity torques are much smaller : the gas inflow in our simulations is really initiated by the bar gravity torques , contrary to the hypothesis raised by @xcite . the bar - driven gas inflow fuels a central mass concentration ( cmc ) : we show in fig . [ fig1 ] the increase in the mass inside radii 100 and 250 pc . at @xmath14 gyr , the mass radial profile shows a central peak of stars and gas that can be fitted by a plummer cmc of mass @xmath15 m@xmath6 and radial scale - length 90 pc . according to @xcite , such a cmc can not fully dissolve the bar . yet , while the gravitational softening length and the number of particles we used are close to that of @xcite , the bar is here fully dissolved in less than 2 gyrs : the residual values of @xmath16 correspond to a weak oval distortion and spiral arms , but no bar is present .    a surprising point shown in fig . [ fig1 ] is that the cmc growth occurs after the bar is already significantly weakened . the increase of the mass included inside radius 250 pc occurs between @xmath17 and @xmath18 gyr . the bar strength is then smaller than 40% of its maximal value . as for the increase in the mass inside radius 100 pc , it occurs at the very end of the bar dissolution , from @xmath19 to @xmath18 gyrs . at the opposite , the bar weakening is already significant at @xmath20 gyr : at this time , no strong increase in the mass has occurred , excepted at large scales of more than 1kpc , but mass concentrations at such scales are totally inefficient to dissolve bars . it thus seems that the cmc growth is not the only factor that is responsible for the destruction of the bar . furthermore , the bar dissolution is not an artifact of a too long time step : we have divided the time step by factor 8 , and found a similar result ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) . the dashed line represents the bar major axis , defined as the major axis of the most eccentric ellipse in an ellipse - fitting model of the stellar density . gas is concentrated on the leading side of the bar inside the cr radius ( 6 kpc ) , with a shift of several degrees.,width=207 ]    , as a function of radius ( in units of the cr radius at @xmath21 myr ) . the curves labeled  g  show the effects of the gravitational torques ; they are mean values over periods of 100 myr around @xmath22 ( dotted line ) , 900 ( solid line ) , and 1000 myr ( dashed line ) . the curve labeled  v  shows the effects of viscous torques , that are negligible with respect to gravity torques . inside the cr radius , gas loses 1015  % of its momentum in one period . torques are positive between the cr and the outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) . because of the bar slowing - down , the cr and olr radii increase with time . the thin solid line shows the comparison with an sph simulation with the same initial conditions at @xmath21  myr . gravity torques are of the same order with this different code . , width=283 ]          to confirm that the cmc growth is not the only phenomenon responsible for the bar dissolution , we have run a purely stellar simulation with the same initial conditions , and added an analytical cmc . this model is similar to that used by @xcite . the final cmc is a plummer sphere corresponding to the cmc we had fitted in the complete simulation ( see previous section ) . its radial scale - length is 90 pc , and its mass is grown up to @xmath15 m@xmath6 following the variations of m(100pc ) shown in fig . [ fig1 ] . in this model , the bar is not fully dissolved , but only partly weakened ( see fig . [ p2a ] ) . this is in agreement with the conclusion of @xcite that the bar can survive to the growth of such a cmc . we have also run a simulation in which we include the gas response , but suppress artificially the growth of the cmc : every gas particle that is found below radius 100 pc , with a velocity inferior to the circular velocity at this radius , is artificially suppressed , unless already present at @xmath23 . we do not suppress particles that are just crossing the central 100 pc with a large velocity , but only those that have definitively fallen in this region . as shown in fig . [ p2a ] , the bar is dissolved , and the evolution is very similar to that of the complete simulation . this result definitively proves that a phenomenon different from the cmc growth intervenes in the dissolution of the bar . this phenomenon is related to the gas response , since it is not observed in the purely stellar simulation ( fig . [ p2a ] ) .          inside the cr , the bar has been shown to exert important gravitational torques on the ism . in the same time , the leading arms of gas exert torques on the stellar bar . the mean torque undergone by stars inside the bar is positive , but the real torques vary with radius and azimuth . this could be the reason why the bar is dissolved in the simulation where the cmc has been artificially suppressed : gravitational torques between the stellar bar and gaseous arms are still present in this model .    to confirm the role of gravity torques , we have run a purely stellar simulation in which gravitational torques exerted by gas have been artificially added . to this aim , in the complete simulation , we compute the amplitude @xmath24 and phases @xmath25 of the tangential forces @xmath26 exerted by gas in the fourier decomposition @xmath27 where @xmath28 is computed in the frame of the bar . we record the mean values @xmath29 and @xmath30 between 0.8 and 1 gyr . then , in a purely stellar simulation , we analytically add the gravity torques given by @xmath31 where @xmath28 in still computed in the frame of the stellar bar . the amplitude of these torques is realistic , since @xmath29 and @xmath30 are given by the complete simulation , even if they do not follow any temporal evolution . we apply no torques before 800 myr and increase them progressively up to their final amplitude between 800 and 900 myr . in this model , that only differs from the purely stellar simulation by the addition of these gravitational torques , the bar is fully dissolved ( see fig . [ p2a ] ) , and its dissolution is nearly as rapid as in the complete simulation .    then , the gravity torques exerted by infalling gas on the bar can strongly weaken it . in this first simulation , this process dissolves it , while the role of the cmc is negligible . we have run another simulation with an initial gaseous mass equal to 4.5 % of the visible mass , and a bulge - to - disk mass ratio of 0.33 , and made the same models with the cmc alone and the torques alone . the results are shown in fig . [ p2b ] . in the complete simulation , the bar is fully dissolved , while the growth of the cmc only partly weakens it . here again , the gravitational torques play a major role in the bar dissolution . they are not strong enough to fully dissolve the bar alone , but the combined effects of the cmc lead to a complete dissolution . this second case confirms the role of gravity torques in the dissolution of bars , even is the cmc plays a role , too .     with an initial gas - to - visible mass ratio of 4.5% and a bulge - to - disk mass ratio of 0.33 . the bar is dissolved in the complete simulation ( curve labeled  gas  ) . the effect of gravity torques ( curve labeled  gas - cmc  ) participate much to the bar weakening , but the cmc also plays a role . , width=264 ]", "in our simulations , viscous torques are negligible with respect to gravitational torques and do not directly initiate the gas inflow . yet , the phase shift between the bar and gas , and the magnitude of the resulting gravity torques , are largely dependent on the viscosity @xcite . then , whether gravity torques in our simulations are realistic or not has to be checked . first , we have checked that our results are not dependent on the box size used to compute particles collisions in the sticky - particles scheme : this parameter controls the distance along which particles interact , influences the numerical viscosity , thus the gravity torques may depend on it . for box sizes ranging from 10 pc to 350 pc , we find that changes in this parameter does not lead to large changes in the gravity torques , and the bar life - time is not dependent on this parameter , as shown on fig . [ visco ] . it may seem surprising that changing this box size parameter does not influence the bar life - time at all . in fact , as shown by fig . [ fig_params ] , the gravity torques are actually dependant on the sticky particles parameters ( the box size , and the elasticity parameter @xmath32 for cloud - cloud collisions ) : gravity torques increase with the box size , and decreases with the elasticity parameter . but there is a range of parameters where gravity torques are nearly constant , for elasticity parameter @xmath32 between 0.65 and 0.85 , and box sizes between 10pc and 350  pc . for larger box sizes and/or smaller @xmath32 , gravity torques become larger , but the medium is very cold ( with a typical sound speed smaller than 5  km  s@xmath33 ) and clumpy , instead of forming spiral arms : these situations are not realistic , so they are ruled out . at the opposite , large @xmath32 or small box sizes lead to situations with smaller gravity torques , but the dissipation rate in the ism is not realistic , the sound speed in the ism is found to be larger than 10 or even 15  km  s@xmath33 and the toomre parameter for gas is larger than 1.5 : as a result , gas only forms very smooth spiral arms that disappear after a few dynamical times . thus , the only acceptable parameters are @xmath34 and box sizes from 10 to 350 pc ( for our number of gas particles ) . in this range , there is an equilibrium between dissipation in the ism and kinematical heating by density waves : for instance a smaller @xmath32 leads to more dissipation , so the first spiral arms are stronger and heat the medium more . this explains why physical properties are not strongly affected by the gas dynamical parameters in this particular range . then , provided that we choose parameters resulting in a realistic model for the ism ( not too cold or too hot , i.e. a medium in which the main instabilities are spiral arms ) , the physical results are not strongly affected by the sticky particles parameters , so they are robust .        ) , and as a function of the elasticity parameter ( dashed curve , top axis , with a box size of 50 pc ) . the quantity @xmath35 , plotted in absolute value , is defined as in sect . gravity torques are not strongly affected by these parameters in the range 10400pc for the box size and @xmath360.650.85 for the elasticity parameter . this explains why the bar evolution is not strongly affected by a change in these parameters , as shown in fig . 6 . outside this particular range , torques are more affected by these two parameters , but the ism is either unrealistically cold or unrealistically stable : only parameters in the range where gravity torques are not strongly affected are acceptable.,width=264 ]    as a second verification , we have estimated the gravity torques exerted by stellar bars on gaseous arms in a sample of observed barred galaxies ( see a forthcoming paper for details ) . we show on fig . [ 7479 ] the results for three well - known barred galaxies , ngc  1365 , ngc  7479 , and m  100 : for these galaxies as for other barred ones that we have studied , inside the cr , gas loses typically 1020% of its angular momentum in one rotation . this result is independant of the tracer of interstellar gas that we choose ( see fig .  [ 7479 ] ) . this is compatible with our simulations ( fig .  2 ) . thus , the gravity torques are correctly reproduced in our sticky - particles simulations , that provide a realistic estimation of the life - time of bars . finally , we also ran a simulation with the same initial conditions as our first run , with the tree - sph code by @xcite , using @xmath37 particles , isothermal initial conditions at @xmath38  k , and adiabatic evolution . as shown in fig .  2 , the gravity torques between the stellar bar and gas have the same order of value as in sticky - particle simulations , and in observations . while the dissolution of bars had always been attributed to the growth of cmcs , we find here that another process contributes to their destruction . even if growing cmcs do not completely dissolve most galactic bars @xcite , the gravitational torques exerted by gas on the bar can strongly weaken it : these torques are positive , which make orbits become rounder ; they also induce a phase shift that depends on the radius , which misaligns stellar orbits , so that the bar is strongly weakened . in the two simulations with parameters typical of sb - sc galaxies , the cycle of bar dissolution takes about 2 gyrs ( for the mass and radius of the milky - way ) . the supply of angular momentum from the ism to the bar , which dissolves it , occurs much faster than the removal of momentum by the darrk halo , that could trigger the bar over timescales of several gyrs @xcite . the constant bar fraction up to @xmath39 @xcite can not then be interpreted in terms of robust , long - lived bars . as suggested by @xcite , the bar could be renewed either by galaxy interactions , or by accretion of external gas . @xcite have shown that galaxy interactions can reform bar only in gas poor galaxies , i.e. not in most spirals . this indicates that gas accretion plays a major role in the high fraction of barred galaxies , which can account in detail for observed properties of bars @xcite .", "the simulations were computed on the fujitsu nec - sx5 of the cnrs computing center , at idris . we are grateful to the anonymous referee for useful comments ."], "summary": "bars in gas - rich spiral galaxies are short - lived . they drive gas inflows through their gravity torques , and at the same time self - regulate their strength . their robustness has been subject of debate , since it was thought that only the resulting central mass concentrations ( cmcs ) were weakening bars , and only relatively rare massive cmcs were able to completely destroy them . through numerical simulations including gas dynamics , we find that with the gas parameters of normal spiral galaxies , the cmc is not sufficient to fully dissolve the bar . but another overlooked mechanism , the transfer of angular momentum from the infalling gas to the stellar bar , can also strongly weaken the bar . in addition , we show that gravity torques are correctly reproduced in simulations , and conclude that bars are transient features , with life - time of 1 - 2 gyr in typical sb - sc galaxies , because of the combined effects of cmcs and gravity torques , while most existing works had focussed on the cmc effects alone .

crystal phase transition , near a second phase transition  a phase transition between phases which are both meta- or unstable with respect to crystallisation . this second phase transition is a vapour - liquid transition . at phase transitions the thermodynamic functions , including interfacial tensions , exhibit singular behaviour which is universal in the sense that many different systems show behaviour which is identical up to a few scale factors . here we show that at the vapour - liquid transition the free energy barrier to heterogeneous nucleation of a crystal shows behaviour which although not truly universal is the same near all vapour - liquid transitions , up to a few scale factors , assuming that the longest - range interactions are dispersion forces . this is due to wetting : the formation of a thick layer of the liquid phase on a surface in contact with the vapour phase @xcite . the layer forms as coexistence is approached and causes a drop in the nucleation barrier to the nucleation of a dense phase such as a crystalline phase . the dependence on the nature of longest - range forces makes our findings not - quite universal ( unlike homogeneous nucleation near a bulk critical point @xcite which is universal ) . motivation for our study is provided by the fact that some globular proteins have the correct set of phase transitions to observe heterogeneous nucleation of a crystal near a vapour - liquid transition . see refs . @xcite for the phase diagrams of a number of globular proteins . the crystallisation of globular proteins is of great interest because protein crystals are required in order to determine the all - important three - dimensional structure of a protein @xcite . also , although we will always refer to the nucleus as being crystalline and the other transition as being a vapour - liquid transition , our findings are much more general . they refer to the nucleation of any noncritical phase near another , ising - type , phase transition . we simply describe the phases as crystal , vapour and liquid for simplicity and because having definite phases in mind is useful for pedagogical purposes .    earlier work has found universal behaviour of the nucleation barrier for _ homogeneous _ nucleation near a bulk critical point , see refs . @xcite . this earlier work , in particular that of ten wolde and frenkel @xcite , inspired this study of heterogeneous nucleation and the results of refs . @xcite are in a sense the homogeneous nucleation analogues of the results we will obtain for heterogeneous nucleation . also , talanquer and oxtoby have studied heterogeneous nucleation of a liquid from a vapour phase @xcite . they studied the nucleation of the liquid phase at a surface when the liquid phase itself is close to wetting this surface . so , although they studied heterogeneous nucleation in the vicinity of a wetting transition , as we do below , they studied the nucleation of the liquid phase , the phase which is doing the wetting , whereas here we study the heterogeneous nucleation of another phase , the crystalline phase .    in the next section , we introduce both our model of the process of heterogeneous nucleation and the phase behaviour of the systems we are interested in . in section [ wetnuc ] we derive the variation in the rate of heterogeneous nucleation near wetting transitions . then in section [ homo ] we compare with homogeneous nucleation of a crystal near a bulk critical point . the last section is a conclusion .", "heterogeneous nucleation is an activated process @xcite and as such occurs at a rate which decreases exponentially with the height of the barrier @xmath1 , which must be overcome . if @xmath2 is the number of nuclei per unit area crossing the barrier per unit time then @xmath2 is given by an expression of the form @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a surface density , i.e. , it has dimensions of inverse area , and @xmath5 is a characteristic time . we will refer to @xmath2 as the nucleation rate or heterogeneous nucleation rate . the surface is smooth , perfectly planar and chemically homogeneous . equation ( [ rate ] ) comes from the fact that the nucleus is a large , i.e. , improbable , fluctuation . as a fluctuation its probability of occurring in unit area is @xmath6 . the rate at which these fluctuations cross the barrier is then estimated as the number of fluctuations divided by @xmath5 which is an estimate of how long it takes the nucleus to acquire one or a few extra molecules , enough for the nucleus to be big enough to grow irreversibly into a crystallite . equation ( [ rate ] ) is far from rigorous but has been found for homogeneous nucleation to be a reasonable estimate . see the book of debenedetti @xcite for a discussion and @xcite for a detailed comparison of an expression of the form of eq . ( [ rate ] ) with the results of computer simulation ( for homogeneous nucleation ) . for the remainder of this work we will assume that @xmath5 and @xmath4 vary weakly with temperature and chemical potential and so the variation of the rate of heterogeneous nucleation is dominated by the variation in the free energy barrier @xmath1 . work on homogeneous nucleation has shown this assumption to be most often justified , except near a glass transition where @xmath5 increases sharply . however , verifying it requires a detailed calculation for a specific model system , which we do not do here . consider the phase diagram in the chemical - potential  temperature plane shown in fig . it is the phase diagram of a simple model of a globular protein , calculated using an approximate theory . see ref . @xcite for the precise definition of the model ; the model parameters have the same values as they do for fig .  4 of that reference . also , see this reference for the same phase diagram in the density - temperature plane which can be seen to be qualitatively like that of a number of globular proteins @xcite . at true equilibrium there is only one phase transition , from a fluid phase , the equilibrium phase below the solid curve , to a crystal , the equilibrium phase above the curve . however , if the barrier to formation of the crystal phase is high then the chemical potential can be increased at constant temperature along a path such as that indicated by the arrow in fig . [ mut ] , until the metastable fluid undergoes another phase transition : a transition from a vapour phase to a liquid phase . the vapour is below the dashed curve , the liquid above . we have used the phase diagram of a model protein because it has the correct form : it has a vapour - liquid transition near where we expect the nucleation of the crystalline phase to occur . however , the behaviour we find will apply whenever heterogeneous nucleation occurs at a surface which passes through a wetting transition . figure [ fighet ] is a schematic of a crystalline nucleus in contact with a surface and immersed in a liquid layer of thickness @xmath7 , with a vapour phase on top . this is the situation of interest , there is a bulk vapour phase against a smooth surface which attracts the molecules causing a layer of liquid to form near and at vapour - liquid coexistence . at coexistence and if we are above the wetting temperature , see refs . @xcite and section [ wetnuc ] , there is a very thick layer of liquid covering the surface and separating the vapour phase from the surface . the thickness @xmath7 is then limited only by gravity . this wetting layer will reduce the nucleation barrier greatly if the interfacial tension between the liquid and the nucleus , @xmath8 is lower than that between the vapour and the nucleus , @xmath9 . if the surface area of the nucleus not in contact with the surface is @xmath10 , then the free energy reduction will be @xmath11 when the wetting layer forms . for @xmath10 of order 10 times the area per molecule of the surface of a crystal , and the difference @xmath12 of order @xmath13 divided by the area of one molecule , the reduction in the surface contribution to the free energy barrier is of order @xmath14 . this reduction will occur on moving in the vapour phase from conditions of chemical potential and temperature far from vapour - liquid coexistence , where there is no wetting layer , to at or very near coexistence . a large reduction which will lead , eq .  ( [ rate ] ) , to a very large increase in the nucleation rate @xmath15 , which should be easily large enough to observe in an experiment .", "in this section we start with the assumption that the variation of the rate is dominated by that in the free - energy barrier @xmath1 and then calculate how @xmath1 varies near wetting transitions of different types . near a wetting transition the qualitative behaviour , in particular the form of the singularities , can be determined without knowing any specific details of the interactions or of the phase which is nucleating , we only require that the longest range interactions be dispersion forces @xcite . this is true as the singularities come from long lengthscale phenomena for which the small lengthscale chemical details are irrelevant . there are a number of different wetting phase transitions , see for example the excellent review of schick @xcite . we will deal with the three most common , starting with complete wetting . in each case we will work very close to the wetting transition , temperatures or chemical potentials very close to their values at the transition . we will determine the leading order singular terms in the temperature or chemical potential variation of the nucleation rate near the transition . as heterogeneous nucleation occurs at a surface in contact with the fluid it is rather obviously controlled by what happens at the surface . now , if the surface attracts the molecules of the fluid then not - too - far from the critical point @xcite , we will have wetting . wetting is where at vapour - liquid coexistence a thick layer of the liquid phase interposes itself between the surface and the vapour phase , replacing the surface - vapour interface by a surface - liquid interface plus a liquid - vapour interface . it is also called complete wetting @xcite . at coexistence the thickness of the layer is generally limited only by gravity . thus , our first result is the , rather obvious , fact that if the surface is wet by a thick layer of liquid the rate of heterogeneous nucleation will be the _ same _ at surfaces in contact with the two coexisting phases , the vapour and the liquid . this result is universal , it is true whenever the surface is wet . the free energy cost of forming a nucleus at the surface in contact with the bulk vapour is the same as the cost of forming a nucleus at the surface in contact with the bulk liquid , as both surfaces are covered by liquid . this is at coexistence , the chemical potential @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the chemical potential at vapour - liquid coexistence at this temperature . in the vapour phase off coexistence , @xmath18 , there is still a layer of liquid at the surface provided @xmath19 is not too negative . but this layer thins as @xmath20 becomes more negative as we move farther from coexistence . how it thins depends on the nature of the longest - range forces present in the system @xcite . here we assume that the longest range forces are dispersion forces , which is most often the case . then the free energy per unit area , @xmath21 , of a film of liquid between the surface and the vapour of thickness @xmath7 is @xcite @xmath22 where we have included only those parts which depend on the thickness of the layer . the first term is the contribution of the dispersion forces , @xmath23 is a positive constant and the @xmath24 dependence comes from starting with the usual @xmath25 dependence , integrating over a volume , for the solid substrate , and then over the thickness of the layer of liquid . this fourfold integration changes the @xmath25 dependence to @xmath24 @xcite . the second term is the increase in free energy due to the formation of a layer of liquid of thickness @xmath7 when the chemical potential of the liquid , @xmath17 , is higher than the chemical potential . in this term @xmath26 is the difference in number density between the liquid and vapour phases . minimising the free energy eq . ( [ fcomp ] ) we obtain the thickness @xmath27 which diverges at coexistence : this divergence is in practice cutoff at some large thickness by gravity . the divergence at coexistence is a genuine phase transition : @xmath28 is analogous to an order parameter and the exponent @xmath29 in eq . ( [ lcomp ] ) is a critical exponent @xcite . so , what is the free energy barrier to heterogeneous nucleation off coexistence : @xmath30 but small ? we know that at coexistence the liquid layer is very thick and so the free energy of a nucleus in the vapour phase is the same as that in the liquid , call it @xmath31 . as we move off coexistence the liquid layer thins and the nucleus will notice this because it will interact with the vapour phase once @xmath7 is not too large . see fig . [ fighet ] for a schematic of a nucleus at a substrate in a liquid layer . for @xmath7 larger than the radius of the nucleus , the nucleus will interact with the vapour as a point object . the interaction of a small object with the vapour across the liquid layer varies as @xmath32 and is proportional to the volume of the nucleus , @xmath33 @xcite . so the nucleus - vapour interaction increases the nucleation barrier to @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a coefficient for the interaction of the nucleus with the vapour across a slab of liquid . a dense nucleus will generally repel a dilute vapour and so @xmath35 will then be positive @xcite . here , we focus on nucleation of a crystal phase and crystalline phases are rather dense . also , note that @xmath36 is a function of @xmath37 and we will use it for @xmath18 where the vapour phase is more stable than the liquid . we assume that we can continue @xmath31 into the region where the liquid is metastable with respect to the vapour , @xmath20 negative but small , and that @xmath31 is analytic at @xmath38 , at coexistence . using eq . ( [ lcomp ] ) for the thickness we obtain @xmath39 which implies that @xmath40 as @xmath20 is negative in the vapour . for small @xmath20 the variation in @xmath1 is linear  the exponent is 1 . this result holds for any system at fluid - fluid coexistence with dispersion forces near a complete wetting transition .        for complete wetting , the thickness @xmath7 of the layer of liquid diverges as coexistence is approached , as in eq . ( [ lcomp ] ) . now , on moving away from the critical point of the vapour - liquid transition , if the attraction of the surface for the molecules is not too strong , then the surface - vapour interface may cease to be wet by the liquid phase . then as coexistence is approached the thickness of the layer of liquid between the surface and the vapour does not diverge , it remains finite . this is called partial wetting @xcite . the transition from complete wetting to partial wetting is a phase transition . it can be continuous , called a critical wetting transition , or it can be first order . we will deal with each in turn .      below the wetting transition , @xmath53 , the surface is partially wet : either covered by a thin film of molecules or with only a few molecules on the surface . then as the coexistence curve is crossed at constant @xmath53 we go from a nucleus on a surface which is essentially in direct contact with the vapour ( with at most a thin film between them ) to a nucleus on a surface in contact with the liquid phase . the rate of heterogeneous nucleation then has a discontinuity at coexistence , @xmath16 . it will jump upwards , as shown schematically in fig . [ figcw ] ( the dashed curve ) . in general we expect that the deeper we are into the region where the crystal is the equilibrium phase , the larger is the nucleation rate . thus we expect that if we cool coexisting vapour and liquid phases , that the rate of heterogeneous nucleation will increase in both , see fig . however , we have just shown that if there is a first - order wetting transition that the rate of heterogeneous nucleation will jump _ downwards _ as we cross this transition . potentially at least , the nucleation rate may not be a monotonic function of temperature : in the vapour phase it may increase and then jump downwards as the transition is crossed . a non monotonic variation in @xmath1 is very rare , we are aware of only one example @xcite . the non - monotonic variation in @xmath1 found by auer and frenkel @xcite is ( presumably ) not due the presence of another phase transition .    when the wetting transition at coexistence is first order , a prewetting transition branches off from the coexistence curve into the vapour off coexistence @xcite . this prewetting transition does not go far into the vapour phase , it ends at a critical point which is at a value of @xmath20 which depends on @xmath48 and @xmath56 but is always small . at the prewetting transition there is a jump in the value of @xmath7 , this jump decreases as @xmath20 decreases until the jump reaches zero at the prewetting critical point . at the prewetting transition as @xmath7 jumps then so does the barrier to nucleation , from eq . ( [ fint ] ) . this transition including the critical point may be calculated from the free energy eq . ( [ f1st ] ) . as this free energy is analytic it yields mean - field exponents for the critical point @xcite . thus at the temperature of the prewetting critical point , @xmath66 , and near the critical point the thickness difference @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the liquid layer thickness and value of @xmath20 at the critical point . this corresponds to the critical exponent @xmath70  its mean - field value . putting this variation of @xmath7 into our expression for the interaction of the nucleus with the vapour phase across the liquid layer , we obtain @xmath71 the nucleation barrier varies with the chemical potential minus that at the critical point to the one third power . @xmath72 is the free energy of the nucleus at the prewetting critical point , and eq . ( [ prewetdf ] ) holds for @xmath73 and @xmath74 small . finally , we note that unlike complete and critical wetting , a first - order wetting transition proceeds via nucleation and growth , see refs . so for example on cooling below the transition , a metastable thick wetting layer may persist , where by metastable we mean the that the thickness of layer is not the thickness which occurs at the absolute minimum of the free energy eq . ( [ f1st ] ) . note that this layer is then doubly metastable , its free energy is higher than that of a thinner film and the system with either of these two layer thicknesses has of course a higher free energy than at true equilibrium where there is dilute - fluid  crystal coexistence . above we have , for simplicity , neglected the time taken to reach equilibrium thickness and assumed that the thickness of the layer is always that at the minimum in the free energy eq . ( [ f1st ] ) . in reality the transition from a thick to thin layer will follow some set of dynamics which will complicate the analysis . see refs . @xcite and references therein for the dynamics at first - order wetting transitions . see ref . @xcite for an explicit study of the analogous problem of homogeneous nucleation near another transition where nucleation of the equilibrium and a metastable phase compete .", "essentially by definition , phase transitions are where the thermodynamic functions of an equilibrium system have singularities . in earlier work @xcite we showed that the rate of _ homogeneous _ nucleation has a singularity at a ising - type phase transition in the _ bulk _ and here we have shown that the rate of _ heterogeneous _ nucleation has a singularity at _ surface _ phase transitions associated with an ising - type phase transition in the bulk . the presence of a singularity at a phase transition is common to both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation . our findings here for heterogeneous nucleation near a prewetting critical point and our earlier findings for homogeneous nucleation are particularly closely related . in both cases we have a nucleus which is a small ( point - like ) perturbation which couples to the order parameter of the transition @xcite . the order parameter is the density for the bulk transition and the thickness in the prewetting surface transition . in earlier work @xcite we used scaling arguments to obtain the correct exponents for homogeneous nucleation near the critical point of an ising - type transition . in heterogeneous nucleation the nucleus will couple to the order parameter of the prewetting transition , which is an ising - type transition in two dimensions . in ref . @xcite we showed that near an ising - type critical point the behaviour is fixed and universal providing only that the nucleus couples to the order parameter . thus heterogeneous nucleation near a prewetting critical point is completely analogous to homogeneous nucleation in a two - dimensional system near a bulk critical point . we can apply the scaling approach of ref . @xcite to heterogeneous nucleation near a prewetting critical point . we then obtain the correct and universal exponents for the variation of the free - energy barrier near the critical point . for example along the prewetting critical isotherm the free - energy barrier scales with distance to the critical point as @xmath75 where the exponent , which is @xmath76 , is obtained from the exact value @xmath77 for the ising model in two dimensions . in two dimensions the mean - field predictions for the critical exponents like @xmath78 are very poor : the mean - field prediction , eq . ( [ prewetdf ] ) , has an exponent which is five times too large @xcite . see ref . @xcite for definitions of the critical exponents . equation ( [ uni ] ) is just eq . ( 14 ) of ref . @xcite in two dimensions . see that reference for a derivation .", "almost invariably , a first - order phase transformation starts with heterogeneous nucleation . the nucleus of the new phase forms at a surface , see fig . [ fighet ] . thus , the free energy barrier to the formation of the nucleus and therefore the rate of nucleation in a phase depend sensitively on anything which happens at the interface between the surface and the phase . if the phase in contact with the surface is a vapour phase close to a second , vapour - liquid , phase transition , then if the surface attracts the molecules a wetting layer may form at the surface . this is a layer of liquid at the surface , separating the surface from the vapour . the wetting layer will reduce the nucleation barrier greatly if the interfacial tension between the liquid and the nucleus , @xmath8 is lower than that between the vapour and the nucleus , @xmath9 . we estimated in section [ hetero ] that the reduction in the surface contribution to the free energy barrier is of order @xmath14 . a large reduction which should be easily large enough to observe in an experiment . the formation of a wetting layer , either as coexistence is approached ( complete wetting ) , or along the coexistence curve ( critical wetting or a first - order wetting transition ) is a phase transition . we found that at complete wetting the derivative of the barrier as a function of chemical potential was discontinuous while the barrier itself has a discontinuity as the temperature is varied through a first - order wetting transition . thus the rate of heterogeneous nucleation has a discontinuity in its slope as the coexistence curve is crossed at constant temperature , when there is complete wetting . the rate of change of the nucleation rate in the vapour phase just below coexistence is not the same as its rate of change in the liquid phase just above coexistence . above and below mean at values of the chemical potential above and below that at coexistence . the rate of heterogeneous nucleation has a discontinuity as a first - order wetting transition is crossed . our model system is highly idealised , the surface is assumed perfectly smooth and homogeneous , and the dynamics of the formation of wetting layers have been neglected : the thickness was always taken to be at equilibrium . future work should address how the dynamics of formation of wetting layers can effect nucleation ; near a first - order wetting transition this will presumably be analogous to homogeneous nucleation near a metastable first - order bulk transition @xcite . also , an understanding of the effects of chemical heterogeneity and of curvature would be useful as in practice surfaces will not be perfectly homogeneous or smooth and heterogeneous nucleation can occur on particles whose surfaces are inherently curved . but the most urgent requirement is for experiments on heterogeneous nucleation on simple , well characterised surfaces . formation of the crystalline phase at the surface does not have to be an activated process . if the crystal itself wets the fluid - surface interface ( this is a distinct phenomenon from the wetting at vapour - liquid coexistence of the vapour - surface interface by the liquid ) then as the fluid - crystal transition is approached , a layer of the crystal forms at the surface and this can grow into a macroscopic crystal . for example , if we move along the path of the arrow in fig .
